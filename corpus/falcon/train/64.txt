Not Really ;-)
The home and the couple!... Both were super nice! Husband and wife both greeted me with smiles and hospitality. Immediately the gentleman offered hook ups. The lady offered a slice of freshly baked homemade pie! Such gracious and accommodating hosts. We took a nice morning walk and became aquatinted a bit more. I felt comfortable and safe and welcomed at all times. Definitely "my people".
We arrived around 6pm and our hosts had made room for us to park in their paved driveway.
Lovely view of pond out our dinnette window. Had some great conversations about life and future plans. Easy going hosts and provide some treats on our two night stay. Surprised us. <3. Location is conventient to tree lined Ohio Bike trails, but we didn't get a chance to ride them. Hopefully another stay. Lovely people and wonderful stay.
Our first BW experience could not have been nicer. Our gracious host greeted us upon arrival and provided access to water and electricity along with I a gorgeous location near a beautiful lake. Thanks, we hope to visit again.
It was such a pleasure to meet StrickBV on our trip to bike in Xenia Ohio. It’s a great biking town with many trails. Our hosts were very generous and we shared a delicious dessert the evening of our arrival. I highly recommend their location.
We had a very nice safe stay here. The host were very nice. We sat 6’ apart and socialized, they even brought out Apple crisp and ice cream, we would recommend this place.
We arrived late just after dark and left early so we didn't see much of Xenia but our hosts were most welcoming and supplies us with electricity, water and wifi. What more could you want.
We truly enjoyed our stay! Great people with a beautiful home and a wonderful driveway to park!!!
We stayed for a night. Great area. A lot of bycicle trails. We walked because of rain then went to see a phenomenal show at the community theater. Barak was very nice. Would recommend staying here if in the area. In fact we are looking forward to going back to xenia in warmer weather.
Barak and Victoria are the penultimate type of hosts we always hope to meet in BW. We arrived, were welcomed and greeted very warmly. Later, we were invited into their very comfortable home to dialogue about our joint RV/TT experiences. Their story about how they met is one of a kind, or maybe two of a kind since Louise and I met the same way. We enjoyed their company over refreshments and a parfait that hit the spot during one of the most uncomfortable heat waves that have hit the Midwest.
When we parted in the morning, we knew we shall return to experience their generosity again sometime. We would highly recommend a stay in their driveway!
We stayed here for 1 night traveling back home to Utah. They move their car out so we could park at the top of the driveway where is level for a small rig and it was easy to back into. They have a nice yard with a public pond next to their house. Very nice and quiet place to stay.
Very quiet neighborhood. Barak and Victoria, I think went above the call. Very nice visit and an excellent walk with Victoria along the trail system. I was very surprised that they have been on the site for 3 years and we were the first.
They parked their cars out on the street so we could have full use of the driveway.Indeed, behind the push for digital vaccine passports is a coterie of supra-national neoliberal institutions guided by oligarchic tech industry donors.
By Jeremy Loffredo & Max Blumenthal & Posted by The Grayzone
Public Health or Private Wealth? How Digital Vaccine Passports Pave Way for Unprecedented Surveillance Capitalism.
“In typical American fashion, the US government is relegating the creation of digital vaccination certifications to the private sector,” stated the non-profit Data & Society.
Indeed, behind the push for digital vaccine passports is a coterie of supra-national neoliberal institutions guided by oligarchic tech industry donors.
Elite corporate interests behind digital COVID passports
Mega-corporations, international finance institutions, and billionaire-backed private foundations have played a vital role in lobbying for and implementing digital immunity passports.
The burgeoning global health passport system has been coordinated under the umbrella of the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO). However, this institution is so intertwined with wealthy private interests it can hardly be characterized as a “public” health body.
As former WHO director Margaret Chan told filmmaker Lilian Franck, “only 30 percent of my budget is predictable funds. The other 70 percent, I have to take a hat and go around the world to beg for money. And when they give us the money, [it] is highly linked to their preferences, what they like.”
Chief among those private funders is the second wealthiest man in the world, Bill Gates, and his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which happens to be the second largest donor to the WHO.
The Gates Foundation recently helped fund a WHO paper providing “implementation guidance” for proof of vaccination certifications across the world. The authors crafted the paper alongside the Rockefeller Foundation and with guidance from several high-level representatives of the World Bank.
According to Foreign Affairs, “few policy initiatives or normative standards set by the WHO are announced before they have been casually, unofficially vetted by Gates Foundation staff.” Or, as other sources told Politico in 2017, “Gates’ priorities have become the WHO’s.”
Also at the forefront of the shift to digital credentials is the World Economic Forum (WEF). “The Forum is involved in the WHO task force to reflect on those [vaccine credential requirements] standards and think about how they would be used,” reads a May WEF article..
In January 2021, several WEF partners, including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, and several other “heavyweights,” announced a partnership to launch the Vaccine Credential Initiative (VCI) to develop digital immunization authentication tools, according to Forbes.
Aiming to institute a single “SMART Health Card” for the world, the VCI intends for its SMART Health Cards to be recognized “across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries.”
In the US, some states are already deploying the SMART Health Cards developed by the VCI. These SMART Health Cards have laid the basis for a de-facto national standard for vaccine credentials.
“If enough states embrace the technology, it could become a de facto nationwide standard and relieve the Biden administration of having to lay out federal requirements for domestic purposes,” Politico noted.
The latest version of Apple’s iOS, iOS 15, even includes SMART Health Card support.
As of today, those who received a vaccine in California, Hawaii, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, or certain counties in Maryland can obtain a SMART Health Card from the state.
In most other states, a SMART Health Card is available to those who were vaccinated at one of more than 17,100 CVS, Walmart, or Rite Aid pharmacy chains nationwide.
“More states, pharmacies, and health systems will begin issuing SMART Health Cards very soon,” promises the site of the Commons Project, one of the founders of the VCI initiative.
Commons Project CEO Paul Meyer happens to be a WEF “young leader.”
In India, tech oligarchs use digital ID to force social credit on rural poor, spawning exclusion and even death
In 2015, The Gates Foundation provided seed money to a Yale School of Public Health project that would become known as Khushi Baby. Now a non-profit, Khushi Baby makes microchip-equipped necklaces for a child to wear at all times to track their vaccination status and establish continuous monitoring from their first immunizations through adulthood. The non-profit says it is now using data from over 35,000 villages in India to create algorithms that “predict health outcomes for mothers and children.”
In 2016, IDEMIA, the security firm now working with the French government on vaccination and identity verification, designed the microchip-equipped necklaces. The necklaces have been used to track health data for 13 million people in India since the beginning of the pandemic.
These programs have been marketed by corporate consultants as essential tools for improving equality and inclusion in the Global South. “Digital identification is key to inclusive growth,” claimed McKinsey, the global consulting firm, in 2019.
“Something like 1 billion people could be more financially included and participative,” said Mike Kubzansky, managing partner of Ebay founder and media mogul Pierre Omidyar’s Omidyar Network during a WEF panel exploring how “Digital Identification Provides a Significant Opportunity for Value Creation.”
Like Gates, Omidyar is heavily invested in the advancement of digital ID and currency systems through his Omidyar Network, which collaborates with the World Economic Forum on the Good ID initiative.
A closer look at the push for “inclusion” by corporate behemoths reveals their altruistic language as little more than public relations cover for raw profit motives, resulting in marginalization and even death for many of those roped into their digital ID systems.
Besides serving as the staging ground for the Khushi Baby venture, India has become a laboratory for digital tracking and identity systems. With support from Western capitalist outfits like the Gates Foundation and the World Bank, the country has become the site of the world’s largest digital ID database, known as Aadhaar.
The Aadhaar system is named for a 12 digit number that serves as a proof of identity and address, among other markers, anywhere in India. To date, a whopping 1.3 billion Indians have been enrolled in the system, making it the largest biometric ID database ever constructed. It contains iris scans and fingerprints from both hands of each user. The technology for this system was provided by none other than the French security firm IDEMIA.
Aadhaar was implemented in 2014, the year that the free marketeering, tech-centric Narendra Modi entered the presidential office. Its creator, tech billionaire Nandan Nilekani, has been branded “the Bill Gates of Bangalore,” celebrated by globalization enthusiasts like Thomas Friedman, and hailed by none other than Gates as an altruistic “hero.” Gates’ foundation has collaborated with Nilekani through its “Co-impact” project alongside billionaire eBay co-founder Jeffrey Skoll’s Skoll Foundation.
“Aadhaar is a huge asset for India,” effused Gates in a 2019 interview with the Indian network Times Now. “The fact that you can make digital payments and open a bank account so easily, India is a leader in that. There are huge benefits in being able to get digital government money to the beneficiary.”
But behind the neoliberal spin, Nilekani’s Aadhar digital ID system has wreaked havoc on the lives of India’s most vulnerable and stigmatized populations.
In the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, a wave of deaths took place in 2017 when impoverished citizens were cut off from government-subsidized food rations by the Aadhaar system. In several cases, aging widows were denied rice for several months because the system rejected their fingerprint scans.
Around the same time, three brothers died of starvation after they failed to properly register with Aadhaar and were subsequently denied rations for six months. The same cruel fate was visited on the Kumari family, which was unable to obtain an electronic Aadhaar ID, lost its ration card, and saw its 11-year-old daughter, Santoshi, die of hunger.
“Many people in Jharkhand have been victims of similar deprivation of food entitlements during the last few months,” reported India’s Scroll. “The main reason is that Aadhaar-based biometric authentication is now compulsory in about 80% of ration shops in the state.”
According to Scroll, a random sample of 18 villages where biometric authentication was compulsory found that a staggering 37% of cardholders were unable to buy their food rations.
Besides making Aadhaar the key to obtaining government services, the Modi government has integrated data collected by Aadhar to establish a “360-degree database” that “automatically track[s] when a citizen moves between cities, changes jobs, or buys a new property,” according to the Huffington Post.
When Covid-19 first reached India in early 2020, Nilekani proposed employing Aadhar as the basis for an anti-Covid vaccination and tracking program. “We must ensure that everybody gets a digital certificate with the date of vaccination, name of the vaccine and through which vendor and at what location,” he declared in 2020.
Unsurprisingly, Nilekani’s system of mass surveillance has proven much more effective at harvesting data than it has been at protecting it. In 2018, the Indian Tribune newspaper was able to purchase the personal information of nearly every Aadhaar user through anonymous sellers over WhatsApp. The process took only 10 minutes and cost about $6 USD, the paper reported.
The system’s serial breaches of privacy even prompted some HIV-positive Indians to drop out of antiretroviral treatment programs that require the Aadhaar card. Though the Aadhaar is said to be voluntary, individuals with HIV have complained to Indian media that they were pressured into enrolling into the ID program, and had been threatened with the loss of medical services.
US privacy advocates have pointed to digital national identity programs like Aadhaar as gargantuan surveillance tools that establish the basis for a social credit system.
Addressing the US House Committee on Financial Services in July 2021, Elizabeth Renieris of Notre-Dame’s Technology Ethics Lab warned, “The Aadhaar number in India is able to track your activity across all facets of your life, from employment to healthcare, to school, to pretty much everything you do. You can’t retain autonomy over specific domains of your life. You can’t separate your personal and professional reputation. You can’t have this kind of contextualized personal identity. I think that’s really problematic.”
“We must avoid building digital identity systems and infrastructure in a way that further expands and entrenches the surveillance state, as does the national identity system in India,” Renieris continued.
But it is the all-encompassing social credit aspect of Aadhaar that has made Gates so fond of the system.
Addressing India’s top policy makers in 2016, the world’s second wealthiest man declared, “Over time, all of these transactions allow the credit market to [score the risk properly].“
ID4D expands digital ID to track more human activity than ever
In 2016, the Gates Foundation ponied up funding for a World Bank project called the Identity for Development (ID4D) Initiative for the declared purpose of bringing the “Aadhaar approach to other countries.”
To date, the World Bank has invested $1.2 billion into the ID4D initiative, with the official aim of creating “identification systems using 21st Century solutions.”
Among the four financial partners that established the initiative were two familiar Big Tech-backed operations: The Gates Foundation and The Omidyar Network, along with Australian Aid and UK Aid. According to the World Bank, the Gates Foundation’s “catalytic contributions” in particular transformed the project from an idea to a functional World Bank initiative.
Aadhaar’s Nilekani currently sits on the ID4D Initiative advisory council.
According to the World Bank, ID4D “promote[s] the use of digital ID systems for free movement and service delivery, by creating linkages across systems that allow users to authenticate themselves for key services such as receiving social transfer payments, completing financial transactions, and crossing borders.”
Promotional materials frame this venture as a humanitarian cause centered on helping poor women and making sure ”unbanked” individuals (those without a bank account) such as refugees and migrants are included in the modern economy.
Yet a closer look at the initiative’s backers and their agenda reveals a longstanding goal of the captains of global capitalism: creating a digitally centered identity system that enables powerful public and private institutions to track more human activity than ever.
“Digital ID … can be leveraged by government and commercial platforms to facilitate a variety of digital transactions, including digital payments,” explains the World Bank.
In an August 2021 white paper, the World Bank called on African nations to achieve a “single digital market” and loosen regulations on digital infrastructure to lower the risk for investors. The paper revealed the real intentions behind the World Bank’s push for a closure to the digital divide: opening up the continent for foreign investment. “Government regulation,” the paper declared, “needs to smoothen the path to digital transformation in the region.”
“By accelerating Africa’s digital transformation, businesses can reap the benefits,” the World Economic Forum (WEF) proclaimed in a 2020 article titled, “Africa has the potential to boost global growth.”
“There will […] be lucrative opportunities in Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia … a good bet for companies seeking to enter new markets,” the WEF advised.
As the World Economic Forum recently wrote, “COVID-19 has highlighted the advantages of creating a digital economy.” Yet the advantages the group speaks of will likely fall on the side of its stakeholders.
Partners of the World Economic Forum’s “Platform for a Good Digital Identity ” include the biometric ID firm Accenture, Amazon, Barclays Bank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Bank, Mastercard, the biometric technology firm Simprints, and the credit giant, Visa.
The initiative’s stakeholders represent the key beneficiaries of a biometric ID system imposed on the Global South, with Western multinational financial firms functioning as the gateway for its inhabitants to participate in the global economy.
The WEF has also made clear that the “end goal” of its agenda is expanding the model it established in India until every person in the world holds a unique digital ID.
In an article titled “Digital ID is the Catalyst of Our Digital Future,” Mohit Joshi, a WEF ‘young leader,’ argued that “governments should use [Aadhaar] to streamline the delivery of services and payments, and massively increase financial inclusion.”
In a separate paper, however, the WEF conceded that the new digital system will not necessarily provide users with the liberation they have been promised: “Fourth Industrial Revolution digital identity will determine what products, services, and information we can access – or, conversely, what is closed off to us,” the WEF stated.
ID2020 leverages vaccinations to push “beyond dystopian” digital ID’s and payments
Back in 2016, Bill Gates’ Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), Microsoft, Accenture and the Rockefeller Foundation established a new consortium to provide digital ID certificates to infants when they receive their routine immunizations. They called it ID2020, incidentally naming it for the year that a global pandemic would be declared.
ID2020 says it is “dedicated to spearheading a global digital biometric identity standard,” and claims Digital IDs will lead to “financial independence.”
Partners in the ID2020 initiative include the credit card giant Mastercard and Simprints, a biometric technology firm supported by the US Agency for International Development, a traditional front organization for US intelligence.
Mastercard’s ‘community pass’ project aims to capture the biometrics of 30 million individuals in remote parts of Africa over the next three years and issue them a Mastercard Community Pass biometric smart card, which will in turn provide Africans with a digital biometric identity and a digital bank account.
ID2020 is currently operating in Bangladesh, where it administers biometric enrollment and digital ID to infants when they receive routine immunizations. GAVI CEO Seth Berkely has said he plans to expand the program across the underdeveloped world, working with mega-corporations such as Facebook and Mastercard to tie vaccination status to a biometric identification system.
“Eighty-nine percent of children and adolescents without identification live in countries supported by Gavi,” Berkley stated. “We are enthusiastic about the potential impact of this program not just in Bangladesh, but as something we can replicate across Gavi-eligible countries.”
With the WHO’s declaration of a global pandemic in March 2020, an unprecedented opportunity arrived for the forces advancing digital IDs. As Andrew Bud, the CEO of biometric tech company and Department of Homeland Security contractor iProov, enthused, “The evolution of vaccine certificates will actually drive the whole field of digital id in the future. So, therefore, this is not just about Covid, this is about something even bigger.”
By the following year, ID2020 and the USAID-partnered biometric ID firm, Simprints, had leveraged funding from Gates Foundation to publish an article entitled, “COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery: An Opportunity to Set Up Systems for the Future.” The authors argued that COVID-19 vaccines in the Global South could be used as a “potential lever” to deliver digital biometric IDs.
They went on to admit that such digital biometric systems would stay in place long after the COVID-19 pandemic was over, and would be exploited for an array of purposes after the rollout: “Biometrics have the advantage of being agnostic to use case,” the co-authors wrote, “meaning they can connect different systems during or even after rollout.”
Elizabeth Renieris of the Notre Dame-IBM Tech Ethics Lab resigned from a technical advisory role on ID2020, citing “risks to civil liberties” after the initiative teamed up with tech giants to design COVID immunity passports backed up by experimental blockchain technology.
Renieris went on to denounce the burgeoning ID system as a civil liberties nightmare: “The prospect of severely curtailing the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals through ill-thought-out plans for ‘immunity passports’ or similar certificates, particularly ones that would leverage premature standards and a highly experimental and potentially rights-infringing technology like blockchain, is beyond dystopian.”
Digital ID mavens prey on the global poor
While linking a digital biometric ID to individuals’ finances is almost certain to exclude masses of people, and has even killed some by cutting impoverished citizens off from government services, predatory financial and credit institutions see the technology as the perfect means for capitalizing on untapped and developing markets.
A September 2021 report by BankservAfrica, the largest automated digital payments clearinghouse in Africa, which is headed by former executives at MasterCard, VISA, and IBM, urged South Africa to adopt a biometric digital ID system.
The report proclaimed, “The time has come for consumers, investors, and the private and public sectors to work collectively to achieve the common goal of enabling a robust, secure, and trusted digital identity for South Africa.”
BankServAfrica’s digital payment platform is currently being tested in Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania with financial support from the World Bank, USAID, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown just how critical a digital ID is,” BankServAfrica’s Chief Business Officer insisted.
BankservAfrica’s report argued that a robust biometric digital ID system will help South Africa achieve “simpler FICA [credit score] processes” and “a fair, transparent, competitive, sustainable, responsible, efficient and effective consumer credit market.”
But behind the lofty neoliberal rhetoric deployed by the financial industry lies a sordid record of profiteering and privacy invasion on a massive scale.
In 2007, Vodafone and Safaricom launched mPesa, a system that allows users to digitally deposit, withdraw, transfer, and pay with money. The project was “able to make credit and growth capital available to millions of people who have never had access to credit before,” according to Areiel Wolanow, who led the team that designed and built the credit scoring engine for mPesa in Kenya.
But a study by economist Alan Gibson revealed that it was the financial sector – not the rural population of the Global South – that truly benefited from mPesa. Meanwhile, the living conditions of the system’s mostly impoverished participants failed to improve at all:
“What is indisputable is that the supply-side of the finance market has benefited greatly from the last ten years. Banks’ sales have increased by 2.5 times and profits by 3.5 times, with profit margins also increased; the inclusion years have undoubtedly been good years for the banks. This apparent contrast between conspicuous supply-side success and a still-poor economy … raises questions on the role of the finance sector. In particular, it begs questions on who/what it is there to serve, and on the incentives that drive behavior.”
In a further indictment of supposedly “inclusive” digital payment schemes, the Review of African Political Economy found that “the bulk of this [mPesa] value does not go to the poor. Rather, such fintech is very clearly designed to hoover up value and deposit it into the hands of a narrow global digital-financial elite that are the main forces behind the fintech revolution.”
Despite the evidence of widening inequality, Bill Gates – whose foundation spends hundreds of billions of dollars promoting digital financial services for the poor – gushed praise for mPesa.
“M-Pesa is an excellent program,” Gates effused on Twitter in one of several tweets hailing the digital payments system.
Gates linked to an article promoting the program by NPR, the US public broadcaster which has received upwards of $17.5 million from Gates while producing hundreds of articles praising the tech billionaire and his initiatives around the world.
Back in the US, meanwhile, Gates’ ID2020 campaign has collaborated with the forces advancing a system that registers Americans’ vaccination status with the same corporation that calculates their financial credit score.
The US credit industry and digital immunity ID outfits collaborate on “huge opportunities for the commercial sector”
In Illinois, residents are currently required to verify that they have received the COVID-19 vaccine through an online portal called Vax Verify which will work in concert with Chicago’s soon-to-be-implemented vaccine passport.
To register their proof of vaccination, Illinois residents must turn to Experian, the world’s leading credit score service.
Already, the Vax Verify portal is facing backlash for providing inaccurate vaccine status information. It is also the subject of serious security concerns given Experian’s record of breaches that leaked the personal data of millions of citizens from Brazil to South Africa.
Further, the online portal requires that any resident with a freeze on their credit must unfreeze it with Experian before registering a vaccination.
“Using Experian is definitely one of the worst [vaccine passports] I’ve seen yet,” Electronic Frontier Foundation Director of Engineering Alexis Hancock commented to Yahoo News.
After Illinois became the first US state to forge a formal relationship between vaccine certifications and Experian, Illinois Congressman and financial industry darling Bill Foster introduced legislation that would foist a digital biometric ID onto the entire American population.
The Improving Digital Identity Act of 2021, introduced by Foster in July, calls for the public sector, and particularly the Department of Homeland Security, to work with the private sector to develop a new biometric digital ID infrastructure for the United States.
In November 2020, the Gates-sponsored ID2020 provided an online forum for Foster to promote his bill. During the event, the congressman advocated for a “trusted biometric digital immunity certificate system” while explaining that his bill would obtain biometrics from every citizen so private corporations could then “leverage” it to generate enormous profits.
“Once the government has [taken] those fairly serious biometrics from you – there will be huge opportunities for the commercial sector to leverage that,” he said. “And to try to get this all started, I introduced the ‘Improving Digital ID Act.’”
Banking and credit card companies are among the many “commercial sectors” that Foster’s bill will benefit through digital biometric IDs. The bill plainly states that the corporate ID system will give “under-banked and unbanked individuals better access to digital financial services,” cloaking the opening of markets for finance giants in the same woke language that ID4D and ID2020 employ.
But as tech oligarchs and their partners in the financial and national security industries leverage the coronavirus epidemic to institute a lucrative apparatus of digital monitoring, dissent is erupting in the countries where vaccine passports have begun to exclude millions.
Protests erupt against vaccine passports and “people who have very little to do with parliament”
In New York City – ground zero of the US vaccination passport roll-out – where over 80 percent of all Covid social distancing arrests were conducted against Black residents in 2020, simmering tensions boiled over when three Black diners initiated a brawl with staff at Carmine’s, an Upper West Side restaurant that prevented them from dining without their vaccination proof.
The incident spurred condemnation from a local Black Lives Matter chapter, which accused city authorities of exploiting mask mandates and vaccine passports to exclude and incarcerate Black residents. “What we are seeing here is the NYPD and restaurants using vaccination proof as a reason to discriminate against Black people,” declared BLM activist Kimberly Bernard.
France has been the site of some of the world’s largest protests against the vaccine passport system imposed under the watch of former banker and President Emanuel Macron. On August 14, over 210,000 people took to the streets in over 200 protests across France against the nascent biomedical security regime.
Puncturing the corporate media’s pigeonholing of the demonstrators as far-right shock troops, France’s Le Monde described them as “alone, coupled up, here with their family or friends, of all ages, white, Black, employed, retired, some vaccinated, others who refuse to get the shot.”
French journalist Pauline Bock noted that in her country, “the only trade that’s exempt from mandatory vaccination — the police — will be the one to make sure everyone else obeys. The policy is ripe for authoritarian misuse.”
In Italy, meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister and former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has mandated that all employees of both public and private businesses produce a Green Pass proving vaccination in order to enter their place of work.
The Green Pass vaccine passport system has already excluded unvaccinated individuals from restaurants, gyms, as well as trains, buses and domestic flights across the country. Official government numbers show the pass has failed to increase vaccine uptake.
With the expansion of the Green Pass to places of work, Italians have risen up in some of the largest protests the world has seen against the nascent biosecurity regime.
On October 9, hundreds of thousands of protesters poured into Italian streets from Rome to Trento to voice their rejection of Draghi’s policy. In Rome, where police repressed peaceful demonstrators with batons and riot shields, a group of about 20 far-right hooligans attacked a local union office while police stood by. Interior Minister Carlo Sibilia exploited the incident to claim that “neo-fascist groups hide behind the so-called anti-vaxxers.”
The secretary of a faction of Italy’s Communist Party, Marco Rizzo, who has condemned the passport system as “a discriminatory, divisive tool that pits one against the other,” cast suspicion on the incident.
In an October 10 statement, Rizzo warned that the incident of “fascist violence” the day before played directly into the hands of the neoliberal government, and questioned whether a new “strategy of tension” was in play. The communist leader was referring to the Italian state’s covert weaponization of far-right militants during the 1970’s “years of lead” to foment violence and neutralize Marxist organizations.
The demonstrations have now spread to the port city of Trieste, where union dock workers have refused to offload goods until the Green Pass is revoked. On October 18, Italian police attempted to break the workers’ strike with water cannons, tear gas, and heavy repression.
Two days before anti-Green Pass protests exploded across Italy, the renowned philosopher Giorgio Agamben appeared before the Italian Senate’s Constitutional Affairs Commission to issue a dramatic statement of opposition to the Green Pass.
Agamben is most famous for his concept of Homo Sacer, or bare life, in which an individual is stripped of rights and reduced to their biological essence in an extra-legal regime justified by war or other emergencies. When Italian authorities declared the first lockdown in March 2020, the philosopher applied the theory to his own country’s heavy-handed restrictions.
“The defining feature…of this great transformation that they are attempting to impose is that the mechanism which renders it formally possible is not a new body of laws, but a state of exception – in other words, not an affirmation of, but the suspension of constitutional guarantees,” the philosopher explained in the foreword to his collection of 2020 writings on Covid-19, “Where Are We Now: The Epidemic As Politics,”
In his remarks before the Italian Senate, Agamben pointed to a sinister agenda behind the official rationale for vaccine passports: “It has been said by scientists and doctors that the Green Pass has no medical significance in itself but serves to force people to get vaccinated. Instead, I think we must say the opposite: that the vaccine is a means of forcing people to have the Green Pass. That is, a device that allows individuals to be monitored and tracked, an unprecedented measure.”
The philosopher concluded his address by taking aim at the supra-national forces – Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum, and Rockefeller Foundation, among others – determined to impose a system of digital identification and high-tech social credit as much of the human population as possible.
“I believe that in this perspective,” Agamben warned, “it is more urgent than ever for parliamentarians to consider the political transformation underway, which in the long run is destined to empty parliament of its powers, reducing it to simply approving – in the name of bio-security – decrees emanating from organizations and people who have very little to do with parliament.”Read.

The Nocturnal Wonderland trailer starts out with wolves and decorated humans alike coming out in the night, looking like they’re searching, hunting or fighting for something. They run and roam freely through the forest and gather around a campfire together to let lose and feel that freedom we hear about, truly feeling it for a special moment when all your worries, insecurities and differences don’t exist and you can just…. Dance the night away, not stopping when moving from stage to stage, and only taking a break to stand still in line while even still bobbing your head to the music of the nearby stage, feeling the massive bass as you await that adrenaline boosting upside ride that gives you that coveted weightless feeling – or maybe that’s just me.
But either way, the important part about Insomniac‘s festivals, is that they’re all about the experience – and it’s important that you make it your own experience. If you want to go off by yourself on an adventure DO IT! Sometimes those are my favorite moments of the festival, like when I go off by myself at a festival, I’m a lot like the wolves and people in this trailer. They were searching, hunting or fighting for the ability to go wild, and let their spirit run free, and given the ability to do so from the music.
Above you can see the mainstage headliners of the festival that will be playing at the Wolves’ Den stage this Nocturnal Wonderland 2016. The festival will also feature LIVE performances by Ame, Autograf, Big Gigantic, Chromeo, Dabin, Gramatik, Gryffin, Henrik Schwarz, Hermitude, Keys N Krates, Matador and the recent addition of Odesza. Make sure you catch at least a few of these!

But what do you think?Our economy grows, more cars hit the road, and the risk of accidents increases. And the costs involved, both financial and other, can be extremely high. Not only does it make sense to ensure that you are properly covered against theft, accident or damage, but Mozambican law makes third-party insurance mandatory coverage. Hollard Mozambique offers a range of options according to your context, financial availability and driving style.
What is insurance?
An insurance is a contract between a person or company and an insurance company. This contract establishes that any person, property, property or other object – called an insured – is covered against risks.
What types of insurance are there?
Insurance can be taken out by both individuals and legal entities – companies, in other words. There are types of insurance that are common to both, and others that can be taken out only by individuals or only by companies.
For individuals, the most common and known are:
- Life insurance : it protects the insured and their beneficiaries against death or disability; it is possible to include other additional coverage in the life insurance contract that extends the protection to the family;
- Auto insurance : it guarantees coverage of the vehicle in question in various situations – theft, robbery, material damage, accidents, among other situations;
- Personal property insurance : smartphone, purse, jewelry and other personal property can also be protected by insurance in cases of loss, theft and theft, for example;
- Travel insurance : guarantees that the insured, in other countries, will have health care, reimbursement for flight cancellations, lost luggage, theft and other specific coverage;
- Health insurance : this insurance guarantees that the insured will have health care if needed; private health plans are, in a way, health insurance.
One type of insurance that can be taken out by both individuals and companies is property insurance – it protects homes, offices, offices and all the assets of a person or company. The coverage can be against natural disasters, theft or robbery, fire and other situations. There is also the option of including accessories in the coverage.pramasana exfoliating scalp brushRegular price $49.00 Sale price $39.20 Save $9.80

never-displayedOne of the most refreshing activities for a hot summer day is a plunge in a chilly swimming pool, and you can find them all over our southern state – in residential backyards, community centers, amusement parks, motels, and apartment complexes. They’re the site of much frivolity, as well as athletic competition, but they can also be the site of tragic accidents.
Already this year we’ve read of several drownings in South Carolina swimming pools. On the last day of May, a 2-year-old Columbia boy drowned in a home swimming pool. The child and his 3-year-old sister managed to get out of the house while their parents slept, by piling up child-sized plastic furniture, climbing on it and unlocking the door.
Just two weeks later, a 3-year-old drowned in her grandmother’s swimming pool in Abbeville County. The woman went into the bathroom and when she came out she was not able to find the little girl in the house. She discovered her outside, in the swimming pool. The grandmother administered CPR, but the child did not survive.
On Friday, June 20, 2014, a young woman was found unconscious in a Conway apartment complex pool. Reportedly, she had been swimming alone there for about 15 minutes. The coroner ruled the death an accidental drowning.
According to the CDC, there are about 3,500 drowning deaths each year, not including those that happen from boating accidents. That’s about 10 people per day. Children ages 1 to 4 are most at risk. Only birth defects account for more deaths in this age group. If you extend the age group to include ages 1 to 14, only motor vehicle accidents cause more unintentional accident-related deaths.
What factors increase the risk of a drowning death?
- Lack of swimming ability. A survey conducted for the Red Cross found that even though 80 percent of Americans said they could swim, only 56 percent of them could perform all five of the basic skills that could save their life in the water (see below). Less than half of the parents of children aged 4-17 describe their children as possessing these necessary skills and yet more than 90 percent expected their kids would be participating in water activities this summer.
- Lack of barriers such as fencing. A four-sided fence separating the pool area from the house and yard is said to reduce a child’s risk of drowning by 83% compared to a regular property-line fence. Additionally, the fenced area should be well secured and inaccessible to children. According to USASwimming.org, most youngsters who drowned in home swimming pools had last been seen inside the house, had been out of sight for less than five minutes, and were in the care of one or both parents at the time of the accident.
- Lack of supervision. It goes without saying that children should be kept under constant supervision in the pool area. This is not always easy to do, especially when the pool is crowded and there are dozens of little heads bouncing up and down. A tragedy can happen in the blink of an eye. Stay close enough to reach your child at all times, and don’t get caught up in conversations, reading or sunbathing, assuming a lifeguard or another parent will be able to rescue your child in an emergency.
Swimming lessons won’t prevent all water tragedies, but they certainly will increase a person’s chances of surviving. We alluded above to the five basic water safety skills the Red Cross says could save your life in a swimming pool. Can you and your children do these things?
- Step or jump into water over your head, return to the surface and float or tread water for one minute, without a flotation device
- Tread water or float in a full circle and find an exit from the pool
- Swim 25 yards (the length of a standard pool)
- Exit from the water without using a ladder.
It’s worth testing all of your family members on these skills, even if you and they think they are safe swimmers.
We hope you’re enjoying your summer in the sun. We hope and pray your family doesn’t have to endure the sorrow experienced by those who lost a loved one in a drowning accident. In some cases negligence plays a part in swimming pool accidents, and in those situations the Louthian Law Firm is pledged to help the grieving family find at least some measure of justice from the responsible parties. Call (803) 454-1200 if you have any questions about a swimming pool accident in the Columbia area this summer.Is This Rapper Addicted To Heroin?

You can’t change how your brain works, but you can use its little quirks to your advantage. Charles Duhigg says “45% of what you do is habit”, anything different requires us to use more of our prefrontal cortex, our higher-level thinking processes. This part of the brain uses up a lot of energy (oxygen and glucose) and tires quickly, sometimes it’s easier to give up than to feel the discomfort.
Why People Find Change Difficult
- Habits: Your current habits are hard to break, and new habits are hard to form. Your brain is trained to follow the pathways set down by years of conditioning, the habits we repeat most are literally etched into our neural pathways. Habit formation is the process by which new behaviours become automatic. The brain doesn’t distinguish between good and bad behaviours, it just builds repeated behaviours, thoughts, and feelings into stronger neuronal circuits. Our brains work on a trigger and reward basis—the so-called “habit loop”. about 40 to 45% of what you do may feel like you are making a decision, but it is actually habit.
- Loss Aversion: Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. First discovered by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, loss aversion is the human tendency to strongly prefer avoiding a loss to receiving a gain. Your brain is constantly scanning the world around you for potential danger and anything new can register as a threat. We are generally motivated not to lose what we already have than to gain something new. While the potential benefits of the change may appear obvious, the brain is more attuned to negatives since paying attention to negatives is more important to your very survival.
- Resilience: Is your ability to adapt well and recover quickly after stress, adversity, trauma or tragedy. Research shows that motivation often flags about halfway to a goal. You can change thinking patterns and behaviours that are hard wired through repetition, but it takes a lot of time and effort. That’s why people need to build time and repetition into the change process. We used to think it was 21 days to change a habit, research at the University College London found it’s more like 66 days. Change is like a giant rubber band that tries to pull us back, often the pull is too strong and that stops people from moving forward.
- Cognitive Dissonance: Psychologist Leon Festinger proposed the theory of cognitive dissonance, where people have an inner need to ensure that their beliefs and behaviours are consistent. People seek consistency among their cognitions (beliefs, opinions). When there is an inconsistency between attitudes or behaviours (dissonance), something must change to eliminate the dissonance or feelings of discomfort will remain until we restore the balance.
- Emotions: Whenever you feel uncomfortable, incompetent, or unsupported the alarm in your brain, the amygdala, doesn’t like it and triggers negative emotions such as anxiety, hopelessness and fear. Negative emotions can become substantial barriers to change and the only relief is to retreat to what seems like a comfortable place, your old way of doing things. As a result, we tend to act irrationally to try and prevent change, often without realising it.
- Environment: Your environment reinforces who you are, even when you don’t want to be who you are. Because change has such a strong impact on our brains, we tend to find friends and form groups that reinforce our beliefs. What we do every day and the people that surround us can cause us to continue down a path that interferes with our happiness and achievement of our goals.
Paying attention to these 6 points will make the change process much easier. Go ahead give it a go.

International Dancehall star Shenseea seems a bit up in her feelings these last few days, as she has been making some very suggestive posts on her Twitter and Instagram pages that have been turning her fans right on.
Amid a regular night on Twitter, the “BeGood” singer, spontaneously popped up on her fans with a post that opened their eyes widely and might have caused many of them to be hitting up the artiste’s dm immediately.
Shenseea bravely wrote on her Twitter”Slut me out bae”, without any context at all, however, her followers were well caught up in the drama with 198 of them retweeting the post and liking it 973 times.
One fan by the name of @Jay_Dawg64 responded to the tweet by saying “I was tryna reach you last night but you ain’t answer man” while another by the name @samyaa__ said, “she just sleep texting y’all Loudly crying face ignore this tweet”.
The “lighter” singer did not care however and continued in her provocative mood when she posted a slide of pictures on Instagram with the caption “Idk why bxtches would hate on me when I’d legit fxck y’all Psh your loss!”, suggesting that she is not afraid to have intimate relationships with other females.
For many, this might be a shocker but other persons have just been working with it, with even Dancehall artiste Ding Dong commenting under the post saying “Outdeh”, while many of her followers supported her caption with heart and fire emojis while others took it for a complete joke, taunting her that they would have to see her do it first.
What do you think?. Is Shenseea capable of doing the crazy things she speaks about?, Or is she just pulling the legs of her gullible followers?.Science Fiction: Where to Start?

Please Note: This was one of the first articles posted here, but I haven't had the time to verify if the links I've provided are for books still in print, although amazon is usually good at presenting all the different available versions, including used through various third-party sellers. Whether new or used, if you use one of our links we may earn a commission. Another good source is BookFinder.com. One of these days, maybe, I might find time to review all the links.
Chapter I: The Short Stories:
Science Fiction and Fantasy are arguably today's most prominent literary genres easily filling three times the book store and library space as they did a mere twenty years ago. Many factors have contributed to this phenomenon, not the least of which is the enormous popularity of television and film entertainments such as Star Trek and Star Wars. Equally important is the legacy of reading handed down by the "baby-boomers" who came of age in the SF boom of the '50s and early '60s. I know I can't be the only one who has been immensely pleased when a son or daughter embraced books and writers the parent has cherished for decades. More than any other genre, SF/Fantasy has been able to capture and inspire the imagination of readers of all ages.
Many who have come to the field because of a television show or film have been content to limit their exploration to novelizations and spin-offs of those original stories. Others have ventured farther afield in search of more and different adventures. A lucky few have been encouraged in their exploration by friends and/or relatives anxious to share their own discoveries. I think it is very important for readers to be familiar with the history of the genre in order to better appreciate current writers and trends. Anyone serious in pursuing a writing career in this genre most especially needs a wide and thorough knowledge of what has gone before. As I said in another essay, Science Fiction: A Primer, there are only nine or ten basic plot elements (OK, maybe a dozen) throughout all of SF. In order to develop these ideas into new and varied storylines one must familiarize themselves with how other writers have handled them.
That brings us to the fundamental questions. Where do I start? Who do I read? It must be stated from the outset that no one, not reader or writer or editor, can absorb all the new works that are published in the field each year, let alone what has come before. One must find a niche, a sub-genre, or a group of authors that please the reader consistently and then concentrate on them. Anything more is impossible to accomplish even if you do nothing else but read, and who would do that even if they could. As a start, and to avoid as much expense as possible, I recommend a visit to your local library, and in order to sample as many authors as possible we will begin with anthologies of short stories.
Many of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells' most popular stories are novellas and can be found in omnibus editions. One of the best collections of early 20th century SF is to be found in Before the Golden Age edited by Isaac Asimov. The Golden Age itself is well represented in several anthologies, the best of which are Adventures in Time and Space edited by J. Francis McComas and Raymond J. Healy, A Science Fiction Argosy edited by Damon Knight, and the two-volume A Treasury of Great Science Fiction edited by Anthony Boucher. Many editors have published yearly "Best Of" anthologies, including Judith Merril, Terry Carr, and Donald A. Wollheim. Currently the two most prominent collections are those offered by Gardner Dozois and David G. Hartwell. Dozois, currently editor of Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, has also issued the excellent collection Modern Classic Short Novels of Science Fiction. Original anthologies have been a significant source of many award-winning stories over the years; John Carnell's New Writings in SF, Damon Knight's Orbit series, Terry Carr's Universe, and Robert Silverberg's New Dimensions. Four recent anthologies have been published by the preminent book editor of the field, David G. Hartwell; The World Treasury of Science Fiction, The Science Fiction Century, The Ascent of Wonder : The Evolution of Hard SF, and the most recent, The Hard SF Renaissance.
A purchase through our links may earn us a commission.
Two series of collections representing some of the best of the genre are those honoring the shorter works winning the Hugo and Nebula awards. Hugos are voted on by fans at the annual World Science Fiction Convention; the Nebula is awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA). This organization was established in 1965 to promote a better understanding of the field and to help new writers gain support and recognition for their work. In 1968 the SFWA decided it was necessary to honor those works which preceded the organization and thus never had the opportunity to receive a Nebula. A poll was conducted of the membership and the results published in two volumes collectively titled The Science Fiction Hall of Fame. Volume I, edited by Silverberg, was devoted to the best short stories published before 1965. Ben Bova edited Volume II which included longer works, classified as novellas or novelettes. Paperback editions of these works, because of their length, were divided into Volumes IA, IB, etc. More recently, Silverberg also edited The Fantasy Hall of Fame.
If your library is lacking in any or most of these titles, the next stop would be your favorite used book store, common in even smaller towns these days. For those who can afford it new book stores will have a good selection of current titles but probably lacking in the classic titles mentioned. Another source is online booksellers, amazon.com being the most prominent.
For those of you new to science fiction, I envy you the discoveries ahead. Happy reading!
Chapter II: Classic Novels:
After perusing several short story anthologies most will have compiled a list of writers whose longer works they may wish to explore. The following is a purely subjective list, for the most part including titles already on my shelves. It is inevitable that anyone's list of classic science fiction novels will be lacking authors and/or titles which would have been included by someone else. My list is not meant to be definitive by any means, and in some cases is not even the title I consider to be the author's best. What I have attempted to do is include titles, most of which should be available in larger used bookstores, that are representative of the broad spectrum of style and quality the genre has to offer. As an expedient, I have selected one author in an alphabetical sequence which is lacking in completion in only two instances, plus a stretch for one letter since it is not the name under which the title was published. I welcome others' suggestions of both authors and titles they feel should rightfully be included in a list of "Classic SF Novels." For what it's worth (nothing really) here are my recommendations:
Isaac Asimov - The Gods Themselves
Ray Bradbury - The Martian Chronicles
Arthur C. Clarke - Childhood's End
Philip K. Dick - The Man in the High Castle
M.J.Engh - Arslan
Philip José Farmer - To Your Scattered Bodies Go
William Gibson - Neuromancer
Robert A. Heinlein - The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress
Dean Ing - The Other Time
J.O.Jeppson (Janet Asimov) - Mind Transfer
Daniel Keyes - Flowers for Algernon (also known as "Charly", the name of the film based on this novel)
Ursula K. LeGuin - The Lathe of Heaven
Walter M. Miller, Jr. - A Canticle for Leibowitz
Larry Niven - A Gift From Earth
Chad Oliver - Shadows in the Sun
Frederik Pohl - Starburst
Daniel Quinn - Ishmael
Kim Stanley Robinson - The Wild Shore
Robert Silverberg -Dying Inside
Wilson Tucker - The Lincoln Hunters
Jack Vance - The Dragon Masters
John Wyndham - Re-Birth
Chelsea Quinn Yarbro -Time of the Fourth Horseman
Roger Zelazny - This Immortal (original title, "...And Call Me Conrad")
Remember that I am discussing Science Fiction. I will leave it to someone else more familiar with the sister genre of Fantasy to recommend authors and titles in that category. In other articles I will attempt to explore various authors' works in more detail, and I hope I will be able to aid both novices and long-time fans to come to a better understanding of the history and literary contributions of this genre.
Chapter III: More Classic Novels:
As mentioned previously there are many other authors and/or titles that could have been included. Knowing there would be other suggestions I thought I might as well return to this myself and add another list. Even my knowledge of the genre is limited and this time there are even more letters not represented. The letters A and B alone are well represented with a banner-full of names, not so with others. To compensate I have included two authors' titles for most lines:
Brian W. Aldiss - Earthworks; Poul Anderson - Tau Zero
Gregory Benford - Timescape; Octavia Butler - Adulthood Rites
C.J.Cherryh - Downbelow Station; Hal Clement - Mission of Gravity
Samuel R. Delany - Nova; Thomas Disch - Camp Concentration
George Alec Effinger - What Entropy Means to Me; Suzette Haden Elgin - Yonder Comes the Other End of Time
Karen Joy Fowler - Sarah Canary; Robert L. Forward - Dragon's Egg
David Gerrold - When Harlie Was One; Parke Godwin - Waiting for the Galactic Bus
Frank Herbert - Dune; Joe Haldeman - The Forever War
Damon Knight - CV; C.M.Kornbluth - The Syndic
R.A.Lafferty - Past Master; Fritz Leiber - The Big Time
Jack McDevitt - Moonfall; Ward Moore - Bring the Jubilee
Kris Neville - Bettyan; Andre Norton - The Stars Are Ours
David R. Palmer - Emergence; Edgar Pangborn - A Mirror for Observers
Spider Robinson - Night of Power; Joanna Russ - The Female Man
Allen Steele - Orbital Decay; Theodore Sturgeon - Venus Plus X
William Tenn - Of Men and Monsters; James Tiptree, Jr. - Up the Walls of the World
John Varley - The Ophiuchi Hotline; A.E.van Vogt - Slan
Robert Charles Wilson - Mysterium; Gene Wolfe - The Book of the New Sun
Nicholas Yermakov - Last Communion
With only a few exceptions I have not included any recent titles. Time will tell if the current crop of favorites have what it takes to be considered classics.

An unforgettable, once in a lifetime shared adventure of epic proportions.EastEnders viewers were left in stitches during Thursday night's episode of the BBC1 soap, as cheeky Tiffany Butcher gave viewers a blast from the past.
Tiffany, played by 19-year-old Maisie Smith, asked Dotty Cotton: "So yeah, do you wanna come to the pub with us?", with Dotty replying she did want to.
"Well, tough, you can't. I'm not letting you ruin the night. You're NFI," Tiffany coolly responded.
Like any new EastEnders viewers would imaginably have been, Dotty was taken aback by the acronym, questioning what it meant.
Tiffany explained: "Not flippin' invited."
The hilarious acronym is a throwback to a 2010 episode featuring Tiffany and Dotty as young kids in the schoolyard, in which Tiffany first coined the phrase.
EastEnders fans who remembered the line took to social media in hysterics during Thursday's episode, with one writing on Twitter: "NFI makes a return! Made my night".
Another fan wrote: "I’m genuinely shocked that the writers even know about the nfi line sorry it’s so iconic but I didn’t think they’d have the braincells to reuse it in such a witty way...".
Other fans said the return of the line was "iconic", while another said it "hadn't aged at all".
Even the official BBC EastEnders Twitter account got in on the joke, as they posted a comparison clip of Tiffany in 2021 and 2010 along with the caption: "Some things never change."
Although there are rumours Maisie Smith who plays Tiffany may be leaving the soap for more lucrative showbiz offers, it's clear she has amassed a huge following of fans during her 13 years on the show who would be devastated to see her depart.
Did you remember the iconic NFI line on Thursday night's episode? Let us know in the comments below.Roger Allen Brown, age 76, died on Friday, October 26 in Englewood Florida.

Federal Trade Commission announced that YouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children’s channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to target million of dollars in advertisements to those viewers.
YouTube announced on its blog that “We are changing how we treat data for children’s content on YouTube..”
Besides the monetary fine, the settlement requires the company to create a system for identifying content aimed at children and to notify channel owners about their obligations to get consent from parents before collecting information on children.
“No other company in America is subject to these types of requirements and they will impose significant costs on YouTube”, FTC Chairman Joe Simons told reporters.
According to Andrew Smith, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, mentioned that “It happens that $170 million is roughly the budget of the Bureau of Consumer Protection for one year”. He also mentioned that the Commission would “conduct a sweep of the YouTube platform to determine whether there remains child-directed content” in which personal information is being collected. The FTC could take actions against individual content creators or channel owners as a result.
YouTube announced in late August that it would launch YouTube Kids with separate niches for children depending on their ages and designed to exclude disturbing videos. It has no behavioral advertising.
“Google and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,” mentioned New York Attorney General Letitia James said.Most people think of social media, surveys, crowdsourcing, and other listening systems as the province of marketing, sales, and product people.

Sirene Blair Cards Final-Round 66 (-6) to Capture Mary Lou Baker Open Victory
By Megan Terry, Programs Administrator
The 2017 Mary Lou Baker Open, a 36-hole UGA Women’s Championship that was started in 2010, included 38 of Utah golf’s most talented and competitive female golfers. Crater Springs Golf Course at The Homestead Resort in Midway, Utah, hosted the two-day event June 22-23.
After the first round, Brigham Young University’s Rose Huang and San Diego State Women’s Golf Alumna Sirene Blair led the pack at one-under 71. Huang carded 35 (-2) on the front nine with three birdies and a bogey on the par-4 No. 6. On the back, Rose shot one-over 36 to top the leaderboard heading in to Friday’s final round.
Other than one bogey on No. 9, Blair was incredibly consistent, especially during her back nine. Sirene carded one-under 36 with birdies on Nos. 1 and 7 and made nine pars in a row coming in to tie Huang after Round 1.
Former BYU athlete Kendra Dalton and Utah Valley University’s Carly Dehlin each posted rounds of even-par 72 during the first round, and three-time consecutive Mary Lou Baker Open Champion Kelsey Chugg finished Round 1 at 75 (+3).
With two tied at the top and two one stroke behind, the Final Round was anyone’s game. Still, only one would be crowned champion.
With a bogey-free round of 66, 34 (-3) on the front nine and 32 (-3) on the back, Sirene Blair pulled ahead of Rose Huang to earn the win by three strokes, 71-66—137. Blair was so “in the zone” from start to finish, she had no idea that 66 was her outcome while in the scoring tent.
“My best shot of the day was definitely on 17,” explained Blair. “I almost holed out from 85 yards for eagle.”
She settled for birdie and ended up with the victory in return.
Blair has been on a winning streak the entire month of June. She won her first two events as an amateur on The Cactus Tour at The Legacy Golf Club in Las Vegas, Nevada, the first by three strokes with a three-day total of seven-under 209 and the second by a whopping nine strokes at nine-under 207.
“My game felt great on Friday,” Sirene stated. “I was putting really well. I enjoyed playing with fellow Division I athletes, especially Rose. She played very well.”
Sirene plans to pursue her dream of playing on the LPGA Tour this year. She also has additional Cactus Tour events lined up this summer to prepare her for Q-School in August.
Sue Nyhus earned Low Senior after posting rounds of 80-77—157 (+13).If you enjoy acoustic music and uniquely talented voices then by now you must have heard of Seafret, right? A band which is the perfect balance of bittersweet vibes and upbeat bangers.
Callum Spencer and Sophie Morgan were the perfect support acts. Both naturally really talented singers with a similar acoustic sound to Seafret, they did a brilliant job of setting the mood.
Sophie Morgan had a creative way of advertising her new EP Marmalade, selling her own homemade marmalade, which apparently took way too long to make. An incredible idea and you should definitely check out her new release!
On to the main act… I was a bit concerned before they took to the stage that perhaps Seafret were one of those bands that you should never hear live, in case they couldn’t hit the notes in their studio releases, but I was SO wrong.
Beautiful is the only word to describe Jack Sedman’s voice. Hearing him sing alongside Harry Draper’s incredible accompaniment on guitar is astonishingly far better than listening on Spotify, because only then do you realise how talented the pair really are.
Jack’s outstanding voice was particularly noticeable when we, the crowd, attempted to sing along to their most popular songs, ‘Wildfire’, ‘Atlantis’, and ‘Magnetic’. Unfortunately for us, it became so clear why we were not up on stage in his place.
Speaking to all the acts afterwards, they were all so friendly and it was also great to find out that most were local, Callum Spencer being from Skipton and Jack and Harry from Bridlington.
Friday the 13th was definitely not a cursed night for me, having the opportunity to hear them perform in Stylus. Seafret, “I want you and I always will”. I cannot wait until you are back in Leeds.
Seafret’s new album, Most of us are Strangers, is out now!Javascript must be enabled to use this. Learn how to enable Javascript

For me, design is going beyond knowing the "ins and outs" of digital design, websites & marketing, or even knowing the latest software. My approach to design has more to do with problem solving.
Providing creative solutions on all levels.
With that, it becomes all about interpreting thoughts and concepts and building brands. To really understand the heart of the project. And best of all, the collaboration with clients and colleagues.
It all begins with listening, visualizing and collaboration.
From there, anything can be successfully created.

.....The Six Day War, and the Origin of the Left’s Hatred for Israel
by Robert Liebman
The iconic photograph of Israeli soldiers gazing at the Western Wall, in Jerusalem, for the first time in their lives, after entering the city as Israel beat the invading Arab armies in 1967. Photo: Israel Knesset..
Amorphous, anarchic, and contradictory, the movement nevertheless enjoyed basic principles and a single voice: America was Amerika. Revolution was imminent. Frantz Fanon’s Marxist anti-colonial Wretched of the Earth was the radicals’ book of the month..”
At Camp David Arafat “committed a crime against his own people.” A high-ranking Arab diplomat said that. The radical left refused to be so honest and frank..
Despite the movement’s blatant moral and intellectual shortcomings, it admittedly enjoys considerable success. It has a large and loyal following, and in castigating Israel, it has been unified and consistent, a signal achievement considering that leftist movements are generally fractious and fragile.
And the Palestinians? They are still stateless, stuck in a hole they dug for themselves by their own obstinacy. But the left helped them dig it, encouraging the Palestinians in their demand for all of mandatory Palestine.
Israel is not going to disappear, or be disappeared.
Chaos now envelops the larger Middle East, with no end in sight. A peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is more remote, more elusive, than ever before.
The radical left is hardly alone in failing to foresee the Arab Spring and its horrendous consequences. But it is accountable for providing vacuous and dishonest cheerleading when the Palestinians needed wise and honest counsel. Now, with the broader Middle East in turmoil, it might be too late.
For nearly fifty years, the anti-Israel left has been committing crimes not just against Israel but against the Palestinians – and the entire peace process.

Recommended for use with the Horizons Preschool Program, these DVDs can also stand alone. The movies teach positive character traits through animated characters and catchy songs. Each DVD holds two stories, each story targeting a specific character trait. The stories are told by a male narrator, who does the voices of all the characters. Older children probably won't appreciate the episodes as much, as younger children will be more forgiving of the slower pace, repeated scenes, and slight lag time of the speakers/animated characters, but the lessons in character are worthwhile for any audience. The set contains 8 DVDs targetting Obedience & Self Control, Goodness & Faith, Honesty & Responsibility, Thankfulness & Gentleness, Sharing & Kindness, Politeness & Joy, Confidence & Love, and Patience & Peace. Running time for each DVD is approximately 20-25 minutes.

Login to report an issueIn 1966, U.S. senators organized hearings where doctors and government officials voiced their concerns about psychedelic use. William Frosch, a professor of psychiatry at New York University and attending doctor at Bellevue Hospital, said that LSD had “serious adverse effects with prolonged psychotic reactions even on normally stable persons.”
The president of the New York State Council on Drug Addiction, Donald Louria (who infamously said, “Gram for gram … LSD is far more dangerous than heroin”), brought up the psychedelic side effects seen at Bellevue, where “in addition to vivid, colorful hallucinations, these include many bizarre effects such as terror. … Some of the patients had developed states of anxiety so powerful that the report called them ‘panic reactions.’”
These testimonies took place in the context of the war on drugs, as pointed arguments in favor of prohibition. Four years later, in 1970, Richard Nixon introduced the Controlled Substances Act, which federally banned psychedelics, with some exceptions.
The idea of the "bad trip" has persisted culturally, even as psychedelics in the past two decades have established footholds in scientific research, academic journals, and for-profit companies. Many states have proposed or passed decriminalization laws on psychedelics, FDA approval for psilocybin for depression is inching closer, and psychedelic companies that have gone public have been valued in the billions.
Psychedelics have entered a stage of mainstreaming where those who might never have considered taking psychedelics are now curious, but could be cautious or risk-averse. They want to know, beforehand, what their experience will be like: Will it be safe, will they have a “bad trip"?
In June, I got an email pitch from a senior adviser at Bullseye Corporate, a communications firm, about the first psychedelic gene test, one that was created to meet this need. “Want to know your reaction to psychedelics before you take them? You can now—with the first ever Psychedelic Genetics Test kit… the test kit can help people considering psychedelics assisted therapy gain personalized insights into how their genetic profile may impact treatment and outcomes. In other words, it can basically predict a 'bad trip' as genetics plays a strong role in how psychedelics are received and metabolized by each user.”
Sold by HaluGen Life Sciences, a subsidiary of Entheon Biomedical Corp, the Psychedelic Genetic Test claims to help a person “understand your sensitivity to classical psychedelics,” like LSD and psilocybin, “discover your ketamine response based on genetics and format,” and “explore your short- and long-term risk factors associated with psychedelics use," according to their website.
HaluGen provided Motherboard with four test kits for $1 each plus shipping; they normally cost $89. I sent in my DNA sample from a cheek swab, as did my colleague, Tim Marchman. As a measure of quality control, Motherboard also sent in DNA samples from a pair of twins to see if their results would be the same. They were. This was a small test of only two people with identical DNA, but in this instance, HaluGen produced consistent results.
The problem with HaluGen’s test is not their DNA processing skills but what's implied from the genes they hone in on—including two genes that HaluGen claims to influence serious mental illness risk that have been scientifically discredited according to published literature. The conclusions drawn from the other genes are also overstated and misinterpreted, according to scientists Motherboard consulted who study those genes. In response to these statements, a spokesperson for Entheon told Motherboard that like other direct-to-consumer tests, the Psychedelic Genetics Test is designed to be educational, not diagnostic, and that a disclaimer on HaluGen's website clearly states that.
This may be the first psychedelics genetic test kit, but it almost certainly won’t be the last. This test exemplifies the kinds of tactics future products will likely utilize: marketing certainty based on biology (while paired with hedging disclaimers), and using scientific jargon and, sometimes, prominent research findings to justify their interpretations. Actually, though, the amount of practical insight or knowledge they can provide from a handful of genes is woefully small.
As such, tests like these create a number of risk factors all on their own. They could lead people to make decisions about drug dosage based on a simplistic reading of single gene variations, which don’t accurately predict outcomes. If a genetic test informs someone that their gene variations are "normal," it could lead them to focus less on their intentions and setting—known to be important for the experience—before a psychedelic trip. Finally, telling people based on outdated or misrepresented science that they are at risk for psychosis or schizophrenia—as I was—is both distressing and ethically fraught.
The test looks at five genes: one that is claimed to impact how fast or slow you metabolize ketamine, one that influences the density of serotonin receptors that you have, and three gene variants that HaluGen claims influence mental health risk—with the implication that those with higher risk based on those variants should be cautious of psychedelics.
In a press release, Entheon CEO Timothy Ko said, “For patients considering psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, and providers alike, this product gives greater insight into how an individual's genetic profile could impact treatment, ultimately improving outcomes.”
The boilerplate pitch for the test I got in my inbox—that the test could "basically predict a 'bad trip'"—is predicated on a gene for a specific kind of serotonin receptor, 5HTR2A. The test said that a gene variation that led to a higher density of these receptors would make a person more sensitive to psychedelics. The suggestion here is that a higher density of these receptors is correlated with the quality of the trip that they're going to have.
Charles Nichols, a professor of pharmacology at LSU School of Medicine who researches serotonin receptors, put it plainly: "This really means nothing,” Nichols said. “The premise of trying to link one polymorphism with a behavioral predictor is just, I would say, preposterous.”
There are many other gene variations that could influence serotonin receptors outside of density, Nichols said. “It may not be the amount of serotonin receptors that you have to look at; it might be the function of the serotonin receptor: How is it signaling? How is it desensitizing?”
It doesn't mean that these receptors are unimportant. HaluGen cites 55 references on its website, and Nichols pointed out one to me: a 2019 paper from the journal Nature that showed that psychedelic effects emerge through serotonin 2A receptors. They reported that the intensity of psychedelic effects, as reported by their participants, was related to the receptor occupancy—meaning how many receptors were stimulated by psilocybin’s active metabolite, psilocin.
Nichols said this was significant research; the study showed without a doubt that these specific serotonin receptors are relevant to psychedelic intensity. But the exact relationship between gene variations, receptor density, and receptor occupancy still needs more research.
(Entheon wrote that "there is growing evidence that the HTR2A gene that governs receptor density has an influence on psychedelic sensitivity. The science is continuously improving as more studies are conducted and we’ll review and monitor new evidence as it becomes available.")
But the study found that the intensity of psilocybin experience is dependent not only upon the number of receptors that a person has in the brain but also on the occupancy of those receptors, Nichols said. "If you think about it, it could negate [HaluGen's] whole premise,” he said. “They’re trying to tell you that the number of receptors that somebody has correlates with their subjective experience. Whereas that paper is saying it’s not the number of receptors that somebody has but it's the fraction of those receptors that are occupied by the drug that govern the subjective intensity of the experience.”
Jacob Aday, an experimental psychologist at University of California San Francisco, agreed that the claim that higher density equals higher intensity doesn’t have any solid research supporting it. “In fact, it could be the complete opposite,” Aday said. “Those with a high density of serotonin receptors might need a higher dose to effectively stimulate all of the extra receptors. So they’re making an assumption that really hasn't been demonstrated anywhere.”
My test results said that my psychedelics sensitivity should be "normal," since my variation of the gene for that serotonin receptor wasn’t associated with increased or decreased receptor density. My colleague’s results said that his variant meant his psychedelics sensitivity was increased. Yet if this test was supposed to be an indication of how the actual psychedelic experience might go, it wasn’t predictive in our case. My colleague said that he has only had good psychedelic trips, and in my case, I’ve only had challenging ones.
I found the most concerning part of the results to be the mental health risk assessment. HaluGen’s test looked at three genes, DISC1, NRG1, and how many copies of the C4A gene a person had, to determine risk of different psychiatric disorders. The results say that certain variations of DISC1 and NRG1 gene have been shown to increase the risk for psychosis, bipolar, and schizophrenia.
But DISC1 and NGR1 have been thoroughly ruled out as candidate genes for schizophrenia, bipolar, or psychosis, said Steven Hyman, director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. “If you apply to the [National Institute of Mental Health] with an otherwise well-written grant purporting to study DISC1 or NRG1 in schizophrenia, the grant would be automatically rejected,” he said. “It’s that straightforward.”
In a 2017 paper titled No Evidence That Schizophrenia Candidate Genes Are More Associated With Schizophrenia Than Noncandidate Genes, the authors re-examined 25 candidate genes previously thought to be involved with schizophrenia, including DISC1 and NRG1. “These commonly studied variants were no more associated with the disorder than would be expected by chance,” the authors wrote.
My results for DISC1 and NRG1 were "normal," as were Marchman's and the twins', but it's worth explaining how such genes were once of interest and then lost their credibility. These genes were thought to be risk factors before scientists had the statistical power of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) at their disposal, Hyman explained. In the past, researchers would pick candidate genes based on guesses about what genes might be at play in a given disorder, like genes that effective drugs targeted or neurobiological pathways that seemed important.
GWAS studies don't require such a priori guesses since they look at the entire genome indiscriminately. Advances in gene sequencing made it so that scientists could look at the whole genomes of large groups of people, with and without a disease, and see what genetic variations popped up in those with the condition compared to those without it. This process eliminated several candidate genes, including DISC1 and NRG1.
Entheon's spokesperson wrote that GWAS are "just one data point that looks at the influence of NRG1 and DISC1. There are other, equally valid peer-reviewed studies, that have shown there is a potential linkage between NRG1 and DISC1 and mental health risk."
In response, Hyman said, "'Equally valid' is not nearly correct," and directed me to a 2013 editorial written by, Patrick Sullivan, the chair of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, who wrote that, "The published genetic evidence for an association of DISC1 with schizophrenia does not meet a high standard."
"And since then there have been large unbiased GWAS and whole exome sequencing studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and neither NRG1 nor DISC 1 show association to either disorder," Hyman said. "For that matter neither emerges in other GWAS, such as for major depression."
The other gene in HaluGen's test, C4, has more rigor behind it. In fact, the relationship between C4 and schizophrenia was discovered by GWAS done by researchers at the Broad Institute, where Hyman works. The graph that showed C4's prevalence was so dramatic that it was named the Manhattan plot, for the skyscraper-like bar that was C4.
The authors of the C4 study, published in Nature, used data from more than 100,000 DNA samples from around the world. They found 100 genetic risk factors, including one very strong signal on a specific location of the genome, the gene for complement component 4 (C4), which is typically an immune molecule that helps contain infections in the rest of the body.
The researchers found that people who had particular forms of C4 had higher expressions of the gene, and higher risks for developing schizophrenia. In animal models, Harvard neurobiologist Beth Stevens determined that the C4 gene plays a role in synaptic pruning, a process that occurs during brain development where some connections between brain cells are removed.
I knew about the significance of C4 already, so I was jarred to find that I have four copies of the C4A gene. The HaluGen test said this means I have an increased risk of psychosis, bipolar, and schizophrenia. When explaining why, the test summarizes the research finding: “increased disorder synaptic pruning can be a contributing factor to a higher risk.”
Entheon's spokesperson referred me to the Nature study, writing that C4 "has one of the strongest genetic risk-associations with mental health." But the legitimacy of the science behind the C4 finding doesn’t mean that HaluGen testing me for copies of C4 is legitimate, said Hyman. C4 was an important discovery in the biology of schizophrenia, but Hyman said it’s taken out of context in this individual test result. The reason why researchers study these genes is to try to understand the underlying biology that gives rise to complex psychiatric illnesses, not for individual use.
All mental illnesses are polygenic, meaning there isn’t one gene that can be implicated in its cause. Yet even polygenic predictions are not diagnostic. That doesn’t mean they’re useless. They are a piece of a larger puzzle of mental illness—the piece that’s trying to understand mechanisms, while other pieces focus on treatment or knowledge that is more clinically useful.
From my results, Hyman said that my risk of schizophrenia has gone from a population base rate of 1% to 1.53%. And, he added, my risk of lupus may have slightly gone down. This reveals how it’s overly simplistic to pin complex illness on one or even a small handful of genes. Genes do many things, and they work in combination to produce phenotypes—the observable characteristics of a person in existence with their environment.
“The results mean, basically, absolutely nothing,” Hyman said.
Entheon responded: "While our test kits are not diagnostic in nature, results do not 'mean nothing.' They provide users with information, which within the proper context of set and setting, can be one point for discussion with a qualified medical professional about mental health."
Of the entire genetic test, Nichols said he thought the only part—conceptually—that had some promise was the ketamine metabolism section. There is a growing attempt to assess how people metabolize certain categories or types of drugs called personal pharmacogenomics.
My gene that encodes for the liver enzyme CYP2B6 has a variant that the test said means I metabolize ketamine very slowly. “‘Slow metabolizers should be more cautious when being dosed with ketamine, as they will likely experience an increased duration and intensity of effect,” the results said. It also said that I would metabolize intravenous or subcutaneous ketamine very slowly, compared to oral ketamine which was normal.
The gene HaluGen looked at was for a liver enzyme, and there are 40 or 50 different enzymes that are primarily responsible for metabolizing drugs, and different forms of the enzymes can be slow or fast metabolizers. Ketamine is known to be metabolized by a couple of major liver enzymes, and if you know which forms of enzymes you have, it could one day predict how fast or slow you metabolize, and perhaps one day inform dosage. But still, the HaluGen results fall short, Nichols said.
There are many different drugs, foods, or natural products metabolized by the enzyme they looked for, which is one of the more common ones. And there’s more than one metabolic pathway to eliminate ketamine or to change it from an active compound to a metabolite that’s not active anymore. This particular gene, “could play just a minor effect to a major effect, depending upon what fraction of ketamine would normally be metabolized by this particular pathway,” Nichols said.
In response, Entheon emphasized that, "There are a number of peer-reviewed studies that we cite that show a clear association with slow ketamine metabolism with the CYP2B6*6 genotype."
Another part of the test results was an ethnic comparison breakdown. For ketamine metabolism, for instance, it showed me how I compared to Caucasians, East Asians, and Africans. Some of the genes included different ethnic comparisons, like Indian.
These breakdowns are a reflection of what we know about the frequency of certain genetic variation in people of certain ancestries, and are often based on research that looked at specific parts of the world. "That's really the basis of tests like 23andMe," Nichols said. But since this test wasn't targeted at revealing my ancestry, it's hard to see how this summary is useful. The test kit did not ask for my background (I am biracial), so Nichols said that ancestral overviews wouldn't be predictive in most cases, and certainly not mine. Entheon wrote that "The ethnic breakdowns are for informational purposes only and are not designed to make a specific prediction."
How can we tell what a person’s psychedelic experience be like? Will it be good or bad, healing or unsettling? “There’s been quite the spectrum of reactions to psychedelics, everything from angelic to hell,” Aday said. "And so a natural question is how can you predict if you're going to have the hellish experience or the angelic experience.”
It's still a pressing question, especially when considering psychedelics in a therapeutic context. In a review from this year co-written by Aday and his colleagues, they summarized predictors for individual psychedelic experiences and concluded that we’re only starting to be able to name and verify what can actually forecast what kind of experience a person will have.
Notably, these predictors are dynamic, not fixed, as evidenced by the fact that the same person might have a “bad” trip at one point in their life and a “good” trip at another. (Also, calling a trip “bad” is subjective in and of itself; the word researchers and clinicians use today is “challenging.” While some psychedelic experiences can be challenging, and they certainly will be in the treatment of mental illness, if users are able to integrate the experience, they can often still find ways to make it meaningful.)
Aday and his colleagues went through all the literature published on predicting psychedelic trips in the last 20 years and found that, broadly, the most reliable predictors could be grouped into two categories: traits and states.
States are how someone is feeling in the moment before they’re about to take the drug. Traits are more stable variables, like personality. People who are more open to experiences, for example, or more willing to think in different ways before they took psychedelics have been shown to be more likely to have positive experiences. Those low in openness or with rigid thinking styles are more likely to have challenging experiences.
Traits are hard to alter, so thinking about how to modify people’s states and moods can be an approach to encouraging good experiences and outcomes, Aday said. Making sure people aren’t confused, that they’re focused on their intentions, and have a safe environment to take the drug in.
“You can't control personality traits necessarily, but you can control the setting of the drug that is administered and the preparation that's done beforehand,” Aday said. People who take psychedelics in research trials also have thorough interviews where they’re asked questions about their physical and mental health history.
This is all somewhat intuitive. But a trait like "openness" is mushier than a definitive-seeming genetic result—which is why a test like HaluGen's will have market appeal. (Entheon wrote to Motherboard that, "The presence of genetic risk factors is not a guarantee of developing a mental illness and is just one of many factors that can impact someone’s mental health, which HaluGen clearly states.The test kit is meant to provide users with additional information to help them make informed decisions about potential treatment, but only within the context of the very important set, setting, and subjective psychological predictors and other conversations that should be taking place with a medical professional or genetic counsellor.")
But since tests like these rely on genetic jargon, its results could unduly influence people, according to Woo-kyoung Ahn, a psychology professor at Yale University. Part of Ahn’s research is exploring how people’s expectations of their symptoms are influenced when they learn about genetic predispositions.
In an experiment, Ahn and her colleagues gave people a fake saliva test, which they were told could detect genetic susceptibility to depression. People who were told that they tested positive on the test felt there wasn’t as much that could be done about their depression. “That is, genetic attributions make them feel that they have less control,” Ahn said.
Using the same saliva test framework, they measured people’s memory of their depression over the previous two weeks. People who were told they had elevated genetic risks for depression reported being more depressed.
Even those put into study groups that are told they aren’t genetically susceptible to a condition can experience negative consequences. People told that they weren’t genetically susceptible to obesity “felt more invincible; they discounted the significance of a healthy diet and regular exercise, and when presented with a menu for a hypothetical lunch, they were also more likely to select unhealthy food,” Ahn said. “We call this the genetic invincibility effect.”
While Entheon told Motherboard "We are fully transparent with the 55 peer-reviewed studies that we cite," and that "anyone that buys our psychedelics genetic test also has full access to these scientific references with our whitepaper and can review for themselves," that leaves it up to members of the public to interpret complicated genetic studies and apply them to their results.
When it comes to psychedelics, a sense of "invincibility" could have serious ramifications. Take the ketamine metabolism result: Nichols said that telling someone they’re a slow or fast metabolizer, and prompting them to modify their dose, might backfire if they’re metabolizing it through other routes. “This is a potentially dangerous product, not only misinformative,” Nichols said.
Many groups in the psychedelic field are working on optimizing the amount of a particular drug to give an individual, but it's not always intuitive. A recent study from Johns Hopkins University found that there was no significant difference in experience between groups that got psilocybin doses adjusted to their weight, for instance—despite this being common practice.
“There are people putting millions of dollars into trying to develop these kinds of tests and assays,” Nichols said. “I think this kind of product is really taking advantage, and almost predatory, of people who want this kind of information but don't understand how complex the question is that they're trying to answer.”
Telling a person that they have reduced, normal, or heightened sensitivity doesn’t guarantee they’ll avoid a challenging experience. “Some people might become overly confident or think they can take the drug in a more dangerous location or more uncertain setting,” Aday said. “They might make riskier decisions because they've been told ‘I’m going to be fine’ beforehand.”
In the future, there might be a more biological approach to customizing doses or predicting with more certainty the kinds of experiences people will have. "But even right now, I think that’s kind of a big leap to make," Aday said. "I wouldn’t spend my own money on this."

{1} The prior opinion of the court is withdrawn and the following is substituted. This case poses the question of whether Defendant Maria Garcia’s general consent to search a vehicle by responding “yes” to an officer’s inquiry to “look at” a compartment on the vehicle was broad enough to allow the police officers to drill a hole in the compartment, thereby damaging the property. We hold that her consent to a general search was not a consent to allow the officers to damage the property. We reverse Defendant’s conviction and order that the motion to suppress be granted.
Facts and Proceedings Below
{2} New Mexico State Police Officer Roper stopped Defendant for speeding in a 1990 minivan on the National Park Highway between White City, New Mexico and the Texas state line on December 4, 1996. United States Border Patrol Agent Kelly arrived to assist Officer Roper because Agent Kelly spoke Spanish. While on an earlier patrol that day, Agent Kelly had observed the minivan “going side to side and bouncing quite heavily.” In his experience, that type of bouncing and swaying would normally be caused by damaged suspension or carrying an unusually heavy object. During the stop, Agent Kelly looked through the window in the back of the minivan and did not see any heavy objects. So he stooped and checked the rear tire and frame. He noted fresh weld marks and welded metal underneath the frame, which, based upon his experience, was not consistent with a newer, normal minivan. Agent Kelly pointed out these marks to Officer Roper.
{3} Agent Kelly asked Defendant and her passenger for permission to search the vehicle. Both Defendant and the passenger consented. Defendant opened the rear of the minivan and Agent Kelly observed that the carpet and screws had been loosened. He also noted “a compartment inconsistency of six to eight inches.” Defendant gave further permission to remove the minivan from the side of the road to a nearby weigh station. After additional inspection, Agent Kelly observed that “the shock absorbers on the vehicle were canted more than normal.” He also crawled underneath the minivan and noted that when he tapped the underneath with a heavy flashlight, it sounded as “if you filled a can with sand and hit it,” as opposed to a normal hollow or echoing sound. Agent Kelly told Defendant that he and Officer Roper thought that there was a compartment in the vehicle that might contain contraband. Agent Kelly asked Defendant to follow the officers into town to a service station and Defendant agreed. He also asked about her knowledge of the compartment and Defendant responded that she knew nothing about it.
{4} Agent Kelly testified that at the service station he told Defendant that the officers were going to “look at” the compartment. The minivan was then placed on a lift. The officers inspected the compartment and could not figure a way to open the compartment without tearing the minivan up. The compartment was apparently welded completely shut. Agent Kelly testified that he had not seen a container that well-made before. The officers proceeded to use a quarter-inch drill bit to drill a hole into the *697container. When they did, a green leafy substance fell from the hole and the officers perceived a strong odor of marijuana. ■ The officers conducted a field test and obtained a positive result for marijuana. Defendant and her passenger were at the service station but outside the garage area, when the officers drilled the hole.
{5} When asked why the officers did not obtain a search warrant, Agent Kelly replied “I’ve never had one before, sir. Once they’ve given you permission to search, I’ve always searched until I found out what was in the compartment.” Following the discovery of the marijuana, Officer Roper obtained a search warrant citing four reasons: bouncing of the minivan, unusual compartment, unusual height of the rear seats, and discovery of marijuana from drilling into the compartment.
{6} Following a hearing, the district court issued an order denying Defendant’s motion to suppress, stating:
[I]t is clear to the Court that the Defendant understood and agreed to the search. Before the van was raised on the automotive rack, the Defendant was again asked for her consent, this time to search the compartment; the Defendant still cooperated with Agent Kelly and gave her consent. Given the circumstances of how the compartment had been made the Court finds that drilling into the compartment was not such an intrusion as to constitute an unreasonable search.
The district court further ruled that “the Search Warrant which was based upon information gathered from the consensual search was therefore also properly done.”
{7} At the subsequent trial, the jury convicted Defendant of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Defendant appeals her conviction, contending that drilling into the compartment without specific permission exceeded the scope of her consent. Defendant further contends that absent reasonable suspicion, Article II, Section 10 of the New Mexico Constitution requires a law enforcement officer to advise a detained motorist that she is free to go at the conclusion of the initial stop. We need only reach the first issue, as it is dispositive. Further, Defendant did not raise the second issue below, thus it is not properly before this Court. See Rule 12-216 NMRA1999.
Scope of Consent
{8} Voluntariness of a consent to search is a question of fact. See State v. Flores, 1996-NMCA-059, ¶ 20, 122 N.M. 84, 920 P.2d 1038. We review de novo, however, application of the law to the facts. See State v. Juarez, 120 N.M. 499, 502, 903 P.2d 241, 244 (Ct.App.1995). The facts are not in dispute that Defendant voluntarily consented three times to the search of her minivan. What is in dispute is the scope of that consent and whether such consent to search included consent to damage property.
{9} “The scope of the search is defined by and limited to the actual consent given.” Flores, 1996-NMCA-059, ¶ 22, 122 N.M. 84, 920 P.2d 1038. The scope of an individual’s consent is measured by an objective reasonableness standard, that is, what a reasonable person would have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect. See id. ¶ 23; see also Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991). If a search exceeds the scope of consent it is “not pursuant to a voluntary consent,” and is therefore invalid. State v. Valencia Olaya, 105 N.M. 690, 695, 736 P.2d 495, 500 (Ct.App.1987).
{10} Defendant argues that her consent was for the officers to look at the compartment, not drill a hole into and permanently damage the compartment. The State argues that while the officers may have used the words “look at” the compartment, a reasonable person, having consented to allowing the minivan to be taken to the service station to be looked at, and after already having consented to two other searches or “looks at” the compartment, would have impliedly understood “that the search would include looking into the compartment.”
{11} We acknowledge that courts have given broad scope to a consent to a general search of a vehicle for narcotics, interpreting the consent to include non-destructive dismantlement of parts of the vehicle, particularly when the defendant was present at the *698time and voiced no objection. For example, in Valencia Olaya we held that the scope of the consent included the use of a screwdriver to remove screws holding a loose vent cover in the door panel. See id. at 695, 736 P.2d at 500. Federal courts have similarly held that dismantling of property was within the scope of a general consent. See United States v. McRae, 81 F.3d 1528, 1537 (10th Cir.1996) (stating that consent to search trunk included allowing officer to lift crinkled carpet area, when the defendant was present but did not object during the search); United States v. Flores, 63 F.3d 1342, 1362 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that signed consent to search vehicle and its containers and contents included the unscrewing of two screws and the removal of two vent covers, when the defendant was present but did not object during the search); United States v.. Torres, 32 F.3d 225, 231-32 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that the oral and signed consent to search vehicle and its contents and containers included the removal of screws to gain access to wooden box, when the defendant was present but did not object during the search); United States v. Santurio, 29 F.3d 550, 552-53 (10th Cir.1994) (holding that consent to search interior of car included removal of screws from strips holding down carpeting); cf. United States v. Pena, 143 F.3d 1363, 1368 (10th Cir.1998) (holding that consent to search motel room reasonably included “search into the area above the bathroom ceiling”).
{12} However, when the search involves intentional damage to property, the courts require more certain evidence that the scope of the consent extended that far. “Although an individual consenting to a vehicle search should expect that search to be thorough, he need not anticipate that the search will involve the destruction of his vehicle, its parts or contents.” United States v. Strickland, 902 F.2d 937, 942 (11th Cir.1990). In Torres, while the Seventh Circuit upheld the removal of screws as within the scope of consent, it acknowledged that the scope of a general consent search does not include “the unnecessary infliction of damage.” Torres, 32 F.3d at 232. Likewise in Santurio, the Tenth Circuit noted that the removal of screws and strips of carpeting was within the scope of general consent to search because the officer did not “tear up” the vehicle. See Santurio, 29 F.3d at 553. But see United States v. Martel-Martines, 988 F.2d 855, 858 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that the defendant’s general consent included allowing officers to use a hammer and screwdriver to puncture sheet metal top of hidden compartment because the defendant stood and watched); United States v. Martinez, 949 F.2d 1117, 1120 (11th Cir.1992) (stating that general consent to search storage unit authorized officers to pry open and break trunk lock of car stored there because voluntary consent to search can be the same scope as pursuant to a valid warrant); United States v. Olivier-Becerril, 861 F.2d 424, 425 (5th Cir.1988) (upholding finding of voluntariness of consent at border checkpoint when agents pierced hole in floor of trunk; however, the court did not discuss scope of consent).
{13} As Professor LaFave notes, even with a general and unqualified consent, “the police do not have carte blanche to do whatever they please.” 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 8.1(c), at 612 (3d ed.1996). The scope of the consent “ ‘is constrained by the bounds of reasonableness: what a police officer could reasonably interpret the consent to encompass.’ ” Id. (quoting Strickland, 902 F.2d at 941).
{14} We agree with Defendant that the officers’ damage to the minivan was outside the scope of Defendant’s consent to a general search. In contrast to Martel-Martines, 988 F.2d 855, in which the Eighth Circuit upheld a search to the defendant’s vehicle as constitutional despite the damage police inflicted upon it because the defendant stood and watched and did not object, in the present case Defendant was outside the garage area of the service station when the officers drilled the hole. She did not imply consent by failing to object while the officers drilled the hole outside of her immediate range of view. See id. at 858 (“[Defendant’s] failure to object made it objectively reasonable for the officers to conclude that his general consent to search the truck included consent to access the compartment in a minimally intrusive manner.”).
*699{15} The State also equates drilling a hole in the compartment in this ease to the search of a paper bag as was allowed by the United States Supreme Court in Jimeno because “[a] reasonable person may be expected to know that narcotics are generally carried in some form of a container.” Jimeno, 500 U.S. at 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801. The State argues that the compartment had no legitimate usefulness; therefore, it must be for concealment of contraband because narcotics are generally hidden. However, the State fails to point out that Jimeno also concluded that while a paper bag could be searched, “[i]t is very likely unreasonable to think that a suspect, by consenting to the search of his trunk, has agreed to the breaking open of a locked briefcase within the trunk.” Id. at 251-52, 111 S.Ct. 1801.
{16} The State further contends that drilling a small hole into the compartment was the least intrusive search because it caused minimal damage to the compartment. But the test is not whether the officers, acted reasonably in the pursuit of crime. It is whether they reasonably interpreted the scope of the consent. In our view, Defendant’s consent to permit the officers to “look at” her vehicle could not reasonably be interpreted to encompass drilling into the vehicle.
Probable Cause
{17} The State, relying on Strickland, 902 F.2d at 942, further argues that the officers had probable cause to search the hidden compartment. The Eleventh Circuit in Strickland stated that while consent to search did not include slashing the spare tire to search its contents, “probable cause, coupled with the obvious exigency that the vehicle could disappear with the contraband if it was not searched immediately, made the warrantless search of the spare tire permissible.” Id. In State v. Gomez, 1997-NMSC-006, ¶ 39, 122 N.M. 777, 932 P.2d 1, our Supreme Court determined that Article II, Section 10 of the New Mexico Constitution requires that a warrantless search of an automobile be based upon probable cause and exigent circumstances. Probable cause is not enough to allow for a warrantless search. See Gomez, 1997-NMSC-006, ¶¶ 37-38, 122 N.M. 777, 932 P.2d 1. In the district court, however, the State did not argue that the search could be upheld on the basis of probable cause and exigent circumstances. We need not affirm on a ground not raised below, if it would be unfair to appellant to do so. See State v. Franks, 119 N.M. 174, 177, 889 P.2d 209, 212 (Ct.App.1994).
Conclusion
{18} Defendant’s consent did not encompass drilling into the minivan. We reverse Defendant’s conviction and remand for a new trial. We order that Defendant’s motion to suppress be granted.
{19} IT IS SO ORDERED.

Those are all of the songs about big booties that I can say off tops were my favorite coming up.
That horn at the beginning of rump shaker let you know it’s bout to go down and the small intro in the beginning of Bonita Applebum get you curious about how the rest of the song sounds. It’s a trip into the 90s. I low key wanted my name to be Bonita just because of that song lol. “Colle Park, Bubba Sparxxxx!” The first four shouts of booty in Ms. New Booty is guaranteed to get your ass shaking along with “Cash money records takin ova for the 99 and the 2000’s”. That beginning come on and every girl gotta stop, look at they friends, and arch that byke (back lol) real quick. Last but not least, Ms. Fat Booty. EASILY a classic, the story telling in rap and hip hop has always been my favorite rap style. I felt like Mos Def described me with the lines “ass so phat that you can see it from the front” because I’ve heard that a lot throughout the years. My favorite: “honey was so blazin, she was just… yo, she was like Jayne Kennedy, word is bond. To my mother man, she was THAT ill man”.
It’s 2005 and I’m in tenth grade now. I’m starting making small strides to finding myself. You know how people give you nicknames growin up? Well, when I was a kid, my nicknames were so innocent and modest. Brit Brit and Boobie were my favorite. But as I got older, I somehow adopted names that related to my body. For a long time I subconsciously went by “Britany with the big butt”. It was a name or phrase rather, that I somehow learned to answer to. Did I like it? I mean…I didn’t really dislike it. It came with the territory. Britany was such a common name that it just sort of came as a given. So I answered to it. How did people distinguish me from any other Britany, Britney, Brittany, Britani, regardless of the spelling I was always Britany with the big butt or as dudes would say, “Britany with the phat ass”. The phat ass part of the name always gave me a weird feeling. It was almost like there was a lack of respect for me and my body, I don’t think any dude ever thought of how that made me feel to be called that. I was never called that to my face which made it even more interesting. However, on a more positive note, the name also shed light on acceptance. As I mentioned before, I struggled with the uniqueness and the confidence to really own what I had. The nicknames kind of helped in a sense.
You know how when you were young, you found interest in people but it was mainly centered around looks. That was where a lot of my crushes came from, looks. Another crush of mine also came around in the midst of me finding myself and figuring out who I was and wanted to be. During this time I was pretty much over Romeo and the rumor that went around in 9th grade. I saw him around here and there but he was no longer my crush. I had eyes on someone new, someone who I always thought was real cool. Especially because he was always fly, he always looked tight in his polo and rugby shirts and cargo shorts. The thing about him was that he didn’t go to Largo too. MySpace was like the birth of social media for us besides Blackplanet. So I would go to his Myspace page often because I didn’t see him that much. Who is this guy you ask? I like to think of him as a El Niño or something. Because once we got older he got tatted up crazy and he resided in a city that best suited his cool lifestyle. I’m going to refer to him as Money Mitch cause Mitch was my favorite character in the classic movie Paid In Full. What that has to do with person I’m referring to? Nothing. Lol. Carrying on, in the movie, Mitch ALWAYS looked good; I loved him lol, (the actual character). One of the things that everybody spoke of in reference to Mitch was his smile. His smile was…just beautiful. Of course in reality I’m referring to a Mekhi Phipher as he played Mitch but whatever lol. It was the character that I loved. He didn’t play about his cleanliness, his family or his money. He meant business and it showed in his demeanor. Because of those things, I had a admiration for Money Mitch. He always had a nice smile as well. My like for Money Mitch was always somewhat mysterious because all I ever really knew about him was that he had a love for animals, especially dogs. So in return, anytime I got the chance to make conversation with him, we talked about dogs. Like I said, crushes at this age (15) was about looks. But I couldn’t like him that much because he always had a girlfriend, therefore I just let my crush for him simmer over the years. At this point in life, I’m still figuring out the flirting thing anyway. You may hear about him later in the blog but for now we’ll just keep it short and sweet. Money Mitch been around for years, so my crush had never really went away. He was always around he was someone who never went forgotten about. I’m still battling myself with the thought of my own insecurities so it never crossed my mind that Money Mitch would like me back. Same feeling I felt with Romeo, that basically if he did like me, I would know the reason why. It’s not to say that all boys actually felt this way but I couldn’t help but think it. Remember what daddy said is what I would tell myself, boys only think with the head in their pants, not the head on their shoulders. You’ll go through four years of high school and the boys won’t be as mature as you, you got titties, you got ass, you pretty, boys are gonna like you because of those reasons, that’s what mommy said. Need I reiterate that high school crushes and shit was just about looks. It was never easy believing things a boy said, yet I took the risk from time to time. I just wasn’t risky enough to have sex. It was never worth it in my opinion. It wasn’t until I was a little older that I heard Money Mitch even inquire about me, and I heard that he thought that I was beautiful. I always wondered if when a boy tells you later in life that he’s always liked you if it’s just game? Or is it the truth? Let them tell it, they just couldn’t say anything about liking you or the timing was off lol. Money Mitch certainly played a vital role in my life though. We’ll get back to him much later, but for now just remember the name. I met him before just right before another glow up, with no idea of what I became part of. How random things happen.lol
Prior to the gogos held at Largo, my brother and I was always familiar with the music. Our parents listened to Chuck Brown (who’s parents didn’t lol), RE (rare essence), Junkyard, Back, and Northeast Groovers just to name a few. Needless to say that gogo lives in us. Where some people stopped listening to gogo after a certain time, he and I couldn’t. It’s just part of who we are to hear it and feel it. It’s nothin like the sound of a crankin socket beat, you can’t help but nod your head or just simply move your body with your cup in your hand. Just two steppin and groovin. I started off going to the Neon. I remember one of my first times there, it was one of Largo’s homecomings after the principal got fired for stealing money. Ever since then they didn’t allow gogos to be held in our gym anymore. But the neon was love. I remember the first time I ever heard TOB. Their first cd was a straight 30 minute track. It cranked from beginning to end, non stop. And it’s crazy that CCB was coming out with Hennessy & Weed and Miss My Dawgs, we danced to those songs at house parties and now they’re defined as classics. Before the birth of the bounce beat, TCB alwaysss got me hype when I heard Chiggy album or any of the clapping songs. They played slower back then though. In the gogo was where I really claimed a name that allowed me to honor my body, the popularity around it allowed me to feel accepted and even loved.
One day my bestie Zindzi♥️ and I, were listening to Fatal Attraction in my mom’s living room. By this time, we were already going to different gogos and having it up crazy. To think that gogo was really life for us and I know that a lot of y’all can relate. We looked forward to it every weekend, our parents took turns dropping us off and picking us up. I even promoted some shows to get in for free. Anyways we were listening to one of their songs, I can’t quite remember and we heard the ending of a song that stuck out to us. PARTY Girl$. How we heard it, we don’t know but it was definitely not what they said lol. We took the name and ran with it though. Neal was in the up and coming XIB and they were the first to put us on. We went to school with like half of the band so we made one big family. I remember my 16th birthday like it was yesterday, they played at the VFW in forestville. Lo was the singer though and Cook was playing the guitar. Our lil squad was lit. Next thing you know me and Zin friends from school started bein wit it and we got known for partying. I’ll never forget going to the CFE one day for one of those 20/20 shows. Pay $20 and see $20 bands play, that meant we spent the entire day in the gogo man, those were the day parties for us. I was walking from the front of the club to the back and this dude came up to me. He was way taller than me, brown skin with a haircut. It was the first time I saw anybody with tattoos on their hands. He spoke with crazy energy. I don’t remember how the conversation went but he left with my number that night. Alias will be Marvin the Martian cause he was always off his astronaut shit. Marvin the Martian at the time, was part of a new band called Allstarz. This band in particular was made up of ppl from various bands hence the name. Marvin the Martian was always live. I remember before I met him or even knew who he was rather, he was in the neon with a freakin fur coat on.lol. It was rumored for a while that he and I was a couple but I didn’t want to claim that. I was smart enough to know, he was in a band and got a lot of attention. I remember my first time going to see him, it was like an adventure and Mama Sonya was with me. I took the train and bus to see him. I had just cut my hair into a razor cut and he hated it lol. But he still tried to do it to me that day. There were a lot of periods in my life where I was just naive. I don’t know why I was going to the Martian’s house that day. For real. I don’t know what I thought we was going to be doing. I wasn’t even chillen with boys. What I took from that experience was that sometimes it’s really not all about looks, at the end of the day, p**sy ain’t got no face. Niggas was on they shit man. “Money over bitches nigga stick to the script”, probably hitting everything walking. It’s crazy, I don’t know how we got close, we just somehow did. But because he and I were talking, it pretty much helped put Party Girls$ on the map. Plus, hanging with Marvin the Martian was fun. He was like spontaneous and me on the other hand, I was shy, just really getting out into the world. It was because of Marvin though, that I did meet and make new friends. The band grew to be like family to me. Now we (Party Girl$) started venturing out to different shows and we even had Yani Miami and Li$$a up in Gaithersburg puttin on. Sometimes we would split up and go two different shows in one day. I had declared Allstarz & XIB as “my bands” because they both showed us love and we showed them love back. We went to most if not all of their shows and always had fun.
Y’all already KNOW what time it is. Atl came out in March 2005. Somewhere in between the summer and in the midst of the Party Girl$ movement, I began to go by a name other than Britany and Britany with the phat ass. Still unwillingly, I was called this other name but this time around I was happy about it. My other Bestfriend LOVER🌻 gave me the name, a new identity. Anybody who knows me know exactly what I’m talking about. She got a big booty, so they call her big booty (
skirt | skirt) / That one line pretty much says it all. Once LOVER🌻 started calling me Big Booty Judy🍑, everybody caught onto it. EVERYBODY. It was like a sweet epidemic and I never felt any disrespect behind it. Everybody in school, outside of school and in the gogo was calling me Big Booty Judy🍑. Moms, dads, aunts, uncles, friends, cousins and who ever else started calling me Big Booty Judy🍑. Eventually it just became Judy for short. So I ran with it. I can’t lie, I loved the name, I loved what my friends and I stood for. We had a reputation for being cool, attractive and positive. And best of all, nobody had anything sexual to say about me. I was still a virgin and niggas knew not to try me. Ask anybody and they’ll tell you. Securing my reputation was very important to me. I was determined to keep a clean slate. We got so much love it was crazy. I’ll never forget when me and Zin was in her bedroom. A ringtone was randomly sent to her phone, it was Allstarz. The clip played one of the first times they recorded Reggaetone. And Marvin the Martin had got us out the way crazyyyy. Man me and Zin was so hype. I vaguely remember who started it but I do remember that was one of our first times hearing “Party Girl$ it’s your world”. That’s when we really knew shit was real. We made a name for ourselves and it stemmed from having fun. Tenth grade was really the start of how lit life started to be.
“My gear is in and I’m in the IN crowd, and all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin me now. My self-esteem went thru the roof man I got my swag, got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged” – Hov
I know exactly how Jay felt when he spit that line. I started coloring my hair and playing round with different looks. Next thing you know I’m a blonde with the short cut. Everybody said I resembled Keyshia Cole. I was feeling and looking good. But I didn’t overdo it with the confidence thing, staying humble was something I always remained. That was part of my reputation. I wanted people to say that I never changed. I still spoke to everybody at school, and in the gogos even if I didn’t know them. I started getting mad attention from boys. It did make a difference in what I thought of myself, I can’t pretend that it didn’t. The part that no one talks about though, is how people tend to date by status. You see, when you or someone else makes a name for you, the attraction goes beyond looks. People want to know you just because someone else may know you. They want to be able to say they know you in some sort of way. They want you to be in their pictures, just because. I’m not saying this in a way to sound arrogant, I’m speaking MY truth. This is what I experienced and it wasn’t bad. It was fun, I felt cool. I felt popular. I was hearing my name in songs and I’m really tellin dudes that my name is Judy too. Judy had respect behind it. I was much more accepting of it than Britany with the phat ass or with the big butt. Every time I met someone new they’d always say “now I see why everybody call you big booty Judy”.
I’m meeting all types of people and I got my first lil job at Coldstone Creamery. Money Mitch used to come up in the joint and get a free strawberry mango smoothie every time. Of course I looked out, I liked him duh lol. The exposure to various crowds at Coldstone was interesting too. One time a man walked in and starred at me. As mentioned in part II, older men see you, notice you, realize your young and still try their hand. I had some clear lip gloss on my lips, the one that comes from bath &a body works. My lips looked full as anybody who has seen me in person to see I got a pair of soup coolers on my face lol. The guy complimented me on them by saying they were sexy. I was maybe around 17. I felt that it was weird, I guess because I’m still learning how to take compliments but that was probably the first time someone referred to me or anything about me as sexy. I somehow went from being cute to sexy. With all of that being said, my attention was split so many ways at this period of my life, this was when I realized the importance of choosing and choosing wisely. I liked Money Mitch, I was cool wit Marvin the Martian too. Sure, there were other lil crushes here and there but nothing came from them. It was about looks. The ones I meant ion here, have somehow made a significant impact on my life. There may have been a few, but there’s always that one that you never forget. I would tell you who or what I’m talkin bout now but it wouldn’t be like me to just tell you and not leave you guessing. 👻

OK I know I should follow this link with a serious commentary on the state of local politics, but I’m sorry I can’t. Not sure which is better, his slogan of “free bananas for schoolchildren”, or the fact that Peter Mandelson was seen skulking about in the background as the monkey and his supporters celebrated.
I should point out that at least Mr.Drummond didn’t dress as the monkey for the election results, although that might’ve been even funnier.Alkyd vs Latex for Cabinets
Alkyd vs Latex for cabinets, which is better?
Alkyd paints have been around for decades. In the good old days they were oil based paints. It is rare to find an actual oil (linseed) based paint these days. Today Alkyd paints are usually synthetic resins not oil but they still share many of the qualities of the linseed based products.
The good side of Alkyds is that they bond well, dry very hard and block many stains. They are a durable finish for any project.
The bad side of Alkyds is that they become brittle and crack with time. They also tend to yellow. They dry very slow and have a strong odor.
Latex or water based products have been around for many years. The performance characteristics of latex paints increases yearly. When they first came out they weren’t so great. A lot of research goes into improving water based products every year. Latex paint passed up Alkyd paints in many benchmarks years ago.
The good side of Latex paints is that they bond very well. Dry to a flexible finish and have good durability. They don’t smell like solvent or oil based paints do and they dry fast. Easy water clean up.
The bad side of Latex paints is they can’t block stains like a oil or solvent based product. They tend to not be as durable as their oil based cousins and the finish is much softer then an oil.
Just as a lot of research is going into improving latex paints, there is much more research going into hybrid products. These paints combine the good qualities from both Latex and Alkyd products and this boosts their performance ten fold.
These are the water borne not water based products. Water borne products still contain solvents and synthetic resins. Examples of this are Benjamin Moore Advance which is a water borne Alkyd. Behr Urethane Alkyd which is also water borne. The technology going into this line of paints is increasing rapidly and the products are changing almost yearly.
Alkyd vs latex for cabinets ? The correct question may be Alkyd/Latex/or a hybrid coating for cabinets. We actually use a hybrid and are happy with the all the positive characteristics and the results speak for themselves.PORTLAND, Ore. — There are six new COVID-19 related deaths in Oregon, raising the state’s death toll to 2,466, the Oregon Health Authority reported today April 21, 2021.

The combination of music styles together with effective visuals developed by staging designer Mark Bromilow and his team and displayed on a huge hanging screen, provided an hypnotic, almost cinematic experience for the Powerhouse audience.
The first half of the concert featured Topology performing works by ensemble members Robert Davidson and John Babbage. Although at times the sound mix was quite strange, with the double bass and saxophone sometimes almost inaudible, the compositions effectively showcased Topology’s refined approach to minimalism. The ensemble creates performances that draw you in as the music slowly grows. Violinist Christa Powell’s tone was exquisite, her playing soaring over the ensemble.
Robert Davidson’s work for solo viola, Spiral, was performed with great intensity and musicality by Bernard Hoey. Throughout, the viola plays a short phrase which is then looped while the next phrase is played. The result is a deeply emotional, almost meditative piece that could easily send the listener into a trance. Previous hearings suggest this performance was at a much faster tempo and therefore perhaps not quite as effective, but the performance was brilliant.
The standout work in the first half was Robert Davidson’s McLibel, based on Britain’s longest-ever trial where fast food giant McDonald’s sued 2 activists. It featured Davidson’s established technique of mixing vocal samples and moulding them with instrumental lines. While the technique of playing with the rhythms of vocal samples is not new, it is the narrative quality of Davidson’s compositions that engage the audience. The performance was outstanding, the instrumental parts matching up with the vocal lines so well it was virtually impossible to dinstinguish between them.
The second half of the concert had Topology and Full Fathom 5 joining forces to perform tracks from the new album. Electronics and acoustic instruments seemingly melt into each other as if always meant to co-exist. Some inspired drumming by John Parker lifted the intensity of the entire ensemble, with the line between minimalism and pop music very blurred indeed.
How can composers who have grown up in the past few decades engulfed in the explosion of musical styles not be influenced by popular culture? It is encouraging to see Topology at the forefront of developing an intellectual and artistic approach to a post-classical music. Perhaps contemporary music in Australia does have a future with ensembles such as these creating a style that bridges the gap between contemporary chamber and pop music.

Excerpt 2
Sabella had barely returned to her wine when she heard the slight strumming of a guitar as someone settled in front of the microphone. She wasn’t certain what had prompted Kane to leave so abruptly, but she was definitely disappointed. Not that she was star-struck or anything. The
fact that she had dressed up to venture outside her hotel room, to the Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar, simply because she had heard that Kane Hartridge would possibly be trying out new material at their open mic night, did not mean she was star-struck. If anything, she was underwhelmed by his song choices tonight, and even more so by her awkward attempt at flirting. Men like Kane didn’t waste their attentions on women like her.
She took another sip of the perfectly nice Riesling and silently deliberated whether she would stay past draining her glass. This bar did have a certain, inexplicably innate, country charm that she wouldn’t mind exploring and observing further. After all, she had come to Nashville to learn what she could about the culture of country music.
As far as she could tell, the room around her was furnished with exactly the same style of unadorned, wooden furniture and boasted a similar smattering of booths around the perimeter as any other bar. Nothing about the décor particularly screamed “country.” No posters of country stars lined the walls, and if it weren’t for the distinct twang emanating from the patrons’ conversations and through the speakers, she could have been back home. If she could figure out what exactly made this bar so popular among the locals, the night wouldn’t have to be a complete waste. Plus, her flight the next day wasn’t until the afternoon, so she could afford to stay out awhile.
“Hey, guys,” Kane’s voice carried through the speaker system, quieting the room. Someone shut off the recorded music that had been playing ever since he had left the small stage, his performance intended as the finale of their open mic night. Sabella twisted on her barstool to face the stage. Kane and his guitar once again occupied the unadorned chair set behind the single microphone. His beer bottle rested just behind his leg. “Don’t mean to pull y’all away, but I have a friend in from out of town who is dyin’, she’s absolutely dyin’, to sing for you. Please join me
in welcomin’ Elle—over by the bar, there, in the purple, that’s Elle—welcomin’ her to the Fiddle an’ Steel stage.”
Most of the patrons shifted their attention toward the bar, trying to find Kane’s “friend.” Sabella froze, schooling her expression. I can take anything you throw at me, she had said. He was clearly testing her claim. What in the world had she been thinking?
“C’mon, Elle,” Kane called through the microphone. “Here’s your chance.” His mouth pulled into a half smile, intended to portray solicitous charm, no doubt, not the baiting nature of his challenge.
She took a deep breath, reminding herself she would likely never see any of these people again, and slid off the barstool. Apparently, her customarily rigid practicality had been dislodged the second he’d bumped into her. Not that he was giving her much choice.
The stage was closer than she would have preferred, but the walk over from the bar still gave Sabella plenty of time to admire Kane’s comfortable posture. He wore jeans and a faded, black, button-down shirt, with a few buttons left unfastened and rolled-up sleeves. With his brown hair cut raggedly to slightly above his ears in front, somewhat longer in back, and his stunning green eyes, he really was more handsome than any man had a right to be. Especially one who was trying to embarrass her in front of a bar full of people.
“What exactly do you have in mind?” she murmured as she took the short step onto the stage.
He covered the microphone. “Name a country duet.”
At least he wasn’t going to force her to sing alone. Still, she wasn’t exactly a country music savant. “The only one that comes to mind is ‘Picture.’” That wasn’t strictly speaking true,
but she was betting he would be even less thrilled with her choice if she had named one with Kelly Clarkson.
All Kane said was, “All right.” He shifted his chair so it wasn’t squarely facing the microphone then started to play an intro. “Not the newest song in the book, but a guilty pleasure for some of y’all, I’m sure,” he drawled, smiling at the crowd.
His voice captured her as he sang, its purity reminding her why his was the only country music to which she really listened. As she watched him, Sabella almost forgot he had manipulated her into joining him on stage—for a duet. She looked out over their somewhat captive audience, filled with men in worn-out jeans and flannel shirts—even a cowboy hat or two—and some amazingly beautiful women. Maybe this was actually a bizarre dream, and in reality she was sleeping in her hotel room, or even back home in her bed. If only.
When Kane finished the first chorus, he looked up at her in anticipation. Little crinkles appeared around his eyes. He didn’t think she would do it.
To be fair, normally she wouldn’t have. This is simply a more active form of research, she assured herself. Sticky sweat still gathered between her fingers and coated her palms. Sabella surreptitiously wiped her hands on her thighs and stepped marginally closer to the microphone.
She scrambled to remember the lyrics, staring at the floor as she sang. When no one booed by the end of the stanza, she risked a glance out at the room. About half of the tables had reverted to quiet conversation, but others appeared to be listening. At the end of her chorus, she looked over at Kane.
He was watching her, eyebrows drawn slightly together, as if he wasn’t altogether sure what he was seeing. Maybe he was shocked she was still singing, despite the blatant difference in their abilities. She had never been one for public displays of foolery, and the remaining shreds of
her rationality were appalled by the ridiculousness of her behavior. Running off the stage would be worse, though, or at the very least more memorable.
She finished their interchanging lines with her eyes on him. The last chord he strummed hung in the air until the murmuring of patrons’ conversations wiped it away. Sabella backed away from Kane and the microphone, then turned to step off the stage, and wove her way toward the hallway that led to the bar’s restrooms and a door with an “Employees Only” sign. She pressed her back to the wall for support and resolutely steadied her breathing. This night wasn’t turning out anything like she could have expected.
Excerpt 3. She hadn’t found it particularly interesting when she had explored the city during the day, but at night, with both the building and the fountains in front of it alight, not to mention Kane’s company and a few drinks in her, she changed her mind., remaining.Lots of children have an issue collaborating their aesthetic and also acoustic abilities from absence of technique as well as usage. A lot of them obtain charged of having ADHD. Payment figures in also. Children that have liquid in their ears when young will certainly find out to utilize their eyes rather since the various other sensory ability was enclosed and also unable to be utilized. Like all humans, those youngsters make up by relying on the solid ability, all the while enabling the weak one to maintain obtaining weak. The capacity to collaborate the abilities with each other basically goes away, developing disappointment and also appearing like ADHD or actions troubles. We are survival animals. If something does not function well, we will certainly locate something to offset it to go on. That can help a while, yet when the needs end up being better as well as the weak ability is needed, you see issues.
PREVIOUS VARIOUS TRAINING: A ten years old boy that remained in fifth quality. He would certainly leave his seat without asking approval to do what he wished to in the class. In spite of duplicated initiatives by the instructors to obtain him to remain in his seat, absolutely nothing functioned. The moms and dads pertained to me due to the fact that the inescapable ADHD medical diagnosis was bandied around and also the instructors were drawing tough for ADHD drug. I did 1 conference with the moms and dads to inquire about his background to identify what else could be taking place. Ends up he went to Montessori for all the years before this. Currently, while I enjoy the Montessori program as well as inform a great deal of individuals to go there, there is a large distinction in the means Montessori runs as well as the method the general public college runs. Public institution needs youngsters to rest and also passively take direction. Montessori desires the children to follow their very own impulses to discover what they want. This youngster invested all the years before Better animes online apk this educated to stand up when he required something of what he was discovering. The general public college was an entirely various method of doing points, yet the youngster was operating the past training. ADHD Medicine would certainly have been a big blunder right here as well as without my brief treatment, I think this would certainly have been a catastrophe for this kid.
ADHD is being identified at high degrees nowadays. What began in the 1970’s as well as 1980’s as being a problem that was seldom become aware of, ADHD has actually proceeded to a location where it’s difficult to discover a youngster that hasn’t had the tag added them or an effort made to do so. The percents are big! Authorities data from the United States National Institutes of Health And Wellness (NIH) and also the National Institute of Mental Wellness (NIMH) show that using attention deficit disorder (ADHD) drug has actually been expanding gradually throughout the USA. The variety of ADHD medical diagnoses has actually been enhancing progressively also.
A 12 years of age child that was being suggested for ADHD medications due to the fact that he can not listen in course, could not do his research on his very own, would certainly fail to remember points frequently, as well as needed to have consistent assistance. This kid had a difficult background. Because he was really young, he had recurring liquid in his ears as well as mini seizures that were not recognizable to an inexperienced individual. As she really did not desire even more medications, the mommy desired him to deal with me. The ear liquid had actually been clear for a long period of time when he pertained to me as well as he was currently on medications to manage his seizures, however his abilities had not boosted for many years. It is easy to recognize why. No person had actually ever before exercised the right abilities with him to capture him up. When we are children, we resemble sensory sponges absorbing whatever around us with our eyes, ears, touch etc. If those are obstructed by anything, those abilities never ever obtain exercised as well as require to be educated as well as caught up. We did that with this kid. When he had the ability to immediately collaborate his aesthetic, acoustic, great electric motor etc., he enhanced substantially. The mother was available in sobbing eventually due to the fact that she was impressed that he had in fact advised HER to clean his basketball attire. Typically she needed to advise him of every little thing. ADHD is not constantly the trouble as well as even more medicine is not constantly the response.
CONCEALED ALLERGIC REACTION: A 7 years of age lady that was doing okay with qualities in institution, yet having a truly difficult time resting still. She was shaking all day as well as likewise having a trouble bearing in mind points she listened to in course so she needed to re-learn it in the evening, making research truly lengthy and also awful. The institution had actually currently suggested that she ought to get on ADHD medicine. The moms and dads were definitely versus it. So the moms and dads employed me as their exclusive supporter to enter into the class to do a monitoring to see what was taking place. I quickly observed that she was damaging a great deal. She would just pick up a pair secs and after that discover elsewhere to scrape. When she was asked to address an inquiry, I discovered that she seemed like her nose was packed. I asked the educator if this prevailed for this kid, as well as she concurred it was, however claimed she had actually never ever actually considered it previously. I asked the moms and dads if it occurred in the house. They stated they had actually never ever seen it. I advised a journey to the Specialist that discovered hatreds be a problem, placed her on Claritin for the institution day, as well as voila-problem addressed. Immediate enhancement. Once more, ADHD medications would certainly have been a misdiagnosis as well as calamity.
NEGATIVE CLASS: A 6 years of age little young boy that was implicated of leaving his seat, creeping under his workdesk, not listening, sobbing, having habits troubles, and also not knowing what to do on assignments in the class. Once more, fast suggestion for ADHD medicine. Moms and dads employed me to do a monitoring. I viewed as the instructor gave instructions on the craft they were mosting likely to do. The instructions were likewise on the board and also the little kid was attempting to compose them down. Absolutely nothing uncommon to start with. When the educator provided the proceed for the youngsters to go obtain their materials to do the craft, the class emerged in a degree of task that frightened also me. Children running everywhere-some running in circles, getting hold of documents as well as scissors, a few of which were flying. Children running into each other as well as dropping. The sound degree was squashing. Where was my little topic? Weeping and also creeping under his workdesk, to create a safety obstacle around him from the mayhem in this terribly taken care of class. He was attempting to complete creating the instructions on the flooring while weeping. In my record, I advised that the instructor be reviewed for ADHD and also place on medications. Being a little bit ironical below, once again, a child that directly prevented mind and body changing chemicals based upon misunderstood signs.
Do they all actually have this problem though? After 25 years of seeing different descriptions of the signs and symptoms, I securely think the solution is no. I see the tag ADHD as a catchall tag for great deals of various signs that can be triggered by great deals of various other things.I have actually constantly really felt that drug has actually been distributed also quickly. Given that the medicines have adverse effects and also can alter body chemistry, I think every information must be considered prior to choosing to go that instructions.
Being a moms and dad train, Kid Psycho therapist and also specialist around, let me share a couple of instances of the children I have actually collaborated with that verified my uncertainties and also educated me exactly how great deals of signs can have various other descriptions. See if any one of these seem like children you recognize.Nairobi, KENYA: Children in the Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) centers in Nairobi County have something to smile about as they will be getting free milk twice a week, in a partnership program between Nairobi County government and Brookside Dairy Milk company.
Speaking while presiding over the program in Martin Luther Primary school in Makadara constituency, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said that the project will see delivery of a packet of milk twice a week to each of the 17,000 children in all public ECDE centers within Nairobi.
“More than 200 children have re-enrolled in school since September 7, when we began distributing the milk. This free milk project not only improves child nutrition and keeps hunger away; it also puts a smile on every child’s face,’’ said Sonko.
The Governor added that with the introduction of milk to schools, he expects the enrollment of children in ECDE centers to increase from the current 17,000 to about 23,000 children by December.
He pointed out that every ECDE centre will receive at least two more teachers before the end of the term once the county public service board completes the recruitment process.
The county boss further promised to build a modern ECDE center in every Ward in Nairobi.
“There are 10 Wards in Nairobi that do not have a single public primary school or ECDE centre. These are Utawala, Pipeline, Nyayo Highrise, Ngei, Ngando, Mabatini, Lucky Summer, Laini Saba, Kware and Imara Daima. My government is finalizing a proposal to develop a modern ECDE centre in every ward to end this marginalization,” he said.
Speaking in the event, Brookside Dairy Group Chief Operating Officer Faiz Taib said the School Milk Program reinforces the company’s commitment realization of the country’s national goals of education,” said Taib.
Also at the event was Nairobi County Education CEC Janet Ouko who said her office will ensure the program is successful by coordinating the distribution of the free milk to all the 229 public ECDE centers within Nairobi County.
Kenya Dairy Board CEO Margaret Kibogy who was also at the event, supported the program saying it will address the nutritional challenges facing children especially in Nairobi County.Digital Running Club » Articles » Vegan Protein Powders for Athletes
Vegan Protein Powders for Athletes
Most athletes have read and have been told by their trainers to consume protein, protein, and more protein throughout their day for muscle building and recovery. Our bodies need protein not only to build and help muscles regenerate but protein also plays an important role in the body’s metabolism, hormonal balance, and immune protection. This does not necessarily mean, though, that we need animal protein such as cheese, yogurt, turkey, chicken and fish at every meal!
While animal protein might provide us with short-term training benefits, eating a diet high in animal proteins has been linked to a greater incidence of high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and a whole other host of diseases. The distinguished Cornell professor Dr. T. Colin Campbell who wrote The China Study has even linked high consumption of animal protein with increasing our risk of cancer and claims that we can literally turn on and off our “cancer genes” by eating a diet consisting of fewer than 20% and as close to 5% of animal protein. Our bodies were literally not meant to eat animal proteins all throughout the day and at every meal.
So, what is an athlete to do? On one hand protein is especially important for our bodies while, on the other hand, too much can cause long-term disease. Whether you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, here is where the vegan protein powder comes into play! Vegan protein powders are an ideal source of supplemental protein in our diets and can greatly enhance your performance while not compromising your long-term health.
How much protein does my body need?
An average person who does not exercise much needs approximately 0.4 grams per pound of body weight per day while runners generally need between 0.5-.8 grams of protein per day per pound of body weight – depending on how much they are running. This would mean that a 150 pound runner would need approximately 75-105 grams of protein per day and a 125 pound runner would need approximately 62.5-100 grams.
Considering that a 3.5 oz chicken breast has 30 grams of protein and a cup of yogurt has approximately 14 grams, that is a lot of protein to fit into your diet! Protein powders help us runners increase our protein requirements so that we are adequately fueling our muscles.
What protein powders do you recommend?
My absolute favorite protein powder is Sun Warrior, and is derived from a sprouted brown rice protein. Sun warrior is a complete protein containing all essential amino acids as well as high amounts of anti-oxidants, tocopherols, tocotrienals and other essential nutrients such as thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, phosphorus, iron and potassium. 1 scoop of Sun Warrior Protein powder contains 80 calories, 16 grams of protein and 20% of the daily iron requirement. Sun Warrior comes in delicious vanilla, chocolate or plain flavors. Best yet – this protein powder is not filled with one single chemical or ingredient that you cannot pronounce – it is 100% nutritional goodness!
Hemp Protein Powder, derived from ground hemp seeds, is another one of my favorite vegan protein supplements. Not only does hemp contain all 8 essential amino acids, making it a complete protein, but hemp is also high in Omega 3’s, antioxidants, and fiber. There are many brands on the market, but I buy whole hemp seed, keep it in the fridge, and then just grind them myself for freshness. 4 tablespoons of hemp protein has approximately 130 calories, 11 grams of protein, and 10% of the daily requirement for iron.
Pea Protein Powder, derived from yellow peas, is another vegan protein powder that is high in protein. 2 tablespoons contains 70 calories and 15 grams of protein. I find that I do gravitate towards hemp or brown rice protein, but pea protein is still a good alternative. Again, there are many brands on the market but just make sure that you buy a “raw” pea protein and that there are no additives so that you get a superior and nutritionally sound product.
If one is good, then all must be better!!! Some of my favorite sports products are the Vega products by vegan athlete Brendan Brazier, the author of Thrive, that contain hemp, pea, brown rice and flax seed protein. One of my favorite Vega products is the Vega Whole Food Health Optimizer. This product has 26g of protein per serving, probiotics, Omega 3s, greens powder, and 100% daily requirements for vitamin A, C, D, E, K, B12, biotin, thiamin, rioboflavin, iron, zinc and a whole host of other nutrients. This product comes in chocolate, vanilla and a delicious chia. If you are traveling or rushed for time, this is an ideal product to add to your regimen. Another Vega product is the Vega Sports Performance Protein, which contains 20grams of protein per serving. (Read their protein powder brochure here.)
Vega Sports Performance Optimizer is their other product touted as a pre-workout energy drink. It contains ingredients thought to work synergistically to boost performance – coconut oil, kombucha, yerba mate, green tarhodiola, ginseng extract, devil’s claw extract, turmeric, brown rice syrup, sodium and potassium citrate and palm nectar. (This last product I have to admit I have not tried and this is not a product that contains protein but I do think that it is important to note.)
How do I use them?
There are many ways you can use vegan protein powders. The most obvious way is to add them to a pre- or post workout smoothie! I use Sun Warrior Protein Powder, Vega Whole Food Optimizer or hemp protein powder in my smoothies every morning and sometimes will even have a smoothie mid-afternoon after a particularly hard run. I also add the Sun Warrior (chocolate or vanilla) to my puddings or yogurts, and even add them to pancakes and waffles! A waffle is a great post workout snack, and I make ‘waffle sandwiches,” which you can read more about below.
When do I use them?
Ideally, I recommend that you start your day with a protein smoothie. Not only will you start you day feeling powered up and light, but you can also make enough for 2 servings and have some ready for an afternoon snack later in the day. Get creative, though, and add them to muffins, pancakes, cookies, yogurt, really anything! The powders are delicious and add even more flavor and my kids can’t even tell the difference when I add them to their pancakes! Below are a few of my favorite protein powder recipes:
Chocolate Green Smoothie
Ingredients:
- 2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or coconut water)
- 1 frozen banana
- Handful of fresh spinach (or 1 tbsp greens powder)
- 2 scoops of Sun Warrior or Vega Whole Food Optimizer chocolate powder
- Optional: frozen blueberries, strawberries, or raspberries
- Optional: 1 tbsp coconut butter
Directions:
Blend all in a blender until smooth and enjoy!
Waffle Sandwich
Ingredients:
- Arrowhead Mills Multi-Grain Pancake and Waffle Mix (or your favorite brand)
- Unsweetened almond milk
- Coconut butter or Earth Balance
- Sun Warrior or Vega vanilla protein powder
- Optional: unsweetened chocolate chips, bananas
Sandwich Filling Ideas:
- Almond Butter
- Raw honey
Directions:
Plug in your waffle iron to get it warmed up, and coat it with an olive oil spray if it’s not already coated. In a bowl, combine the pancake mix, almond milk, coconut butter or Earth Balance (substitute for butter or canola oil) as indicated on the package.
Stir in the protein powder. Determine the amount you need based on whether you make the entire bag of waffles to freeze or whether you make a smaller amount. Approximate 2 scoops per 4 waffles serving. For a more “decadent” waffle, add chocolate chips to the batter.
Cook according to your waffle iron instructions, approximately 3-5 minutes.
For a sandwich: Take 2 waffles and put almond butter in the middle. We also love to add raw honey for sweetness as well as to aid digestion and boost immunity. These “sandwiches” are portable and great for breakfast or for a post-workout snack!
Tip: Make larger quantities and store them in the freezer so that they are ready to go!
(Raw) Mixed Berry Pancakes
Ingredients:
- 1 cups almond pulp (or ground up almonds, walnuts, or any nut really)
- 1/2 cup ground flax
- 1/2 cup ground chia seeds
- 2 tbsp hemp powder
- 1 tbsp maca
- 1/2 avocado
- 1 tbsp coconut butter (optional)
- Splash of organic, alcohol-free vanilla extract (optional)
- Dash of cinnamon
- 2 tbsp agave nectar
- Almond milk (just enough to get mixture a good consistency)
- Topping: Blueberries, strawberries, kiwi or bananas
Directions:
Mix all of the ingredients in a cuisinart or blender. Stir in the berries or other fruit by hand. Shape into pancakes and place into dehydrator for 6-8 hours and turn them over and dehyrate for an additional 4-6 hours. If you do not have a dehydrator then you can cook the pancakes on low heat in an omelet pan on the stove. (Then they would not be raw.)

This makes a good contrast with A Portrait of my Father by Aleksandrov. Ivan Semyonovich Kulikov (1870-1945) was an almost-exact contemporary of Nikolai Bogadanov-Belsky, and shared his emphasis on the portrayal of peasant life (especially that of his native region of Murom in Vladimir Guberniya). In fact, next week, Mr Kulikov shall be my featured artist, as his work is such a varied depiction of peasant life.
Many Westerners are unaware of the Old Ritualists (staroobraztsy in Russian). In English, they are often called “Old Believers”. This is incorrect, as they only preserved old rituals, not ancient Orthodox beliefs. In fact, many lacked priests (the so-called bezpopovtsy, “priestless ones”) , and were, for all intents and purposes, Protestants with an Orthodox ritual.
This raises an important point for we Orthodox in America today. Many (not all) recent converts to the Faith are not Orthodox in spirit. They have the same relentless focus on the externals of church life as the Old Ritualists had. A Dutch nun recently remarked that it takes at least ten years for Orthodoxy to take true root in a Westerner’s soul. Therefore, most of the internet writing one sees on Orthodoxy is more grounded in Protestantism than in a churchly spirit. Many have been ordained far too early (especially ex-Anglican and Protestant clergy), or they have been encouraged to write when they have had nothing of substance to say. They are toddlers in soiled nappies attempting to lecture at the MDA!
Speaking of my own bent, I usually refuse to portray myself as a specialist on the Fathers or to put myself up as an expert on theology, for I am neither. I do know art, history, music, and lived Orthodoxy, so, I stick to that. In short, there is a basic humility in Orthodoxy missing in virtually all writing by converts in America today. In Russia, they have had much trouble with this in the context of the current revival there. Grounded clergy and laity intervene to save the Church from the juvenile wanderings of recent arrivals. This is called “young eldership”, and it is a DANGEROUS phenomenon.
Two Orthodox groups are particularly infected with it. The OCA is full of convert clergy jumped-up too quickly. Bishop Benjamin of the West is a prime example. He has refused to condemn the recent ordination to minor orders of a sexual offender by one of his colleagues, and he opposes an open investigation of the OCA scandal. I should note that Bishop Benjamin should have been guided by the actions of Vladyki Innokenty Vasiliev in Paris.
When the scandal around the schismatic Osborne arose, Vladyki Innokenty immediately held public meetings and had an open investigation (the report was issued some 100 days after the crisis broke). I say that Vladyki Innokenty was right, and Bishop Benjamin is wrong (utterly and completely). The scandal in England is now moot, and the few rebels (supported by the SVS faction in the OCA, by the way) have left the Church. The fact that Bishop Benjamin ostentatiously lives in a “homeless shelter” is just too false for words. He should show the obedience that St John Maksimovich gave his doctor!
However, the group most thoroughly infested with “young eldership” is the so-called Antiochian Archdiocese. The spirit behind virtually all writing emanating from this group is Anglican or Evangelical Protestant. The prime examples are Joseph Honeycutt, Frederica Matthewes-Green, and the entire Again lot. I agree completely and without reservation with the criticism of Professor Vigen Guroian that Ms Green is completely ungrounded, and I fear she is not alone. All good Orthodox Christians should avoid the writings of these people for I fear they are little but “Protestants with an ‘Eastern’ veneer”.
We have a choice. We may follow grounded Orthodox Christians such as Fr Vsevolod Chaplin, Deacon Andrei Kuraev, the recently-reposed Elder Ioann Krestiankin, Archimandrite Tikhon Shevkunov, Mother Varvara of Pyukhtitsa, Professor Osipov of the MDA, and countless others in the solid Russian church. Or, we can follow the recent arrivals from Protestantism. I do not believe that the choice is hard….50 3,500,000 Positive High 44.61%

But unlike creative writing, most academic essays at college diploma levels are exceptionally analytical: they strive to convince the reader of a specific perspective or a specific interpretation of a topic. This makes it significant for your essay’s writer to understand her or his audience well enough to know what information to include and how far to prevent irritating the reader with unnecessary arguments, personal pronouns or vague or irrelevant information. The essay’s purpose is to convince the reader that the thesis statement is correct, useful and reasonable. If you don’t do this properly, you will end up arguing with your viewers instead of persuading them.
One important facet of effective writing is making sure your audience completely comprehend what you’re saying, but this is not always as simple as it seems. Some students have difficulty following the particulars of what they are studying, particularly at university levels, so writing a more detailed and thorough essay requires some excess care. By way of example, if you’re writing an essay concerning the applications and benefits of a specific sort of mattress, you will want to first clarify what a superior mattress could be and the typical mattress is not quite as great as the one you’re discussing. Next you would love to go over the many different forms of mattresses available, specifically what each type offers as benefits and disadvantages. Finally, you’d like to argue your point contrary to the next individual’s using the exact same mattress, proving in your way that your mattress is best. This isn’t quite as simple as it sounds, however, and this first step can go a long way towards addressing the issues of your audience.
Another very important part of academic essay writing is developing and building a solid, persuasive instance. This involves a comprehensive explanation of the main thesis statement, rather supported with references and examples, as well as a second, weaker thesis statement that give more detail concerning the first thesis statement. Both of these principal statements have to be clearly expressed and discussed within the body of the essay. This ensures that all arguments made in support of this thesis are all based on strong academic details and study, rather than opinion or personal preference.
The final part of the essay is made up of listing of the main points you’re arguing and a conclusion. Where the thesis is concerned, you might wish to use another format than ordinary, relying upon your knowledge and expertise to write it. However, as normal, you must write a conclusion together with your reasons for supporting this and reveal where you have discussed each of the main points. You need to make certain that your decision is written in such a way as to buying essays online allow you to appeal to the reader.
Writing an essay can be quite difficult to work for almost any pupil, and even more so when you are job it as a class project. But with just a bit of assistance, you need to be able to develop the abilities necessary to compose an essay readily and in a organized way. Of course, when you find yourself at a loss and uncertain of where to begin, you can always start off by studying some fundamental measures on composing an essay. These will help you develop a basic understanding of what needs to be done to be able to correctly compose a quality essay.
In addition to the introduction paragraph, the rest of the essay should ideally comprise the body of your work. The introduction helps to direct your reader in your research and provides them with the first information that they want about you and your topic. Your introduction must go over both your reasons for writing the article as well as your opinion on this issue. After your introduction, your entire body of work could be discussed in the paragraphs which follow. In the end, a conclusion should be written to be able to wrap up your composition.- This event has passed.

28 of the Best Cheap Used Luxury Cars You Can Buy
Because you deserve to treat yourself (on a budget).
If you can afford the running costs or get a great warranty, these cars will be nicer than anything new at the same price. Here are some great used luxury cars to buy.
The Grand Wagoneer has recently become a bit of a collector's car, but prices haven't shot up wildly just yet. Higher-mileage examples can still be found for under $20,000.
The Cressida was one of Toyota's last rear-wheel drive sedans in America, aimed as a more luxurious option in its lineup. Nowadays, most of them have been turned into drift missiles with 2JZ swaps, but if you can find a clean one like this for sale, it remains a good buy.
If you're into the idea of long-distance grand touring cars, it's hard to beat the 928. It has four seats, a big V-8, and plenty of luggage space to take your stuff on a weekend-long jaunt to the nearest coast. Here's a clean one with a manual transmission you can buy now for $20,000.
Yes, it is possible to own a real, actual, running Rolls-Royce for under $20,000. Cars like this 1994 Silver Spur have depreciated to a mere fraction of original MSRP. But they're cheap for a reason—maintenance costs are the highest of any car on this list, meaning you can easily rack up a bill matching the entire price of the car in one visit to your local independent shop. Don't say we didn't warn you.
If you're willing to deal with some maintenance costs, the R129-generation Mercedes SL is a solid used-car buy. It's comfortable and incredibly stylish. Plus, the roof goes down! This one is clean, and up for sale right now for under $6000.
People often forget about the DB7, which means prices have dropped considerably since they first appeared in showrooms. This manual-transmission V-12 model can be yours for under $40,000.
While the rare, V-12-powered 850CSi regularly sells for over six figures, normal, early production 8-Series models can regularly be found for under $20,00o. This one on eBay is for sale right now. Just budget a lot for parts and maintenance.
The E-Class is one of Mercedes' most legendary and popular cars. Because Merc made so many, used examples depreciate fast. This E-Class Wagon can be yours right now for just under $8000.
If you want a V-12-powered grand touring car on the cheap, the Jaguar XJS is here to satisfy. It's certainly not perfect (one look at that complex engine bay will tell you that), but when it works, it's wonderful. This clean convertible model can be yours today.
The Phaeton's high price compared to the rest of the VW lineup meant it never sold well in the United States when new. It's a fantastic luxury car with an available W-12 engine hiding under an economy car badge. This W-12-powered model can be yours for just under $11,500.
If luxurious reliability on a budget is your goal, there's no better choice than the Lexus Ls400. Its bulletproof V-8 can go hundreds of thousands of miles without issue, while its boxy, understated looks will keep you flying under the radar. This one's for sale for $2700 right now.
You're always rolling the dice when buying a used Jaguar, but it might be worth it for an XK. Succeeded by the more sporty F-Type, the XK was a modern take on the classic Jaguar grand tourer, complete with a sweet 4.2-liter V-8. You might not be able to find an XKR for under budget, but there are plenty of convertibles to be had. This coupe is listed for $9500 right now.
Few cars offer the same combination of luxury and off-road capability as a Land Rover LR4. It's easily the best off-roader on this list, but it still has a beautiful, classically British interior. If you're willing to take a chance on British reliability, the LR4 is a lot of car for very little money. Here's one for sale right now for $13,500.
The Porsche Cayman (or its roadster sibling, the Boxster) might not have as many luxury appointments as the other cars on this list, but it's a true sports car. You'd be hard pressed to find something better handling for the money. Buy one before Porsche fans re-discover how great these Caymans are, and drive up prices. This one is up for sale on eBay now.
Can't be seen in any Porsche other than a 911? Well, we have good news. The Swiss Army Knife of cars can be found for under $20,000. You'll just have to settle for an early 2000s 996-generation model like this one.
The Audi A8 may not be quite as popular as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7-Series, but it's still a serious luxury car. It has a classic design that's aged well over the years, and the interior still looks great. The only bad news is that you're unlikely to find a W-12 version for cheap. This 2013 model is listed for $18,000 on eBay right now.
It seems like just yesterday that BMW redesigned the 7-Series to minimize the Bangle styling of the previous generation. But it was actually close to 10 years ago. As a result, you can get a used 7-Series for a steal. It won't have the new car's fancy touchpad key, but you'll still look awesome. This long-wheelbase model is for sale for about $16,000.
Cadillac's been building some great cars lately, but for whatever reason, people aren't really buying them. That means you can get some killer deals on new ones, but you can get even better deals on used ones. With a reasonable stack of cash, you can have your pick of almost any CTS you want. This 2016 model is $17,000 on eBay right now.
People laughed at the Equus when Hyundai first introduced it, but at the time, it represented a pretty serious luxury bargain. On the used market, it's even more of a steal. A loaded V-8 Equus can sometimes be had for way under budget. Here's an example on sale for $13,000.
Jaguar shocked the auto industry when it introduced the first-generation XF. The design was gorgeous and got even better looking when it was refreshed a few years later. Here's a newer V-6 supercharged model for $19,000.
If you're shopping for a cheap Range Rover, you better hope you can get a warranty. But assuming you can, you'll be the proud owner of what's possibly the most prestigious SUV you can buy. If you're particularly brave, you might even be able to afford a Range Rover Supercharged. Here's one with just over 100,000 miles you can own today.
Most of the cars on this list are going to be fairly expensive to maintain. Some are especially risky. But if you want decadent luxury combined with low running costs, you've got one option—the Lexus LS 460. Even if it's not as cutting-edge as an S-Class, the reliability alone makes it worth considering—just like the original. This one can be yours for $15,000.
If there's a luxury sedan out there that could be considered the opposite of the Lexus LS in every way, it's the Maserati Quattroporte. It looks amazing, sounds even better, and couldn't possibly be called reliable with a straight face. But the second you hear that exhaust note, you'll understand why people give used Quattroportes like this one a shot.
Much like the Porsche 911 defines the sports car, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class defines the flagship luxury sedan. You're going to have a hard time coming up with a nicer luxury car to spend your money on. You'll probably only be able to afford an S550 like this one, but if you have a thing for V-12s, older S600s are also in range.
Last alphabetically but certainly not least is the Volvo S80. It's not a particularly flashy choice, nor is it as prestigious as some of the other cars mentioned. But it's still comfortable, quiet, and plenty luxurious. With tons of safety features and the durability you expect from a big Volvo, you could do a lot worse with your money. This V-8 model is for sale on eBay right now.today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you by now you should've somehow realised what you got to do and all the roads we have to walk along are winding and all the lights that lead us there are blinding there are many things that I would like to say to you I don't know how cause maybe you're gonna be the one who saves me? and after all you're my wonderwall

Interplay of synthesis and mechanism in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis
Abstract: Asymmetric homogeneous catalysis forms one of the main planks of modern organic synthesis. It has developed rapidly and largely through the application of novel ligands, whose design is very much based on insight and intuition. At the same time, a better understanding of catalytic reaction mechanisms can contribute to further progress, since it can identify the intimate relationship between ligand structure and successful applications. The presentation will concentrate on the author's research with complexes of the late transition metals and include the search for superior methodologies in hydroboration, as well as ventures into the chemistry of reactive intermediates. The latter will be exemplified from work with rhodium and palladium catalysts. mean spirited ass.
Lol
Oh I think there is more of a concept than you are giving him credit for. You just prefer to not engage with his work.
The concept is an invitation into the subjective reality of humans who have committed monstrous acts. You may prefer to dismiss those humans as monsters, as beyond understanding. That precludes them ever being redeemed. That is a judgement you have made.
Many people believe it to be a useful exercise to contemplate the subjective reality of people who have committed monstrous acts so we can attempt to understand them and attempt to understand the continuum of ideation to act. Exploring the subjective reality of humans who feel themselves to be radically estranged.
Art is useful for this purpose, you should give it a try sometime.
Even if the show itself had a worthwhile concept, and assuming the goal is to sell this work, who the fuck would want a portrait of dylan roof?? The context of the exhibit doesn’t really stick with the art once it leaves the gallery; it’s just a giant portrait of an ugly terrorist with a bad haircut.
Seriously, who is the market for fine art renderings of human garbage??
@5 someone could buy it and invite the artist to observe as the new owner shit on the work and then burned it.
I say take up a gofundme.
Was it Kandinsky that exclaimed “At last it is finished?”
Bait, taken
Are they sofa sized?
The trolls on slog and this clown artist can eat a giant turd sandwich.
@5 "Seriously, who is the market for fine art renderings of human garbage??"
Hmmm… Verminazis, for one?
Highly-disturbed Wealthy* people?
The NRA?
*just say NO! to The Death Tax!
@3 si.
I wonder what his colleagues at BC Women and Children’s hospital would think of an esteemed “emergency pediatric physician” producing this? Patients (and colleagues) also often Google their doctors, so having this review attached to his name probably won’t look so great- especially to patients who are part of the 53.8% visible minority groups here in Vancouver (Statistics Canada, 2016). Troubling indeed.
Last time I looked, art didn't have to be sellable to qualify as art. There are many paintings down the years I wouldn't want to live with at all, but they are certainly art. Good art.
Oh, we've got plenty of local white supremacists who will buy a giant Dylann Roof. :( Greg Johnson and buds are probably already beating a path to his door.
If he's an interesting artist, this is a project about selling white supremacist paintings to white supremacists. Maybe it's a project where he chats them up at the sale and surreptitiously records their boner for Rooff. Maybe it's to smugly take their money and hand it to the NAACP's voting rights effort.
Or maybe it's just as slack-jawed unexamined as he tries to make it sound.
Maybe he meant to show portraits of hate. Hard to tell because he wasn't articulate in his answers. However, I don't think we should automatically assume ill intent because he is a white man. He's painting from photos of these people in the news, and not making them look more heroic or sympathetic, so he's not trying to glorify them. Yes, it's insenstive and inappropriate at this time, he clearly didn't think (or maybe doesn't care) about how POCs might feel. But I'm uncomfortable with saying artists shouldn't paint certain types of subjects because of the color of their skin; that's a slippery slope we should stay away from.
Why not a word from the colloborator on this show Li Turner? Apparently she is happy and excited to be sharing a show with this guy. Why don't we get to hear anything from her about that and about why?
For the record, I don't think this guy who painted these images is correct to have done so either so thoughtlessly or with the intention being ascribed to him (my guess is it's a mix of the two. Thanks systemic racism!) But, I do think it's important to hear from another artist who is so okay with the guy's work that she is willing to colloborate on a show with him.
So many knee-jerk reactions it’s hard to read some of these superficial comments. As an art reviewer, I’ve known this artist for 20 years and he does not have a mean bone in his body. His work is a sincere and deliberate effort to isolate and point to racial and religious conflict in our time. People might object to the timing of the exhibit, but he’s been quietly and thoughtfully developing these themes for years. Perhaps the portraits will be better understood in 50 years when they can be seen for their documentary value. It’s taken almost 30 years for people to begin to understand Richard Attila Lukac’s skinhead paintings as social commentary, and most still don’t.
I don't have any opinion about the quality of this work but I am super super cranky about the tone of this screed. This trend of the internet outrage machine spilling over into art galleries in recent years should disturb anyone who claims to be for freedom of speech. Intimidation, ignorant splenetic outrage, calls for censorship: this is all fringe right shit. Any so called liberal hopping on this band wagon, whether out of some desperate need to signal their social justice bonafides or what have you, should be embarrassed.
I think we're aiming in the wrong direction if we think going after art we don't like is going to slow down the Deplorables Crazytime Bus, but any white male artist who paints portraits of white nationalists and isn't prepared with very crisp answers to the inevitable shit storm is either breathtakingly naive or disengenuous.
As a POC, I think this work is important. When you take the subject out of the context, it actually makes them more abjectly horrible. I find it speaking truth to power.
You're fine to dislike it but disliking it and damning the artist for doing it are very different things and you're leaning too much into the second. You can't take from one hand and dig with the other. These things already exist, making paintings of them is one guy's thing - so prefer the work or don't. Getting mad at an artist making subjective work of something that would exist either way is a great way to spin your wheels and get paid by the word.
Thank God we're finally attacking the artists. They get such a free pass in this city compared to tech workers.
"There seems to be a cavernous divide between the established profitable galleries, such as the [sic] Greg Kucera (who came out in support of the show via an email, claims Haughton) and the POC/queer/community based arts spaces which prioritize social justice and the expressions of the marginalized."
Did you call Kucera to check that fact? (cf Journalism)
Also, there's a reason galleries like his are profitable: they don't beat you over the head with social justice. If I wanted to live in a haze of polemic, forget art; I'd just play recordings of Sawant, Oliver and O'Brien and listen to that all day long. But I don't. Sometimes I want to look at an artist's portrayal of flowers or the sea or a naked lady or a horse. And sometimes I want to see Sacco and Vanzetti laid out in their coffins or one of Kehinde Wiley's powerful black faces. Some AM and FM. Those one-band galleries are a drag.
The critic has written a self-applauding, up on the soap box, knee-jerk critique of this artist's show. Funny to see this from a critic who also writes in another story about Chuck Close and Seattle U: "As a staunch opponent of censorship, I took issue with the initial removal and find the rehanging to be a validation of the universities original intentions–public relations overshadowing discourse."
You can't have it both ways. You can't be against censorship and then come down so hard on David Haughton's presentation of this work and his right to do so without a denouncing statement. The paintings are their own denouncement of the figures in them and I think it's good solid painting. It both presents and transgresses this imagery the artist finds worthy of investigating. Distasteful though the figures might be, they are nonetheless a part of this country's current discourse. It is the artist's right and, often, their privilege to go where others fear to tread.
Artists also often sidestep issues of content in their work. That's their prerogative. The color of his skin shouldn't preclude him from using this imagery. Haughton and Gallery 110 has thoughtfully responded to critics of this work despite his initial lack of didactic eloquence. Good for him. But no artist needs to have a manifesto every time they make a body of work. Look at images by Gary Winogrand, Diane Arbus, George Grosz and recently Sue Coe, Kara Walker, David Wojnarovicz, Leon Golub, Andres Serrano, Eric Fischl, and very recently Childish Gambino. They all have worked with images that may disturb some and they were sometimes pilloried for having done so. But history bears them out. This is the imagery and content we need to pay attention to right now in America. This is America.
We ask privileged people to do the work within their groups. He's trying to do his part by acknowledging and exploring the criminal/murderous element within his group using art. He is doing the shit work that needs to be done. I hope he takes the feedback he's receiving seriously and not personally, because he really does need to develop a stronger statement. It would better serve his work and his audience wouldn't be left guessing if he's glorifying these guys.
Oh please! I am so tired of censors and racists - which in this case i am defining as those who use a person's whiteness as a criticism of an individual's right to engage in discourse without being hit over the head with his obvious color as a criticism and mode of discrediting him. I don't know the art but respect the artist's right to make it. And I am a tad bemused at the responses, which in part, by being evocative, renders it more valuable as is common to good art. One must not be required to pass muster with the thought police, or to have an articulate answer to their work. Critics can trash it if they wish, but they must not destroy it - though the Muslim fundamentalists did this in Afghanistan and other groups have done this over time, to the loss of the world.
In our own city the excellent ceramic artist Charles Kraaft had his work taken off display in museums when his neo-nazi affiliation came out. As a Jew, I have very mixed feelings about this but lean against this act. Years ago I was in Brooklyn during the infamous show with "Piss Christ" on display by Andrew Serrano. Many including then mayor Rudy Giuliani were vocally enraged, thus ensuring the show's success.
Consider watching this video by Jon Haidt at Duke on the way in which we are censoring rather than engaging in open conversation in the university environment:
The tone of the article fits right in.
critique of art written by art critic being called “censorship” by critic’s critics
the internet never disappoints
@27 I don't know, would you call a reactionary and thinly veiled racist paroxysm of outrage about athletes kneeling for the national anthem a 'critique'. Because this is just about the equivalent, except coming from the other end of the political spectrum.
@28 if people are just expressing their distaste for the protest or questioning their motives then it's a critique and analogous
if people are saying players should be fired or punished then it could be considered a call for censorship esp if it's coming from the president - this is not analogous
HTH
There is no way to paint such work without it being highly politicized and conveying a privileged and aggressive message.”
Up to politicized, agree. Privileged and aggressive is a projection by the reviewer.
“severe fear and trauma, not experienced by the "angry white man" but rather, their victims”
The reviewer is again projecting her reactions on the works. The portraits are ‘mug shots’ – the perpetrators are in custody. Think about that – they will answer for their crimes. The works composed of groups of angry white men are just that – impotent portraits of ineffectual rage
It is obvious to anyone who views this exhibit along with quotations included that the content is not arbitrary, though the particular images may be.
Moral outrage and righteous indignation are potent and addictive emotions. This work depicts these emotions. It need not provoke them.
I value art that stimulates introspection and dialogue. From my perspective this particular show has done that for me and is fine art.CBD edibles from CBD American Shaman of Fogelsville Fogelsville, are a delicious way to reap the benefits of CBD_0<<

RSL's playoff hopes take hit with 1-0 loss to Chicago
Robert Beric's goal near the end of the first half proved to be the only score of the evening as the host Chicago Fire imperiled Real Salt Lake's playoff chances with a 1-0 win on Saturday night.
Playing its final home match of the regular season, the Fire (9-16-7, 34 points) extended its unbeaten streak to three, while RSL (12-12-6, 42 points) lost for the eighth time in its last nine matches on the road.
The defeat left RSL in eighth place in the Western Conference, a point behind Vancouver for the seventh and final playoff spot with just four matches left in the regular season.
Chicago controlled the offensive pace for much of the first half, with three of its 11 shots on goal, including a Beric shot that was saved by RSL netminder David Ochoa in the 38th minute.
However, Beric made the most of his next opportunity when his shot on the right corner found its way past Ochoa to give the Fire a 1-0 lead in the 45th minute. It was his eighth goal of the season and third in his last two matches.
The goal was assisted by midfielder Miguel Angel Navarro, his second of the season.
RSL, held without a shot on goal in the first half, made its best effort in the 71st minute when Albert Rusnak's shot from the center was stopped by Fire netminder Gabriel Slonina.
Anderson Julio's bid at an equalizer in the 76th minute sailed to the right.
Real Salt Lake's last chance at tying the match came when Justin Meram's shot was denied in the 88th minute. Chicago spent much of the remainder of the match -- which included five minutes of extra time -- on the offensive as RSL's desperate attempts to get the ball out of its zone proved unsuccessful.

From September 1 to October 4, Christian communities will come together in prayer and action to promote the preservation of Mother Earth, according to World Council of Churches. With the theme “A Home for All? Renewing the Oikos of God,” this year’s Season of Creation begins and ends on dates linked with Eastern and Western traditions of Christianity. September 1st was declared as a day of prayer for creation for the Orthodox in 1989 by the late Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I while October 4th is the Feast of St. Assisi, the patron saint of ecology.
We have to ensure a just home for all creatures for life on our planet to thrive. —Rev. Dr. Chad Rimmer, Chair of the Ecumenical Season of Creation Steering Committee
In a joint statement from Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, Council of European Bishops’ Conferences (CCEE) President and Rev Christian Krieger Conference of European Churches (CEC) President, they defined Oikos as ‘home.’ “Renewing God’s Oikos, the common home we share, is a concept that unites the whole human family in the quest for integral and sustainable development with shared fairness,” the statement read.
Further, the statement said, “Faced with the question: “A home for all?” our response must be woven into goodwill and concrete commitment to the renewal of God’s Oikos every day. If we know how to practice justice and speak truth from our hearts, and we do not harm our neighbor, we will then be worthy to “abide in His tent” (Ps 15:1), and His “Oikos” will truly be a home for all.”
The theme is based on Psalms 24:1, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.” Christians are urged to be proactive in combating the current climate crisis that destroys the homes of millions of species, not only of animals, but humans as well. According to World Wide Fund for Nature, climate change is the biggest environmental challenge humans is facing today since it is happening too fast that many species find difficult to adapt.
“Oikos is a Greek word for the Earth community,” explained Rev. Dr. Chad Rimmer, Chair of the Ecumenical Season of Creation Steering Committee. “It is an invitation to be united in the human vocation to reshape just and sustainable political, social and economic systems that respect the life-giving ecological limits of the Earth.”
Rimmer, the Lutheran World Federation Program Executive for Lutheran Theology and Practice, reminded Christians that, “We have to ensure a just home for all creatures for life on our planet to thrive. That requires ecological, economic, and technological solutions that are rooted in a faithful vision of justice for the dignity of every creature.” He hopes that this year’s Season of Creation will strengthen Christian communities’ will to preserve and protect the environment.
Since 2003, major Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, and Anglican organizations have come together to pray and act on major environmental problems facing the world.Estoy Stoned Lip Balm (a la carte)

Such emails astound you, stick with you, and may leave you speechless, rolling your eyes, or rolling around laughing. An incredible email from a college student makes you want to turn to your colleague and say, “Can you believe a student just sent me this?!” The creators, who have seen some incredible emails while working in the increasingly digital world of academe, decided it would be a rewarding project to host a forum for college faculty to share these “knock your socks off” emails. This site is where you can now share those emails.
Emails from college students can be funny, jaw-dropping, confusing, insensitive, unnecessary, inspiring, uplifting- the list goes on. Email is a form of personal expression, slightly more involved than the text message, and much less involved than a signed, sealed, and certified letter. Email is a vital tool for faculty-student communications, yet is often treated with casual disregard. This leads to the creation of some pretty memorable emails, especially when a paper is late, a class is missed, or a student needs a last-minute favor to avoid that failing grade!
Perhaps you have received an incredible email from one of your college students that you would like to submit!

Since 1995 excavations on tomb 184 on the southern slope of Khokha Hill has been carried out by a Hungarian group led by Egyptologist, Zoltán Imre Fábián. There stood the tomb and mortuary temple of Governor Nefermenu, erected in the late 19th Dynasty, probably following the reign of Ramesses II. The archeologists' efforts have been directed at comparing the so-called 'Khokha-tombs', including that of Djehutymes (TT32) excavated by László Kákosy et al., that of Tyai, Merneptah's Royal Scribe (TT23), the tomb of Nebsumenu, who also comes from a governor's family (TT183), the rock chamber and tomb of Ipi, the 'Overseer of the Royal Cattle' (TT264), and tomb 370, whose owner has not been clearly identified yet
Carved into the cliffs within a stone's throw from each other, the above monuments contain motives that show remarkable similarity in their architecture, ornaments a well as structure. Opening from a colonnaded forecourt, these rock-cut cultic places have a traditional T-shaped ground plan and three chambers. Its decoration resembles those of the 'Khokha-tombs': painted reliefs showing a significantly clear and settled style are laid in clearly separated horizontal picture straps. Their typical elements are reliefs and hierogliphics depicting scenes and images of Chapter 145 of the 'Book of the Dead' and the 'Opening of the Mouth' ceremony as well as scenes where offering is made to the dead man. The double false doors and the tomb-owner's half-statues prove that the tomb served as a cultic place as well. The ornaments show passage to the other-world, the motifs of which are arranged in a way so that the series of pictures and inscriptions purposely lead towards the inner part of the mortuary temple.
Unlike previous burial chambers, the niche carved in the main axis of the inner sanctum does not contain any representations of the owner or his family. The statues depict Osiris and other gods, which proves that the mortuary temple served as a holy place following the Amarna period. The owner and his family were pictured in free-standing statues, just like the two groups of statues of Djehutymes found there.
The decorations of several 'Khokha-tombs' including that of Governor Nefermenu indicate an affection for god Sokaris, which presents a new topic to study for historians of religion.
In the 'Khokha-tombs', to the left-i.e. to the south in accordance with cultic orientation-of the the third chamber, the sanctuary, derives a 1.1-1.2 m (3.5-4 feet) wide sloping or winding passageway of a man's height which leads to the burial chamber containing the granite sarcophaguses. The archaeologists managed to identify the inner sanctum and the passage in Governor Nefermenu's rock-tomb though it had partly fallen in or been walled up before an older one (TT 241) located higher up on the hill originating from the 18th Dynasty, where previous research suspected an independent tomb. It was not until 1998 that excavations could start in in the passage blocked up by debris, where the sooty walls show that the passage having a separate entrance was used as human dwelling during the years following the rockslide. The artifacts discovered under the debris such as coffin and papyrus fragments also suggest that following the first burial, the chamber and the passage were used as a burial ground but it was ravaged and raided later and the granite sarcophagus and the wooden coffins were broken and the mummies cut up.
New research seems to indicate that besides the rock temple and the rock-cut burial chamber, a pyramid-shaped structure of stone or adobe was erected a bit higher on the hill, which also belonged to the monuments of the nobility of the period. Its chamber was decorated with paintings connected to the cult. The painted plaster fragments found in the excavation of Nefermenu's Rock Temple could be its remains. The ruins of such a pyramid were excavated in 2001, which-though no written evidence was found-may have belonged to Governor Nefermenu's Rock Temple.
Governor Nefermenu, who had his burial chamber built in the vicinity of the oldest known tombs of the necropolis, next to the tombs of governors of the Old Kingdom, held several offices during his career. The inscriptions mostly mention his title 'Royal Scribe', which refers to his qualifications and 'Governor of the Southern City (i.e. Thebes)', which was his highest rank. The inscriptions also reveal that in his career he was closely attached to god Amon's estates, where he held various economic positions, including the 'Keeper of Amon's granaries' and 'Chief Steward of Amon's exstates'. He also had important high ranks in the state hierarchy. His title 'Chief Tax Collector of Two Countries' Lords' probably indicate that he had led valuable plundering campaigns. He also had the title 'Chief Steward of Silver and Gold House', which means he was in charge of the state treasury and controlled finaces. Like other Theban governors of the New Kingdom, Nefermenu kept under his control one of the most important sanctuaries on the west bank: he was the 'Chief Steward in Pharaoh Amenhotep I's mortuary temple'. Besides these titles, he often mentioned that he had led the ceremonial processions of Theban Gods.

There’s a new Ruffles flavor coming to Kroger shelves near you, and it’s basically a chip and dip in one. The Chili Cheese Ruffles are proving that you can have your dip and eat it, too!
The news was shared by Instagram junk food account @markie_devo, and since then, we have been eagerly keeping our eyes out for this new flavor. It’s a Kroger exclusive, so if you want to try this flavor, you’ll have to check out local Kroger stores (find your location here).
But junk food maven @markie_devo suggests it may be possible to find these Ruffles at Walmart, too, so if you don’t live near a Kroger-associated grocery store, you could possibly find it at Wally World.
And no, your memory isn’t playing tricks on you. Ruffles rolled out a chili cheese flavor about 10 years ago. But the limited-time flavor was only a blip in our beloved chip index — until now.
Of course, the new flavor is being compared to another Frito-Lay offering, Chili Cheese Fritos, but the Ruffles version will be a potato-forward twist on the flavor, rather than corn-based.
Whatever the brand, it’s undeniable that chili cheese is one of the best chip flavors of all time. Cheetos even got into the chili-cheese game a while back, offering up the delicious Cheetos Fantastix Chili Cheese to satisfy our need for cheese and chili-flavored heat all at once. And hot dog champions Nathan’s Famous Chili Cheese Crunchy Crinkle Fries brought the chili-cheese snack game to a whole other level of perfection.
Looking for a way to bring some of this Ruffles goodness into your Thanksgiving feast? We love this unique dip recipe for a pumpkin-shaped cheese ball. This particular recipe calls for crushed-up Doritos, but we think the Chili Cheese Ruffles would be even more scoop-worthy.
And for those who are watching their carb count, keto-friendly Whisps has a Hot & Spicy Cheese Crisps flavor that may satisfy your need for spicy junk food.
Are you excited to seek out the new Chili Cheese Ruffles?

Starting at the front, the grille, positioned slightly lower, features a new look with polygons at the intersections of the horizontal and vertical bars. While LED headlights come as standard, new Matrix LED units now feature on top-spec Vorsprung variants.
To the side, the revised SQ2 features aluminum-look mirror housings, sill inserts, a roof edge spoiler, and gray C-pillars. As for the rear, the bumper has been given faux air vents with pentagonal polygon design. LED lights also feature, with those scrolling dynamic rear indicators in highest spec.
Inside, sports seats now boast electrically adjustable lumbar support (woohoo), while a rear-view camera is now standard. Vorsprung trim brings heated front seats, a panoramic sunroof, Bang & Olufsen audio, and wireless phone charging.
The 2.0-liter turbo engine doesn’t get an upgrade, still producing 296hp and 400Nm of torque, enough for 0-100kph in 4.9sec. But while there’s no more power than before, the safety tech is boosted with the addition of adaptive cruise assist, bringing a glimpse of autonomy when you’re on a long highway slog.
Prices kick off at £38,700 (P2.48 million). Tempted?

Reviews
There are no reviews yet.Henry James formerly said,” it is difficult to speak adequately or rightly of London. It is not a pleasant place; it is not agreeable, cheerful, or easy or exempt from reproach. It is merely elegant .”- its first year, we braved nearly three and a half months of lockdown in London. So I know that having to go through it again will be really difficult and challenging for countless parties. Being stuck inside in a city not known for its infinite will be so hard in a city so full of life. But London and Londoners will survive.
As someone who left a piece of her nature in London, here’s a little love letter, in the hope that it will help people appreciate the amazing city that is London!
Dear London,
It’s been really over a month since I left your beaches, but I miss you every single date. What a relationship we’ve had! The two years we had together merely flew by, and before I knew it, it was time to say goodbye. I wasn’t ready. For the first time in a long time, I felt physically psychological and sad about leaving.
How is it that you’ve constructed me feel like this in such a short time? It’s incredible the impact a place can have on the heart.
From second-guessing to creating memorable instants
When I decided to move to London, a lot of people in New Zealand questioned me. Why? My friends wished to know why I was leaving a beautiful country and a well-paying job to go to London?
Everyone I spoke to mentioned the grey-haired, rainy days, the crowds, and the traffic , none in a delightful channel. Most parties didn’t get it.
But there was just something about you that pulled me apart halfway across the world despite all the negative things parties said. Looking back now, I am so glad I engaged you and decided to leave Christchurch to be in London. Two year ago, a dream came genuine for me. I imply it in the most genuine, sincere channel possible.
You’re big-hearted, staggering, and expensive. You’re heaving with audiences, but you can still make one feel lonely, even at the best of seasons. But you’re likewise very comforting and friendly and welcoming. It’s a intimacy I’ve grown to love.
You welcomed me with open arms, hugged me as an expat, and added me with opportunities and experiences I never meditated possible. Thank you.
In awe
People love to complain about the Tube, the pollution, the homelessness. I get it; I’ve done it too. Sometimes it does get a bit too much, and it genuinely sucks. But more frequently than not, I’ve learnt myself in awe of the amazing, crazy, beautiful municipality that you are. The grizzly area is part of the character; it’s what determines you, you.
You truly do furnish something to everyone, whether they’re with you for a short visit or they’re around to make a living.
All things Underground
Speaking of the Tube, my goodness, where do I begin !?
Yes, it is stuffy. It is packed with parties like sardines in a can, but no one can argue that it is one of the best things about living in London. Name a better public transport system; I dare you. There is so much to love about the iconic Tube.
From its legacy and growth, the tube map, the roundel, the individuality of tube terminals( from the Sherlock tiles in Baker Street to the artwork of Tottenham Court Road ), the frequency of learns, the tube etiquette( I could write a whole section about this itself ), there is so much! Then there’s that moment of joy when you no longer need to refer to the map to figure out which row to take. Success!
You previously know how to get from Shoreditch to Hammersmith. I had that moment very. That’s when I knew I was a local, and I belonged here. I was home, and it felt huge!
I love you for the incredible museums that help find a home in you. What other municipals in the world offer the collection taverns.
I love that each bar has a story and history behind it and that they all thrive in one place together! And what about the legend of Sunday roasts? When my sister asked me what I wanted my last-place snack to be before I left you, I knew it had to be a good old traditional Sunday roast at a neighbourhood pub.
I have never seen a Yorkshire pudding this good, in all regions of the world!
This fetches me to food- a lot of people advised me that good meat is hard to come by in London even though it’s a melting pot of cultures. In my humble ruling, they couldn’t be further from the truth.
You have allowed me to eat some of the nicest food I’ve ever feed. Affordable Michelin star restaurants serving the best of the UK produce, the fresh, handmade pasta at Padella( if you guys haven’t been, start THE MINUTE it is safe to do so, again !), the hummus at your umpteen Middle-Eastern diners, and all the incredible street food at the countless food markets; Borough, Brick Lane, Portobello, to list a few cases- there is so much good food here that I have come back to NZ a few kilos heavier!
And what about the myriad of coffeehouses and bookshops that are bustling with fervent patrons.
Much like every tavern has some record behind it, I found that every coffee that is spewed in your quaint coffeehouses has a story behind it: every bookshop, its own charm. I want, merely look at Word on the Water- a bookshop on a canal barge give a beautiful smorgasbord of classic and contemporary myth and non-fiction works.
I love you because of your adoration for play, mode, artwork, and design. You’re home to the home of cricket and the eventual in tennis. Do I it is necessary even mention football?
I’ve cherished going to the pub and going amongst it during video games of rugby or cricket; I’ve enjoyed screaming until I lost my voice watching the Champions League Final in 2019, just as much as I’ve enjoyed soaking in the history and chivalry that accompanies video games of measure cricket at Lord’s Cricket Ground.
A life of distinguishes
In you, I noticed different sorts of bewilder contrasts.
The streets around Westminster where Big Ben and Westminster Abbey proudly stand are full of history. But only across the Thames, there’s likewise modernity to be found in The Shard. Fitzrovia’s streets are placid, with lots of quaint local bakeries and coffeehouses opposing with the bustle and fus of Borough Market. I’ve sauntered past the nicest homes and flashiest cars in St John’s Wood just as I’ve seen clues of skirmish and homelessness near King’s Cross.
This is just a small glimpse into why I love you. You give opposes to co-exist. In London, you cause beings, homes, and things to be who they are without judgment. Here beings write their own fibs no matter where they’ve come from, how much they earn, what one of the purposes of you they choose to live in.
I have to admit our relationship did have a bit of a rutted start even though I adore London now.
Sometimes, experiencing a home in you is hard work – you don’t make it easy. Your overwhelming nature can be suffocating. Even with millions of people around you, you can make one feel lonely. I felt the same for a while until you let me to get into a chore, and that’s when I fell in love. That’s when I regarded you for being the strong, staunch metropoli that has stood the test of epoch across centuries.
True adoration
London, I fell in love with you for being unabashedly yourself. A lieu where one can find comfort in the promise of flood every other day, one can find the gala intent under the dazzling Christmas angels on Regent Street, one can find certainty in your changing seasons, and sometimes one can find oneself…in awe, magnetized in a army of people in the middle of Piccadilly Circus.
I love London.
Thank you for being you.
What city have you inspected/ lived in that stole your center? What are your favorite things about traveling, extremely, are living below metropolis other than those you were brought up in? Spill!

Egyptian Rebirth II<<It has been a long tradition in the entertainment industry to release film related information on the birthday of people who are in it. Sushanth is something of a star in Telugu industry or enough for his birthday to be celebrated in some capacity by fans and hence the first look of his film is revealed. One can assume how lazy and scriptless this film must be which has nothing in the poster but the actor sitting like kids in college do in their Facebook profile pictures. Absolutely no substantial information regarding the film is conveyed by the poster instead of begging people to know that Sushanth has done such a favor on everybody to be in it.
He is just sitting on the bench in the most mondaying style and similar things can happen to the film on the box office. What could possibly be the purpose of a poster that reveals no information about the film because the actor announcement can be made with a press release. Film is expected to release sometime in later half of 2018 but makers failed to generate any excitement regarding this project or maybe they have already given up to even try.
Even the worst films in the history of cinema have made some effort to bring in whatever hype they can to the theaters and eventually wait for the results to become a calamity to them but this one goes beyond that. Makers did not even try to tell the basic theme or tonality of the film instead gave Sushanth a profile picture to use on some social media account of his by the name of a film poster. He has got a tennis racket lying next to him but it does not seem at all if he has played game or even going to by his extremely gel-ed hair look.Arbinger Infographics

When Disney announced pricing for its new Space 220 restaurant, a richly themed dining experience set in a space station overlooking panoramic projections of Earth, social media let the House of Mouse have it. Who would pay $55 for a two-course lunch or $79 for a three-course dinner inside a theme park?
We now have the answer. Disney made Space 220 reservations available on Monday morning and within minutes, the first 60 days of availability were sold out. Given the limited daily capacity of Space 220 and the unique nature of the experience (complete with a theatrical pre-show liftoff), Disney apparently left money on the table here. It could've easily charged $75 for lunch and $99 for dinner, if not more, and still filled up.
Theme park fans aren't going to like it, but Disney World prices are going to be heading higher. Shareholders won't mind as much, of course.
►Your source for Travel news: Get our latest coverage delivered to your inbox
Prices are out of this world
Space 220 isn't even the big-ticket space-themed experience that really stoked fires for Disney World fans this summer. Last month, Disney announced that Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, the new "Star Wars"-fashioned lodging experience, will set a party of two back at least $4,809 plus tax for a two-night stay when it opens next year.
"This is the way" (as they say on "The Mandalorian") is probably echoed in Disney executive meetings when it comes to pricing decisions. It's not just on sci-fi experiences, either, where the pricing gun seems to be going out of control.
Right now at the resort's flagship Magic Kingdom theme park, a Halloween after-hours event is selling for a lot more than it did two years ago. The new family-friendly soiree is shorter in terms of hours than before. It also lacks some of the features of the 2019 incarnation. Disney is charging as much as 47% more than it did two years ago, and every night has been sold out for weeks.
► You must be this thin to ride: The 'walk of shame' some theme park visitors dread
Disney World annual passes were reintroduced for new customers earlier this month. They also come at stiffer price points than before. Some of the features the passes used to include (like access to expedited queues and digital photo downloads) are now premium-priced add-ons.
None of this should come as a surprise. The House of Mouse has been telegraphing these moves since last year. The new Disney math involves fewer guests (something that should enhance the experience for all visitors) paying more per capita. Disney's theme parks division surprised investors by returning to profitability in its latest quarter, and now it's fine-tuning the segment to be a high-margin product.
The initial response – from customers, not those complaining on social media – has been encouraging. Folks are having no problem paying as much as $199 for the Disney After Hours Boo Bash. They're not flinching at $79 for a three-course dinner at Epcot. Even the "Star Wars" cruise-like hotel experience is going to sell briskly at its roughly $5,000 price point.
Skeptics will argue that the premiums won't last once the novelty wears thin.

Internal Number: 264<<The incarceration rate for juvenile offenders hit its lowest point ever since the U.S. began tracking the statistic in 1997, according to The Washington Post.
Juvenile incarceration and general crime has fallen steadily in the U.S, since 1997, with today’s juveniles offenders being sentenced to prison at less than half the 1997 rate. Roughly 1 in 400 juvenile offenders were incarcerated in 1997, but only 1 in 1,000 were incarcerated in 2015. The fall comes in the wake of steady drops in youth arrests and crimes, but some argue even fewer juveniles should be going to prison.
“We know that keeping youth out of high risk environments helps keep them out of the system in the long run, strengthens communities, and saves taxpayer dollars,” Jasmine Heiss, a director at the Coalition for Public Safety told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “But our work is far from over. Even as numbers have fallen, racial disparities in the juvenile system have widened, despite the fact that there is little difference in crime rates between black, white, and latino kids.”
Sentencing reform proved to be one of the few widely bipartisan issues under the Obama administration, and state governments have continued pushing softer sentencing under President Donald Trump.
States across the political spectrum and the country have adopted justice reforms in 2017. In May, the Republican-controlled Louisiana House passed a massive 10-bill criminal justice reform package to decrease the state’s prison population by 10 percent over the next decade.
In June, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a bail reform measure in Illinois to get more people out of jails, and GOP Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill to reduce Oklahoma’s recidivism rate by matching restitution payments to an inmate’s ability to pay.
Until recently, federal sentencing reforms had faltered due to the appointment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but Senate Republicans and Democrats have begun working together again on the issue. Sens. Kamala Harris and Rand Paul pushed a bail reform bill together in September, and both left and right-wing caucuses are pushing soft sentencing reforms this week..Multiple Locations

Lapsang Souchong is a tea everyone should know about. It's a type of tea known as Bohea, similiar to Oolong, which has been smoked over pinewood fires and smells like a firecracker when you hold it to the nose. The flavor is surprisingly smooth, with a strong hint of the smokiness coming out at the very end. This is a wonderfully deep and succulent tea, shockingly unique, and prize addition to any tea collection.Summary
Regulation and control of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has always been a complicated subject. There is a broad spectrum of opinions on the subject ranging from complete governmental control and oversight, to a completely self-regulated sector. This subject is currently of even more relevance in Pakistan because of the consistent attempts by the government to exert greater control over NGOs in the past few years. The most recent of these attempts is the introduction of a new policy for regulation of International Non-governmental Organizations (INGOs) put forth by the Ministry of Interior (MOI) in October 2015.
Prior to the introduction of this policy, the regulation of INGOs came under the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) of the Ministry of Finance and was done through the “Policy for Regulation of Organizations Receiving Foreign Contributions”. Introduced in November 2013, this was considered the prevailing INGO policy in the country. This EAD policy has been replaced by the current policy, which states that it “will have sole jurisdiction over all types of International Non-governmental organizations (INGOs)…”. It is important to note that currently there are no uniform law governing non-profit organizations – whether national or international.
There are issues of rights, responsibilities and transparency on funding that the INGO policy aims to regulate. We have identified and aim to explore ways to bridge the following gaps:
The impetus behind the introduction of the current INGO policy primarily
relates to national security considerations. A series of incidents involving foreign funded NGOs (such as Save the Children) raised concern about the risk posed by such organizations as potential security hazards. The government claimed that there was no proper oversight of the non-profit sector and many non-profits were being misused for anti-state activities. Among several groups, there is considerable skepticism about the validity of these concerns; resultantly the policy formed is a knee jerk reaction and suffers from serious handicaps. Both national and International NGO’s are showing reluctance in compliance and the government is besieged to enforce the INGO policy.
Both the current INGO policy as well as the previous EAD one were introduced and administered by the federal government (MOI and Ministry of Finance). In a post 18th amendment context, this raises concerns about the role of the provincial governmental departments, particularly the Social Welfare Department (SWD) that is meant to be responsible for the registration and regulation of the NGO sector as a whole. Both the EAD and MOI remain involved in administering the policy. For example, organizations are required to submit their annual budgets and plans of action to the MOI as well as the Economic Affairs Division at the time of getting approval and thereafter annually. There is no role and space given to the SWD, which is a key provincial department dealing with the NGOs. Given that a large number of INGOs and their local partners operate at the district level, this is particularly problematic because it leads to a
large disconnect between the policy and those most directly affected by it. This also adds to the uncertainty and lack of transparency around the implementation of the policy.
Ostensibly, the policy is expected to monitor and evaluate the activities of INGOs and local NGOs receiving foreign funding. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the target of the policy have mostly been rights based NGOs, particularly those working on advocacy and the promotion of rights of women and minorities.
This roundtable therefore intends to bring together representatives of NGOs working in Punjab to discuss these issues and share their experiences – both in terms of the implementation of this policy as well as interacting with the Social Welfare department through the course of their activities. It will address the broad question of the regulation of NGOs as well as more specific concerns raised above. In that spirit it will invite participants to present their suggestions towards making the INGO Policy transparent, effective and more tolerable for the NGO community; so that it improves the trust level between the government and the NGOs.

Unfortunately there is not much information yet released, especially no photos yet of the police uniform for the 2013 RoboCop production. Peter Weller, who we learned this year will be featured in the next Star Trek movie, originally dawned the steel armor of the downed cop who, like the Bionic Man, was rebuilt to fight the forces of evil in the U.S. The original costume is instantly recognizable, but early word from production is that we will see a very different police armor uniform for the new RoboCop.
Although it is not quite as cool as the original RoboCop, I am a fan of the Iowa State Patrol uniform worn by the officer hunting down a young James T. Kirk in the future Riverside, Iowa in Star Trek 2009:
I’m still not sure if that was a good protective outfit for a human cop, or whether that android face mask reflects an actual android, or this was meant to be a cyborg creation. Either way, it’s a pretty good outfit.
Years ago Academy Award winners Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock showed us the prim and proper cops of the future city of San Angeles, where we learned “In the future, all restaurants are Taco Bell.”
My fellow Trekkies will recognize those belts being re-used in the Mirror Universe of the Enterprise TV series by evil Captain Archer & Co. These guys looked believable. But no armor!
And this year’s coming remake of Total Recall features another slick looking future cop:
Note that the new Total Recall takes no obvious design queues from Paul Verhoeven’s original Total Recall. So it should be no surprise if the new RoboCop takes no design queues from Verhoeven’s RoboCop. Verhoeven’s RoboCop was inspired by the future cop from the comic book 2000 A.D., Judge Dredd, and Verhoeven’s RoboCop has been interpreted as a retelling of sorts of the original Judge Dredd story because of several common themes, and, of course, the mask. Although the Sylvester Stallone future cop in Judge Dredd didn’t adhere totally to the original story, he did have a mask, but his uniform was a bit strange:
Future cops are definitely “in” these days. Karl Urban (Bones in Star Trek 2009, Eomer in Lord of the Rings, Xena, Bourne Supremacy, Chronicles of Riddick) will be starring in a new version of Judge Dredd, that Urban says comes more from the course material, titled Dredd and expected to be released in September 2012.
Far less interesting are the precrime future cop uniforms from Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report, based on Philip K. Dick’s short story of the same name:
For the new RoboCop, José Padilha is slated to direct a screenplay by Nick Schenk and Joshua Zetumer. Thirty-three year old actor Joel Kinnaman has been tapped for the lead role as Murphy/RoboCop. Of the creative trio, Schenk is the best known for his sceenplay for Clint Eastwood’s (awesome) film, Gran Torino. Kinnaman had a small role in last year’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and as Stephen Holder in the TV series, The Killing.
Here is the the marketing blurb for the new film: “In a crime-ridden city, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg with submerged memories haunting him.”
Padilha and Kinnaman have disclosed thus far that the new RoboCop will be a very different film than the original, with a costume where you can see the RoboCop’s eyes, and they’d said that the focus of the new story will be the period from Murphy getting shot to becoming RoboCop, as opposed to an action film where RoboCop serves as a futuristic officer. So this seems a bit like the path of Martin Caidin’s original Bionic Man story as told in his novel Cyborg.
My favorite scene, and the one I hope they do include in some way, is the scene where the non-cyborg RoboCop before Weller’s is revealed to be flawed and destroys one of the executives in the board room at the big reveal.
The current release date is scheduled for August 9, 2013.

Launch 1.1. Nucleic Acidity Aptamers and Their Selection Procedure Nucleic acidity aptamers are brief DNA or RNA substances (oligonucleotides, ONs), or related analogues, in a position to bind with high affinity and specificity an array of goals including steel ions, organic dyes, nucleotides, proteins, peptides, enzymes, protein, whole 293762-45-5 manufacture cells as well as entire organisms, such as for example viruses or bacterias, thanks to their particular three-dimensional folding (Amount 1) [1]. They are able to form various supplementary buildings (e.g., stems, loops, bulges, pseudoknots, G-quadruplexes and kissing 293762-45-5 manufacture hairpins) [2], which can provide rise to exclusive three-dimensional architectures in a position to particularly recognize their goals by exploiting a number of interactionssuch simply because hydrophobic and electrostatic connections, hydrogen bonding, truck der Waals pushes and – stackingas well simply because shape complementarity. Open up in another window Amount 1 Schematic representation of feasible goals of oligonucleotide aptamers and matching examples. Aptamers are usually discovered through a technique known as Organized Progression of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), an in vitro iterative procedure that allows the choice, from libraries of 1015C1016 different oligonucleotide sequences, of high affinity ligands for the selected chemical substance or biological focus on [3]. The aptamers attained by SELEX display dissociation constants (Kd) to the focuses on in the micromolar to femtomolar range. The SELEX strategy essentially includes four methods: (i) the binding treatment, where an ON collection, comprising a 20/60 nucleotide arbitrary series flanked by set primer regions in the 5- and 3- ends, is definitely incubated with the prospective molecule under described experimental circumstances (e.g., particular collection/target percentage, buffer, ionic power, pH, temp, or incubation period); (ii) the parting from the target-bound aptamers from unbound ONs (partitioning); (iii) the elution from the bound sequences from the prospective (recovery); (iv) the amplification from the enriched pool of chosen aptamers prior to the successive selection circular (Number 2). The ON libraries to evolve aptamers can be acquired using chemical substance synthesis, genomic DNA [4] or transcriptomic resources [5] and may contain organic 293762-45-5 manufacture or revised nucleotides [6,7,8,9]. The usage of revised nucleotides can raise the chemical substance and enzymatic balance of aptamers, aswell as enhance their binding affinity and specificity. The revised monomers could be inserted following the SELEX treatment (post-SELEX adjustments) or, better, contained in the preliminary ON collection, because of the option of manufactured mutant polymerases in a position to understand also nucleotide analogues [10,11,12]. Open up in another window Number 2 Schematic representation from the Organized Progression of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) procedure steps; on the proper, available partitioning strategies are shown. After incubation from the ON collection with the chosen target, the parting of destined from unbound sequences could be understood by both heterogeneous strategies (purification, affinity chromatography, or magnetic bead-based parting), or by homogeneous partition methods, such as for example kinetic capillary electrophoresis methodologies (Amount 2, correct) [13,14]. Then your destined aptamers are eluted from the mark and amplified by PCR (DNA SELEX) or invert transcription accompanied by PCR (RNA SELEX) to provide 293762-45-5 manufacture an enriched pool of chosen ONs (Amount 2), also if, in some instances, amplification isn’t strictly required [15]. After many selection rounds, cloning right into a plasmid and sequencing Foxo1 are performed to recognize high affinity aptamers. A substantial improvement in the SELEX method has been attained with the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with bioinformatic evaluation of the developing aptamer populations, allowing the id of structural motifs that could be critical.Casa Don Loco – Tamarindo

Arrow Season 4 stole a bit of spotlight from Comic-Con 2015 in introducing Oliver’s flashy new threads, but The Flash Season 2 better lives up to that description with an upgrade of his own. Barry Allen is rocking some classic white lightning for his Season 2 costume, but what might it mean for the speedy CW series?
The CW released our first look at The Flash’s Season 2 costume, which more closely follows the comics with a white background behind the lightning bolt logo, as opposed to the first season’s red. Future Barry was also seen to adopt a much redder hue overall with the white logo, while Cisco himself drew a bit of timey-wimey inspiration from a future glimpse of Flash’s 2024 threads.
That said, the Barry Allen we’ve seen on set for Season 2 is still rocking the red logo look, leading us to wonder what inspires Grant Gustin’s central hero to (eventually) make the change. As tends to be the case with these costume releases, Warner Bros. may simply have intended to head off photographers from snapping less flattering looks at the new costume on set., former WWE wrestler Edge’s Atom Smasher, celebrate becoming “The Man Who Saved Central City” with some new duds, or is something deeper at play here?

Online gambling is any kind of gambling conducted via the web. This includes casinos, online poker and online sports betting among numerous others. The first online gambling destination open to the public, was electronic ticketing for the prestigious Liechtenstein International Poker Tournament in 1994. Ever since then, online gambling has gone through immense growth and expansion.
Nowadays, there are a great number of things that make gambling an extremely lucrative business, in fact it is one that is also quite legal in the usa. The primary article mentioned in this writing discusses online gambling in the light of the law, as well as some of the main issues surrounding gambling. This short article could be freely reprinted or distributed in its entirety in virtually any ezine, newsletter, blog or the main article in this write-up that requires a brief look at the history of online gambling, and specifically at one of the more prominent examples of such, because the World Wide Web’s first legal online gambling room. Specifically, we’ll take a look at the world’s first online casinos, as well as some details surrounding how they had become. The internet gambling industry is an extremely complex one. However, the basic elements are fairly simple.
Gambling is a activity that is around for centuries. For instance, European law recognizes a “hare” to be an agreement between two different people where each person includes a right to purchase a specific thing, usually gambling. Exactly the same is true of online gambling. To clarify, let’s have a look at some citation needed here. Gambling is defined by law because the wagering of funds between people in place of conventional gambling. This is then becomes a little bit more complicated if you include casino gambling, although there is not much difference in this is between the two terms.
When European lawyers translated the law into English, it literally meant that men (and sometimes women) will make bets or engage in gambling without being viewed as guilty of a crime. This is actually a major step of progress in the expansion of internet gambling in america. This was especially important due to the often-nightly raids that police in New Jersey and elsewhere conducted in an effort to prevent gambling from occurring on the internet in the US. It had been the implementation of this law that allowed the formation of licensed internet gambling casinos in the state of New Jersey.
So, now we arrived at what was probably the most important part of the story: the birth of the New Jersey Gaming Commission. This board of oversight was responsible for passing the gaming laws that authorized online gambling in hawaii of New Jersey. In short, this commission was created in order to regulate and limit the amount of gambling activity that took place online. The New Jersey Gaming Commission operates today beneath the leadership of the Attorney General of New Jersey, John M. Corvirci.
What happens when you operate a small business in a country where that country has generated a legal system for online gambling? For example, if you wanted to open an online casino in Germany, you’ll first have to get permission from the German government to take action. This is something that goes through an extended and complicated process. Interestingly enough, just lately, an appeals court in the united kingdom ruled that exactly the same principle should also connect with activities linked to online gambling in the united kingdom. As of right now, the UK government is trying to get the European Commission to overruling the EC’s ruling that would allow online gambling in the united kingdom.
In the final analysis, there are many of things to consider when you’re considering online gambling. First, there is the issue of whether a business in a fresh jurisdiction can practice the business enterprise that it’s been operating in its home jurisdiction with some amount of success. For example, if an American company wanted to open a casino in Spain, which it had been legally allowed to do, the Second Amendment to the US Constitution would prevent American officials from enforcing regulations against it. Second, there is a huge problem of international law, and what happens whenever a country’s laws conflict with another country’s laws. The primary article with this issue begins by letting you know the way the US government feels concerning this issue. You’ll also find an article that provides a brief history on the history of the ban on online gambling in Germany.czobce.info

The carrier claimed the changes will provide easy access to all flight information when customers require help the most.
It has also introduced a ‘Day of Travel’ assistant on its Ryanair app, which will feature live videos and webcasts during major disruptions, updates on new departure times or re-routings and live information on airport, terminal, flight and gate information.
Ryanair, which carries 225 million passengers a year, also promised to improve access to boarding passes and other travel documents.
The changes are part of a digital self-service hub, where passengers can resolve problems using “improved chat, FAQs, and new self-help videos” with customers able to track updates on claims and issues with customer service.
A customer advisory panel, which will meet twice a year, has also been formed to provide “recommendations for future customer-led initiatives”.
Ryanair’s director of marketing Dara Brady said: “We are pleased to launch these innovative customer improvements which will enhance the travel experience of our guests..
"Our new Day of Travel Assistant will make travel easier and hassle free with live updates on departure times, terminals and specific gate info for boarding. In the small number of cases where we suffer disruption, customers will receive regular updates including live video and webcasts from our Ops Centre.
"In rare cases of cancellations, customers who request a refund will now get confirmation and access to it within 24 hours in myRyanair and will be refunded to the original form of payment within five working days."

The twins went to my school but were a year older, and their mother would drive us all there and then babysit me for an hour after the school day ended until my mom could come pick me up.
I don’t know which of the twins came up with the idea to play an April Fools joke on me. But that morning, the two of them very carefully strung several lines of clear fishing line across the front door, hoping that I wouldn’t see it, and get stuck when I tried to walk through it.
Unfortunately, in their five-year-old excitement, they couldn’t wait to see me trip over the fishing line, and crowded the doorway as I got out of my mom’s car and waved goodbye. I walked up to the front door, and couldn’t figure out why they already had the door open waiting for me, and were standing so strangely just inside the doorway.
“Why won’t you let me in?” I asked
“You can’t come in!” they shouted. “You’re stuck!”
“Why are you standing in the way?” I asked.
“You can’t get through!” they said “There’s a string there!”
“Why did you put a string in the doorway?”
“April Fools!”
They then cut the string free from the door, and I went inside and we got ready for school. I knew I had been “pranked”, but because the joke had failed, I was having huge four-year-old difficulties understanding what exactly that had meant.
A few years ago, we had a housemate who worked from home and therefore often had his laptop sitting open in front of him on the couch. Sometimes we would all be sitting around having conversations in the living room while he was working, and he would chat with us while simultaneously typing away at a programming problem.
One of his favorite tricks was to invent a crazy lie in these situations, which he would drop into the conversation completely deadpan. Then, while the rest of the house discussed how improbable such a fact was, our housemate would quickly update the wikipedia page for the topic at hand to reflect his invented lie.
“Check wikipedia,” he’d say when we all told him he was full of it.
He only fooled us a few times.
Today, the best April Fools prank I saw was the Grosset & Dunlap design team covering director Giuseppe Castellano’s desk in googly eyes.
My awesome @GrossetPSS design team punked me on #AprilFoolsDay. They’re the best! #luckyartdirector pic.twitter.com/IHpUUZjWnr

Unlike the wikipedia lie or the fishline door, this is a prank I understand and can get behind. I think it would be awesome if Hallmark got in on this, selling massive googly eye packets. Of all the holidays to commercialize, I think there’s a market here. Compare, if you will, the googly-eyed scissors or thermostat to the stale “conversation hearts” that are a Valentine’s Day staple. The appeal should be obvious.
Meanwhile, think of the future. Think of the children. Put the plans to work now and in a hundred years we’ll have a googly eyed muppet who “distributes” April Fools eyes like Santa or the Easter Bunny.
Googly eyes on the toaster.
Googly eyes on your steering wheel.
Googly eyes on your math textbook.
Googly eyes on everything.
Everything.
It will be glorious.Is it a cookie? A brownie? Giant Brookies are both! This recipe takes gooey chocolate chip cookies and marries them to fudge brownies for the ultimate treat!
We’re all about dessert mashups over here! From sugar brookies to Brookie Cookies, combining two treats in one is always a delicious idea.
What are Brookies?
I have a favorite brownie recipe. And a favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Then one day, they met, and it was love at first bite.
Corny? Yeah. But you’ll forgive me when you taste these cookie brownies. Or are they brownie cookies? Both work, but I like to respect the equality of a cookie – brownie marriage and call these Brookies.
Brookies are dessert bars with one layer of brownies and one layer of chocolate chip cookies. They’re just a little bit more “extra” than your average cookie or brownie, making them a festive option for parties or special occasions.
Or, you know, a regular Wednesday night.
The first time I made Brookies, they disappeared so fast I only got to eat one for myself. I’d had the idea to serve some of them with a big scoop of ice cream for an after dinner indulgence so, naturally, I had to go make a second batch.
That second time, I got a few for myself before my family suddenly appeared to claim their share. I can’t blame them–these brookies are seriously delicious!
Pin this now to save for laterPin this recipe to your favorite Board
Ingredient Notes
To make Brookies, you start by making a batch of chocolate chip cookie dough and a batch of brownie batter, from scratch.
For the brownie batter you need:
- Sugar
- Flour
- Unsweetened cocoa powder
- Eggs
- Melted butter
- Chocolate chips
We could stop right there and make some pretty wonderful brownies. But we’re here for some decadence!
For the chocolate chip cookie layer you need:
- Crisco – Butter flavored is best!
- Brown sugar
- Eggs
- Milk
- Vanilla Extract– be sure to try our Instant Pot Vanilla Extract recipe!
- Cinnamon
- Baking soda
- Salt
- Chocolate Chips
Now let’s put them together, shall we?
How to Make Brookies
STEP 1. Make the brownie layer
In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients together until just combined. Pour into a 13×9 pan that is lined with parchment paper.
STEP 2. Make the cookie layer
Beat the Crisco with brown sugar. Add in vanilla, milk and egg. Slowly beat in flour, salt, baking soda and cinnamon. Mix in chocolate chips. Drop by spoonfuls onto the brownie layer.
STEP 3. Bake!
Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely. To speed up the process (because who has the patience to wait to dig into these brownie cookies bars?), pop the pan in the fridge.
PRO TIP: Use a serrated plastic knife to cut brookies. (or any brownies). Works like a charm without shredding the bars.
GIANT sized
I like to cut these into BIG sqaures. Mostly to ensure that I can get my fill of the Brookies before my family eats them all! You can cut them into whatever size you like.
If you want to stretch them to feed a big crowd, go ahead and turn them into Brookie bites–cut into 1 to 2 inch squares.

Serving suggestion
If chocolate chip cookies baked on top of double chocolate brownies weren’t enough decadence for you, go ahead and do what I did and serve them in bowls with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
You could even go the extra mile and turn them into brookie sundaes with whipped cream, sprinkles, the works. It would be the perfect birthday treat for someone who loves brownies and cookies!
Tips and Tricks
- Cutting the brookies: Lining the baking pan with parchment paper makes cutting into these bars a breeze. Once cooled, lift the parchment paper from the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Use a cold sharp (not serrated) slice the brookies into bars.
- Butter flavored Crisco: Using butter flavored shortening gives the cookie layer a buttery flavor with the chewy fudgy texture of cookies made from Crisco. If you don’t have crisco or prefer not to use it, you can use butter in the cookie dough layer but the finished texture maybe a bit crumblier and not as chewy. They’ll still taste great!
- How to store brookies: Bars keep well at room temperature for about a week as long as they’re stored in an airtight container. Everyone finds them so difficult to stop eating, though, that they rarely last even a couple of days!
Can you freeze brookies?
Brookies freeze well when sliced into bars first! Freeze them in a single layer or with wax paper between the layers to keep them from freezing. This is a great make ahead option–or if you wind up with more brookies than you want to eat all at once!
One more tip: If you’re making these when other people are home, don’t forget to set aside one or two for yourself as you cut them up! That way, when the entire batch inevitably gets gobbled up by your family, you’ll have your own secret stash to enjoy. Trust me on this.

The main financial district has benefited as much as many other Asian capitals and is now home to a large number of skyscrapers, yet this historic city also has plenty of other attractions to draw the crowd too. The social life in the city is embraced by many of its residents, and it is a true cosmopolitan city where people from all backgrounds and orientations can be seen alongside each other.
Shopping In Bangkok
Along with the financial revolution that has happened in Asia over the last twenty years, the development of a shopping culture has also appeared, and Bangkok is one of the best places on the continent for shopping. Shopping malls have sprung up throughout the city centre, with the districts of Siam and Ratchaprasong being particularly popular because of the series of shopping malls located there.
For those looking for more traditional Thai wares or simply wanting to enjoy and exciting and different shopping experience, there are a number of different markets available. Probably the most impressive, and certainly the biggest market of all is the Chatuchak weekend market which is believed to be the largest weekend market in the world, boasting over 5,000 stalls selling everything from food and household items up to religious artifacts and live animals.
Get Soaked In The Songkran Festival
One of the most fun festivals to be enjoyed in Bangkok happens between the thirteenth and the fifteenth of April every year, and is a celebration of the traditional New Year according to the old Thai calendar. While it may come as a surprise to those unsuspecting visitors, it is traditional on this day to douse others in water or water combined with talc as a wish of good fortune for the coming year. During the festival many locals can be found on the streets of Bangkok armed with containers filled with water or even water guns.
The symbolic act represented on this act is the washing away of the old year, and the hope is that the washing away of the bad aspects of the previous year will bring prosperity and success for the coming year.
Enjoy The Nightlife In Bangkok
One of the most famous (or some may say notorious!) aspects of the culture in Bangkok is the vibrant nightlife, with the fun centered on the districts of Si Lom and Lamsalee being particularly popular. As well as the wide selection of nightclubs, jazz bars and restaurants to be found in the city, there is also a significant culture of ‘Ladyboy Shows’, which does attract many visitors.
The risks of going for a night on the town in Bangkok have reduced significantly over recent years, with a big drop in the crime rate. However, the low cost of alcoholic drinks in the city mean that visitors are likely to continue to flock to Bangkok to enjoy the nightlife districts.
Explore The Grand Palace
Like many other kingdoms in Asia, Thailand has a grand and impressive palace complex that is well worth exploring for the interested tourist. Not content with one ornate palace, the GrandPalace is made up of a large number of accommodation buildings, temples, entertaining rooms and a variety of other outbuildings too. The highlight of the GrandPalace in Bangkok is the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, which has a sacred statue of the Buddha which can only be touched by the King of Thailand. This temple is generally considered to be the most important in the whole of Thailand.
Loi Krathong
This is another important festival in the cultural life of Bangkok in which the city is lit up by fireworks, and light decorations are released on the water. The festival itself is related to the Thai calendar, and usually falls in November in the western calendar. The original intent of the festival was to honor the Buddha, although it is now a festival celebrated by most people in the city rather than just Buddhists. The tradition of making small decorations that include a small candle sees the river lit up by many small lights, which are said to take away the individual’s negative emotions.Tattoo and Kokeshi Book Signing with Manami Okazaki

Disembarking Made Easy With New Smartphone App
U.S. Customs and the cruise industry have finally entered the 21st century. Starting just a few days ago, passengers disembarking ships at Port Everglades could use the new Mobile Passport Control Device. The app for your phone enables you to complete your Customs declarations electronically. Those opting to use the app are ushered into specific lines to speed the processing of their paperwork and customs requirements. Initial reactions are favorable, with cruisers indicating the app was easy to use and improved the often dreadful disembarkation procedures. The Princess and I will have to give this a try on our next sailing onboard Harmony of the Seas.
New Princess Cruise Ship Construction Begins
Princess Cruises is not slowing down. The company’s largest class of ship, the Royal Class, is getting another vessel. After the fanfare surrounding Royal Princess and Regal Princess, and the excitement building over Majestic Princess debuting soon, the line recently cut steel on their fourth vessel in the class. Expect the ship to be similar to her older siblings but to still pack a few surprises under her hull. The ship is expected to be delivered in 2019; where she will spend her inaugural season, and eventually homeport, is not yet known.

Celebrity Cruises Calls Dublin Home in 2018
Yes, you read that headline correctly. In some surprising news, Celebrity Cruises announced that a Solstice class ship will be home-ported in Dublin, Ireland. This “mini-season” will occur between April and June 2018. It is unclear which of the five Solstice class ships will have the honor of sailing the British Isles. Itineraries have not been announced yet either, but a total of five cruises, carrying over 14,000 passengers, are expected to occur during the two month period. The Princess and I will be keeping our eyes on these cruises very closely. After all, we do only have one 2018 cruise booked so far!
MS Koningsdam Arrives in Florida
Holland America’s largest and newest ship, MS Koningsdam, arrived in Florida this past week after completing a transatlantic sailing from Europe. Appealing to both families and more seasoned travelers, the ship offers a variety of firsts for the cruise line. Debut features include family cabins alongside staterooms built for solo travelers, an entertainment venue with a 270 degree digital backdrop, an outdoor movie theater, and several restaurants. The ship will host a variety of Caribbean sailings before returning back to Europe for another six month season cruising the Mediterranean.

Cruise News November 13, 2016Be the first one to post commentThough I tend towards the fruity or super spirit forward cocktails, I do love a good savory cocktail now and again. Never a fan of Blood Mary’s (yeah yeah, I know), I like to mix in other vegetable juices, herbs, and syrups into my drinks to lend a savory component to a libation. One of my favorites? Carrot juice. Although savory, it still has some sweetness that goes well with many spirits and citrus. The Zanahoria Verde cocktail I whipped up recently is a tasty sweet and savory drink that would be perfect for Cinco de Mayo in place of margaritas or on any ol’ spring or summer day.
The Zanahoria Verde is made with Ancho Reyes Verde. The new expression from bartender loved Ancho Reyes Chili Liqueur, Verde is bright and just screams green! Where Ancho Reyes is smokey and earthy, the Verde is vegetal with subtle herbaceous notes. Both use the versatile poblano chili, but instead of using anchos chilis (the term for dried poblanos), Verde leaves them undried which highlights the fresh from the garden pepper taste. There is a bit of sweetness that tempers both the vegetal notes and the hint of spiciness that creeps through on the palate.
Rather than finding a contrasting flavor to pair it with, I went with complimentary vegetal ingredients. Carrot juice is slightly sweet with a crisp subtly flavor that allows the Verde to shine yet not take over. Pineapple juice is tart, bight while adding sweetness which lands the cocktail in both the sweet and savory category. For the base spirit, tequila is a natural choice, lending earthy notes of it’s own. I used Tequila Ocho. The single estate tequila is made with 100% blue agave that has some fruity, peppery notes with the characteristic vegetal notes with some salinity. Perfect here! Agave syrup is a great sweetener here, but I would like to see how honey pairs with it. Topped off with cilantro for both a pop of color and adding some herbal notes on the front of the palate as you sip.
I am flying back from Florida today after over a month of traveling and spending time with family so I am planning to make a round (or quite a few) of these tonight when I touch down. Paired with fresh guacamole, pajamas and lots of Netflix, it’s exactly what I’ll need!
The Zanahoria Verde (The Green Carrot)
- 1 oz Ancho Reyes Verde
- 3/4 oz silver tequila, preferable Tequila Ocho Plata
- 2 oz fresh pineapple juice
- 1/2 oz carrot juice
- 1/4 oz agave
- garnish: cilantro sprig
Add all liquid ingredients into a shaker with ice. Shake and strain into a coupe glass. Smack cilantro on the side of the glass to release oils. Garnish with the cilantro sprig.

OvCa cell colonization of individual omental tissues and decreased and prevented LAQ824 (NVP-LAQ824, Dacinostat) OvCa metastases in mice. Furthermore, knockdown of fascin Rabbit Polyclonal to Thyroid Hormone Receptor beta particularly in the LAQ824 (NVP-LAQ824, Dacinostat) OvCa cells utilizing a fascin-specific LAQ824 (NVP-LAQ824, Dacinostat) lentiviral-shRNA also obstructed metastasis and decreased OvCa metastasis and tests [12]. G2 was also bought from Xcessbio (NORTH PARK, CA) to verify findings. Lifestyle and Isolation of principal individual mesothelial cells and principal individual cancer-associated fibroblasts. Normal individual omental samples had been acquired from feminine sufferers who underwent medical procedures and had been free of cancers, endometriosis, or various other irritation. Omental tumor examples had been acquired from sufferers with high-grade serous OvCa. Informed consent was attained before the medical procedures and the analysis was accepted by the IRB on the School of Chicago. The principal individual mesothelial cells (HPMCs) had been isolated from regular omentum. The CAFs had been isolated from omental tumor of high-grade serous OvCa sufferers. The principal cells had been characterized and cultured by vimentin, keratin 8, smooth-muscle actin, and calretinin immunohistochemistry [13C15]. Principal cells were employed for experiments at passages 1C4 to reduce any kind of divergence from first morphology and features [14]. OvCa cells had been fluorescently-labeled utilizing a lentiviral vector expressing copepod cGFP as previously defined [15]. Proteomic evaluation The MaxQB data source ( queried using the Potential Planck Perseus software program for fascin appearance in OvCa tumors from 11 sufferers and in 30 OvCa cell lines as previously defined [11]. Immunohistochemistry Individual omental samples (n=3) were acquired from female patients undergoing medical procedures for benign reasons. Omental metastases from 12 patients with high-grade serous OvCa were deparaffinized LAQ824 (NVP-LAQ824, Dacinostat) and incubated with anti-fascin antibody (1:2,000 dilution) as previously explained [16, 17]. Slides were stained using the Envision avidin-biotin free detection system and counterstained with hematoxylin. Representative images were taken using a Leica Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with color video camera. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry Tissue microarray (TMA) cores (= 2, per patient sample) were constructed from main OvCa and peritoneal and omental metastatic tissues collected from patients with OvCa (N=201; n=153 serous papillary, n=16 obvious cell, n=21 endometrioid, and n=11 mucinous). Clinical and histopathologic information was collected and updated every 3 months as previously reported [16]. TMA slides were deparaffinized and LAQ824 (NVP-LAQ824, Dacinostat) incubated with fascin antibody (1:2,000 dilution) as previously explained [16, 17]. Slides were stained using the Envision avidin-biotin-free detection system and counterstained with hematoxylin. The intensity of 3, 3-diaminobenzidine staining was decided in malignancy- or stroma-specific regions of the tumor cores by a pathologist (AM) and given scores of 0 (absent), 1, 2 or 3 3 (highest). The score averages were reported. Immunoblots For analysis of fascin and GAPDH, cells were lysed, and equivalent quantities of protein for each sample were added to each blot. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblot analysis was performed. Membranes were incubated with the following antibodies overnight at 4C: anti-fascin (1:1,000 dilution), anti-GAPDH (1:2,000 dilution). Blots were than incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidaseCconjugated IgG and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) fascin concentrating on Fascin was stably knocked down in GFP/luciferase-labeled HeyA8 cells [15] utilizing a lentiviral-based shRNA vector. The HeyA8 cells had been plated within a 96-well dish (500 cells/well) in 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% MEM nonessential proteins, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% vitamin supplements in DMEM (complete growth mass media) and permitted to incubate right away.

People migrate across borders but how does food migrate and how do recipes evolve in new environments? As migration increases certain ingredients become scarce or inaccessible. This has led to many recipes from all over the world to adapt to new environments creating fusions and unique flavors for everyone’s taste.
Therefore “Migrating Cuisines” is a project based on the recipes mostly retrieved from the personal archives of the individuals who migrated from the Middle East or who have Middle Eastern roots. The recipes included on this website are not claiming their authentic origin but rather the ways in which dishes have migrated and changed across time and space. The main intervention of this project is proposing an authenticity statement with the purpose to value the personal/individual heritages of the dish. The purpose is to show how foods migrate and carry multiple identities and meanings as they diffuse across borders onto different plates. The project encapsulates and presents the personal manuscripts of recipes and photos taken by people, from the personal archives of the creators of the project, and of their families and friends. The selected dishes are located in their origins based on the recipe holders’ personal experiences and variations of the recipes are listed for some of the dishes.
This project presents how food has no identified borders and no certain “home”/origin as they fluidly move and modify across regions and countries and time. Wherever it is cooked and shared, is the home for that specific recipe. Its home is on that specific preparation and that plate at that moment.

Finding the best loan services provider may be hard. This is especially when you have got little or no information about a loan services provider. You may find the activity of sorting out different loan services providers being overwhelming. As such, it is advisable that you choose a loan services provider in advance if you know you will lone day need services from them. Guessing on any loan services provider can lead to a wrong option because and thus, do not choose any firm because you heard them being advertised somewhere. So, the tips which will be discussed on this site are crucial when choosing a reputable loan services provider.
In the first place, you have to look at a loan services provider with a great reputation in the place you leave. If you are new to a given place, then you should confirm whether many people are aware of the loan services provider you are about to choose. It is imperative that you request them to share something about the loan services provider. Their description of the performance of the loan services provider is what will determine their reputation. Another tip is checking the total amount to spend on a given loan services provider. Remember that not all loan services providers will provide excellent services at an affordable cost. So, in this case you ought to know the accurate price. The only perfect way you can do this is comparing the different price estimate given out by various loan services providers. More so, even though there will be cheap services, try and avoid them because you might end up getting poor quality results.
Another factor is the experience. For how long has the chosen loan services provider been working? This is a question you should ask yourself prior to choosing a loan services provider. For instance, your aim should be to find a loan services provider who has worked for more than fifteen years. With this, you can be guaranteed that they have perfect services as a result of working with different clients. Again, look at the education history of a specific loan services provider together with the staff who work in the firm. Are they people who are properly trained? Do they have anything to proof their training background? Always look forward to be shown a certificate in this case when you need to receive perfect services.
Also, choosing a loan services provider where it is easy to walk or drive is imperative. You don’t have to choose a loan services provider residing far from you and expect to always access their services easy. So, locate where each loan services provider is using google map among other online sites. Also, online reviews and ratings will talk more about how a particular loan services provider work. So, regardless of whether the reviews are positive or negative, you should read them so that you understand the both sides of the loan services provider. Finally, get a few of your colleagues to suggest a loan services provider on behalf. They are close people this expect to get sincere suggestions only.

If after reading this, you still have a burning questions, get in touch and ask away.
Q: So you are a documentary wedding photographer – does that mean you don’t take any formal photographs?
A: What I do best is take natural, documentary-style shots of you and your guests enjoying the day. However, most couples also want some formal portrait pictures, including group shots. I’m more than happy to oblige – it’s your day after all! I’ll make sure that we minimise the time this takes, so that you can get back to the party. I keep it light and natural, so the shots never look cheesy or over-posed.
Q: Do we get to meet you before the wedding?
A: If that suits you, then I would love to. If we can’t meet, for whatever reason, then we’ll talk on the phone and work out exactly what you want and how I’ll make sure you get it. I like to understand your needs before the wedding and make sure that everything goes smoothly on the day.
Q: Where are you based and which areas do you cover?
A: I’m based in North London. I cover weddings in the London area but am happy to travel further afield.
Q: What happens after the wedding?
A: I first secure your memories with several backups – on and off-site. I then review, select, and edit the best photos from your day. I dedicate a lot of time and care to bringing out the best features of the photos, including converting to black and white, correcting colours and tones, etc. When the photos are ready, I’ll send you a link to the online gallery and pop the USB stick in the post for you.
Q: Do you offer wedding albums?
A: Yes, I do. There are two options: a coffee table style wedding book or a classic wedding album. Take a look at the Albums page to find out more.
Q: Are you insured?
A: Yes, definitely. Equipment, professional indemnity and public liability are all covered. Let me know if you or your venue would like to see a copy.
Q: Are you full-time photographer?
A: I am a photographer as well as a Mum of a pretty demanding 6 year-old. But yes, photography is my only paid profession.
Q: How do I book?
A: A deposit of £400 and a signed wedding photography agreement secures your date.The EQF is a framework to compare qualifications beyond national systems, according to eight reference levels ranging from basic Level 1 to advanced Level 8. It applies to all types of education, training and qualifications, from school education to academic, professional and vocational.
In the construction sector Levels 3 and 4 apply to workers taking responsibility for completion of tasks (L3) and exercising self-management (L4), in usually predictable contexts. Levels 5 – 6 apply to supervisors managing technical activities, responsible for decision-making in unpredictable contexts. The design work of architects and engineers belongs to level 7.
The EQF has been set up in 2008 and is in use since 2010.
“The EQF is a common European reference framework which links countries’ qualifications systems together, acting as a translation device to make qualifications more readable and understandable across different countries and systems in Europe. It has two principal aims: to promote citizens’ mobility between countries and to facilitate their lifelong learning. (..). The EQF recognises that Europe’s education and training systems are so diverse that a shift to learning outcomes is necessary to make comparison and cooperation between countries and institutions possible.”Two-time Grammy-nominated band, The Lumineers, are back with their third album, a cinematic piece presented as a narrative in three chapters, with each one centering on one main character.

In a world where we’re constantly being bombarded with content, advice, and often pure lip-service, connecting on a deeper level can be a challenge. That’s why I focus on one thing: moving people.
I’ve learned that the best sessions are those that are deeply real, unapologetic, and practical.
Every event I participate in is something totally unique…just like the clients I work with.
My clients are disruptive, visionaries who champion a workplace that elevates human potential.
To make it simple: a speech is nothing if it doesn’t shift perspective, conversations breed momentum, and collaboration unlocks everything.

Virtual keynotes allow you to open up to wider audiences, without reducing learning and impact.
Signature Talks
In addition to “from scratch” talks, I customize the following signature talks.
Technology is redefining how we work, how we interact, and even how we are fundamentally wired neurologically. In this talk, we’ll inspire you and your team to rethink choices around digital tools. You’ll learn to use digital tools to empower performance, rather than engaging unconsciously with digital tools from a stressed, overwhelmed, drained state.

Milestones)A construct of code effectiveness: empirical findings and measurement properties
AbstractThe purpose of the study is to examine and describe the use of codes of ethics in companies operating South Africa. The population included the company secretaries of the top 500 companies operating in the South African corporate sector. The findings stipulate that South African companies need to understand that their employees are diverse in beliefs and opinions and as a result do not all have a similar ethical value system. Therefore, ethical education is imperative to ensure a stronger focus on the offering of ethics programmes aligned with the business philosophy of the company.

Palm oil: the biofuel of the future driving rainforests to extinction; but we'll fight global warming!
The Guardian
Wed, 04 Apr 2007 08:06 UTC."
The fear is that Indonesia'sised tonnes of carbon a year. Worse, it is often set alight to speed clearing, adding to the CO2 from the huge forest fires that blanket much of south-east Asia in haze. Estimates say Indonesia's fires generate 1,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, pushing it to the world's favour.
"There are bad biofuels in the world and palm oil is often the very 'baddest'," said Ed Matthew, biofuel specialist at Friends of the Earth. "Europe shouldn't be setting targets until it's put a mechanism in place to block bad biofuels. Palm oil is one of the cheapest biofuels in the field, but by setting targets it sends the wrong signal for businessmen."
As the risks become more obvious there has been a growing clamour for eco-labelling. "It's vital we find financial backing for this now," said Fitrian Ardiansyah, a Worldwide Fund for Nature-Indonesia programme doesn't have the capability or the capacity to do this alone without the support of the Europeans, the US, Japanese, or whoever," said Alhilal Hamdi, chief executive of Indonesia's biofuels development board. "It's no good other countries looking to us to help cut their CO2 emissions without helping to support us in that effort."Property Attributes

After five years on the air and countless quotes, Schitt's Creek is coming to an end in April of 2020. The show — which is led by father-son duo Eugene and Dan Levy — centers around the Rose family, who moves to the town of Schitt's Creek following the loss of their fortune.
Though the Roses initially hate their new town, and the motel they're forced to live in, they ultimately grow to love it, and they even forge lasting relationships along the way (though it's too soon to talk about Ted and Alexis's breakup).
Nothing will soften the blow that is the thought of Schitt's Creek rapidly approaching the end, but there is some good news to celebrate the end of one of TV's most culturally important comedies.
There is going to be a Schitt's Creek farewell tour from May to July of 2020 — meaning that we can prolong our sadness in saying goodbye to the Roses, Stevie, and Roland until the summertime. Read on to find out all of the details of the farewell tour (like how far you'll have to travel to see it), how to get tickets, and what it entails.
The thought of not hearing Moira Rose (Catherine O'Hara) saying "bebe" on a weekly basis is a travesty, but the farewell tour will be a celebration of the show that has become an iconic staple. Most of the major players will be part of the tour, including both Dan and Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Annie Murphy (Alexis Rose), Emily Hampshire (Stevie Bud), and Chris Elliott (Roland Schitt).
As if seeing the cast wasn't a huge treat in and of itself, they will also be discussing the most infamous moments from the series, including how they came to be. In addition, they'll also be sharing some behind-the-scenes footage, which we hope includes a tour into the costume area so we can see the options that didn't make it into Moira Rose's closet. 11. The shows begin at different times, ranging from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.
Here are the dates and locations for the Schitt's Creek tour (get your wallets and itineraries ready):
May 2: Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix, AZ.
May 22: Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, FL.
May 23: Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando, FL.
May 24: The Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg, FL.

June 26: The Colosseum at Caesars Windsor in Windsor, Canada.

July 10: Boch Center Wang Theater in Boston, MA.

After getting two superhits released in consecutive years, Two Heroes (2018) and Heroes Rising (2019), fans expected an upcoming launch this winter. The officials had heard their prayers, and late-night, they surfaced a new teaser of My Hero Academia Movie 3. Since then, fans have created havoc in the discussion boxes. Everyone has been concocting their own opinion related to the teaser. Newly, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train has broken multiple records and becomes the third highest-grossing film in Japan. The same has been anticipating from this new feature also. So, in this post, we will discuss the elucidation of the teaser, plot, and the release date of Boku No Hero Academia Movie 3.
Warning: Spoilers Ahead! This post might contain some spoilers. So, if you don’t want to get spoiled, then it’s better to leave here.
My Hero Academia Movie 3 Teaser and Plot-
Heroaca-movie has just launched the official poster of the potential third My Hero Academia movie. We can see Bakugo, Midoriya, and Shoto in their new winter hero costume on the poster. My Hero Academia series publicized their training in Endeavor’s agency in the month of January. They were advancing their quirks and techniques to engage in the war against the Paranormal Liberation. Afterward, we have witnessed their clash with the Paranormal Liberation army in the first spring. We have only seen the beginning and the ending part of the internship. Therefore, the upcoming movie will cover the mid of the training arc.
A message is imprinted on the poster, “He will meet The Three Musketeers.” Also, there is a badge present on the new winter costumes of these 3 heroes remarking “WHA.” Fans have assumed that “WHA” may stand for “World Hero Association.” It means that they may represent their nation in the Heroes Summit under the suzerainty of Endeavor. Moreover, in this summit, “He” will meet them. If we compare this with the original Three Musketeers, they made the saying of “All for One” and “One for All” popular. Hence, we can predict, maybe the word “He” stands for All for One. Like the other MHA movie, this movie might be canon.

My Hero Academia Movie 3 Costumes-
The main topic of the discussion is the change in the heroes’ suits. If we see Bakugo’s costume, his grenade launcher part has become smaller and finer. We know, Bakugo can create explosions from his sweat glands, and during winters, it is challenging to produce sweat. So, in our opinion, his suit may get some modification. On the contrary, we have seen multiple times that whenever Shoto used the Flash Fire Fist, his costume gets burnt. Therefore, his costume may also have some variations in which he can easily use his Flash Fire. The last musketeer also needs some changes in his costume. The winter costume of Midoriya looks very cool. Now, these three musketeers are ready to show some action in their Winter internship.
My Hero Academia Movie 3 Release Date-
There is no official confirmation of the release date of My Hero Academia Movie 3. We will get the new updates in the upcoming Jump Festa. But we can estimate that this new movie will release on next Summer 2021. We will be back with another news article related to this topic. Till then, stay tuned with us.

Vidya Balan started her acting career from television with the popular serial 'Hum Paanch' and then made her Bollywood debut with 'Parineeti.' Since then she has been taking roles that are still considered 'risky' by many. A seven-month pregnant lady, a soft-porn actress, a mathematician, a housewife turned radio jockey and now a forest officer, Vidya has portrayed a variety of roles on screen. This has enabled her to be labeled as brave and has given her the success she deserves. It's not surprising that many believe that it was Vidya who paved the way for women-led films in Bollywood.
But there another reason to admire her. It is her embracing her body in the way and form it normally is. In an industry that is obsessed with size zero, puffy lips, and whatnot, Vidya has been able to make her mark being her natural self.
But she has been criticised by a section of media and people for her weight and some reporters still ask her 'when will you lose your weight and do normal roles?' Well, despite all this problematic scrutiny, Vidya has emerged as a 'Sherni' in Bollywood and never changed herself to meet the expectations of either the industry or our society.

Whether you look back in interaction to the electricity of grayscale movies, or even to the present day 21st 100 years, Indian women are thought about some of the most beautiful ladies available to choose from.
From Sharmila Tagore to Rupi Kaur, Indian ladies never have best found that they are beautiful, and incorporate a heavy dose of mental magnificence towards the combine. As an example, after retiring from operating, Sharmila Tagore switched the girl landscapes to helping other people, and providing the Hindi cinema fraternity. Moving forward to Singles Kaur, an Indo-Canadian poet. She takes the eloquence of thoughts, and translates them inside communications of terms which as any creator myself provided is aware that isn’t any simple feat.

Overview (No Spoilers):
Novik has been on my TBR periphery for a past year or so based on fellow blogger and author recommendations. Furthermore, her novels kept showing up every ‘must read’ lists that I happened to be perusing. Finally convinced, I was careful not the spoil any of the backstory or even a brief synopsis of Uprooted prior to adding the title to my library holds list. That being said, I couldn’t stop listening to this fantastic read, which turned out to be an emotional roller coaster that had me both crying and laughing. Novik delivers a delightfully unique literary adventure that is gracefully eloquent with a strong, independent female lead that is truly a breath of fresh air. Upon beginning Uprooted, I was under the impression that this novel would fall under the genre of young adult, however I was pleasantly surprised to find adult themes laden throughout. Additionally piquing my interest was the deliberate method at which the world building and character depth were developed alongside the story, drawing the reader ever deeper into Agnieszka’s plight. As someone who grew up in a rural community where woods walks were frequent Sunday afternoon activities, I loved the concept of this story, especially as we learn more about the Woods, due to Agnieszka fearlessly adventures further into its depths. While I want to say more and to rave about how wonderfully refreshing and innovative I found this read to be, I would hate to spoil anything more regarding the premise of Novik’s work of art. That being said, I can appreciate this read is a standalone novel, however I would love to have her revisit this wonderful literary realm sometime in the future. Overall, Uprooted will be my go to book recommendation for the foreseeable future and will likely find its way into many of my Christmas gifts this year. Sorry to spoil the surprise if you’re reading this friends and family.
Additional Insight (Spoilers Abound):
- As a result of going into this read anticipating a YA novel I was continually shocked at all the death throughout this book. It kept the reader on their toes, not knowing what character would be next to bite the dust.
- Due to Kasia being in the heart tree and changing to part wood, how will her normal aging process be changed?
- Will Agnieszka cope with her parents, family, etc growing old while she stays young?
- Did the Dragon try teaching the other young girls magic?
- Prince Marek was seriously the worst! I kept worrying the Novik would redeem him. While I’m mentioning characters I despised, I might as well bring up Solya, the Falcon. He was so irresponsible, enabling Marek in his wild ambitions.
- Did the Queen actually run away with her suitor or was she kidnapped?
- What is Jaga’s story? Will Agnieszka learn to time travel too? I kept wondering if Agnieszka would turn out to be Jaga.
- Will there be peace for Polngya and Rosya?
- Will Agnieszka finish healing the forest?
- That ending was so beautiful with Agnieszka and the Dragon reuniting!

#marriageplot+traditionalnarrativesftw
in one scene midway through the movie, as she was about to put the moves on the man it was already clear she would wind up with at film's end, danica mckeller took a sip from this giant owl mug. and when the aforementioned man asked her what she was doing, she informed him that she was drinking from her "snazzy owl mug."
some days later, my family were at marshall's and lo! there in the glass things aisle was THAT EXACT SAME MUG from the hallmark movie. and we eatons gathered round in a triangle of awe, marveling that a ceramic we had seen in a movie not three days earlier now appeared before our very eyes in real life.
if memory serves, i carried it around for a few minutes to determine whether i loved it enough for purchase and then put it back, because it seemed impractical to pay $3.99 for something likely to be broken in the trip home.
cut to three days later, when garebear drops me off at the airport and calls to tell debo that, having done so, he's gonna swing by marshall's and pick up that mug for me as a surprise because he could tell i loved it more than i knew and i needed it in my life.
except this message was left on my voicemail- not debo's. and so, landing in atlanta, i learned i would one day be the surprised recipient of a giant owl mug all my own.
while in memphis earlier this month, the owl mug officially became mine and it, later, successfully made it to london unbroken.
it is, i realize now, having drunk from it for a fortnight, probably the equivalent of four to five cups of coffee. so garebear's surprise that the coffee pot was always empty when i'd had "only the one cup" gradually becomes clear.AWS Database Blog
Use the TempTable storage engine on Amazon RDS for MySQL and Amazon Aurora MySQL
MySQL 8.0 has introduced TempTable as the new, default internal temporary table storage engine to speed up query processing. The MySQL query optimizer creates temporary tables internally to store intermediate datasets while processing complex queries. In AWS, you can deploy MySQL 8.0 using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL, a managed service for MySQL Community Edition (CE) that automates time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. You can also deploy MySQL 8.0 compatible database clusters using Amazon Aurora, a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud that combines the performance and availability of traditional enterprise databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases.
In this post, I share with you best practices of using the TempTable storage engine in an RDS for MySQL DB instance and Aurora MySQL DB cluster. I discuss common issues that affect query performance when internal temporary tables are involved and require memory or disk storage allocation. I also point out specific considerations that you should give to AWS’s managed database services.
MySQL handling of internal temporary tables
Typically, internal temporary tables are held in memory first for best query performance. To avoid excessive memory allocation, MySQL provides parameters that you can use to set a memory limit. Internal temporary tables overflow to disk storage when that limit is reached. MySQL may designate different storage engines for internal temporary tables in memory than for those on disk storage.
Prior to version 8.0, MySQL used the MEMORY storage engine as the default for in-memory internal temporary tables. MySQL 8.0 has replaced it with the TempTable storage engine, but it also provides the option to switch back to the MEMORY storage engine.
A key simplification for manageability for the TempTable storage engine is that it uses a memory pool for all sessions that use it. The memory limit, set by
temptable_max_ram, applies to the sum of memory consumption from concurrent sessions. This is different from the MEMORY storage engine, where the memory limit, set by the smaller
tmp_table_size and
max_heap_table_size, is per table, specific to a session. The TempTable storage engine also has its own disk overflow mechanism. You can configure it to overflow either to memory-mapped temporary files or to InnoDB on-disk internal temporary tables. A memory-mapped file provides the mapping between a file and memory space that speeds up file read and write operations. In addition to the memory limit, these two separate overflow paths can bring out distinctive aspects of internal temporary table storage engines and directly impact query performance.
Configuration parameter differences
The following diagram illustrates the behavior of the four parameters for the TempTable storage engine in MySQL 8.0.23, one of the most recent MySQL CE releases.
The parameters are as follows:
internal_tmp_mem_storage_enginedefines the storage engine for in-memory internal temporary tables with allowed values of TempTable (default) or MEMORY. This parameter was added in MySQL 8.0.2 with the introduction of TempTable storage engine.
temptable_max_ram, also introduced in MySQL 8.0.2, defines the maximum amount of memory that can be used by the TempTable storage engine.
temptable_max_mmapwas introduced in MySQL 8.0.23, and defines the maximum amount of disk storage that the TempTable storage engine is permitted to allocate for memory-mapped temporary files. Setting it to 0 disables the use of memory-mapped temporary files, making the overflow go to the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table.
temptable_use_mmapdefines whether the TempTable storage engine overflows to memory-mapped temporary files. It was introduced in MySQL 8.0.16, and deprecated in 8.0.26 because its function becomes a duplicate.
If you use Amazon RDS for MySQL, note the change history of these parameters. There have been quite a few revisions over time while the TempTable storage engine continues evolving. Because Amazon RDS for MySQL supports various minor versions of MySQL 8.0 CE, the available parameters in each version may vary. You can check the DB parameter group to verify.
Aurora MySQL 3.0 versions are wire-compatible with MySQL 8.0.23 CE. You have the option to configure all these parameters in either the DB cluster parameter group or DB parameter group, depending on whether you want to apply a uniform setting to all DB instances of an Aurora DB cluster. However, the unique storage architecture of an Aurora DB cluster results in different behavior of internal temporary tables on Aurora replica (reader) DB instances.
An Aurora DB cluster has two types of storage: a cluster volume shared by all DB instances, and local storage attached to each DB instance. On the Aurora primary (writer) DB instance, the TempTable storage engine has its overflow paths defined as follows:
- Memory-mapped temporary files get created on the local storage
- The InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table is stored in the shared cluster volume
Because Aurora replica DB instances have no write access to the shared cluster volume, they can’t use the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary tables. As a result, the following constraints apply to parameters on Aurora replicas:
internal_tmp_mem_storage_engineis set to the TempTable storage engine internally and can’t be modified. If you try to set it to the MEMORY storage engine in the parameter group, the change doesn’t take effect.
temptable_use_mmapis set to 1 internally and can’t be modified. If you apply a different value in the parameter group, the change doesn’t take effect.
temptable_max_mmapcan’t be set to 0. If you try to set it to 0 in the parameter group, it internally resets to the default value of 1 GB.
In summary, although the primary (writer) DB instance of an Aurora DB cluster has the same four configuration parameters available as MySQL 8.0.23 CE, Aurora replica (reader) DB instances only use two of the parameters,
temptable_max_ram and
temptable_max_mmap, as illustrated by the following diagram.
Tuning strategies
Internal temporary tables allocate either memory or storage, or most likely both, to process data. The resource consumption required by an internal temporary table storage engine is workload-dependent. However, an RDS DB instance has system resource capacity based on the DB instance class and storage architecture. A good tuning strategy requires striking a balance between the demand and supply of system resources to allow your queries to scale and meet the expected performance goals.
Memory usage
Processing data in memory is always faster than overflowing to disk. The memory limit of the TempTable storage engine,
temptable_max_ram, defaults to 1 GB in MySQL CE, and is honored by Amazon RDS for MySQL as well as Aurora MySQL in general. This is a conservative setting for most DB instances that use memory optimized DB instance classes, such as db.r5 or db.r6g. You can tune this parameter based on your workload and use a formula to size it based on the memory capacity of the DB instance,
DBInstanceClassMemory. This is a dynamic parameter and you can change it without rebooting the RDS instance.
Setting
temptable_max_ram to a large value may increase the risk of running out of memory, especially on some of the db.t2 or db.t3 instance classes that have limited memory capacity. Therefore, Aurora MySQL has adjusted the default value to be 16 MB for db.t3.medium, and db.t3.large instance classes. It’s recommended that you monitor the Amazon CloudWatch metric
FreeableMemory to make sure the memory usage on the DB instance is within the expected range.
Storage usage
Overflowing to disk is an alternative to allow queries to continue to be processed if the data is too large to fit in memory. It usually happens when those queries that use internal temporary tables come from a highly concurrent workload or process a large amount of data. The TempTable storage engine has two overflow paths. By default, it overflows to memory-mapped temporary files first when the memory limit is reached. There is a storage limit for memory-mapped temporary files, set by
temptable_max_mmap. When that limit is also reached, overflow goes down the second path, the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table, if it’s available. As
temptable_max_mmap is a dynamic parameter, you can change it without an instance reboot.
The default configuration has the potential to make overflow take two hops. With respect to storage allocation and I/O operation, the two-hop path is more expensive compared to the one-hop path that uses either memory-mapped temporary files or the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table, but not both. The default value of
temptable_max_mmap is 1 GB in MySQL. Leaving it to such a small default value raises the possibility of taking a two-hop path.
If you use Amazon RDS for MySQL, I recommend optimizing for a one-hop path to the extent possible. Both overflow paths lead to the same storage that is attached to the DB instance. When there is a storage shortage for memory-mapped temporary files, the same holds true for the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table as well. If the available free storage allows, I recommend increasing
temptable_max_mmap to accommodate the largest size of memory-mapped temporary files that your workload can use. If your workload favors the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table, you can set
temptable_max_mmap to be 0 to block the use of memory-mapped temporary files. You can scale up storage, or adjust your workload to avoid filling up the storage.
On the primary (writer) DB instance of an Aurora DB cluster, two overflow paths are assigned to go to different storage types. Memory-mapped temporary files are created in local storage. You can use the CloudWatch metric
FreeLocalStorage to check the available free local storage on the Aurora DB instance, and that is the maximum value of
temptable_max_mmap you can set. The InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table is stored in the cluster volume that has 128 TiB capacity. The one-hop path is still the best choice, and you can choose the overflow path that suits your workload best. One situation you want to watch out for is a runaway query while it drives an InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table growing on the cluster volume continuously. I recommend configuring
max_execution_time to set a query timeout limit to avoid this scenario.
On the Aurora replica (reader) DB instance, TempTable is the dedicated storage engine for internal temporary tables, and the overflow path goes to memory-mapped temporary files on local storage only. The query fails with a “table is full” error message when the size of memory-mapped temporary files reaches the storage limit set by
temptable_max_mmap. Your workload may require different temporary table configurations on the primary (writer) DB instance from the replica (reader) DB instance, and you have the option to apply separate DB parameter groups to ensure fine-grained tuning at the instance level. However, if the replica (reader) DB instance is your failover target, I recommend configuring both the primary (writer) and replica (reader) DB instance to use the same instance class and DB parameter group, to avoid potential mismatch issues after failover.
Table structure
The TempTable storage engine retrieves data from a table and operates on it in its own format. The magnitude of data to be processed reflects the data structure of the source table, such as data types and character sets. The following diagram shows an example of the correlation between a table character set and storage allocated for different overflow paths.
The data is collected from running the same workload on two Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instances. Each instance has a set of
sysbench tables with the size ranging from 10–100 GB. The only difference between these two sets of tables is that one set uses
latin1 as
DEFAULT CHARSET and the other set uses
utf8mb4. The workload includes running a single GROUP BY query against the sysbench tables, one by one. In each run, the TempTable storage engine consumes all the available default 1 GB memory and overflows in a one-hop path.
From the testing, you can observe the following:
- Comparing tables using the
utf8mb4character set with those using
latin1, you can see a wide gap in the storage allocated during overflow, regardless of the overflow path taken
- Different overflow paths also contribute to the gap, and tend to make it wider on tables using the
utf8mb4character set as well
- In all overflow scenarios, the table size consistently serves as a good indication of the size of overflow
Note that MySQL 8.0 uses utf8mb4 as the default character set. Be aware of the potential impact of this change and be thoughtful when choosing the right character set for your tables.
RDS storage type
There are also differences in how efficiently the TempTable storage engine utilizes system resources. The following diagram shows an example of the correlation between query response time and RDS storage types under different overflow circumstances. The experiment is done by making two additional changes in the previous test environment. First, the two RDS for MySQL DB instances load the same set of
sysbench tables using
latin1 as
DEFAULT CHARSET. Second, for one of the DB instances, the 1 TB Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume is configured as 10k Provisioned IOPS (io1) while the other uses General Purpose SSD (gp2). Note that this 1 TB gp2 volume has the baseline performance at 3k IOPS.
From the above graph, you can observe the following:
- With the use of memory-mapped temporary files, queries run at the same speed on the io1 and gp2 volume at the beginning. As the time goes on, the burst credits of the gp2 volume get exhausted and queries on io1 volume start outperforming.
- When the overflow path changes to use the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table, different volume types stop showing an effect on query response time regardless of table size.
- For queries running on the gp2 volume, the InnoDB on-disk internal temporary table may show a better query response time than memory-mapped temporary files.
If you use Amazon RDS for MySQL and have options to choose the RDS storage type, you can consider using high throughput disk storage to help your workload to achieve optimal performance. An Aurora MySQL DB instance has a pre-configured local storage capacity and I/O bandwidth based on the instance class. You can scale up to a larger instance class to get more local storage and IOPS/throughput. It’s always beneficial to tune your query to avoid using the TempTable storage engine to process a large dataset.
Monitoring
CloudWatch provides metrics for you to have an overall view of the memory and storage usage at the DB instance level or DB cluster level. The following metrics are useful:
- FreeableMemory for both Amazon RDS for MySQL and Aurora MySQL
- FreeStorageSpace for Amazon RDS for MySQL
- FreeLocalStorage, VolumeBytesUsed, and AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal for Aurora MySQL
If you enable Amazon RDS Performance Insights for your DB instances, you can also query MySQL’s performance schema to monitor the memory and storage used by the TempTable storage engine. You can use the following SQL queries to get more insights from the performance schema:
Summary
In this post, you learned some of the best practices for configuring the TempTable
storage engine for optimal query performance of an RDS for MySQL DB instance or Aurora MySQL DB cluster. I hope this post gives you a better understanding of this new feature in MySQL 8.0 and makes it easier to use it with AWS’s managed database services.

Zaim spends his time criss-crossing five major cities, famously flying 200 times a year, usually from the UK — where he and his family live — to Hamburg, Germany, Montblanc’s headquarters and seat for its writing instruments; Florence, Italy, for leather goods; Le Locle, Switzerland, for watchmaking; and Paris, France, where two of his key designers live. Of course, he flies to other destinations for work as well as leisure.
The best way to describe Zaim — just under six feet tall and whippet thin — would be, with his approval, Keith Richards meets Dorian Gray. Articulate and with his flawless English taking on the faintest hint of a German cadence due to his schooldays and time spent going in and out of the Montblanc mothership in Hamburg, there is no denying Zaim cuts a striking figure — it is more rock star than creative director of a luxury goods conglomerate, really. But perhaps it is this very global approach and urbane spirit that allows him to intuitively tap into the spirit of the times and ensure that his finger is on the pulse of what today’s ever-discerning luxury market demands.

Pressurized ampule.
This is a small (1/8" inside diameter) vial of liquid xenon. It takes quite a lot of pressure to turn xenon gas into a liquid, so the vial is made of high-strength quartz glass, and it's embedded in a large cylinder of acrylic to contain the gas if the glass were to break. Hopefully the acrylic would be strong enough.
Actually there is only liquid in the ampule below 16C (61F), so at room temperature it's just gas. Fortunately it's winter now so I could easily cool my studio down to about 50F to photograph the 360 degree rotation I make of every new sample. This process takes half an hour (360 frames shot one every 5 seconds as the sample makes one complete revolution in 30 minutes). I put the sample in the freezer for a few hours, which got it about half full of liquid. You can see it evaporating slowly until only about a fifth of the ampule is liquid by the end of the rotation. (The rotation is shot very close up so all you see is the bit of liquid at the bottom of the vial.)

Universities are peculiar places that gather certain types of personality to them. It sounds weird but academics are full on and wear their subject like a favourite pair of jeans; all the time. Whilst the student body represents the cultural diaspora, academics are a rather narrow minded and small slice of that diversity partly due to that single mindedness of living in the depths of their research. It results in many peculiarities including the left of politics having its last bastion in some of those ivory towers.
My own days of bad hair and dodgy wardrobe as a postgraduate student, post-doctoral fellow, and eventually an academic, were a delight. I loved it. What I did not fully recognise at the time was why I liked it so much. One of the big reasons was that I was surrounded by people who understood, more or less, the topic areas of interest to me.
There I was in a department of biologists and environmental scientists, with people who had basically the same core understanding of how nature works. They didn’t know much about the politics and the social structures of the world, about people in general, but they knew a lot about biology, ecology and the biophysics of the environment.
I often remember that if you didn’t know your basic biology that could cause an embarrassing moment or two amongst your colleagues. As I was trained in my undergraduate years as an environmental scientist not a biologist, a few basics of genetics, photosynthesis and respiration, for example, had passed me by and people noticed.
The point I’m making is that awareness of basic theory and foundational understanding of nature was very high amongst your colleagues. When you had a conversation you could deliver most of what you were thinking and expect it to be understood by the person you were speaking to.
In recent times, I’ve realized that that is by no means a given in the real world.
When you speak to sensible folk in everyday world, awareness of some or all of the foundational understanding that I could take for granted as a trained ecologist chatting in the coffee room of a university department, is missing. Understandably, the technical detail and the deeper theoretical concepts are not there if you have not been through the program. And not everybody has. But the basic common sense of it all was present and correct.
Over the years I have learned to be a little less naive and to deliver potted versions of the concepts. Certainly not to dump all of the knowledge on an unsuspecting member of the public. However, even dialing down expectations of what people will understand to a fraction of what you know yourself may not be enough.
This statement lacks political correctness but stay with me.
At the moment many of the people I work with are educated in the environmental sciences and have decades of experience in rural landscapes. They advise landholders, their colleagues and ministers in matters of natural capital and agricultural production systems. I had made assumptions about what they would know — that soils underpin everything in production, that vegetation delivers livestock and that crops are aliens in most landscapes and need care and attention.
I also assumed an understanding of the policy frame and the politics of landscapes and the use of natural capital.
It seems reasonable to make such assumptions. These were professional people well educated, well-trained and you’d expect them to have some knowledge.
The reality is that my expectation reduction was nowhere near enough.
I had guessed that a reduction of the available knowledge by 80% of what I knew about a topic should be exceeded. That is what expectations should be, low enough to easily be exceeded; a version of the ‘under promise over deliver’ mantra of any good service company. This did not mean dumbing it down nor to assume ignorance just reducing the complexity to fundamentals so that the basics came across.
I had always expected that people would be okay with that and that they would recognize what I was trying to say. I expected responses with intelligence and from their perspective.
It turns out that delivering just 20% of what you know as an experienced academic is nowhere near enough reduction. You’ve got to cut much harder than that if you want your expectations to be met.
Now unmet expectations create a lot of stress for the person delivering information. I realize now that my big mistake was to overestimate the ability of people to understand nature and how humans use it.
I’m not talking about intelligence here, nor the ability to solve puzzles, to do math or the ability to find the tail end of a binomial distribution.
What I mean is a lack of basic understanding of phenomena that are happening in the world and their consequences for the rural landscape. Little things like knowing that we have eight billion people growing at eight thousand an hour. That almost all soil is under human management and at least 40% are in some sort of disarray as a result of that management.
Then there are some basic numbers that suggest future challenges for organizations involved with rural landscapes, even their own backyards. Some fundamentals that they really should know — average age of farmers in Australia is 58 with 50% of them working more than 49 hours per week, the debt to equity ratio of most farm businesses is very high where farmers have leveraged their properties in order to maintain their production systems and therefore giving themselves a very high debt load constraining any future innovation. Overall agriculture in Australia is under capitalised and there is a vast need for improvements to infrastructure particularly transport networks, but also in intensification of certain parts of the landscape and a desperate need to rest other parts.
Everyone should really understand that the challenge is how to get that investment. Where to get it from, what the financial instruments might be, who owns the risk, and who benefits from the risk?
These are the sorts of questions that should be simmering under the everydayness of any environmental role that is involved in any way with natural capital. And be talked about in tearooms and prior to meetings on Zoom. They should be the issues and questions that interest people. Unfortunately, they don’t.
At least not in recent experience. The generation that are currently in managerial and senior positions in environmental organizations, particularly in the bureaucracy, simply don’t have that frame of reference. Perhaps it’s a baby boomer story perhaps it’s a Gen X problem. Few seem to have the ability or the voice to put their organization into the broader context of what must happen in the world to stop humanity from major catastrophe.
People are parochial. I understand that. What’s going on in our backyard, what’s going on in the neighbor’s yard, and what’s going on overseas is increasingly distant to us. Such is normal human behavior ever since we started in tribes. But in the modern age when supply chains are universal — my wife ordered a parcel from the US which has gone via Los Angeles, Hawaii, Japan and still hasn’t arrived in Australia — these are global systems needing global solutions as well as local solutions.
The questions I have are these…
- Do I lower my expectation from 20% to 10% or 5% and make things even more simple than I do at the moment?
- Do I stop writing 20 page reports which have the detail in them and a one-page summary, which is the 20% that people might read and reduce that 20% to a headline?
- Do I keep plugging away with the 20%, sometimes going to 60%+, and hope for the best?
It goes against the grain to capitulate and it’s not the smart play because detail is important in these matters. There is a lot of information and understanding needed to make good decisions around how we use the landscape, how carbon is managed, how nutrients are managed, how we appropriate net primary production.
So I suspect that I must kick on with the conflict still in my head. Just keep trying.
And we need more people to try. More people to be educated around these matters and be able to communicate that information to others who might not have had the opportunity to learn about it.
More importantly, I encourage you to not shy away from the information and the understanding even if you don’t work in the environment or deal with where our food comes from, you still consume food, you have a diet and what you choose to put into your body is important for not only your own health, but also how we manage resource product resources natural capital use and food production into the future.
I struggle with the stress of trying to be able to make this connection to people over topics that they do not readily understand. And one day I’ll retire and stop doing it.
But for the moment I still keep the fire burning and encourage people to understand more about the world around them, it is after all in their interests and the interests of their great grandchildren.

As in the drawing of the Champions League in the UEFA Europa League, two Spanish club reached the semi-finals. One of the representatives of the Spanish La Liga was Villarreal - club aspiring to get into the Champions League zone at the end of the championship Spain 2015 - 2016. The Spanish company will be "Sevilla" is the current holder of the trophy.
Football fans witnessed the outstanding quarterfinal match of UEFA Europa League 2015 - 2016 between "Verulam" and Dortmund "Borussia". On the famous Enfield the British showed football character, having made sports feat. "Red" beat "Borussia" with the score 4:3 and advanced to the semifinals of the European League.

The schedule of the semi-finals of the Europa League
Football draw spread the two Spanish teams in the different semifinal pairs, which leaves a hope to the fans of La Liga to see a Spanish final. However, Sevilla and Villarreal will have to overcome a rather serious rivals in the semi-finals. The opposition for an exit in decisive match for the UEFA Cup the following:
- "Shakhtar" (Donetsk) - "Seville"
- "Villarreal" - "Liverpool".
The first semifinal match of the Europa League 2015-2016 will be held on the 28th of April on Thursday. The start time of confrontations 22:05 GMT. The Ukrainians and the players, "Villarreal" will start with home games.
Back sernikov planned for Thursday 5th may.
Among the finalists is the "Liverpool" is the second titlevest England team. The heroic feat of the current wards Jurgen Klopp in the match with Dortmund leaves a serious chance to win the British tournament, which will allow to Liverpool next season to play in the Champions League. However, the sport is unpredictable, it is impossible with absolute certainty to have to consider Liverpool's winner of the tournament.£2,800

1) If one posts a video of someone else acting inappropriately, is that lashon horah? He isn’t “saying” anything?
2) If someone is acting inappropriately and one tells others to come over and see it (live), is that lashon horah?
3) Is there a heter to post a video of frum Jews making a chillul Hashem for the purpose of “news” or “public interest”?
Answer:
The Chofetz Chaim says that loshon Hora is not only when it is done with words, but any way that communicates negative information about someone else, therefore this would be included.
- The answer to this would be the same as the last question.
- I don’t understand why “news” or “public interest” is a heter to talk loshon hora. Besides if someone is publicizing a chillul H-shem, that in itself is a chillul H-shem.

Thanks to the UV systems, the UV dosage of the water prevents the growth of the bacteria whose DNA structure is changed. UV disinfection systems consist of a stainless steel reactor, quartz sleeve, UV lamps and control panel. UV reactors made of polyethylene HDPE material are preferred in seawater containing high salinity, in swimming pools and in special processes. UV disinfection systems have a disinfection effect of 99.99%. The UV disinfection systems have an end-point effect and if the biofilm layer is present inside the pipe after the UV unit placed, the UV disinfection system will not have any sterilization effect at this point.

Septic tanks
Cross-section of a typical septic tank.
Irrigation with treated effluent is possible when septic tanks are used together with an aerated system that treats wastewater to a higher standard.
The septic tank usually has two chambers, separated by a dividing wall (a baffle) that has an opening halfway between the tank floor and roof to allow only the clarified liquid to move between the chambers. The septic tank usually has a manhole cover with two inspection ports
Wastewater enters the first chamber, where solids settle to the bottom and scum floats to the top. The scum forms an airtight layer that allows anaerobic digestion of the solids (microorganisms breaking down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen). This reduces the volume of solids.
The clarified liquid between the sludge and scum layers flows through the opening in the dividing baffle into the second chamber, where further settlement occurs. The partially clarified liquid then flows from the outlet into absorption beds or mounds where further nutrients and microorganisms are drawn from the liquid.
Common problems with septic tanks are:
- unanchored tanks rising out of the ground after rainfall
- stormwater accessing the tank because the tank is too low or run-off is not diverted
- high levels of sludge accumulating from lack of maintenance
- tank size too small for size of house (hydraulic load).
Effluent (treated wastewater) from septic tanks may be released onto your property through:
- amended soil mounds
- sand mounds
- absorption trenches and beds, and
- evapotranspiration absorption beds.Britain will charter what it said was a “second and final” flight this weekend to evacuate nationals from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the deadly novel coronavirus outbreak.
The civilian aircraft will leave Hubei’s capital Wuhan on Sunday bound for the Royal Air Force base at Brize Norton in southern England.
Medics and Foreign Office officials will be on board to provide support if necessary.
“We have been working round the clock to help British nationals leave Hubei province, on UK, French and New Zealand flights,” said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.
“The Foreign Office is chartering a second and final UK flight with space to help all British nationals and their dependents remaining in Hubei to leave.
“I encourage all British nationals in Hubei to register with our teams if they want to leave on this flight.”
Britain has advised all its nationals in China to leave.
Some 83 British citizens returned from Wuhan on a UK government-chartered flight from Wuhan to Brize Norton on Friday.
They were then sent into 14 days’ isolation at a medical facility in northwest England.
So far, there have been two confirmed cases in Britain, two relatives who had recently been to China.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC television that the pair remained in quarantine.
“There are two cases only here in the UK but we do expect more, so we are taking no chances,” he added.
Hancock said people returning from China would not be quarantined and should instead “self-isolate” at home and call medics if they show symptoms rather than go to a hospital, for fear of spreading the virus.
Eight British nationals and six of their family members left China on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday.
More than 24,000 people have been infected in China. The virus has already killed nearly 500 people.

You don't even have to suggest a craft or activity to follow these books - the kids suggest and ask for it themselves! I mean, what kid doesn't want to make a robot?
Here are the stories we read:
We played some robot games after each story, and these games helped us practice some essential early literacy skills like rhyming, vocabulary, and alphabet knowledge.
Then we created! Each class project serves as catalysts for further story discussion, it gets the kids' creative juices flowing, those imaginations start dreaming things up, and then they end up with a fun little reminder of that week's story to take home with them!

為了在中國獲得利潤豐厚的交易，摩根大通(JPMorgan Chase)採取了大銀行常常用來吸引客戶的各種餐飲招待策略。聯邦當局現在說，摩根大通還有辦法把跨越法律界限的交易洗白。
Federal prosecutors and regulators announced on Thursday a settlement of roughly $264 million with the bank and its Hong Kong subsidiary, accusing them of a vast foreign bribery scheme that may have spread to a number of Wall Street banks.
本週四，聯邦檢察官和監管機構宣布與該銀行及其香港子公司達成約2.64億美元的和解協議，他們指控摩根大通在境外大量行賄，而且可能波及華爾街的其他銀行。.
該案集中在摩根大通在中國的招聘工作上，該銀行聘用了中國領導者的子女在這個快速增長的國家贏得業務。當局說，一些有著優越社會關係的候選人其實並不合格，而且經常「執行輔助工作」——顯示了暗中行賄的跡象。
該案可為當局對其他大銀行進行懲罰打下了基礎。包括滙豐銀行(HSBC)、高盛(Goldman Sachs)和德意志銀行(Deutsche Bank)等銀行暗示，他們在中國的招聘活動正在面臨調查，這是從2013年開始的一個大清查行動的組成部分。
“We do not expect this to be the last action resulting from that sweep,” Andrew J. Ceresney, the head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told reporters on Thursday.
「我們並不認為這是此次大清查的最後一個行動。」證券交易委員會執行主管安德魯·J·塞雷斯尼（Andrew J. Ceresney）本週四對記者說。
It is unclear what will happen to the investigation under the president-elect, Donald. J. Trump. Mr. Ceresney and other officials who led the investigation are expected to leave the government in the coming weeks.
在當選總統唐納德·J·川普(Donald J. Trump)治下，這宗調查會怎樣發展目前尚不清楚。塞雷斯尼和其他領導調查的官員預計將在未來數週內離開政府崗位。
In the investigation of JPMorgan, it was not immediately apparent whether the bank would be accused of carrying out a quid pro quo arrangement, an issue at the heart of whether JPMorgan violated United States law governing foreign bribery.
在對摩根大通的調查中，該銀行是否會被指控進行了利益交換安排現在還看不出來，那是摩根大通是否違反了美國頒佈的外國賄賂法的核心問題。
The bank argued that the hiring of well-connected employees was routine in China, and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws.
該銀行認為，在中國僱用有良好人脈的員工是種慣常做法，是自己的招聘做法陷入了外國賄賂法的一個灰色地帶。
But the prosecutors and regulators say that as JPMorgan hired more and more candidates based on referrals from Chinese leaders, senior bankers in several instances explicitly tied those jobs or internships to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies.
但檢察官和監管機構表示，摩根大通聘用了越來越多的由中國領導者推薦的求職者，在幾個案例中，高級銀行主管明確地將那些工作或實習崗位與和中國政府運營的公司達成交易聯繫起來。.
用摩根大通自己的話來說，推薦來的求職者要想被聘用，就必須擁有「與商業機會的直接聯繫」，檢察官和監管機構表示，該公司通過這種做法來贏得或保住業務，為它及其附屬機構帶來超過1億美元的營收。
“The common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defense,” said Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office helped lead the criminal investigation into the bank. “This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.”
「人們通常認為這只是在海外開展業務時的做法，但這不能成為為它辯護的理由。這不再是正常的做生意，這是腐敗。」布魯克林的聯邦檢察官羅伯特·L·卡佩斯（Robert L. Capers）說。他的辦公室參與領導了對該銀行進行的刑事調查。
Still, the authorities acknowledged that JPMorgan cooperated extensively with the investigation and they lowered the penalty accordingly. The bank, the authorities stated, also disciplined nearly two dozen employees and “took significant employment action” that led to the departure of six employees who participated in the misconduct.
不過，當局承認摩根大通對這項調查非常配合，因此他們相應地減輕了處罰。當局稱，這家銀行對20多名員工進行了處罰，並「做出了重大的人事決策」，後者可能會導致6名參與不端行為的員工離職。
“We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged,” a JPMorgan spokesman, Brian Marchiony, said in a statement. “The conduct was unacceptable.”
「我們很高興自己的合作得到認可，」摩根大通發言人布萊恩·馬爾基奧尼(Brian Marchiony)在一份聲明中表示。「這種行為是不能接受的。」
“We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved,” Mr. Marchiony added. “We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.”
「我們在2013年停止了這個招聘項目，對參與的個人採取了行動，」馬爾基奧尼還表示。「我們也在改進自己的招聘流程，加強了對員工行為的高標準要求。」.
中國招聘調查於三年前在《紐約時報》的一篇頭版文章中首次曝光，之後便成為這家銀行不斷增長的監管麻煩中的首要問題。除了價值60億的所謂「倫敦鯨」交易醜聞，這家銀行還與美國司法部(Justice Department)就它導致2008年金融危機的抵押貸款證券銷售問題達成了130億美元的協議。就中國僱傭案達成的這項和解協議，解決了摩根大通僅剩的幾個令人頭疼的重要監管麻煩之一。
The United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn and the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington imposed a $72 million penalty on the bank but did not charge any of the bankers who doled out the jobs, though the investigation is ongoing.
美國布魯克林檢察官辦公室和司法部在華盛頓的刑事分支機構對摩根大通處以7200萬美元的罰款，但沒有對任何一個提供工作機會的銀行高層提出指控，不過調查仍在進行中。
The bank itself also secured a moral victory by avoiding criminal charges, and instead negotiated a rare nonprosecution agreement.
通過達成一個罕見的不起訴的協議，免遭刑事指控，摩根大通也獲得了精神上的勝利。
The S.E.C. will assess the largest punishment, about $130 million of the overall $264 million settlement, while the Fed will impose a roughly $62 million penalty.
美國證券交易委員會(SEC)的罰款占最大頭，即整個2.64億美元和解協議中的1.3億美元。與此同時，聯邦當局也將對它處以大約6200萬美元的罰款。.
摩根大通與其他全球性大銀行展開競爭，以便在中國國有企業選擇投行幫它們上市時，獲得利潤豐厚的業務。在某個時刻，一些摩根大通銀行高管層得出結論，覺得他們需要增加招聘，以便更好地與對手競爭。
“We lost a deal to DB today because they got chairman’s daughter work for them this summer,” one JPMorgan investment banking executive remarked to colleagues, using the initials for Deutsche Bank.
「今天我們有一樁生意輸給了DB，因為他們今年夏天聘用了董事會主席的女兒，」一名摩根大通投資銀行業務高管曾這樣對同事講。這裡的DB是德意志銀行的縮寫。.
摩根大通在亞洲的另一位常務董事曾寫道，這家銀行需要加強自己的客戶推薦項目，還表示人們覺得其他銀行「在這方面做的要好得多」。之後公司決定，對於來自決策者（有能力對一樁交易產生影響的中國客戶）的推薦會給予優先考量。.
摩根大通在十年前開啟了這個招聘項目，它在銀行內部被稱為子女項目。最初，這個項目曾試圖避免違反《反海外腐敗法》(Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)。這項使摩根大通案件得以成立的法律，根本上禁止美國公司為了「維持業務」贏得「不當優勢」，給外國官員提供「任何有價值的東西」。
But as the bank faced increased competition, and it expanded the program in 2009, senior JPMorgan bankers “institutionalized” the hiring, federal authorities say.
但聯邦當局表示，隨著這家銀行面臨更激烈的競爭，它在2009年擴大了這一項目，摩根大通銀行高層開始將這類招聘「制度化」。
They explicitly tied those jobs or internships to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies, the prosecutors and regulators say, using them as “a tool to influence senior officials.”
檢方及監管機構表示，他們明確將這些職位或實習機會與和中國政府的企業達成協議之間聯繫起來，把它們當作「影響高層官員的工具」。
“The so-called Sons and Daughters program was nothing more than bribery by another name,” Leslie R. Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, said in a statement.
「這所謂的子女項目只不過是另一種形式的行賄，」司法部刑事部門負責人萊斯莉·R·考德威爾(Leslie R. Caldwell)在一份聲明中表示。.
當局表示，在過去的七年裡，摩根大通應客戶、潛在客戶和外國政府官員的要求，先後僱傭了大約200名實習生和全職員工。在這些候選人中，有大約一半是由在中國國有企業和政府機構的官員所推薦。摩根大通在亞洲的高管便利用他們與這些政府機構的關係，幫助公司和客戶順利通過複雜的監管程序。
In late 2010, a JPMorgan employee in Hong Kong created a spreadsheet that tracked hires to specific clients. The spreadsheet included a column for the amount of revenue attributable to the hire.
2010年末，摩根大通在香港的一名僱員創建了一份電子表格，用以記錄來自特定客戶的招聘。這份表格裡有一欄記錄了各項招聘帶來的收入。
Many of the job candidates were unqualified, the authorities said, but JPMorgan hired them anyway.
當局表示，這些職位的候選人有許多都是不合格的，但摩根大通還是聘用了他們。The Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts has become hyper aware of how quickly things are changing from day to day.

It demonstrates the difference between the Green Revolution and Green Imperialism. Starting in Mexico, he toiled “for endless hours in the lab and in the fields to breed a wheat plant that was resistant to disease, thick-stemmed, and enormously productive.” Mexico’s wheat yield was six times higher in 1963, sixteen years after Borlaug’s arrival. Ninety-five percent of Mexico’s wheat was of “Borlaug’s dwarf variety.” Developing nations began sowing Borlaug’s crop. The results? “Global yields skyrocketed. Starvation rates decreased. Doom was postponed.”
Yet, environmental lobbyists attempted to block Borlaug’s expansion into Africa. They even convinced the World Bank, the Ford Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation to cut funding. While Borlaug was able to boost Ethiopia’s wheat yield to record levels, Africa is still steeped in starvation.
“Some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists…” he told The Atlantic. .”
But the post doesn’t stop there. It captures perfectly what is often wrong with environmental debates:
As with most debates, this one comes down to intrinsic values. From our lofty position in the developed world, we have the luxury to value the fallacious image of pristine, untouched nature over feeding ourselves. Hunger simply isn’t something that most of us are familiar with.
“These people have never been around hungry people,” Borlaug says of people like this. “They’re Utopians. They sit and philosophize. They don’t live in the real world.”
Proselytizing is easy. But try doing it when you’re starving.
2 thoughts on “The Man Who Fought Green Imperialism”
These two points of view clash everywhere. We are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who, like many members of the Church, have a 3-months supply of foods we normally eat, and a 1 year’s supply of staples, including buckets of hard white wheat. I’ve become sensitive to modern wheat, with it’s high gluten content, as are many people in the developed world. I’ve taken to using Einkorn wheat (also called Emmer and Farro wheat), which is the wheat used anciently in the fertile crescent, Egypt, etc. It’s much different than modern wheat, and the flour is dense and low gluten, tricky to use in bread and dessert recipes. Modern wheat seems to have been bred not only for yield and drought and pest resistance, but to concoct the modern desserts and breads we savor. However, should calamities occur, and starvation set in, you can bet your life, I’ll happily eat the modern wheat we have stored.
This article reminds me of “How the Other California Lives” in the Wall Street Journal a few days ago. California is suffering from the worst drought it’s experienced in years, with thousands of acres of farmland laying fallow from lack of water. Though central California is the ‘Salad Bowl of the Nation’, farmers are taking a half million farm acres out of production this year.
Environmentalists, also called Obstructionists, have convinced Gov. Brown, Senator Feinstein and others, that nothing is as important as the 3″ Smelt fish , and the reintroduced Salmon. So millions of acre feet of water (one acre foot of water is 396, 000 gallons) are diverted from the fertile fields to these fish. Never mind that much of our food stuff will be imported from Mexico and Chile this coming year because of the lack of agricultural water.. (While the govt./obstructionists blame the water shortage on climate change, the truth is that water deliveries have been diverted (stolen) during the last eight years from the farmers. They are being left high and dry…)
When we had a heaven sent rain happen in California more than a week ago, Brown and Feinstein quickly had 95,000 acre feet of water diverted away from the channels where the Smelt are, to pour into the ocean. Did any Environmentalist complain about what could happen to the salt water fish when the flood of fresh water hit their environs?

Many times a start-up company will need services, for example software development, but doesn’t have the money to pay for them. At that point, many founders offer to give their key contributors “a piece of the action” by issuing equity in the company in exchange for the services. The services contributor might be willing to accept that bargain because the ultimate value of the equity stands to be much greater than the value of the time put in. Sounds like a win-win proposition. However, there are numerous factors to consider before agreeing to such a deal, on both sides of the equ ...read more

"You're over-lawyering it!" is one of the most common complaints leveled by a client's representative at a transactional attorney. What usually precipitates the comment is when the lawyer returns an agreement drafted by the client's counter-party and the lawyer has lavishly decorated it with comments and edits.

He warns they could “fail completely” in the cold temperatures meaning they will not work next year.
However, he also warned of the very possible risk batteries could corrode”.
He said this may cause them to leak in a massive damage risk.
He said: “Batteries are another menace people tend to forget about.
“Leave them unattended for too long in the cold and they could fail completely.
“You must remove every battery, including from the batteries in clocks and remotes and especially your leisure battery.
“All batteries have the potential to corrode and leak over long periods of time, which could further damage the interior.”
According to the Camping and Caravanning Club, most motorhomes will have two types of battery.
A starter battery is used to start and run the engine, while a leisure battery provides steady power over a long period of time.

When most homeowners consider whole-home heating options, their minds are most likely to think of furnaces. But if energy efficiency is something that’s important to you, you may want to consider a heat pump. Which one is right for you?
The Difference Between A Furnace and Heat Pump
Most homes use furnaces, generally powered by gas or electricity. Gas furnaces have sealed combustion chambers that work to create heat whereas electric furnaces have electric heating elements (like those in space heaters, but a lot more powerful). Both types circulate air over their respective heating elements and throughout a network of ducts and vents throughout your home to provide heat.
Unlike furnaces, heat pumps don’t produce heat. Instead they pull heat in from outdoor air. The heat is condensed and then pumped throughout the home through a fan system.
Which one is the better option for your home?
There are a few things to consider when deciding which option to choose. A major factor to think about is climate. In temperate climates with mild winters, like Ohio, heat pumps are much more energy efficient. If you’re in a colder climate, however, a heat pump will likely struggle to keep your home warm enough. Something else to consider is that a heat pump also works in reverse to help cool your home. It does this by drawing hot air from inside of your home and pumping it outside.
Talk with an HVAC professional
If you’re unsure if a furnace or heat pump would be better for you, don’t hesitate to contact an HVAC technician to help you decide. Discuss whether your home and climate are appropriate for a heat pump, as well as the difference between initial costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs. Usually the initial costs of furnaces are much cheaper but you may also need to get ductwork installed, which can be costly depending on the size of your home. The up-front costs of a heat pump are made up over time.
Not sure which is the better option for you? Call A-Abel for a free estimate and consultation today to discuss your options!We tried channeling spring with our annual "Spring Activity Day." The first grade at my school has approximately one activity day a month. Apples Day, Pumpkin Day, Gingerbread Activity Day, Winter, Spring, and Ocean Activity Day are a few activity days we typically have. On an activity day, we set aside a few hours and a few fun activities centered around a particular theme. Parent volunteers come in to help and a great day is had by all. Here are some photos of our Spring Activity Day this year:
We made boats out of tinfoil (if you try this I recommend small sized squares such as 4x4). Students drew a picture to show what their boat looked like. They also predicted how many pennies it would take to sink the boat and recorded their estimates.
We put our predictions to the test by placing our tinfoil boat in water and counting how many pennies we added to the boat until it sank. We also determined if our result involved using more or fewer pennies than we predicted. We subtracted to get our difference in penny prediction counts and actual counts. If you are are interested in the worksheet I found it from Lakeshore Learning.
Of course you can't think of Spring and not think of flowers and planting. We reviewed the life cycle of a seed with this fun project. The students enjoyed tearing construction paper to make the seed, soil, and parts of the plant and they used colored pencils for the labeling. They came out really cute!
The duck was also popular:
Last but not least, we made pussywillows by tracing and cutting out a vase pattern, drawing stems, and adding tiny bits of cottonballs. They added the following poem to their projects: "Close your eyes and do not speak, and I'll rub spring across your cheek" -Aileen Fisher
Happy Spring!
Julie I love the themed days that you all do! How fun. We build the boats in my county in first grade too. It's part of our Science Olympics.
Ooooo Science Olympics sounds fun! Think you'll blog about it? I'd love to learn more about what you do with it.While going through roll rudiments recently I started to grow fond of the 7 stroke roll. It’s one that I never spent much time with but can see some technical benefits from this rudiment. Besides the standard 7 stroke roll there is also the tap 7 which starts with the accented note first. My thoughts… Let’s combine the two together and create an exercise.
Download The Free PDF Tap 7&7
In this exercise we will go through each rudiment (Tap 7/7 stroke roll) then combine the two together for a great exercise for stick heights and control.
Tap 7
Starting off with the downstroke followed by tap strokes for all the diddles. Be sure to keep the accented right down after the hit so that you are in position for the right handed diddle. Keep everything low except for the accented note.
7 Stroke Roll
The 7 stroke roll will start off with diddles and end with the accented left. Again keep everything low until you reach the last accented left.
Now that we have both rudiments down let’s place the two together to form the exercise! We will be playing four Tap 7’s and four 7 stroke rolls which will come together quite nicely. Repeat as many times as you like.
Take time to work through each rudiment gaining familiarity and comfort, then move on to the main exercise. Practice slowly and pay close attention to those stick heights! Make sure when you play the accented notes (Down Strokes) that you keep the stick low after the hit. Don’t let it rebound back up. The downstroke needs to stop low so that you set yourself up for the tap stroke immediately after.Pea Protein Cappuccino

Back in 2011, a national study by a team at UC Davis concluded that as American salaries grow into the upper echelons of middle income, so does fast-food intake…Now a new study, this time by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, weighs in on the matter. While the national survey did show that on a given day, roughly one-third of American children will eat fast food, the breakdown among income levels is pretty even..

The extracts below relate to Sino-Greek relations (in view of the 2008 visit to Greece by Chinese leader Hu Jintao) and the COSCO saga – i.e. the agreement for the Chinese shipping and logistics company to operate a terminal at the port of Piraeus. What is revealed – if the US embassy in Greece is to be believed – is how feeble and fatalistic Greece's diplomats are when it comes to defending the country's interests – China abuses and insults Greece, and like a battered wife Greece feels it can do nothing other than accept its punishment – and how imminent privatisation deals in Greece will likely be done.
The document from Ta Nea continues with another cable on Greece's doomed efforts to reform and liberalise the country's economy, but I've only included the opening remarks by the Americans regarding COSCO developments and the description of the workings of the mafia-type port authority trade unions. If the Greek people were wondering why their economy is a basket case, they would be advised to turn their attentions and ire not only on Goldman Sachs, the IMF and the country's politicians but also on the unbelievable (at least, to those of us exposed to Anglo-Saxon/northern European economies) unsustainable and crooked industrial practices that have developed in Greece since 1974.

SUBJECT: GREECE/CHINA: GREEKS SEE PRC AS MORE "AGGRESSIVE" DURING PRESIDENT HU'S VISIT
2. (C) People's Republic of China President Hu Jintao paid a state visit to Greece November 24-26. CHINESE VIEW
----------------
3. (C) In a readout for us of the visit, Chinese Embassy Political Counselor Liu Wei said the Chinese had three goals. The first was to repay Greece for the visit of President Papoulias to China and the support Greece had shown to China with the Olympics. Wei said it was important to the "Chinese mentality" to show gratitude…
4. (C) The second goal was renewal of Greek-Chinese friendship. Wei said Greece and China were not allies, as Greece and the U.S. were -- China did not make such alliances with foreign governments. But Greece and China were "comprehensive strategic partners," as established in their 2006 agreement. Wei defined precisely. Wei said Greece was the "most adamant" supporter of the one-China policy in the EU, and China was a strong supporter of the reunification of Cyprus. Such a convergence of views, he argued, made Greece and China "natural partners." Greece was one of China's strongest advocates in the EU, and the Chinese President promised during the visit that China would never do anything to harm Greece.
5. (C) Expanding "pragmatic cooperation," that is, economic and business interaction, was the third Chinese goal. Wei indicated.
6. (C). Wei admitted that the Chinese saw some difficulties in managing the Piraeus operation, due both to the global economic downturn and to Greek labor unrest. Greek dock workers continued to strike at the prospect of job or salary cuts under Chinese management, though Wei said China intended to have only one Chinese national running the container operation with an otherwise entirely Greek staff. Additionally, four other minor agreements were signed, including two removing obstacles to Greek agricultural imports to China (Wei said Greek agricultural imports were quite expensive compared to domestic Chinese products but were nevertheless necessary in the production of high-quality goods for export.) Other agreements covered cooperation between the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE) and the Chinese microchip supplier HUAWEI, and the sharing of programming between Chinese television CCTV and the Greek State-owned television ERT.
7. (C) Finally, when asked about potential military sales, Wei said there had been no such discussion during the visit. (NOTE: Greece has often helped cement deals or agreements in other areas through military equipment purchases. For example, at the same time that Greece was sealing the Southstream gas pipeline deal with Russia, it also agreed to purchase more than a billion dollars worth of Russian armored personnel carriers (BMPs). END NOTE.) China was "very prudent" in arms sales and did not want to upset the balance between Greece and Turkey. "Do no harm" was China's first rule in arms sales.
THE GREEK VIEW
--------------
8. (C) The Greek readout, provided by MFA A10 Directorate for Asia and Oceania deputy head Adam Adamidis, while covering the same basic territory as Wei's readout, was less positive and more cynical. Adamidis said the Chinese had "imposed" the visit on Greece, providing only a month's notice, which forced Greece to cancel or delay some other high-level meetings, such as the visit of the Cypriot President. This was in contrast to Papoulias' visit to China in June, for which the Chinese had required a year's preparation. It was not clear why the Chinese had forced their President on the Greeks at short notice, though apparently they wanted to conclude the COSCO port concession agreement as quickly as possible. Adamidis said the COSCO agreement had been stuck in the Greek bureaucracy for some time, but the visit had forced it out.
9. (C) During the visit, President Papoulias discussed most of the political topics, while PM Karamanlis confined himself to economic matters. The COSCO concession, Adamidis said, had been Karamanlis' idea. (NOTE: Press reports early on indicated that the Piraeus port concession was to be done by an open and fair competition, though as it developed politics may have played an increasingly significant role. END NOTE.) Adamidis took exception to the Chinese interpretation of the "comprehensive strategic partnership," saying that while Greece and China agreed on many things now, that certainly did not mean they would agree forever or on everything. At the same time, however, he conceded that Greece was in a "subordinate position," due to its very large trade deficit with China: 12 billion euro, plus Chinese shipyards were building 20 billion euro worth of Greek ships. Greece accordingly generally supported positions of importance to the Chinese. Adamidis noted.
10. (C) The Greeks clearly did not believe this show of support for China was reciprocated. Adamidis noted President Papoulias' discussion with Hu on the Macedonia name issue. He said Papoulias had told President Hu, "We support you on Taiwan, Tibet, and Market Economy Status, but we need your support on FYROM." Papoulias went on to note that Greece had been "furious" at China for being the first member of the UN Security Council to recognize "FYROM" by its constitutional name (1993). The Chinese reply was "We are going to accept any decision by the two parties for a mutually acceptable solution." The Chinese President had also warned Papoulias that if the Dalai Lama were permitted to visit Greece, it would have a "severe impact" on bilateral relations. Adding to this list, Adamidis mentioned with some disfavor as well that in the runup to the Olympics in China, the Chinese had agreed to have Greece help with security at the games but as the event approach, "they dumped us."
11. (C) Summing up, Adamidis said the Chinese had become much more "aggressive" of late. A few years ago, they treated Greece with more respect, but now they sought to impose their wishes on Greece.
12. (C) COMMENT: Due to its subordinate economic position stemming from its trade deficit and outstanding ship-building contracts with the Chinese, Greece apparently feels compelled to support Chinese positions on a range of international issues. But Greece evidently is not getting what it thinks it deserves in return, and the Greeks do not appear happy with the relationship. PM Karamanlis may be trying to turn this situation around with the concession to COSCO on the Piraeus container port -- assuming that the MFA report is true that he and not a competitive bidding process was ultimately responsible for the Chinese getting the concession. As is the case with Russia, the GOG appears willing to make concessions on current business deals to secure a better position later. But whether such a strategy will work -- either with China or with Russia -- may not be clear for some time.
SPECKHARD
=======================CABLE ENDS===========================
SUBJECT: Greece: Government Manages to Suspend Port Strike, But For
How Long and At What Cost?
1. SUMMARY: Confronting its first major challenge since taking office, Greece's new PASOK government negotiated a temporary suspension to a dockworkers' strike on October 17. Latching onto PM Papandreou's pre-election promises to re-examine privatization agreements, dockworker unions at the port of Piraeus went on strike October 1, demanding that the government scrap a concession deal granted to the Beijing-based China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) Pacific. COSCO is a shipping conglomerate scheduled to take over management of one of two existing cargo terminals on October 1 and to rebuild and manage a third terminal currently not used. The tentative deal to suspend the strike, about which few details are known, ended a 16-day saga that had paralyzed Greece's busiest commercial seaport, cost businesses and the government tens of millions of euro in lost revenue, and stranded over 10,000 shipping containers.
2. SUMMARY CONTINUED. On the surface, the suspension of the strike appears to be a win for the new government. But it was not the decisive pro-business, pro-competition conclusion for which many affected business and potential investors had hoped, and it remains unclear what the government promised dockworkers to go back to work and whether it can deliver. Despite the suspension of the strike, and depending on any further negotiations, the PASOK government will continue to face challenges placating the powerful dockworkers' union as well as other labor groups looking to exploit the government's pro-labor leanings. More significantly, PASOK's apparently ambivalent approach to upholding the terms of the COSCO contract--signed by the previous government and approved by Parliament--raises fresh doubts over Greece's ability to attract and retain foreign investors in the midst of a global financial crisis that is forcing all to compete for a dwindling and increasingly risk-averse pool of foreign direct investment (FDI). In a battle that serves as a microcosm for the innate tensions in Greece between social democratic instincts and efforts to modernize and make the economy more competitive in order to attract much needed foreign investment, the victor remains elusive.
COSCO: A Controversial Privatization from the Start
----------------------------------------
3. In November 2008, in the presence of former ND Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis and visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao, COSCO and the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP) signed a landmark 4.3 billion euro (6.4 billion USD) port privatization deal granting COSCO up to a 35-year concession to manage one of two existing terminals and to rebuild a third terminal at Piraeus, Greece's largest port, near Athens, and the top container port in the eastern Mediterranean. Under the terms of the contract, COSCO's Greek subsidiary was granted, after a transition period, the right to manage all shipping transactions at terminals II and III. In exchange, COSCO promised to: a) retain for the time being all employees that currently work at the two terminals it will oversee (approximately 600 out of OLP's current Piraeus workforce of 1,500); b) invest millions of euro to upgrade the terminals' container-handling capacity, more than doubling the port's current capacity, thus creating 1,000 new jobs; and c) reserve 10 percent of new hires for the qualified children of current unionized OLP employees. OLP, in turn, would retain exclusive control over the operations of terminal I. In the view of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry (EBEA), this landmark deal was a win-win for all parties. For the GoG, which managed to achieve a major agreement prior to the onset of the financial crisis in Greece, the privatization and resulting expansion of port capacity was seen as helping to create greater role for Greece in Mediterranean shipping and transport. Export and import businesses and consumers hoped to benefit from increased port competition, which would decrease processing fees and reform the inefficient and corrupt offloading process, bringing down shipping costs and the cost of consumer goods over time. For labor in general, the deal maintained intergenerational job security and provided the possibility of new jobs.
4. Dockworker and port authority employees' unions, which had been calling intermittent complete and partial strikes and refusing to work overtime and weekends since the government announced the international tender for the port's operations in early 2008, immediately criticized the deal in November and continued to refuse to work overtime or weekends. Coinciding with the negative effects of the global economic crisis on shipping worldwide, strike action resulted in the Piraeus port suffering the biggest decline in container traffic among the world's 100 busiest ports, caused several major shipping companies to temporarily forsake Piraeus for the Greek port of Astakos and other European ports, and increased the cost of transported consumer goods as a result of higher transport and processing costs. While no specific statistics are available, EBEA indicated to DepEconCouns that many Greek export businesses were forced out of business as a result of delays and increased costs.
Dockworker Unions: A Powerful, Corrupt Monopoly
5.The Dockworkers' Union and the Federation of Greek Port Personnel (OMYLE) have long held a labor monopoly over the operations of Greece's two major ports in Piraeus and in Thessaloniki. Controlling exclusive contracts with the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), the unions have reaped substantial financial benefits, with ironclad job security, guaranteed hiring privileges for the children of union members, and annual dockworker salaries in the range of 90,000 to 140,000 euro (135,000 to 210,000 USD), once overtime and other benefits are factored in--far above the average Greek yearly salary of 32,280 USD (National Statistics Services of Greece, data for 2008). According to union contacts, EBEA, and media reports, dockworkers also benefit from systematized corruption, manipulating the customs processing bureaucracy to expedite the containers of shippers who pay an extra fee--or holding up imports for those who refuse. All of this translates into what EBEA describes as the most expensive port in Europe in terms of fees and costs for shipping companies, importers, and exporters. Privatization and competition would change all this and lessen opportunities for rent-seeking behavior. Post's union contacts described the COSCO deal as threatening long-established dockworker salary levels and inter-generational job security, as OLP will need to cut costs in some way in order to stay competitive with the COSCO-operated terminals. Union officials noted that while they traditionally wield powerful influence within PASOK, they were willing to fight any government seeking to reduce their benefits…The state’s legislative session kicked off this week with a bang: an embarrassing and embarrassing loss in the Senate, a state Senate candidate losing to a challenger, and a statewide Democratic candidate losing a primary election to an opponent.
The story, as it turns out, is all over the place.
The state is facing some of the worst economic times in years, and the economy is expected to shrink by as much as 3.5% next year.
The budget deficit is estimated to be $6.9 billion.
And the state’s largest cities and counties are facing a severe funding crisis.
But it’s the Legislature that really gets the headlines.
In the last week, the Democratic incumbent, Democratic Assemblyman Scott Wiener, lost by less than 50 votes in a Democratic primary to Republican challenger Greg Cassella.
Cassellas had been running as a moderate, but has said that the state needs to do more to reduce the state income tax and raise more revenue.
“I am very concerned about the budget and the deficit,” Cassellsays.
“We have a $5.4 billion deficit.
That’s what we’re going to have to fix.”
In his loss, Cassellos’ Democratic opponent, Assemblywoman Jennifer Granholm, beat him by more than 600 votes.
She said that Republicans were out to take back the statehouse and blamed Cassellaus “campaign.”
“He was trying to be a moderate,” she said.
“He wanted to help people and that’s why I lost.”
Republicans, who control the Senate and House, say that they were able to pass the budget bill because Democrats and other Republicans didn’t have enough votes to pass it.
But the Democrats are blaming Democrats for not getting enough Democratic votes to approve the budget, and are also blaming the Republican governor for not vetoing the budget.
Democrats and Republicans have a history of arguing about who’s right.
The state budget debate began when Republicans controlled both houses of the legislature and were in a position to veto bills that would have increased spending.
Democrats in the legislature voted to increase spending, and Republicans voted to decrease it.
The two chambers of the California legislature have since had budget battles.
The last time the state was in the news was the fiscal year that ended in December.
The latest budget, which passed in March, was expected to increase the state debt by more then $5 billion.
The news cycle has also taken on a political bent, with both parties saying that they’ll do whatever it takes to defeat the other.
But that doesn’t mean they’ll always agree on what that means.Pick up any subject from your curriculum to study. Encountering a difficulty? Open up your gadget and type it in a search bar. You will be presented with hundreds of articles, videos, and podcasts, all answering your questions. The Internet made information accessible and affordable for all in a way that has created a dependency on online information accessible at anywhere, anytime.
Technology continues to affect every sphere of life and education is no exception. According to a survey by UNESCO, the 11 countries mentioned from Central and South Asia are using online learning platforms for learning.
These unprecedented times have also pushed Pakistan’s educational institutions to adopt online learning. Students are becoming more familiar with online systems and are showing mixed inclinations towards having a blended mode of learning.
Sarah, a student of Economics at Punjab University favors blended learning ‘if it is implemented with the right strategies.’
“I believe that the best way to improve the quality of education is to use both systems as complements of each other. By using pre-recorded sessions to deliver lectures so that every student can grasp the lecture at his or her own pace and later on discussing new ideas, questions, and discoveries in a traditional class”, she says.
There has been a considerable talk about online classes in Pakistan. A blended model is different from a completely online mode of learning. Even though students and teachers have become familiar with it because of the launch of the blended learning initiative by the Education Ministry in April 2021, there will be a rush to go back to traditional methods if we don’t fully understand what blended learning is.
What is blended learning?
It is simply a model that works on hybrid learning methods and is based on integrating face-to-face teaching models with digital learning to help students and teachers gain and learn more. In the context of Pakistan, there are three modules to work on.
Digital classroom setting
Have you ever felt like the teacher is moving too fast with a topic and you’re being left behind in terms of grasping the concept? You’re probably nodding right now. With blended learning, teachers will upload all of the course content, chosen by your institute, on the online platform. You will be able to study difficult concepts at your convenience.
Students have the luxury to pause, rewind and forward lectures, which enable them to learn at their own pace. This is important to improve our education system because all students do not learn in the same way. Having a blended learning system will cater to students’ personalized needs and make the classroom more interesting. Teachers will be able to teach at a slower pace and will have more time on their hands to give individual attention to students.
Aimen Aftab studies English Literature in Forman Christian College and ‘finds it really hard to connect with the teacher/class on screen’. For Aimen, attending online classes was more difficult than actually studying for them.’
This is because even in online settings, the traditional instructor-assignment model is followed in Pakistan and innovative practices are only limited to a few private institutes.
Traditional classroom setting
With the blended learning system, traditional methods and techniques will be curtailed. Instead, teachers will have to redefine the classroom. The classroom setting should be redesigned in a way that students can fully use this setting to find practical solutions to the problems they came across during independent study. Along with this, there is a dire need to plan more outdoor learning activities and design unorthodox exercises that put theory into practice.
To make their classroom more interactive, teachers will have to abolish the instruction-assignment model and incorporate blended learning strategies.
A blended learning strategy
Both of these systems should complement each other in a way that they surpass their individualistic benefits. This is perhaps, the most difficult module to work on.
If the face-to-face setting is only a repetition of what students gained during online and independent learning, then learning losses might continue.
On the other hand, if all the educational content is unleashed online, then the time that can be used to have outdoor and practical skill-building experiences will be misspent along with a loss of feedback from students. In the same way, if teachers only deliver through a face-to-face setting along with giving uncontrolled reading assignments online, then that would also subdue the individual learning process.
Interestingly, various institutions around the world are adopting blended learning methods and technologies. Many of these institutions are also providing technology e.g. smartphones and laptops to their students to equip them for the new system. However, to be able to consider your institutions as having a blended learning system, it is crucial to completely follow the model of blended learning and embrace its essence that focuses on integration of online learning with classroom learning.
Why blended learning in Pakistan?
In this report by Dr. Krasulia, she highlights that blended learning increases the student base by providing remote access to educational resources. It also enables ‘On-demand learning’ as students can study the course content at their own pace i.e. rewind and forward video lectures. More time for teachers to give individual and personalized attention and devise more ways to keep track of their student’s unique capabilities. Many studies have proven the importance of peer discussions and the way they can move the students to be more communicative and interactive.
One of the models of blended learning is the flipped classroom model in which teachers encourage students to engage in problem-solving and skill-building activities during the physical classroom sessions. Using LMS to build fair assessments that can be graded automatically. LMS will further equip teachers with a methodical measure of their students’ performances as it will record and store students’ assessment scores. Teachers can analyze poor performance and work on them more quickly. Education will become more affordable as course content will be uploaded online and the need for textbooks will be eliminated.
The catch
Dr. Krasulia also mentions some perils in her report. While the blended learning model is applicable in most societies and structures, it will still be essential to analyze the course and student base to ascertain whether blended learning will be right for a particular subject matter.
This system also requires the latest tools and reliable digital platforms for student learning. There is a strong risk of increased dependence on technical resources. Studies have revealed that a lot of students prefer watching videos in one set usually after the given time slot.
Teachers have also complained that the online feedback process is more time-consuming than doing it in a physical setting. Strong partnerships with learning management systems and ensuring the provision of the internet are also essential along with conducting further researches.
The-bottom-line
Blended learning is becoming increasingly popular and many countries are devising innovative ways to use it. It is also not a new concept and many universities around the globe have already employed this model. There has been an increase in research, lately, to achieve perfection and truly reap the benefits of blended learning.
The digital migration that took place in the wake of the pandemic was massive in scale and has thereby changed consumer behavior. Technology has found a more essential place in human lives and humans are continuing to evolve. In the coming years, catering to such changes in learning behavior will make educational models like blended learning more compatible as compared to traditional learning methods.Monthly Archives: November 2014
Colliers International l Pittsburgh Gets Greener With New “Tablet Tours”
Sources: World Wildlife Fund
Colliers International | Pittsburgh has created a new marketing strategy that will reduce paper waste and help save our environment one tree at a time. The company now uses electronic tablets instead of printing paper copies of tour books, company overview books, Offering Memorandums, presentations and other marketing materials. These materials that contain anywhere from ten to 100 pieces of paper, depending on the project, can now be sent electronically after a tour is completed.
According to Gregg Broujos, Managing Director of Colliers International | Pittsburgh, the new Tablet Tour is convenient for all parties, and saves a large amount of paper. “When prospective tenants and buyers tour a property, they will be given a Colliers International | Pittsburgh tablet that contains all of the pertinent information on the subject property. After the tour, they give the tablet back to the Colliers broker, and the Colliers broker will send the same information to the prospective buyer or tenant electronically. In this way, the prospect can pick and choose what pages they want to print, if any.”

Q3 2014 Pittsburgh Industrial Market Report
Q3 2014 Trending Upward
As expected the third quarter was an active quarter for lease executions. Net absorption for the quarter was 950,000 SF putting year to date absorption at just under 1,500,000 square feet. This already exceeds 2013’s total absorption of 1,150,000 square feet. With the current activity in the market there is no reason to think the trend will not continue into the fourth quarter. All indications are that 2014 will have a year end positive absorption that hasn’t been witnessed since 2008.
The only down side to this activity is we are still not seeing the market react with corresponding speculative development. Users (whether they be tenants or buyers) seeking quality space over 100,000 square feet now have only three options in the entire Southwest Pennsylvania market. We do see some light on the horizon with several hundred thousand square feet of speculative building in the pipeline, but this is just not enough to satiate the market’s appetite.

Q3 2014 Office Market Report
The Pittsburgh office market continued its steady growth during the third quarter with increased absorption and an unchanged vacancy rate of 8.4%. The average asking lease rate was up over last quarter to $19.97 per square foot, an increase of 0.7%. Class “A” space continues to be in strong demand, especially in the CBD where the vacancy rate is 6.84% and large blocks of space are scarce. Suburban class “A” space has a higher vacancy rate of 9.1%, with large vacancies in the Cranberry, Monroeville and Parkway West submarkets.
Lease rates have general held steady or increased over the quarter. Overall, asking lease rates for the CBD are $21.84 with suburban asking lease rates coming in at $19.20. The average lease rate for the entire market is $19.97, which represents a healthy increase over the average rate of $18.79 quoted at this time last year.
Absorption for the quarter was 404,283 square feet, the largest amount since fourth quarter 2012. The largest transactions during the quarter were Express Scripts’ lease for 70,000 square feet and EQT’s lease of 30,000 square feet at Zenith Ridge Two. It is anticipated that absorption should continue to be positive for the near term although new deliveries may hold the occupancy rate in check. A number of new projects are on the drawing board, but not many will be built on a speculative basis, and those that are built speculatively will be relatively small. With the exception of the Gardens at Market Square (159,000 SF), the most speculative construction is under 100,000 square feet.

A distributed ledger allows transferring the rights of an asset through cryptographic tokens that can represent such assets off-chain. Currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum accomplish that with purely digital assets, but many blockchain companies are now working on solutions that would help us tokenize real-world assets such as gold or real estate. Cutting out the middleman will also lower the asset exchange fees and accelerate the process significantly.

Traditional banking institutions underwrite loans by using a system of credit reporting. With blockchain, we’re looking at the future of peer-to-peer loans, faster and more secure loan processes in general, and even complex programmed loans that can approximate syndicated loan structure or mortgages.
Banks that process loan applications evaluate the risk by looking at factors such as credit score, homeownership status, or debt to income ratio. To get all of that information, they need to ask for your credit report provided by specialized credit agencies. In the United States, that amounts to three institutions.
Such centralized systems are often harmful to consumers because they contain erroneous information. Moreover, concentrating such sensitive information within a small number of institutions makes it very vulnerable. For example, last year, one of them, Equifax, got hacked, and exposed the credit information of over 145 million Americans. Now you can see why blockchain offers a more secure, efficient, and cheaper way of processing loan applications.,. Naturally, storing this type of information on a blockchain also ensures its security..

One holiday is also upon us, although one that’s celebrated more widely across the pond than it is here in Scotland and the UK.
Thanksgiving is the holiday of gratitude, where people predominantly from the North American continent come together with family and friends to express thanks for things that have happened throughout the year.
Here’s all you need to know about the American holiday of Thanksgiving, including how to celebrate in Edinburgh.
When is Thanksgiving 2021?
Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States.
This year, American Thanksgiving falls on November 25th.
The holiday dates back to the earliest settles in Massachusetts who shared food with the Wamanoag Native Americans there.
It’s often thought that Thanksgiving and Black Friday are connected, but Black Friday is a term that was actually coined in Philadelphia.
Philly shoppers flocked to the shops on the day after Thanksgiving, ahead of a big Army-Navy American football game the day after.
There were so many shoppers that retail workers were overwhelmed and shoplifters were able to take advantage of the chaos.
As a result, Philadelphia police named the day Black Friday, but it doesn’t really have much of a connection to Thanksgiving, only that it always falls the day after.
In Canada, they do celebrate Thanksgiving.
However, they celebrate the holiday on the second Monday of October.
Canadian Thanksgiving will be on October 10th in 2021.
Where is Thanksgiving celebrated?
Thanksgiving is predominantly celebrated in the United States and Canada, with its origins in Massachusetts, a state in New England in the Northeastern United States.
Nowadays, however, celebrating Thanksgiving as spread across the globe, as American and Canadian expats travel and settle in other countries, bringing the Thanksgiving traditions with them.
How to celebrate Thanksgiving in Edinburgh
Traditionally, turkey is the main component of a Thanksgiving meal.
This is because turkeys were very common in Massachusetts, the home of the holiday.
In addition, you might want to cook turkey stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, corn, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie.
In many way, a traditional Thanksgiving is similar to a British Christmas dinner.
Naturally, if you’re celebrating Thanksgiving in Edinburgh, you should also remember to give thanks for whatever you’re grateful for from the last year.
Families often say what they’re thankful for out loud before or after eating a Thanksgiving meal together.
As Thanksgiving is not widely celebrated in the UK, there are no official parades or public celebrations in Edinburgh like there often are in the United States and Canada.
However, the main focus of Thanksgiving is on spending time with loved ones and giving thanks, so you can still load up with food and gather together for the holiday.
Do you say Happy Thanksgiving?
If you’ve got friends or loved ones who celebrate Thanksgiving, you might be wondering how to wish them well for the holiday.
Here are a few common Thanksgiving greetings you can use during the holiday:
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Have a blessed Thanksgiving!
- Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.A friend sent me this post from Hands Free Mama last week and I absolutely love the words.

I LOVE this. Brought some cleansing and realization tears. I need and want to soften. Thanks for sharing her post and also for sharing so faithfully and honestly with us. I always look forward to what you will share each day and it seems it’s always what I need to hear. : )
Rachel!! I needed these words too! So glad they got passed along for me to share with you! Thank you for reading and commenting, friend 🙂 you’re an encouragement to me and I’m so very thankful!
We live in such a fast paced world. We all need to slow down and cherish the time with family!
Yes!! And I’m glad that you are making decisions to do just that, especially with work!!Background provided by the Instructor: I just wanted to share how stunning it is that some students continue to equate “feminist” with “hates men.” I happen to teach a class where we discuss gender issues, including violence against women. Here is one of my course evaluations from a male in the class:
I took this class as an elective. It is obvious that our teacher is a feminist and hates men since she talked about issues like domestic violence being a problem and how rape is also an issue for girls. It is clear she hates men …. why else would she bring these up in a class on gender roles. As a guy I was really uncomfortable hearing her tell us about the studies.As an admin, I created the new user and assigned him user role who is basically able to view dashboards / searches.

ThanksTo create such an alien tentacle snake as shown in the video, ignite a small pile of cigarette ash and 3–5 table spoons of spiritus with 2–3 tablets of sodium bicarbonate (baking powder) and sugar (e.g., Emser pastilles).
The sugar melts when heated. It first becomes brown and finally burns to black, solid carbon (C12H22O11 → 12 C + 11 H2O). At the same time, the sodium bicarbonate decomposes (2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O). This releases CO2 that inflates the liquid sugar so that a very light, foamed mass is formed, which pushes itself as a "black snake" or alien out of the flame as more and more of it is formed. The snake mainly consists of carbon from the heated sugar.

Canadian airlines wait for federal aid package to help travel industry survive COVID-19 Back to video
Passenger revenue is expected to drop by US$64 billion in North America and US$314 billion globally in 2020 compared to last year, according to updated estimates from the International Air Transportation Association, which represents 290 airlines comprising 82 per cent of global air traffic.
With new estimates predicting domestic air travel won’t recover until summer and international travel until the end of the year, Canadian airlines are advocating behind the scenes for government aid — quickly.
The National Airlines Council of Canada has been pressing for measures including liquidity, a break from fees such as airport rent and taxes, and updated regulatory measures that could simplify operations in the short term.

The road to recovery will be difficult, but this Canadian company has its eye on the future
Individual airlines have been reluctant to discuss specific requests publicly lest they strike the wrong message with officials holding the purse strings.
But the industry is eyeing the US$25 billion aid package the United States announced for 10 of its major carriers earlier this week. That relief package intends to cover salaries until September, includes grants, low-interest loans and equity warrants that give the government the option to buy the airlines’ stocks. Airlines have agreed not to cut jobs or pay for the duration of the aid.

If Canada adopts a similar strategy, Air Canada could be eligible for more than $1 billion in aid on top of the wage subsidy, Scotiabank analyst Konark Gupta noted to clients this week.
“We believe any substantial incremental financial aid, depending on the terms, could potentially lift investor sentiment as concerns have risen about AC’s balance sheet coming out of this downturn, particularly given uncertainty around the extent of COVID-19 impact,” Gupta noted.
Air Canada already plans to adopt the emergency wage subsidy covering up to 75 per cent of salaries to a maximum of $847 per week for at least 16,500 of its employees.
WestJet also intends to use the wage subsidy for the 6,400 workers it previously laid off. This week, the Calgary-based airline also sent layoff notices to 1,700 pilots effective May 1 or June 1, planning to keep them on payroll under the wage subsidy program as long as it’s in effect. WestJet will not top up the remaining 25 per cent for inactive employees, spokeswoman Lauren Stewart said in an email. It will have 569 pilots left after June 1.

On Friday, Transat A.T. Inc. also said it plans to use the wage subsidy to rehire 4,000 employees it had temporarily laid off after halting all flights.
While the wage subsidy expires in June — for now — load factors are expected to be significantly lower than normal for the remainder of 2020 with travel restrictions expected to stick around until at least fall, National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen noted to clients this week.
“Even if restrictions are eased, quarantine rules may make international travel for all but essential travel impractical,” Doerksen noted. “We wonder how many people will be willing to travel internationally given that most international events such as festivals, sports, and conventions have been cancelled until at least the fall. Furthermore, will tourist sites even by fully open by the summer?”
As airlines deal with these existential questions, they continue to look to the government for support.
“Once the government-imposed travel restrictions are lifted, we have every intention of recalling our employees as soon as it’s feasible, but have been clear that we will need economic support from the Government of Canada to preserve our business and ensure Canada’s air transportation industry survives this pandemic,” holiday travel airline and tour operator Sunwing Airlines Inc. said in a statement this week.Approach.
Pharmacologic Treatment Regimens
Uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonococcal infection
Treatment for uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonococcal infection is ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscular (IM) given in a single dose.
Treatment for coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis with oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) should be administered when chlamydial infection has not been excluded. Ceftriaxone is safe and effective in pregnant women and probably destroys incubating syphilis. Its major drawback is the necessity for IM administration.
A review of the recommendations for antimicrobial treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea in 11 East European countries showed ceftriaxone (250-1000 mg IM once) was a first-line antimicrobial in all of them. [57] (However, many of the second-line and alternative treatments were less than ideal, with regionally manufactured antimicrobials predominantly used.)
Data have indicated that the 400-mg oral dose of cefixime does not provide a bactericidal level that is as high or as sustained as that of the 250-mg dose of ceftriaxone and provided a lower cure rate for pharyngeal gonorrhea. The oral cephalosporins cefpodoxime and cefuroxime seem to be inferior and have less desirable pharmacodynamics. [58, 59] In addition, based on findings from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), reported July 2011, from 2009-2010 a decreasing susceptibility to cefixime was found. [60] In response, the CDC issued revised guidelines that do not include oral cephalosporins as first-line treatment. [6]
Alternative treatment options or cephalosporin allergic
In patients who are cephalosporin allergic, a single 240 mg IM dose of gentamicin plus a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin is an option. [6] . Be aware of treatment-limiting adverse gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, vomiting) of both of the cephalosporin-allergic regimens, 7.7% and 3.3%, respectively. A single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime is an alternative regimen. However, cefixime does not provide as high, or as sustained, bactericidal blood levels as does ceftriaxone and demonstrates limited treatment efficacy for pharyngeal gonorrhea.
Another alternative regimen for patients intolerant of cephalosporins include is spectinomycin (2 g IM). Spectinomycin may be costly and is currently unavailable in the United States.
A test-of-cure is unnecessary for persons with uncomplicated infection, except for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended using culture or nucleic acid amplification tests 7–14 days after initial treatment, regardless of the treatment regimen. CDC advises that clinicians should perform susceptibility testing in patients who fail to respond to treatment and notify their local public health STD program. [61]
Monotherapy with azithromycin is not. [62]
Drugs that are not primary treatment options
Prior to 2007, fluoroquinolones were the preferred class of antimicrobials for the treatment of gonorrhea; however, reports surfaced of N gonorrhoeae infection with decreasing susceptibilities and frank resistance. In addition, United States gonococcal strains with elevated MICs to cefixime are likely to be resistant to tetracyclines but susceptible to azithromycin.
In August 2012, the CDC announced changes to susceptibility, new guidelines were issued that no longer recommend oral cephalosporins for first-line gonococcal infection treatment. [63]]
However, if a patient has an absolute contraindication to cephalosporin and other viable antibiotic options are limited, a fluoroquinolone may still have a role in treatment. In these situations, sensitivity testing would be necessary in the event of treatment failure.]
When treating an arthritis-dermatitis syndrome, CDC guidelines allow for switch to an oral antibiotic, when guided by susceptibility testing, after 1-2 days of significant clinical improvement is documented to complete a total course of at least 7 days. [64]
Gonococcal conjunctivitis
Treatment recommendations for adults are single doses of ceftriaxone 1 g IM plus azithromycin 1 g PO with saline irrigation. [1, 65]). [66]
In disseminated infection, it is important to evaluate for evidence of meningitis and endocarditis. Inpatient management and consultation with an infectious disease specialist to decide upon initial regimen are recommended, especially in patients who may be noncompliant with therapy, in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, who have purulent arthritis, or who have other complications.
Gonococcal meningitis and endocarditis
Current recommendations in the treatment of gonococcal meningitis and endocarditis are to use ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV every 12-24 hours plus azithromycin 1 g PO for 1 dose. The exact duration of therapy and any alteration in antibiotics should be discussed with an infectious disease specialist. Of key importance are antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the patient's clinical response to empiric therapy. The 2015 CDC guidelines recommend 10-14 days of parenteral therapy for meningitis and at least 4 weeks of parenteral therapy for endocarditis. [64]
See the 2015 CDC STD treatment guidelines for treatment of gonococcal infection in children and newborns. [64]
Per the 2015 CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a test-of-cure is no longer needed for patients with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with recommended or alternative regimens.
However, patients with pharyngeal gonorrhea treated with an alternative regimen should be tested for 14 days after treatment and be tested for cure with NAAT assay or culture. Confirmatory testing of the repeat NAAT assays that are positive and further antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be needed.
In many cases, "treatment failure" may result from reinfection from sexual partners who have not received appropriate therapy.
Reevaluation 3 months after treatment is recommended by the CDC. This is distinct and different from immediate test of cure. If 3-month retesting is not possible, the patient should undergo repeat screening at the next medical encounter, within 12 months of treatment.
Instruct patients with uncomplicated gonococcal infections to follow up with a primary care physician or public health provider to reduce the risk of future infection.
Early follow-up care and culture with antibiotic sensitivities are indicated in patients with unresolved or recurrent symptoms despite therapy.
Patients with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) who are treated in an outpatient setting must receive follow-up care within 24 hours.
Deterrence and Prevention
In an effort to minimize transmission of gonorrhea, patients should refrain from all sexual activity for at least 7 days after treatment, and all sexual partners should also undergo appropriate treatment.. [67, 68]. [69]). [70, 71] While designed to prevent reinfection with chlamydia and gonorrhea, the recommendations can also be applied to other STDs. The ACOG recommendations include the following:
- Expedited partner therapy to prevent reinfection, with legalization of expedited partner therapy
- Counsel partners to undergo screening for HIV infection and other STDs
- Expedited partner therapy contraindicated in cases of suspected abuse or compromised patient safety; pretreatment evaluation for abuse potential recommended
- Expedited partner therapy medications and protocols based on CDC, state, and/or local guidelines
Screening
Because of the health risks from asymptomatic gonorrhea, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends gonorrhea screening of women who are at increased risk for infection, including the following [72] :. [28]
PRO-2000, an antimicrobial gel for the potential prevention of HIV infection, is in phase 3 trials for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, in Africa. [73]
HIV Infection
Patients with HIV infection should undergo the same medical and surgical therapy as patients without HIV infection.
-Micro "[u]pon the information currently available to MPT and its belief." MPT twice amended its infringement contentions.
Plasma-Therm then moved to strike MPT's infringement contentions, arguing MPT lacked diligence in their preparation. The Court denied the motion to strike, noting that while the contentions were "sparce," they gave notice of MPT's preliminary theories. The Court also noted that the parties would have an opportunity to serve final contentions later in the litigation.
A month later, MPT filed its counterclaims asserting patent infringement (and other claims). Plasma-Therm moved to dismiss those counterclaims. Two weeks later (before MPT responded to the motion to dismiss), Plasma-Therm sought sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 for MPT's failure to conduct a proper pre-suit inquiry before asserting its patent infringement counterclaims.
The next day, the Court construed a number of terms the parties has disputed, adopting Plasma-Therm's constructions. Shortly thereafter, MPT voluntarily dismissed its counterclaims and the case settled in full, but for resolution of the sanctions motion.
MPT offered four defenses to the sanction motion:
- its counterclaims were compulsory, so it had to file them at an early stage of the litigation;
- the sanctions motion is better resolved as a motion to dismiss;
- the standard for pre-suit investigations is different for method patent claims than product claims; and
- its pre-suit investigation was reasonable in light of its "good faith constructions.
As to the counterclaim being compulsory:
the fact that a counterclaim may be compulsory does not excuse a litigant or counsel from compliance with Rule 11. See e.g. View Eng'g, Inc. [v. Robotic Vision Sys], 208 F.3d 981, 986 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (affirming Rule 11 sanctions on defendant who filed counterclaims of patent infringement without reasonable inquiry following plaintiff's declaratory action seeking to have defendant's patent declared invalid, or in the alternative, a finding of no infringement).As to the sanctions motion being better resolved as a motion to dismiss:
The Court disagrees. With respect to patent infringement claims, Rule 11 asks whether there was, at a minimum, a reasonable basis for a finding of infringement. Thought not the only factor, the content of the pleadings is relevant to that analysis.As to the legal standard for sanctions in connection with method claims:
None of the cases MPT cites support its theory that a different pre-filing standard exists with respect to patent infringement claims involving a method. Q-Pharma, Inc. [v. Andrew Jergens Co.], 360 F.3d 1295, 1300-01 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (analyzing a patent “directed to a method” and stating that “[i]n the context of patent infringement actions, we have interpreted Rule 11 to require, at a minimum, that an attorney interpret the asserted patent claims and compare the accused device with those claims before filing a claim alleging infringement”); PPS Data, LLC [v. Athenahealth, Inc], 2012 WL 601208, at *1 (describing pre-filing analysis). Other case law on the topic of Rule 11 sanctions does not support MPT’s assertion, either. See, e.g., Judin v. U.S., 110 F.3d 780, 784 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (analyzing whether claimant and attorney adequately compared accused devices with patent claims involving a method). Therefore, the Court finds no basis to adopt MPT’s contention that it did not need to conduct a factual inquiry prior to filing suit.As to the reasonableness of its pre-suit analysis:
Here, MPT has not shown why, prior to filing suit, MPT believed its claim of infringement was meritorious. MPT has not compared any product, process, or method utilized by Plasma Therm to the patents-in-suit. Nor has MPT even identified any such product, process, or method utilized by Plasma-Therm against which the patents-in-suit could have been compared. See Judin, 110 F.3d at 784 (Viewing an alleged infringing device “may have been sufficient to put Judin on inquiry about whether the Government was using a device that infringed his patent. But Rule 11 requires more. It requires that the inquiry be undertaken before the suit is filed, not after.”).
The only explanation MPT gives as to why it believed it had a reasonable chance of proving infringement is provided in a footnote, in which MPT states that “if Plasma-Therm practiced the disputed claims in the way Plasma-Therm implies it did in its claims constructions it would infringe the claims as construed by MPT.” Doc. 111 at p. 2, n. 3. But Plasma-Therm’s claim construction brief does not explain its own products, processes, or methods. Rather, PlasmaTherm’s claim construction brief describes only the patents-in-suit, including the specification and prosecution, to explain why the disputed claim terms should be construed as Plasma-Therm suggests. To the extent MPT draws inferences about Plasma-Therm’s product, processes, or method from Plasma-Therm’s advocacy of certain claim constructions, this is not explained. Nor would such inferences have necessarily been reasonable and sufficient for MPT to meet its burden under Rule 11 given the Court’s rejection of MPT’s claim constructions. See Source Vagabond Sys. Ltd. [v. Hydrapack, Inc.], 753 F.3d 1291, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2014).Summarizing its analysis, the Court noted that "neither MPT nor its counsel even suggest that they attempted to apply the claims of the patents-in-suit to any accused device, method, process, or product of Plasma-Therm. The failure of MPT and its attorneys to make a reasonable inquiry before filing the frivolous infringement counterclaims warrants Rule 11 sanctions."
Motion for sanctions granted.

And beer drinking isn’t so much a quandary as a given. Particularly during the pandemic that is not a quandary.
And you might be wondering (or you might not, but let’s just pretend) why, when I’m playing in the virtual open mic to benefit Poor David’s Pub and the Kerrville Folk Festival tonight, and have a big show on Friday (also at Poor David’s Pub) that I’m promoting, I’m taking time to worry about beer. And there it is folks, the pandemic in a quandary bottle (or can) with beer on the label.
Actually, I’m not so much worried about beer. There’s some in the refrigerator. It’s just that I’d like to go back (or forward) to feeling like I earned a beer. “I’ve done a hell of a lot today. Damn, I deserve a beer.” Rather than, “why the hell not, I’m not going anywhere.”
I still work of course (can you see me now), and Cyndy works from home too, but we don’t really DO anything. Even when I social distanced my butt to Colorado, stayed with our friend, Sally, and played a live (safe) show, that’s all we did. I got there, we hung out, went to my show, came back, hung out some more, and I came home. No sight-seeing, no going out for a beer, no nothing.
What would going out for a beer matter when I don’t (in my mind) deserve it. Or I deserve it, but I just can’t enjoy it. It’s sad when you can’t fully enjoy a beer.
And that’s my quandary. That, and I’ve run out of ways to use quandary. There’s nothing to do but ride this damned thing out like we’ve been doing for what seems like an eternity.
Come to think of it, I may have another idea. I’ll have a beer and get back to you.

Add comment really works and the volume it gives is unbelievable. I only apply on crown area and I section it to add lift. I will purchase again !
A couple of pumps of this dust goes a long way. It is literally a little puff of "dust" that comes out of the bottle when you pump it. Hold it over your hair and pump into the location you want the texture and volume. I made the mistake of putting it into my hand the first time and made a mess. It is going to be hard to tell when the bottle gets low, and I'll be curious how long the little bottle lasts.
Love the body this gives. Do wish the container were easier to use.
I have always had curly hair and have always struggled with finding a style I love. This product helped me find the volume that I have been looking for without any damage or harm to my hair. It holds beautifully and looks so natural!!!
The cap was so difficult to remove that I was forced to open the container completely and ended up breathing in some of the dust on accident. I think more user friendly packaging of their product would have improved this experience.
My hair dresser introduced me to this product. I have short hair and use it after I have dried and styled my hair to give it that “piecy” look. I tap the bottle on the counter before using and make sure to part my hair and apply product from approximately 6 inches away. It takes a little practice to learn not to apply too much as that will make hair matted. One bottle lasts a long time!
I got this as a gift and fell in love with it! My hair is super thin and it gave it tons of volume. I tried other brands that cost about the same and they did absolutely nothing for me. It really works like magic!

Poor Richard's Almanack : Initial Publication Date[edit]
The Wikipedia article for Poor Richard's Almanack states ( in the History Section ) that 'Franklin began publishing Poor Richard's Almanack on December 28, 1732'; the cite note associated with this assertion, and the Resources section that follows the Notes, both list The Independence Hall Association (of Philadelphia) as the source for this information , and specifically provide a link to the "Benjamin Franklin Timeline" on their website, where you will find the following line in the 1732 section: 'Publishes the first edition of "Poor Richard's Almanack" on December 28'. I am confident that this information is incorrect, and offer the following to replace it: “Jared Sparks, in his edition of Franklin’s works, gives the advertisement of the first number, printed in the Pennsylvania Gazette, Dec. 19, 1732, as follows: ‘Just Published, for 1733, an Almanac, containing [list] By Richard Saunders, Philomath. Printed and sold by B. Franklin.’” ; from The Encyclopedia Brittanica: a Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature : Supplement (1892), Volume 1, Brittanica Publishing Company p. 211. Let me add further that the ushistory(dot)org website also contains this line (from the short biography of Franklin in the "Signers of the Declaration of Independence" section) : "In 1741 he began publishing Poor Richard's Almanac, a very popular and influential magazine." Thus far, I am not impressed by the accuracy of the information contained on this site. CononOfSamos (talk) 21:58, 21 October 2009 (UTC)

Thomas Fuller[edit]
The page Thomas Fuller (writer) which you were inquiring about has now been properly renamed to match the Wikipedia one.~ Kalki 05:37, 15 November 2009 (UTC)
Kalki - thank you for responding to my inquiry. While this change improves the situation, as it results in a consistent naming scheme, I am not sure that it is the best solution.
Allow me to explain further :
At the moment, there are 7 (seven) individuals named Thomas Fuller for whom pages exist on Wikipedia. Two of these individuals also have pages on Wikiquote.
Here is a list of the seven Thomas Fullers, with dates of birth and death, and (very) brief occupation info.
Name, Dates, and occupational description ; On Wikipedia ; On Wikiquote
T. F. (1608-1661) ; Eng. cleric/writer (historian) ; Thomas_Fuller ; Thomas_Fuller
T. F. (1654-1734) ; Eng. physician/writer (aphorist) ; Thomas_Fuller_(writer) ; Thomas_Fuller_(writer)
T. F. (1710-1790) ; Amer. slave/mathematician ; Thomas_Fuller_(slave) ; no page
T. F. (1808-1876) ; Amer. Congressman ; Thomas_Fuller_(Maine) ; no page
T. F. (1832-1901) ; Amer. Federal Judge ; Thomas_Charles_Fuller ; no page
T. F. (1823-1898) ; Canadian architect (pere) ; Thomas_Fuller_(architect) ; no page
T. F. (1865-1951) ; Canadian architect (fils) ; Thomas_W._Fuller ; no page
Or, we can look at middles names / initials --
Thomas_Charles_Fuller (1832-1901) ; same above
Thomas_Horace_Fuller (1816-1861) ; Canadian politician; not on above list
Thomas_J._D._Fuller (1808-1876) ; same as Thomas_Fuller_(Maine)
Thomas_W._Fuller (1865-1951) ; same above
There is a Lieutenant Thomas Fuller House (Lieut._Thomas_Fuller_House) in Middleton, Massachusetts, built in 1684, which is on the National Historic Register, and which seems to be named after yet another Thomas Fuller for whom no Wikipedia page currently exists.
Then we have the following pages :
Thomas_Fuller_(Maine) on Wikipedia redirects to Thomas_J._D._Fuller on Wikipedia.
Thomas_Fuller_(physician) on Wikiquote redirects to Thomas_Fuller_(writer) on Wikiquote.
Thomas_Fuller_(disambiguation) on Wikipedia lists the initial seven Thomas Fullers above ( but not Thomas Horace Fuller ) .
There is no Thomas Fuller disambiguation page on Wikiquote at present.
Some additional notes :
Thomas W. Fuller (1865-1951) has a son, Thomas G. Fuller, for whom no Wikipedia page currently exists : he is the founder of Fuller Construction, which built many public buildings in Ottawa, and was awarded a 2002 contract to renovate the Canadian Library of Parliament.
There is also a Wikipedia page for T. O. Fuller State Park ( T._O._Fuller_State_Park ), which is named in honor of Thomas Oscar Fuller (1867-1942), a prominent African American church and civic leader and author in early twentieth-century Memphis, Tennessee. There is currently no Wikipedia page for Thomas Oscar Fuller.
Although Thomas Fuller (1654-1734), formerly Thomas_Fuller_(physician), has now been designated as Thomas_Fuller_(writer), and Thomas Fuller (1608-1661) is presently designated simply as Thomas_Fuller, Thomas Fuller (1608-1661) actually has a better claim to be thought of as Thomas Fuller (writer) than the physician and aphorist Thomas Fuller (1654-1734). Thomas Fuller (1608-1661) was the author of The History of the Worthies of England (1662), a three-volume historical work published after his death. Other works include The Historie of the Holy Warre (1639), The Holy State and the Prophane State (1642), A Pisgah-Sight of Palestine (1650), Church-History of Britian (1655), and numerous other works including poetry, collected sermons, other historical works, and political writings. As his Wikipedia article notes, Fuller was “one of the first English writers able to live by his pen.”
Thomas Fuller (1654-1734), while a prolific writer himself, left us a more limited set of published works. These consist of three sets of Pharmacopoeia (in numerous editions), three collections of ‘precepts’ including Gnomologia (1732), which is probably his best-known work, and Exanthematologia, his most important medical work. In addition to the preceding, it should be noted that Gnomologia, the best known of Fuller’s non-medical works, is basically a collection of unsourced material that was not original to Fuller. Fuller’s most “original” work was unquestionably Exanthematologia: Or, An Attempt to Give a Rational Account of Eruptive Fevers, Especially of the Measles and Small Pox (1730). This treatise is now regarded as a pioneering effort in the development of the theory of infectious diseases. To quote Ludvig Hektoen’s 1922 paper on Fuller, published in the Bulletin of the Society of Medical History of Chicago, March 1922, Vol. II, pp. 321-333 : “While Thomas Fuller does not speak of the causes of infectious diseases as living organisms, he does expound their specificness of action with surprising clearness and unfaltering consistency, expressing well what we believe now to be settled scientific facts. He is a pioneer exponent of the specific principles in infection and immunity.” In contrast, Fuller’s life-long fascination with Adages and Proverbs is more in the nature of a hobby; the chief reason that Gnomologia is as well-remembered today as it is, is the fact that Benjamin Franklin used it as the source of a number of the witty sayings he printed in various annual editions of Poor Richard’s Almanack. Thus, there is no doubt in my mind that we should remember this Thomas Fuller as Thomas Fuller, Physician.
A minor cleanup note :
The Wikipedia page for Thomas Fuller (1654-1734), currently designated as Thomas_Fuller_(writer), still points to the page Thomas_Fuller_(physician) on Wikiquote.
With regard to the Lieut. Thomas Fuller of Lieut. Thomas Fuller House in Middletown, Massachusetts :
The first (Massachusetts) Thomas Fuller, who purchased 300 acres in this vicinity, had five sons; Thomas Fuller, Jr., John Fuller, Jacob Fuller, Joseph Fuller and Benjamin Fuller. The Thomas Fuller who built and occupied the historic House was the son of Thomas Fuller Jr., and is believed to have lived in this house ( on Old South Main Street, abutting the Fuller family burial ground ) by 1684. The website of The National Register of Historic Places is currently being worked on and cannot be used to obtain additional information.
My opinion on where all this should go from here :
I believe that Thomas Fuller (1608-1661) should either be left as is or designated as Thomas_Fuller_(writer) { or perhaps Thomas_Fuller_(author) ? } on both Wikipedia & Wikiquote. The fact that he is currently designated simply as Thomas_Fuller, on both Wikipedia and Wikiquote, is probably sufficient reason to leave him undisturbed : "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" ~ popularized by American politician Bert Lance (b. 1931), but likely origin is as a proverb ( possibly from Sweden, or Texas ) : see The Yale Book of Quotations, Shapiro, p. 441
I believe that Thomas Fuller (1654-1734) should be designated as Thomas_Fuller_(physician) on both Wikipedia & Wikiquote.
I believe that, perhaps, there should be a Thomas_Fuller_(disambiguation) page on Wikiquote.
I believe that there should, at minimum, be a Thomas_Oscar_Fuller stub page on Wikipedia.
I believe that there should, at minimum, be a Thomas_G._Fuller stub page on Wikipedia.
I believe that there should (probably) be a Thomas_Fuller_(Lieut.) stub page on Wikipedia.
I have researched some information on Thomas Fuller (1654-1734) and hope to be able to expand his Wikipedia page in the not too distant future. I am also willing to work on the objectives I have listed above but could use some guidance in doing so.

French quotes from Poor Richard's Almanack[edit]
InvisibleSun: I have a question that involves a couple of short quotes in French. They are :
- Fient de chien, & marc d'argent,
Seront tout un au jour du jugement ;
and
- Le sage entend à demi mot .
They come from the annual editions of Poor Richard's Almanack for, respectively, 1742 and 1743. Can you tell me what they would translate to in English ? Thanks - CononOfSamos (talk) 05:17, 7 December 2009 (UTC)

Re "thank you" notifications: it's a relatively new system. Now, next to the "undo" option, you also have a "thank" option when looking at a specific diff, or in the revision history of a page. It's just a nice and fast way of thanking people for edits you appreciate. You also get notifications when someone mentions you, leaves you a talk page message (like this one), etc. You can see all your notifications at Special:Notifications.

Agriculture reforms are necessary, farm laws provide an option: PM Modi
Photo Credit :
New Delhi [India], February 10 (ANI): Noting that the process of reforms in agriculture is necessary and important, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that the new farm laws provide an option to farmers and have been brought to meet the emerging challenges.
In his reply to the motion of thanks on the President's Address in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister said no mandis have been shut after the implementation of these laws and there has been no impact on the MSP.
Congress members, who interrupted Prime Minister during his speech, later staged a walkout.
The Prime Minister said three farm laws were an honest effort by the government to improve the conditions of agriculture.
" Three farm laws were brought in by the Government. The process of agricultural reforms is necessary and important. The agriculture sector has been facing challenges for years. We will have to make efforts to meet them and we have made honest efforts," he said.
The Prime Minister accused the opposition of misleading farmers protesting against farm laws.
"Congress MPs in House debated on the colour of the laws. It would have been better if they had debated on the content and intent of the laws. Let us understand, as far as the protests are concerned, our farmer brothers at Delhi borders have been a victim of rumours, propaganda and confusion," he said.
PM Modi said that the Parliament and the government respect the "sentiments of all agitating farmers".
"This is why the agriculture minister has been holding talks regularly with farmers groups with full honour and dignity. Talks have been going on for a while including way back when the agitation was in Punjab. We concede that if there is any shortcoming in the laws we are willing to amend. The changes should be practical and convincing," he said.
.
The Prime Minister attacked Congress for disruptions in the House.
"Those who are disrupting the House are doing so as per a well-planned strategy. They are unable to digest that people are seeing through the truth. It will not work. Through their games, the trust of the people can never be won," he said.
He said Congress leaders had adopted one strategy in Rajya Sabha and a different approach in the Lok Sabha and this shows its "divisions".
Taking a dig at Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary who had been repeatedly interrupting him, the Prime Minister said his actions have been noted where he wanted it to be".
"Adhir Ranjan ji, ab zyada ho raha hai. I respect you. You will get more publicity than TMC in Bengal. Don't worry...This doesn't look good, why are you doing this? These laws are not coercive. They only offer >>Can you name every player to score 10+ Premier League goals in 1997-98?

Basement water problems are pervasive. Whether you live in a generally humid area, a generally arid area, or somewhere in between, chances are that you’ve had basement water problems of some kind at some point. A wet basement is a huge problem, and there are many other issues that can arise because of these basement water problems.
MUSTY BASEMENT SMELL
Dampness, cracks, and waterproofing issues can cause serious basement moisture problems, which can themselves lead to mold and other health concerns.
WET DRYWALL IN YOUR BASEMENT
Wet drywall typically comes around because of cracks in your walls and general leaking.
BASEMENT CONDENSATION
No homeowner wants to deal with basement condensation. Learn more about the signs and solutions to protect your home.
WET BASEMENT CARPET
Fixing problems associated with dampness, cracks, and flooding is not always easy, and you can’t always fix it on your own.
CAUSES
There are numerous reasons your house may have these problems. Most of these causes stem from the ground.?
When storm season comes around, you need to do more than prepare for the storm by buying supplies. You also need to prep your home for the heavy rain and flooding that the storm may bring.
The heavy rain and flooding brought by the storm contribute to hydrostatic pressure and soil settlement. Both of which can result in basement wall cracks and a very wet basement. So when storm season comes around, make sure to check your sump pump, current waterproofing and have a plan in place to help keep your basement dry. When in doubt, call your local basement waterproofing experts..
Just like its summer and fall cousin, Tropical Storms are famous for flooding basements. The heavy rain and flooding caused by Tropical Storms add to hydrostatic pressure and soil settlement problems, both of which can cause basement wall cracks.
A Tropical Storm can occur any time of the year but is notorious for occurring during the winter. It’s called a Tropical Cyclone because it travels to the Northwest from the Atlantic, and Southern hemisphere. These storms can cause flooding, force winds, heavy rain, and snow. All of which can spell trouble for your basement..Neudorf Sauvignon Blanc 2016 – LAST BOTTLES

Surmounting the odds: How Paralympians Avani Lekhara and Ekta Bhyan rose above disability to become champions
false
true
It was an unforgettable dream run for India as it won 19 medals at the Tokyo Paralympics this year. The best showing before this was a mere four medals. And despite the pandemic and its challenges, para-athletes registered historic feats and became the nation’s pride and joy.
For most of them, it was not just the victory alone; it was also a mantle to be taken seriously. They advocate for more accessibility and infrastructure for the disabled and society to be inclusive and empathetic to their needs.
The spirited contingent included Avani Lekhara and Ekta Bhyan, who have proved that while rising above disability may be challenging, hard work and the right attitude always triumph.
While Ekta did not win a medal, she carried a feeling of victory as India posted a formidable medals haul. Nineteen-year-old Avani became the first woman to win two Paralympic medals by winning a gold and bronze in rifle shooting.
HerStory spoke to Avani and Ekta about their experiences at the Paralympics and how it felt to be part of a winning contingent and advocate for inclusivity and more women in para-sports.
We also spoke with Deepthi Bopaiah, CEO, GoSports Foundation, an award-winning national non-profit that works towards developing some of India’s talented, emerging, and elite athletes, competing across Olympic and Paralympic disciplines through athlete scholarships and knowledge-building programmes.
Avani Lekhara
Avani Lekhara receiving an award
In 2019, when Avani Lekhara was participating in the World Cup in the UAE and playing for the Paralympics quota, she could not make it to the finals in three matches. In the fourth and last game, she came seventh in the qualification round. She was very nervous.
“This was my last chance, and it was not even my main event. I went in there, gave my 100 percent with full focus and came first, winning a berth in the Tokyo Paralympics,” she recalls.
To be held in 2020, the Paralympics were postponed due to the pandemic. Avani says she was highly disheartened but not prepared to give up. The training was a massive challenge as shooting ranges were shut during the lockdown.
Avani got a digital target setup installed in her home. “So basically, I was shooting from my kitchen to my master bedroom,” she says with a laugh, adding, “All my training sessions were online; only my physiotherapist would visit me at home. The good thing was I got a year to train.”
Avani met with an accident in 2012, following which she was paralysed below her waist and lost all motor power and sensations. “I was on bed rest for seven months. I went to school for two years and later was homeschooled. I became an introvert, and my parents suggested I try out some sport,” she says.
During the summer holidays, Avani joined a shooting and archery range close to her home. While she did not have the physical strength for archery, she managed the 5kg rifle and said shooting chose her immediately.
But there were some hurdles; she did not have proper equipment or the know-how of the rules and regulations of the game. She hired a coach and won a gold in the first-ever match she participated in, where she competed with able-bodied athletes. More wins followed, three golds for Rajasthan at the National Games in 2017, at the World Cup in the UAE in 2017, after which she partnered with GoSports Foundation to take her career forward. She also moved from a rented rifle to proper equipment.
The reception in India after her return from Tokyo “has been surreal”. The athletes interacted with Prime Minister Modi, and Avani has also been made ambassador of the government’s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign.
“I will try to spread more awareness about the need for girls to study at the grassroots level, especially in villages,” she says.
Juggling sport with an intensive five-year law degree, Avani says everything’s possible because of the support of her friends, her friends, and her educational institution.
“There should be better infrastructure for the disabled in India – like ramps on public transport, accessibility to washrooms, and more to provide them accessibility,” she adds.
Avani is now looking forward to the Asian Games in 2022, the World Championships, and qualifying for the 2024 Paralympics.
Ekta Bhyan
Ekta Bhyan
After training hard for four years, Ekta Bhyan was a medal prospect for India at the Paralympics. But she failed to win a medal.
“It was very disappointing, and all my hard work went down the drain. But I believe we should always learn from our mistakes and look forward,” she says.
Ekta is happy that after India’s spectacular performance in Tokyo, para-athletes are now getting the recognition they deserve.
A road accident in 2003 that led to a spinal injury led to complete paralysis of her lower limbs and partial paralysis of her upper limbs. She was just 18.
“I had dreamt of becoming a doctor, and after the accident, my whole life underwent a drastic change. Life changed completely. I spent nine months in the hospital and underwent three surgeries,” she says.
After she returned home, Ekta says she realised she was a different person. There was a change in society’s perception of her and her disability. She was considered a burden on her family.
She started studying, and that boosted her confidence. In 2013, Ekta cracked the Haryana Civil Services Exam and joined the Haryana government as Assistant Employment Officer in Hisar.
Media reports about her achievement reached Paralympian Amit Kumar Saroha, who encouraged her to try the para-sport and introduced her to club throw. In 2016, Ekta started competing in major tournaments. She won the silver at the Athletics Grand Prix in Berlin and, in 2018, won gold at the Asian Para Games.
Though initially hesitant to take up para-sports because of its burden on others, Ekta's support from the government and the GoSports Foundation has allowed her to dream big.
However, she believes India still has a long way to go for inclusivity for the disabled.
“Assistive devices like artificial limbs or a good quality wheelchair are costly. Due to faulty infrastructure, the disabled don’t have many opportunities to pursue a career. Employment is also hard to come by. Most of us are also dependent on others to move from one place to another,” she points out.
The international recognition, she believes, will help more para-athletes come to the fore. But there is also a greater need to create more infrastructure and also raise awareness.
“We also need to break the mental barriers surrounding the disabled. Give them more opportunities,” she adds.
Ekta signs off with her favourite quote. “’Life is not in our hands but living is’. You may face any kind of situation you may not be prepared for. But the best thing we can do to make our situation better is to work hard and with the right attitude.”
Deepthi Bopaiah
Deepthi’s association with GoSports Foundation began in 2012. A tennis and basketball player at the state and university level, she worked in the banking sector before joining GoSports Foundation in 2012 to follow her passion for sport and create a meaningful impact on India’s sporting ecosystem.
Deepthi has worked with more than 200 Indian athletes across Olympic and Paralympic disciplines whilst being a part of the journeys of around 50 Olympians and Paralympians, not to mention 10 Paralympic medallists as well.
“Behind the success of every athlete, there is an entourage that does everything possible to provide the platform for the athlete to succeed. The Foundation’s support structure for the athletes, across all programmes, constantly adopts the latest innovations in the sporting world, to provide a platform where talent can meet opportunity,” she says.
Over the years, GoSports has supported athletes on various aspects of their development, including designing and curating a support structure for each athlete individually, especially understanding their needs.
These comprise impact sports training, physical assessments, physiotherapy, strength and conditioning, mental conditioning, nutritional counselling, and injury management and rehabilitation; competition expenses including travel, accommodation, insurance, and tournament entry fees; sports apparel and equipment; athlete education and development; career management guidance, and support; and legal support.
“Aligning and contributing towards various international programmes and movements such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the #WeThe15 Movement is a huge objective for GoSports Foundation, as these aim to create a more inclusive world, bring to the fore more opportunities for people with disabilities, and change the attitudes and perceptions of the public,” Deepthi says.Jordan Jiang, CTV News Vancouver

Several election campaign signs appeared to be damaged in the Vancouver-Kingsway riding early Thursday morning.
Signs that were knocked over belonged to NDP incumbent candidate Don Davies. Not all signs were damaged along the street, however, as it appeared Liberal candidate Tamara Taggart’s were intact.
One of the NDP signs was seen on Grandview Highway between Nootka and Lillooet streets. Some drivers were unable to avoid the sign and wooden debris, ultimately striking the objects.
This comes after Liberal and Conservatives signs were allegedly stolen last week.
In Vancouver South, Conservative candidate Wai Young’s campaign claims more than 30 per cent of their lawn signs have been stolen in the riding. In an emailed news release, Young called the alleged thefts “hurtful and dangerous.”
At the time, Liberal candidate for the same riding, Harjit Sajjan, said some of his election signs had been stolen as well.
Both campaigns proved CTV News Vancouver with security camera footage showing people taking signs.To contact support, please visit our support center. For all other issues feel free to use the information on this page.

One of our neighbors, the Downingtown School Board recently approved a resolution that calls for the state to change Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (PSERS). Driving their decision is the predicted dramatic increase in PSERS contribution from school districts. Looking ahead to the upcoming years, the teacher’s pension increase will greatly affect the school district’s budget and then the taxpayers.
According to one of the Downingtown School Board members, their PSERS contribution is going from a little over 4% to about 31% in 2012! School Board member Robert Yorcyk, who introduced the resolution to the other board members explained, “Considering that salary and benefits make up about 70 percent of the budget, the increase to 31 percent would represent about 15 percent of the budget or half of what we have left to support education.” The Downingtown School District pays about $4 million in teacher pension contributions – that number will rise to $7 million in 2011 and by 2014-15 retirement contributions are expected to hit $36 million! The school district estimates that in just 5 years, PSERS contributions will increase nine-fold.
If I understand the PSERS plan correctly, employees and employers alike contribute and that money is then invested, . . . the pension payout is guaranteed (regardless of the market economics). The real problem is that due to the volatility of the market, school districts are being forced to pay larger pension contributions because the pension investments have not kept pace with what is guaranteed in the payouts of the pensions.
The state House of Representatives is reviewing changes in the PSER bill. The new plan would actually put a cap on the school district contributions. If the pension payout required additional funds, the bill would require the state to be responsible for the difference. The Downingtown School Board signed their recent resolution to urge the state to lessen the burden on taxpayers and the school district (understanding that the teacher benefits will remain the same).
Should the Tredyffrin Easttown School District take a similar stand? Should our school board members be encouraged to follow Downingtown’s lead?

Pattye:
The TESD Board has already stated (but not formally resolved) that they are banking on a state bail out of their PSERS obligation. (That is: for the state to pay even more than the half of the liability they already pay). And given the union power in Harrisburg, I’d say that’s a pretty good bet.
The key question is: is there any chance of evolving the plan to the defined contribution type experienced by the rest of today’s working world? Or will we be stuck for perpetuity with an increasingly underfunded entitlement in a low return, “new normal” world?
>>
that they are banking on a state bail out of their PSERS obligation.
>>
Really?? Let me get this straight. The GOP lead TESD is looking for a state bail out? Where is TTRC member Jim Bailey on this? The gov’t can’t do everything for everybody…right?
Jim…where are you?
By the way, is it true that Jim Bailey was recruited by EJ Richter to serve on the TTRC???? If so, that sheds a lot of light on his comments…
(Yes John, we know you think the TTGOP political machine runs T/E….)
The problem here is that PSERS is a state mandate to begin with. Local districts can’t legally negotiate any other pension system for teachers. Since this is a problem created by the state (and the unions) it’s perfectly consistent to demand the state (and the unions) resolve it.
I agree. But I think it is prudent that TESD has funds designated in reserve to help diminish the spike. If you go on the PSERS website, you can read a power point presentation from December that illustrates the issues and options.
John, I took your advice about ” keeping my powder dry”! I would like to treat you to lunch sometime. I would love to talk to you off the boards. Let me know if your interested.
Sure…Let’s go to Carangi’s. Perhaps some pizza and some cannoli for dessert.

I know a lot of people will be very interested in Mike O’Laughlin’s podcast on Scartaglen, Talisman, and the early days of those traditional Irish music bands as they played in Kansas City.
It’s a wonderful interview with Dave Browne as he talks about their influences - particularly The Bothy Band - and the characters who recorded in and with Scartaglen, many of whom still populate the Kansas City Irish music trad scene in some form - like Dave Agee (of Kelly), Mike Dugger (of Glen Road), Roger Landes, Connie Dover, Kirk Lynch.
I’ve listened to so many of Mike O’Laughlin’s podcasts that I’m losing track, but the Scartaglen one is Number 6 in the series entitled Missouri Irish History & Legend: Ireland to America.
I’ve been so late in posting on this that Number 7 has been already posted. Like all the podcasts by Mike you can find them at his podcast page on Irish Roots.
The other series of podcasts is the general genealogy one called At the Irish Roots Cafe Today - which is already up to number 31, and then there are also 6 podcasts from the early days of the Irish Roots Cafe, called fittingly, The Best of 1984.
With the amount of Irish events and Irish music that touches Kansas City these days it’s easy to forget that it wasn’t always so, nothwithstanding the Irish who migrated to the city to work on the railroads or the Scots-Irish who came here from rural Missouri and other nearby states.
Check out Kansas City’s leading genealogist, Mike O’Laughlin, and the wonderful collection of oral history he is building at the Irish Roots Cafe

Speaking after the Assembly backed a motion calling for direct dialogue between the Assembly and the European Parliament, Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald said:
“I welcome the Assembly’s support for the motion calling for direct dialogue between the Assembly and the European Parliament.
“It is important there is representation of the views of citizens from the north in the European Union institutions in relation to the protocol and broader peace process.
“Sinn Féin consistently raised the need for continued representation throughout the negotiation process.
“We proposed that the additional MEPs allocated to the twenty-six counties post-Brexit be allocated instead to the north of Ireland, however the Irish government rejected this, which was a missed opportunity.
“Since the onset of Brexit we have continued to raise with the Dublin government the need for representation for citizens of the north.
"We have made a number of proposals including observer status for MEPs from the north of Ireland; representation at the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee; the ability of Executive Ministers to participate in Council of Ministers’ meetings (as part of the Irish delegation); and the ability of civil servants from the north to participate in relevant Council working groups.
“Last week the European Commission published a package of proposals on the implementation of the protocol, which included proposals on engagement.
“These proposals would strengthen the participation of business and civic society representatives and political representatives from the north and included a proposal on dialogue with the Assembly.
“It is important that the views of stakeholders and elected representatives are heard in shaping the policy development and legislation relevant to the protocol, and that the impact of EU regulations and policy on the north are understood by the EU institutions and direct dialogue would help to achieve this.
“I have asked the Speaker of the Assembly to write to the President of the European Parliament and the European Commission following the Assembly’s support for today’s motion.”STUART LANE PEARSON is a Burglar Alarm - Burglar Alarm Company Agent licensed to practice in Utah.

Bergs Timber has previously announced the closure of Gransjö sawmill. Similarly, production as a result of the ongoing coronavirus crisis has been reduced at other Swedish sawmills and at the company’s Estonian sawmill. The closure of Gransjö sawmill has proceeded according to plan and the sawmill production will cease during April, the company reports.
According to Bergs Timber, demand for sawn timber is good for several important markets and the company sees some improvement in the UK market. The company’s stocks are in balance and order intake has improved. Demand for wood products is normally seasonally high during the second quarter.
At the company’s Swedish sawmills, implemented short-term work has been terminated and production has returned to normal pace from May 4. Bergs Timber’s Estonian sawmill has produced in one shift during April and returned to two shifts from 4 May. The company’s Latvian sawmill Vika Wood has not been affected by production curtailments.
”After a decline in the second half of March and during April, we now see that demand is improving and that order intake is increasing until the holiday period. After the production curtailments that have been implemented, we have balanced inventories and it feels positive that we are now returning to normal production levels. The long-term effects of the ongoing coronavirus crisis remain difficult to assess, says Peter Nilsson,” President and CEO of Bergs Timber.

This journey is split into design stages as the project develops and the requirement for co-ordination with other consultants. As a RIBA Chartered Practice, these work stages follow the RIBA Plan of Work. This is industry standard and is widely recognised by construction professionals.
RIBA Stage 0 / Definition.
David will provide information and fee proposals outlining the viability of the project and how it might be organised.
RIBA Stage 1 / Preparation.
David will assist the client in assembling a design team. He will undertake Site Analysis and feasibility studies. This stage may be undertaken as a stand alone phase.
RIBA Stage 2 / Concept Design.
During this stage David will prepare options for discussion and develop the design in conjunction with the emerging brief.
RIBA Stage 3 / Spatial Co-ordination & Planning Submissions.
Once a preferred design option has been found, David will consider the design in more detail, addressing the surrounding context, cost and construction implications, culminating in an application for statutory planning approvals.
RIBA Stage 4 / Technical Design Parts I & II.
Following approval for planning, the design is developed in technical detail in conjunction with other specialist consultants. Part 1 is concerned with developing a package of documents that may be submitted for Building Regulations initial approval. Part 2 develops the detail further so that a thorough and detailed package of information is produced that can be competitively tendered.
RIBA Stage 5 & 6 / Construction to Handover.
The role of the architect on site is to administer the building contract between the client and contractor. This consists of monitoring the work on site and certifying regular payments to be made to the contractor for work completed and reporting back to the client.
David will advise on other consultants that you may require and the statutory legislation that applies to your project.
Principal Designer Services.
In order to fulfil your obligations under the Construction, Design & Management (Health & Safety) Regulations, David may also be appointed as the Principal Designer for the project.
Clients may opt for a full architectural service or for only some of the RIBA work stages. They may also choose their own bespoke work stages. For example, a client might only wish to employ an architect up to the submission of a planning application. Alternatively, might choose to add additional stages to the commissions, such as Interior Design. Either way services can be tailored to suit the project to achieve your extraordinary bespoke home.The CEO of Firekeepers Casino Hotel has been named one of Michigan’s 100 Most Powerful Women for 2021.

LEMON CAKE
INGREDIENTS
- 375g all-purpose Flour
- 2 teaspoons Baking Powder
- 230g Unsalted Butter room temperature
- 400g granulated Sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 Large Eggs, room temperature
- 2 tablespoons Lemon Zest
- 60 ml Lemon Juice
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
- 240ml Milk
LEMON GLAZE
- 100g Granulated Sugar
- 60ml Lemon Juice
LEMON ICING
- 240g icing sugar, sifted
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 lemon, zested
METHOD
- Preheat the oven to 180˚C
- Grease a 25-cm bundt pan with nonstick spray
- In a medium bowl, sieve together the flour and baking powder.
- In a large bowl, cream the butter, sugar, and salt with an electric hand mixer until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla and beat to combine.
- Add half the flour and beat to combine, then beat in the milk, then add the rest of the flour and beat just until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and make sure any floury spots are incorporated.
- Spoon the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Gently tap the pan against the counter to release any air bubbles.
- Bake the cake for 50 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
- While the cake is baking, make the lemon glaze: In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the sugar and lemon juice. Microwave for 1 minute, stirring halfway through, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Set aside.
- Make the lemon icing: Sift the icing sugar into a medium bowl. Add the lemon juice and whisk until smooth.
- After the cake is done baking, let cool in the pan for 10 – 20 minutes (this will ensure the cake becomes firm enough to remove from the pan without breaking apart), then invert onto a wire rack set over a baking sheet and remove the bundt pan. Use a knife to loosen the cake around the edges, if needed.
- Use a skewer or fork to poke holes all over the top and sides of the cake. Brush the cake with the lemon glaze. If the glaze drips off, let the cake cool for a few more minutes, then continue brushing on the glaze. Let cool completely, at least 1 hour.
- Pour the icing over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Grate lemon zest over the icing. Let the glaze dry completely, about 30 minutes

CHEF’S TIP: To ensure your Bundt cake does not stick to the tin, make sure to grease the tin thoroughly with non stick spray. Make sure spray in all the crevices. Do not use butter; the milk solids in butter can act like glue, causing the cake batter to stick to the pan.

Chromebook, has been supported by his wife Nicola Baker after he admitted feeling “apprehensive” about embarking on the Rickshaw Challenge this year. The Countryfile star was forced to miss tuning into the latest episode of his family’s More4 reality show Our Farm in the Dales this evening while travelling away from home for the next stage of the challenge in Manchester.
Matt explained he was worried about the future of the challenge, which he takes on each year for BBC Children in Need, as it won’t be featuring on The One Show following his exit from the programme.
The presenter divulged in a candid Instagram video shared with his 285,000 followers: “Hi all, so we are now on our way to Manchester, Salford way.
“The rickshaw is on a trailer behind us because this year, we are taking the rickshaw around the UK and allowing riders to cycle it on home turf and places that are special to them.
“So we’ve had a brilliant first day, check out the Instagram Stories with what’s been going on for Thomas on day one but yeah, it’s a bit of a road trip this year.
“Loving it, absolutely loving it as always, big thanks to everybody that’s come out on the road to support us.
“I was a bit apprehensive as to what would be happening as far as the fact that we’re not on The One Show this year.”
Fortunately, Matt went on to say that he had no reason to worry, as a big crowd gathered to support him and his fellow riders.
The star added: “But there’s so much love out there for the rickshaw, so I’m incredibly proud of that.
“So thank you so much and also just a little reminder that Our Farm in the Dales is on tonight, More4, nine o’clock, it’s all happening!
“I’ll see you later, bye for now,” he concluded.
Matt captioned his emotional video: “The Rickshaw road trip! Were off to Manchester after an Epic Day 1!(sic)
“As I’m travelling I’m gonna miss our farm in the dales tonight at 9 on more4 so tell me what you think….

Matt was inundated with well wishes following his heartfelt video, with one of the first being from his wife Nicola.
She penned in the comments section: “Hope you’ve all managed to dry out!”
Matt was cycling the first leg of the challenge today with 16-year-old Tom from Somerset.
The rickshaw challenge is featuring a twist this year, as Matt and the team will complete a relay-style ride in five chapters.
Each inspirational rider will take on a leg each, travelling through their hometowns and significant places for them personally.
It comes after Matt’s other half Nicola teased her 25,000 followers with what was to come during tonight’s episode of her family’s hit TV show in his absence.
She posted a snap of three adorable baby goats from their farm and said their names would be revealed on the show.
Nicola penned alongside the picture: “We’re naming the pygmy goat kids in Episode 3 of Our Farm in the Dales tonight at 9pm on More4.
“I wonder what we decided on?…… #farmlife #goatkids #pygmygoats.”

Cyclists have to observe a number of rules on the road as do drivers sharing the road with them.
In Queensland, you need to keep a gap when overtaking cyclists in a car or truck. While riding a bike side-by-side with another cyclist is not only legal but also widely encouraged – even though not everyone agrees with it.
As summer sets in a common sight on roads and paths may be people walking their dog while riding a bike. But did you know it’s illegal to ride your bike with your dog on a leash, and can lead to a big fine?
How much can I be fined for cycling while walking my dog?
In Queensland, it’s a minimum penalty of $133.45 and a maximum of more than $2600.
Queensland Police Senior Constable Diana Kratochvil wrote in a blog post, police can issue an “on the spot fine”.
“We urge dog owners to be more mindful of their pet’s safety and consider other users of public spaces. You must have proper control of your dog, at all times,” Snr Cst Kratochvil wrote.
“When you and your dog are out in public you must walk your dog on a leash unless you are within a designated dog off-leash enclosure or park.
“It is important to exercise your dog but not while riding your bicycle as it is an unsafe practice for you, your dog and others.”
The Queensland Transport Operations Regulation says: “The rider of a bicycle must not lead an animal, including by tethering the animal to the bicycle.”
A South Australia Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure spokesperson told Yahoo News Australia in a statement it’s illegal there too.
“It is an offence to lead an animal while riding a bike, as per Road Rule 301(3),” the spokesperson said.
“The fee for breaking this rule is $60, plus a $60 payment to the Victims of Crime levy.”
Break the law in NSW, and you could be slugged with a $76 fine. Challenge it in court and lose and it could go up to $2200.
In Tasmania, it’s a minimum of $163 and a maximum of $815.
Commit the offence in Western Australia and you could cop a fine between $50-$100.
Do it in Victoria, and it’s a far heftier fine of more than $480.
It’s also illegal in the Northern Territory but the law doesn’t state what the fine is.
Is it safe to take your dog cycling?
It’s a law that not everyone agrees with. The US vet-approved Pet MD website says if you think your dog actually has the energy and stamina to trot alongside you as you bike, it is great exercise.
It does advise several safety tips including have a leash long enough not to get caught in the wheels, but such precautions still make the activity illegal in Australian jurisdictions.
The matter was discussed in the Australian whirlpool forum with some pet owners unaware the practice of running your dog from a lead while riding a bike is illegal. While others talk about mishaps while trying to run the dog alongside the bike.

“I had my dog stop in front of me, hit him so hard the front wheel of my bike buckled,” one person explained.
“My boxer decided to go one side of a telegraph (power) pole, and me the other,” was another dog owner’s experience.
A couple of people on the forum advised the only safe way to take a dog on a bike ride was to attach a trailer. Others simply suggested taking the dog for a walk before going for a bike ride.
An RSPCA NSW spokesperson discouraged cyclists taking their dog with them while cycling.
“Pet owners should avoid forced exercise, including running your pet alongside a bicycle. In some states, including New South Wales, it is against the road rules to lead an animal by tethering while operating a vehicle,” the spokesperson said.
“The high intensity sustained exercise can overexert dogs.
“Dogs should have opportunities to run freely in a dog park off-leash and this enables them to regulate the duration and intensity of the running themselves. Speak to your vet for details and for advice on exercise options for your particular dog.”

According to details, Governor Punjab Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar met with Provincial Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid in Governor House.

Stay tuned to Baaghi TV for latest news and updates!PORT CANAVERAL — Emmanouil Kasselas, captain of Royal Caribbean’s Freedom of the Seas, called the ship his “little puppy” hours after docking at Port Canaveral on Monday.
“Big dog” is more appropriate.
And more dogs are coming.
Freedom of the Seas is the world’s largest cruise ship, running more than 1,100 feet long and holding up to 4,375 passengers. It’s the first of four huge cruise ships that will begin sailing from Port Canaveral between now and 2012, and tourism and port officials said their presence here will generate millions in additional tourism spending and solidify the area’s reputation as a major player in the cruise business.
They’re banking on cruise passengers coming to Brevard County a day or two prior to their cruise to stay in local hotels, eat at restaurants and visit some of the area’s tourist attractions.
“Today is a defining moment in the history of the port,” J. Stanley Payne, chief executive officer of Port Canaveral, said Monday following a brief tour and ceremony on board the Freedom of the Seas, noting the heated competition from ports worldwide to secure deals with the massive ships.
Payne added: “We feel this is the right size, and certainly the right size for the market we have.”
The 154,000-ton Freedom of the Seas, which looked capable of gobbling Royal Caribbean’s smaller Monarch of the Seas, docked nearby, soon will have some big company.
This fall, Carnival Cruise Lines bring its largest ship to date at Port Canaveral, the 130,000-ton Carnival Dream. The Dream accommodates 3,652 passengers.
Then Disney Cruise Line plans to base its two new big ships, the Dream and the Fantasy, at Port Canaveral in 2011 and 2012. The new Disney ships will weigh 122,000 tons each with a double-occupancy capacity of 2,500 passengers.
While there has been growth lately in the popularity of shorter, three- tofour-day cruise excursions, industry experts generally agree the big ships and the longer cruise offerings should mix nicely with what’s already being offered at Port Canaveral.
“They are very popular with cruise enthusiasts, who don’t want to take shorter cruises,” Paul Motter, president of CruiseMates, an Internet cruise guidebook, said of the longer outings.
“I think you should think of them as an additive cruise product that actually will not compete with the three- and four-day product. Royal Caribbean’s Freedom-class ships are immensely popular with a large number of regular cruisers, and Port Canaveral is very lucky to have them,” Motter said.
Oivind Mathisen, editor of Cruise Industry News, said during tough economic times, shorter cruises tend to pick up but that during the past few years, the trend has been more seven-day trips.
“I think the cruise industry has been very flexible — adjusting to market needs and conditions, offering different lengths of cruises, moving ships to different ports, enhancing the onboard product, in addition to pricing strategies to fill the ships,” Mathisen said.
The Freedom of the Seas left Monday afternoon with 3,900 passengers for a six-day cruise to the western Caribbean. Upon its return, the ship will be offering seven-day cruises from Port Canaveral to both the eastern and western Caribbean.
Passengers began boarding Monday morning, just a few hours after the ship’s 6 a.m. docking at Port Canaveral’s Terminal 10. Guests were greeted with glasses of champagne, and many of them wasted little time before checking out the ship’s amenities.
“I thought it was a city,” said Issie Bell-Yovich, a West Melbourne resident who was taking a honeymoon cruise with her husband, George.
Bell-Yovich said she has been on short cruises but prefers the longer ones because you can unpack and become more thoroughly adjusted to your living quarters.
“It allows you to unwind,” she said.
Local Brevard officials who toured the ship and met with the crew during a special noon ceremony said the out-of-town visitors should charge up the local tourism base and bring in millions in additional revenues.
“We’ll have 7,000 to 8,000 new visitors to the city,” said Rocky Randels, mayor of Cape Canaveral. “Many of them will be staying at our hotels. They’ll be asking: ‘Where do I eat? Where do I go to the drug store?’ ”Key West, FL has a longitude of -81.8 degrees and a latitude of 24.6 degrees.

About a mile above Waterville on route 44, just before the bridge over Pine Creek, a spacious parking lot extends north from the road, ostensibly to serve those hiking or biking this delightful, more remote section of Rails to Trail. We arrived for an alternate reason, to ascend Huntley Mt via a northern segment of the Tiadaghton Trail— for us, a virgin path.
Barely a few steps along the Rails to Trail a sign alerts hikers to the Old Wagon Road, and the Tiadaghton Trail, which run together for a short distance, gently gaining altitude away from the R TO T. Not far up this combination of trails, the Tiadaghton separates from the Wagon road via a hairpin back to the right. Engaged in conversation and enjoying the very civilized ascent, we missed the turn, until a short distance later we realized we were only seeing red trail markers not the Yellow needed for the Tiadaghton. We returned to the hair pin fork and began a rigorous ascent that would have put a smile on Forester Bob Weber’s face, switch backs not- withstanding.
This trail has an aversion to meandering, continuing a serious climb through relatively open forest. Somewhere near the half way point of the ascent, the trail reaches an open section of the ridge offering dramatic views of the Pine Creek Valley, a very good place, we thought, to hydrate and take advantage of the overlook.
The trail continues to gain altitude but not long after the overlook it hooks into an old road that gives up switch backs and continues to climb in a less aggressive diagonal route to the upper plateau. From here there are multiple options including trails that head southeast descending into Little Pine Creek Valley. After skirting more than a mile of the plateau, we chose the Gleason Trail which heads back down toward Pine Creek following a mostly waterless run and descending rapidly, at a rate that would easily match the ascent. Approaching the bottom, with Pine Creek in sight, Gleason intersects the Old Wagon Road. We chose this route to traverse the remaining mile and a half to the parking lot, occasionally offering greetings to the bikers on the Rails to Trail below us.SSP Muhammad Hilal Khan was working on one of the most important assignments of his career when his life was cut short.
Hilal was investigating the murders at the Nanga Parbat base camp in June, which killed 10 foreign tourists and their Pakistani guide. But less than two months later, the SSP himself lost his life when unidentified men fired at his vehicle. He was 37. An army colonel and captain also died in the attack.
Following his retirement from the Navy and induction in the civil service, Hilal was appointed as the Assistant Superintendent of Police in Muzaffargarh. He was later posted to other districts in Punjab from 2006-08. In 2009, he was transferred to Rawalpindi and promoted to superintendent of police. He also worked as the security in-charge for VIPs.
In 2010, Hilal was transferred to Attock and became the youngest district police officer to serve the district. He remained DPO till December last year, following which he was transferred to Diamer and served there until his death.
He is survived by three sons; six-year-old Abdul Kabir, four-year-old Saghir Khan, and two-year-old Salar Khan. Hilal also leaves behind four brothers, parents and a widow.
His parents may never recover from the loss. “My heart is torn apart. My son left me all alone,” Parent.

In fact, HCR 2031, given preliminary approval on2031, if approved in November, would immediately boost that exemption to $2.4 million. Potentially more significant, it would let lawmakers increase that even more in the future without asking for future voter approval.
Rep. J.D. Mesnard, R-Chandler, said the change would be good for the economy.
“If you want folks to be investing and buying and whatnot, we should increase the exemption,” said Mesnard, who dubbed his legislation the “Small Business Job Creation Act.” cash..
That 2012 effort was defeated, gathering just 44 percent of the vote. But Mesnard said he thinks the result would be different this time around.
A final roll-call vote is needed to send the measure to the Senate.

According to this story on MSN News a group from the University’s department of molecular biology and biotechnology under Professor Milton Wainwright sent a balloon 27 km up into the stratosphere during the recent Perseid meteor shower. The balloon was launched from Chester and came down near Wakefield. The balloon carried microscope studs, which were set to open between 22 and 27 km above the Earth. To ensure that the results were not contaminated by organisms from the Earth’s surface, the equipment was sterilised before it was launched.
When it returned, it was found that the studs had collected a variety of microscopic organisms. Some were diatoms, a form of algae, along with more unusual life-forms. Prof Wainwright said “It is generally accepted that a particle of the size found cannot be lifted from Earth to heights of, for example, 27km.!”
The team’s finding appears to corroborate the highly controversial views of the origin and evolution of life on Earth of the late Sir Fred Hoyle and his colleague, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe. Panspermia is the theory that life originated in space and later colonised Earth. It was first put forward in the 19th century by the Swedish astronomer, Svante Aarhenius. In the late 1970s and early ’80s another creatures here on Earth.
Most controversially, they suggested in the last book. More speculatively still, they suggested that the seeding of such genetic material on Earth was done deliberately by advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. They suggested that these would artificial, machine intelligences from another cosmos in the multiverse..
This is not the first time a scientific balloon has returned from the stratosphere containing what was suggested was extraterrestrial microbial life. A few years a balloon sent up by scientists in India returned to Earth with red slime. Like Prof Wainwright, the Indian scientists believed this material had been collected from too high an altitude for it to have come from the Earth. They came to the conclusion that it must therefore have come from space. Fred Hoyle died twenty or so years ago in the 1990s. The media did contact Chandra Wickramasinghe, who was then working at Cardiff University, if I recall correctly. Prof Wickramasinghe was delighted that there was now further evidence to support his and Sir Fred’s theory.
Meanwhile, Prof Wainwright’s team intend to repeat the experiment in October, when there is a meteor shower associated with Halley’s Comet. This will spread further cosmic dust. If the balloon returns again with similar material, it will confirm the team’s theory.
All this is fascinating and highly controversial. I don’t think, however, there’s any remote chance of them finding anything like the horrific extraterrestrial disease in Michael Creighton’s book and film, The Andromeda Strain.

Green Gold FulMecca is a water-soluble formula of low molecular weight humic acid, that benefits the plant during the entire growth cycle.

One Boot Tells Its Tail
by Alyson Faye
You stand naked
carved from moonshine,
your eyes oyster pearls
casting aside your
humane skin
for shimmering scales.
You have
led me
to this shore
bearing flowers,
a tangled posy
of ragwort and daisies
ripped from our
meadow-bed,
sweet, oh so sweet your breath
where we had lain
that morning
awash with lust and longing
transformed now into
my funeral wreath,
and you into sea-witch,
serpent-seductress,
whose hair coils tight
around my wrists,
whose tail froths the waves
and whose kiss
oh those lips
sweet mercy
Jesus save me
suck the life from me
leaving . . .
one boot upon the shore.
A fantastic poem.
Thank you so much. Alyson
Love the tale that you’ve woven around the boot – that first stanza, in particular, sets the scene so well.
Thank you Alex, appreciate your commenting – AlysonCrestor tablet cost

Filing Bankruptcy Amid Covid-19 Pandemic In Singapore: What You Should Know About The Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (Expired)','filing-bankruptcy-amid-covid-19-pandemic-in-singapore-what-you-should-know-about-the-covid-19-temporary-measures-act-expired','
Article was first published on 24th May 2020 and updated on 31st January 2021.
Bankruptcy and insolvency may seem like taboo topics for discussion but with the number of bankruptcy applications reaching 462 in March 2020, the highest in more than 15 years, getting clarity on the subject can just be the best way to prevent such unfortunate events. Furthermore, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to corrode the business sector and weaken the economy, there is no harm in getting more well-versed with the topics, they may even come in handy if you (touch wood!) or anyone around you are confronted with bankruptcy and insolvency matters.
A total of 8,663 business entities closed in April 2020, this figure more than doubled the number of cessation in March 2020. It will only get worse for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), when the Job Support Scheme wages subsidy drop in June for most SMEs from 75% to 25% and that is also when the grace period of 6 months ends for loan moratoriums.
Due to the pandemic, the Ministry of Law has recently included additional relief measures under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act to help individuals and businesses cope with potential bankruptcy in Singapore. Here’s some information that we have gathered for those who are keen to find out more.
Temporary Amendments to Bankruptcy & Insolvency Laws As of 20th April 2020, the Ministry of Law has implemented extra relief for bankrupts under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. There are two key amendments that both debtors and creditors need to know: The monetary threshold to petition for insolvency of a business - The Act increased the monetary threshold for bankruptcy from $15,000 to $60,000 for individuals, and $10,000 to $100,000 for corporates. The increase in the minimum debt amount provides a safety net for Singapore business owners to continue operating while insolvent. Debt repayment scheme has also increased from the initial $100,000 to $250,000 in this period to qualify. The statutory period to respond to creditor’s demand - The Act provides temporary relief to debtors from creditors’ legal action for up to 6 months from April 20. This means that for statutory demands served on or after this date, debtors can take up to 6 months, instead of 21 days, to satisfy creditors’ demands.
Measures in the Act relating to bankruptcy and insolvency will also commence on 20 April 2020, and last up to and including 19 October 2020
Alternatives to Bankruptcy Bankruptcy is not an easy way out of financial difficulties, being a bankrupt can create long-term problems that will impede employment, travelling overseas and loan applications. In Singapore, there are also restrictions for bankrupt to manage a business or act as a director of a company. As such, never ignore your creditors’ Letters of Demand, instead, take a proactive approach to resolve any credit issues before the matter escalates to the point of bankruptcy.
1. Private Negotiation with Creditors
An alternative to bankruptcy is to engage in private negotiation with creditors to pay off debts in instalments. Debtors should attempt to negotiate terms based on a realistic timeline and financial status so that repayment can be fulfilled promptly. If more time is required to liquidate assets or gather funds to repay the debts, present evidence and communicate the conditions clearly so that both parties can come to an agreeable decision.
2. Temporary Relief Measures - Ended 31st January 2021
Individuals and businesses who are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations due to the Covid-19 pandemic can leverage the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act to protect themselves from litigation or bankruptcy proceedings. Besides the increased monetary threshold for bankruptcy and extension of the statutory period, the Act also renders support to those who enter into contracts for rentals in the industrial and commercial sectors, construction and supply contracts, as well as certain secured loan facilities granted by banks or financial institutions to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
For debtors who require protection from legal proceedings and wish to obtain relief under the Act, a notification for relief must be served to the other party. Refer to the Ministry of Law website for notification guidelines. Additional Reporting on 31st Jan 2021: The prescribed period for three contracts will end on 31st Jan 2021:
- Hire Purchase and conditional sales agreements for commercial equipment or commercial vehicles, excluding those entered with banks of finance companies regulated by the Monetary Authority Of Singapore (MAS) (SMEs who are affected can still opt to take up a repayment scheme under the Re-Align Framework)
- Rental Agreements for commercial equipment or commercial vehicles (SMEs who are affected can still opt to take up a repayment scheme under the Re-Align Framework) To do so, hirer or renter must serve notice on all parties to the contract between now and 26th Feb 2021
- Events and tourism-related contracts
3. Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS)
Since 2009, the Singapore Bankruptcy Act has granted DRS as another alternative to bankruptcy proceedings. The arrangement allows individual debtors to repay their debts while retaining possession of their property and continuity of their business activities without becoming bankrupts. The DRS also prevents creditors from proceeding with any legal action against the debtor unless permitted by the court.
To apply for the DRS, debtors are required to file a bankruptcy application with the Singapore court. If bankruptcy proceedings have been filed by creditors, the court will refer the debtors to the Insolvency Office to assess their eligibility to enter the DRS. As part of the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, the monetary threshold for DRS has also been increased from $100,000 to $250,000. This means that the DRS is now available to those with debts not exceeding $250,000.
4. Voluntary Arrangement (VA)
VA is another negotiation alternative for debtors to initiate a proposal to repay their debts in the hope that creditors can hold back on bankruptcy proceedings. Debtors who want to enter into a VA agreement must first apply an interim order to stop all further proceedings against them. The application should be filed together with a proposal containing information on the debtor’s assets and liabilities and repayment plan. A nominee such as a registered public accountant or an advocate and solicitor must also be appointed to supervise the implementation of the VA. If the debtor fails to comply with the VA, the nominee or any of the creditors may file a Bankruptcy Application against the debtor. Bankruptcy is No Laughing Matter Bankruptcy is a rare occurrence, but it is a possible scenario when we are faced with uncertain times such as this pandemic when there is no clear sign of how fast our economy will recover. Whether you are an individual or an SME owner, becoming financially literate and managing your debts efficiently are the first steps to securing a more stable future. Be open to seek assistance, there is really no shame in asking for help from professionals and governing bodies that are set up to provide financial aid and advisory. It is better to be in the know and avoid bankruptcy than getting tangled in a financial mess that is hard to get out of.
Bankruptcy Q&A In Covid-19 Situation
- Can I be sued for failure to fulfill my contractual obligation due to current Covid-19 Situation?
The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill will apply to various categories of contracts, including:
- Construction and supply contracts;
- Leases or licenses for non-residential property;
- Contracts for the provision of goods and services for events;
- Certain contracts for goods or services for visitors in Singapore, domestic tourists or outbound tourists, or promotion of tourism; and
- Certain loan facilities granted by a bank or a finance company to SMEs.
The Bill will have retrospective effect and apply to contractual obligations that are to be performed on or after 1 February 2020 in contracts that were entered into or renewed before 25 March 2020.
The Bill will prohibit contracting parties from taking certain legal actions against counterparties who have breached their obligations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes court and insolvency proceedings and the termination of leases.
For construction contracts and supply contracts, the Bill will relieve contracting parties from the liability to pay liquidated damages in the event of a delay or failure in performance that was caused to a material extent by COVID-19. This statutory protection will override any contractual agreement between parties relating to the payment of liquidated damages.
The Bill will also provide additional relief in respect of forfeiture of deposits for events and tourism-related contracts. For example, a venue provider cannot forfeit a person's deposit for an event that is postponed because of COVID-19 restrictions without obtaining a determination from an assessment that it was just and equitable to forfeit the whole or part of the deposit.
- How long will the relief last for?
By default, the relief will last for 6 months from 20 April 2020. The Singapore government will monitor the situation and may adjust this period accordingly.
- What if i am sued or want to be declared bankrupt during this COVID-19 Period, am i allowed to meet my insolvency practitioner?
Meetings whose due dates fall between 27 March and 30 September 2020 2020 are allowed to be deferred. Alternatively, electronic means or alternative arrangements can be arranged but a meeting ordered or directed by the court does not apply to the order. For such meetings, one may wish to apply to the court to seek further directions or variation of the orders, as to the safe distancing measures that your practitioner intends to implement at such meetings.
- Can I be sued if I am unable to pay rents owing to COVID-19 situation?
Landlords would not be allowed to terminate the lease of tenants or repossess the premises and start court or insolvency proceedings, if rent is not paid during the relief period for rental contracts that are performed on or after 1 February 2020 and that were entered into or renewed before 25 March 2020.
If landlords dispute, the Ministry of Law will appoint assessor to decide if inability to perform contractual obligations was due to Covid-19.
The assessor will then decide on a just and equitable outcome based on facts of each case, the process will take no more than 5 days at no costs to either party and their decision is final and no appeals can be made.
- Are financial institution's contractual rights included in the current relief bill?
No, the financial institutions are still allowed to charge you for fees and interest for non-payment or late payment.
- What happened to my HDB, CPF and Insurance Policy after I was declared bankrupt?
Monies in your CPF statements are protected by legal liabilities, these include any amount in your Ordinary account (OA), Special Account (SA), Medisave Account (MA) or any CPF Investment Scheme (IS).
An undischarged bankrupt will still be able to purchase a HDB with their CPF monies of not more than $500,000 in value and no bigger than 4-room flat. (Special exemption can be obtained from your Official Trustee (OA), if you need to purchase a bigger flat of higher amount).
Existing HDB assets are protected from your OA and will not form part of your assets managed by the OA.
Undischarged bankrupt are still allowed to withdraw money from their CPF when they turn 55 if you are eligible but monies that are withdrawn will not be protected from the claims by your OA.
Any insurance policy especially those with cash value will form part of your assets and maybe sold by your OA, life insurance policy where your spouse or children are the beneficiaries will be protected from the OA.
7. If I am already a bankrupt, do I still need to pay my monthly installment or contribution this period?
Yes, but in light of the COVID-19 situation, the OA may allow bankrupts to formally request for a reduction of their monthly installment or contribution as a temporary relief measure.
More info can be found here.
8. Can i file my own bankruptcy during this Covid-19 Period ?
Yes, there are no change in the procedure for debtor bankruptcy application. But in light of the COVID-19 situation, the Legal Registry will determine if the application is deemed 'Urgent and Essential', and whether to proceed with the bankruptcy filling in this period.

My Current Situation
I am at a house in Upstate New York with my family. When I say Upstate, I mean no cell service, backwoods, 25-minutes to the nearest grocery store Upstate New York. It is absolutely beautiful. We rented a house at the end of a LONG, HILLY, GRAVELY driveway with a pool, tennis court, bocci ball and horseshoe court (or as my brother just said, you should call it a horseshoe arena), a pond and wonderful people I call my family.
The Problem
I rarely have the urge to go on a run, just like Paige rarely has the urge to pick up weights. Today, though, I was feeling it. I was so exited to get up to this house, work for a bit and then go on a nice, long run. The problem is that about every 200 ft, there is a deathly curve in the road and you seriously cannot see what is 5 ft on the other end of the curve. So running in the street is out.
My mom brought ten pound weights, which is more than enough for a killer workout, but like I said, I really just wanted to get a run in.
Enter: Adam
Adam is my oldest brother, an Assistant Men’s Soccer Coach at Butler University and a bit of a crazy person when it comes to exercise. So, after already running this morning and playing about an hour of tennis with my other brother Danny, he suggested getting a workout using the driveway.
*Please see description of driveway above. Read it again, but this time in a louder-than-appropriate voice and the tone you’d image the Devil to use when speaking.
The Workout:
Find a friend. Jog down the .3 mile-long driveway. Look up at the hill in front of you. Think unpleasant thoughts. (Adam described this as the opposite the feeling you get when you are super pumped to ski a double black diamond, then you get to the top and think about how stupid an idea this was) Change those unpleasant thoughts to positive, motivational, YES YOU CAN thoughts. Take off up the hill. Curse at each other the whole way up. Walk back down to recover. Repeat as many times as you can, then do one more.
The Finisher
5 Minutes of arms: Push ups 10x, Tricep Dips 10x, Plank Up/Downs 10 e/a
5 Minutes of abs: Slow Cross Crawls 20 e/a, Reverse Planks 10x, Side Plank Pulses 10 e/a.
Pro Tip:
Bring bug spray with you to do the abs and arms.
I am currently working on tomorrow’s circuit training for Adam and I to do. There MIGHT be a guest appearance from my mom, in which case, I’ll explain the workout and all the ways you can moderate it for your fitness level. Until then, over and out fitness peeps.

Business Case:
User wants to sort the list report output based on list columns dynamically, after the report output has been rendered in HTML format.
IBM Solution:
IBM has an article for doing the same thing. I found that this article was extremely complicated with a lot of steps. So, I wrote this script from scratch, which in my opinion is much simpler to implement. Here's the link to IBM's article in case you are interested.-
Solution:
- Most of the work here is done by the Javascript.
- The script goes through each row and loads the data into an array.
- When the column titles are clicked, the array is sorted in memory and the script re-writes the data into the list.
- In this example, my report has 2 columns.
- The column names in list report header will be clickable.
- Initially, the data is unsorted. Clicking the column header will sort the list based on that column in ascending order.
- Clicking the column header again will sort in descending order.
- After that the sort order keeps toggling.
Note:
Implementation:
- If sorting is required before running the report, prompts can be used.
- The solution provided here is only for simple sorting. Sorting is by one column at a time only. Excel style advanced sorting cannot be done with this method (E.g. Sort by Column 1 Ascending, Column 2 Descending).
- Only data on the current page will be sorted, so if you have data spanning more than one page, set the "Rows per Page" property of the list report to a high number (e.g. 10000) so that all the data is displayed in one page.
- There are a total of 4 scripts.
- Script 1:
- This is a placeholder to identify the list report. The main script will look for this script, and access the data inside it.
- Unlock the cells and place an HTML item in the first column header.
- Paste the following script inside this HTML item
- Scripts 2 & 3 are wrapper scripts for the column headers. This will make the column headers clickable.
- Script 2:
- This is the first part of the wrapper script.
- Place an HTML items before each column header and paste the following code inside it.
- Note: The number inside the "sortList()" function should match the column number. So it should be sortList(2) for the second column, sortList(3) for the third column and so on.
- Script 3:
- This is the second part of the wrapper script.
- Place an HTML items after each column header and paste the following code inside it.
- Script 4:
- This is the main script that does all the sorting.
- The first section of the report has 3 variable declarations that you have to edit according to your report.
- "
var column_count = 2" indicates the number of columns in your report. If you add more columns, change this value.
- "var current_sort = new Array("","")" is the initial state of the sorting. If you have 3 columns, put three "" separated by commas.
- "var column_names = ["Group","Market"]" is an array with column names. If you note in the screenshots below, the column names are different (Market Group instead of Group). This is for script reference only and doesn't have to match with the list column names.
- The rest of the script should be used as is.
- You can download this script here.
- Place an HTML item after the list report (outside the list) and copy/paste the following code:
- Once you have placed all the scripts, your report layout should look like this:
<span id="list1"></span>
<a href="JavaScript:sortList(1)">
</a>
<script type="text/javascript">
/******************* Customize this section according to the report ***********************************/
var column_count = 2; //Number of columns in the report
var current_sort = new Array("",""); //This array should contain one empty value per column.
var column_names = ["Group","Market"]; // List the names of columns which should be sortable
/**********************************************************************************************************/
var list_cell = document.getElementById("list1").parentNode; // Lookup the placeholder span item
var list_row = list_cell.parentNode; // Create Handle for the header row which contains the span item
var list_table = list_row.parentNode.parentNode; // Create Handle for the table
var rows = list_table.getElementsByTagName("tr"); //Get List of rows in the table
var row_count = rows.length; // Get row count
var list_array = new Array(); // Create parent array. Each element of this array will represent a row in the list report.
for (i=1; i<row_count;i++) //Loop through the rows. Skipping header row and starting from 1
{
columns = rows[i].getElementsByTagName("td");
var list_row_array = new Array(); // Create child array. Each element of this array represents a column on the row.
for(j=0;j<column_count;j++) // Loop through the columns for each row
{
// Read value from the cell and store it in array
list_row_array[column_names[j]] = columns[j].getElementsByTagName("span")[0].innerHTML;
}
list_array[i-1] = list_row_array;
}
// Main Function used for sorting.
function sortList(col_num)
{
if(current_sort[col_num-1] == '' || current_sort[col_num-1] == 'desc'){

columns = rows[i+1].getElementsByTagName("td");
for(j=0; j<column_count; j++)
{
columns[j].getElementsByTagName("span")[0].innerHTML = list_array[i][column_names[j]];
}
}
}
// Sub function used for sorting. Don't change.
function dynamicSortAsc(colIndex) {
return function (a,b) {

}
</script>
- When you run the report the initial output will be like this:
- Clicking on "Market Group" will sort the list in ascending order by Market Group and the report will look like this:
- Clicking on "Market Group" again will sort the list in descending order by Market Group and the report will look like this:
- Clicking on "Market" will sort the list in ascending order by Market and the report will look like this:
- To sort by Market in descending order, click Market again:

Solar Meltdown
Earth’s reliance on electronics could make the planet vulnerable to a global internet “meltdown” should a solar storm as powerful as the one that occurred in the pre-hi-tech year of 1859 knock out that technology. The Carrington Event of Sept. 1-2, 1859, caused serious damage to telegraph systems of the day. Speaking to “WIRED,” researcher Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi said that while local and regional fibre networks probably wouldn’t be badly affected by such a large-scale solar storm, she is concerned about the repeaters used to connect the world’s vast undersea cable system. Earlier studies have warned that other technology, especially orbiting satellites, could be fried by an intense solar storm.
Earthquakes
At least one person was killed as a powerful temblor caused scattered damage and power failures around Acapulco.• Earth movements were also felt in West Texas, New Zealand’s North Island, eastern Taiwan and Bali.
Babbling Bats
The infants of one bat species in Latin America have been found to make a babbling sound not unlike those of human babies. While the early vocalizations of human babies are integral to their language development, there has been little evidence of the behaviour in other species. But researchers from the Museum of Natural History in Berlin found that baby greater sac-winged bats are especially loquacious, mouthing 25 different types of syllables. Study co-author Martina Nagy says that as in speech, the bat babbles are a precursor to the sounds adults of the species use to communicate. Bouts of the bat babbles can last up to 43 minutes, according to Nagy.
Dwindled Giant
South America’s once- mighty Paraná River is now at its lowest level since 1941, causing thousands of acres of wetlands to dry up as well as threatening public water supplies and the livelihoods of fishermen and farmers. Experts say they don’t know if this is part of a natural cycle or climate change. But there has been a three-year period of below-normal rainfall at the river’s source in southern Brazil. Low water levels have also created a 50 percent drop in hydroelectric power at generating plants along the Argentina-Paraguay border.
Climatic ‘Shapeshift’
A new study reveals that some warm-blooded animals are getting larger beaks, legs and ears to better regulate their body temperatures as the planet gets hotter. Researcher Sara Ryding of Australia’s Deakin University says that the physical evolution of some species is occurring across many regions and among a variety of species. She says this means climate change is probably the only common factor behind the evolution. “Shapeshifting does not mean that animals are coping with climate change,” Ryding said. “It just means they are evolving to survive it.” But she adds that not all species may evolve rapidly enough to survive global heating.
Pollution Kills
A new report highlights how air pollution, mainly from coal, is impacting life expectancy far greater than diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and even behavior such as smoking cigarettes and waging war. The Air Quality Life Index reveals that unless particulate pollution is reduced to meet World Health Organisation guidelines, the average person will lose about 2.2 years of his or her life. Even though China has slashed its air pollution, dirty air is still cutting about 2.6 years off its life spans. India has made no such efforts, and its citizens lose 5.9 years off their lives, especially in the highly polluted north of the country.
Tropical Cyclones
Tropical Storm Conson knocked out power in parts of the Philippines. • Typhoon Chanthu briefly reached Category-5 force east of the Philippines.• Newfoundland was on alert for Hurricane Larry as Tropical Storm Olaf clipped Baja California.• Tropical Storm Mindy doused northern Florida and southern Georgia.

This means that our smile is very important when meeting new people and when trying to increase our relationships and careers. When our smile is beautiful it gives us more confidence and we feel like we can conquer any obstacle. IF your smile is not as perfect as you would like it to be, there are numerous things you can do to enhance it. There is a whole range of dental treatments available to restore damaged or missing teeth, strengthen them and make them beautiful. Read on to find our 6 ways to overhaul your smile this year.
Teeth Whitening and Your Smile
Teeth whitening is a very common part of making your smile beautiful and enhancing it if you don’t need bigger procedures. It can brighten your smile and it’s an instant anti-aging treatment. It’s usually done at a smaller cost but still achieves amazing results. If your teeth have a mild to moderate staining, in-office whitening can do wonders as it erases years of staining in only one procedure. If your teeth need a little bit more work, you will have to revisit your dentist two or three times. Maintenance is simple and it requires you to wear a whitening tray once every couple of months. If you prefer to do your teeth whitening at home, there are numerous whitening toothpaste and strips you can use.
Porcelain Veneers
Veneers are one of the most popular dental cosmetic procedures and also one of the simplest to do. They can give you the most dramatic change in your appearance. Veneers are a long-lasting treatment of your teeth that can conceal and flaws you have. They improve your smile and the look of your mouth in general. Veneers are a thin layered shell of porcelain that is layered over your teeth to improve their appearance. Veneers are great if your teeth are stained, or if they are chipped, cracked or just worn out. The complete transformation of your teeth and smile can be done in just a couple of weeks.
Lumineers
Lumineers are a type of veneers. They are extremely thin, and they can be placed directly over your natural teeth without any preparation. Unlike normal porcelain veneers, they don’t require a reduction of your natural teeth prior to being placed. They are a perfect option for anyone who wants to have veneers but doesn’t want their natural teeth reduced or who prefer a non-porcelain option.
Ceramic Crowns and Your Smile
Ceramic crowns are a non-surgical way to improve the appearance of your teeth. Porcelain is a highly durable natural material that can stand up to a decade of use. It’s a comfortable material to have in your mouth. It’s resistant to staining. Crowns are like a small cap that is placed on top of your tooth. It’s perfect for protecting your teeth from further damage while giving you the perfect smile you have ever wanted. Ceramic crowns are made to match with your natural teeth that are surrounding them so they don’t look out of place and fake. If your teeth are completely removed, the crown can act as a cover.
Teeth Straightening
Teeth straightening or alignment is a procedure that aligns your teeth in a position they should perfectly be in. You can have misaligned teeth due to an accident or due to genetics. A common problem is an overbite or an underbite. All of these issues can be corrected with an orthodontic procedure. It’s important to choose qualified and professional dentists like Terrigal Dental to ensure the quality of the procedure. Noticing any problems with your child’s teeth early on can prevent future bigger procedures. Teeth aligning can also be done even if you are an adult, and it’s becoming more common than it was.
Dental Implants
Dental implants are artificial teeth that are surgically placed in your jaw. They are a relatively new procedure for improving your smile and appearance. They act as a foundation or a substitute for any missing teeth you may have. They offer a long-lasting and stable replacement. They are usually done if dental bridges or other dental cosmetic procedures are impossible. Dental implants don’t rely on the support of the teeth beside them. They are surgically rooted in your jaw. This makes them sturdy and they last for a long time. A screw is fixed into your gum and acts as an artificial root. The bone around it locks onto the screw, and you will have a temporary crown while this process completes. When the process is completed a proper porcelain crown is fitted on top of the screw.
Investing in the look of your teeth is important for boosting your health and confidence. There are many procedures you can do to get the smile you have always dreamed of. If you are unhappy with your smile, consider these procedures to fix any problems you may have.Imphal, April 1 (IANS): The newly-formed Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in Manipur has ordered an inquiry into a 2010 CCTV scam involving over Rs 8 crore.
The three-member committee constituted on Friday began working on the pre-poll pledge of the BJP to fight corruption beginning from even a single rupee and punishing the guilty ones.
The Committee will submit its report within 15 days.
Then Congress government in 2010 had sanctioned Rs 8.01 crore for the installation of 100 CCTV cameras.
At least 50 and 27 cameras were to be installed at the Raj Bhavan and the Chief Minister's office complex, respectively. The rest were for different parts in the city here.
It is alleged that soon after installation, the cameras installed by a Bengaluru firm began to malfunction. Following the media attention, a three-member inquiry committee was constituted but it never filed a report.
The coalition government in Manipur was formed in March after three consecutive terms by the Congress party.Student Instructions

Recent MAX price plunge due to market pricing in the risk of a 51% attack as 1GH.com dominates the network's hashrateWith that being said, I'd like to invite some of you to come join us over at, there's only 16 people mining atm, and there's NO fees, with a very pleasing UI.
I'm admittedly a MAX bull and I think a lot of the recent price action is due to a problem right now with the centralisation of mining power at 1GH.com. As of yesterday, they control upwards of 84% of the entire network giving them the ability to carry out a 51% attack if they so wished. 1GH's admin has a lot to answer for here. They are acting irresponsibly by failing to increase the fees on their pool.
MaxCoin is a brand new cryptocurrency in the broad scheme of things and it's community is still in it's early stages and quite weak. It took years for bitcoin to develop the community that it has behind it and almost as long for it's price to rise from 0 to where MaxCoin currently is. So to be honest, MAX is still doing brilliantly compared to the growing pains bitcoin experienced, and it is one of the most traded altcoins right now meaning the potential for future gains is huge once our current problems are ironed out.
It has strong fundamentals, which is the most important point. MaxCoin transactions are much faster, hashing function is technically superior, the initial distribution of mining profits was fairer than even bitcoin was & SHA-3 is a more efficient algorithm for mining, meaning you can squeeze more Khash/$ from your mining rigs.
The major problem for this coin right now is centralisation of mining power at 1GH.com because of the liability of a 51% attack. The fact that the maxcoin blockchain is technically un-secure is the reason the price has fallen. An anonymous, private mining pool - 1GH.com - controls about 5.5 TH/s of the network while the total hashrate is only about 7 TH/s. 1GH could attack the maxcoin blockchain if they wanted to, making your investment worthless. They have not done so as of yet, but their ability to do it remains an underlying fundamental liability in the network. Who knows if they have malevolent or benevolent motives. They are unlikely to do this as it would cut them out of their 3% fee, but the potential remains and is getting priced in by the market.
This is only a temporary state of affairs however. It is only a matter of time before other convenient pools spring up and 1GH's dominance of the network falls, but until then I think the smart money will be invested in other coins. This is why the 1GH issue is currently THE MOST IMPORTANT problem for this coin. There are some other exchange-related teething problems, but they are insignificant in terms of the blockchain security issue.
Anyone currently invested in MaxCoin should probably hold tight through this period. Either that or crystallise a huge loss. I suppose it's about confidence. I have seen bitcoin go through similar growth pains so that is why I have the confidence to hold while others may not. In fact, I am using this as an opportunity to get some extremely cheap coins from panic sellers.
The single most effective thing we can do is to pull our miners from 1GH and move to another pool. If you keep mining there, you are de-valuing your own mining investment. This is not a profitable coin for people to mine and dump right now, so if that is what you are doing, I suggest you do it elsewhere. Mining MaxCoin right now is basically a speculative medium to long-term investment. Don't bother doing it if your cash-flow requires you to dump-out to fiat immediately to pay electricity costs. There is no profit to be had doing that at this point.
Here is a statement from the 1GH.com pool admin with regards to fees:Clearly, he does not care that the market and the price is reflecting the failure of the dominant pool operator to act in a responsible way. When the market urges an increase of fees, this is not 'artificial regulation', it is an attempt to self-regulate which 1GH is resisting.
Quote from: 1GH Admin We are against artificaial regulation of mining. If majority of miners like our pool best - so be it, we are not booting them with prohibitive fees. We also believe that anyone genuinely interested in network security should get down to starting a p2pool rather than waste their time and effort trying to distribute and redistribute the hashpower between private pools.
TO THE ADMIN of 1GH.com:Please tweet this comment thread to the admin of 1GH. The community deserves a response from the dominant maxcoin pool operator. His twitter handle is @1ghcom
If you care at all about the security of the maxcoin network and your future profits from mining this coin, you need to immediately introduce a significant fee for mining MAX at your pool or make an announcement on your site regarding the security issue your members are causing. Failure to do this is posing a huge risk to the security of the blockchain. As the largest pool, you have a duty to act in a responsible way. You cannot just ignore the facts and the price signals from the market telling you that this IS A PROBLEM. Increasing your fees is NOT an 'artificial regulation', it is something the market is DEMANDING that you Merkle Baum .

This chart compares the hash rates on Bitcoin and two of its forks, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. We can still compare the amount of hashrate between two different cryptocurrencies, and the Bitcoin network has a lot more computing power than all the other currencies put together. This is why it’s pretty easy to argue that Bitcoin is the most stable and secure, and why it’s very unlikely ...

#Brooke, who was turning eight, asked her brother, turning 10, how he felt about asking for donations for their birthday rather than presents. He agreed, and the two approached their mom to help with the arrangements.
According to Ethan, not having presents didn’t take any of the excitement out of their party. “It was a really great time with friends.”
This act of pure generosity doesn’t surprise their mom, Kelli Murphy. Their Aunt Fay was like a second mom to her children. The time the family spent together in the palliative care unit was very profound and had an impact on everyone including Brooke and Ethan.
“Fay’s passing was a very difficult time, which would have been so much worse without that unit. We as a family talk about it all the time.” Kelli is keenly aware of the difference the Unit has made. Her father passed away from cancer in 1994, before the Palliative Care Unit was opened.
“The kids had a living room right next to Fay’s room. They could have a cookie and do puzzles with other family members. That space made such a difference for all of us.”
Speaking to Brooke, she remembers having fun spending time with family and beating her brother at a game of cards.
“You can tell that a lot of thought and heart went into making that place what it is,” says Kelli, who remembers the Unit as a calming, serene and comfortable place.
The family delivered the donation on Dec. 21, the one-year anniversary of Fay’s passing.
“I wasn’t sure how I’d feel going back there. But it was good; it felt good to give back because the unit made such a difference for us. We’re hoping to continue what Brooke and Ethan have started and to grow it with our family as a tradition to honour Fay.”Lonely seeking nsa warsaw

Before I continue though, I should just mention that this film should not be confused with the 2001 film of the same name, which stars Thora Birch. Two different films, my friends, and two films of greatly differing tones. Joe Dante’s The Hole, which unfortunately is not released in 3D format, is by all accounts a family film. It’s rated PG-13 and has the feel of an 80s or 90s flick, such as The Gate or even Dante’s Gremlins. There was definitely that classic vibe about the film, straight from the get-go, so it was interesting to see whether the story itself, and execution of, could back up that nostalgic feel.
The good news is that The Hole is a really fun movie. I will admit to having my concerns about it, with the lengthy delay on its release, but on the whole (or Hole) it is quite the charming little movie.
The plot of The Hole follows Dane, his brother Lucas and their mother, as they move once again to another new home. This time they move to a quaint small town and a house that is quite the picture. There’s a girl next door, who immediately catches Dane’s eye, and despite his complaints about moving yet again, he tries to make the most of it.
During some playful shenanigans with his brother they stumble across a locked door in the floor of their basement. Being the curious kids they are, they decide to open the door and it is then that strange things start to happen; a mysterious and creepy young girl is seen, an evil looking clown makes an appearance and a hulking great figure, all makes an appearance.
This being a Dante flick it is all down to the kids to try and work out what is going on. This involves a visit to the house’s previous owner, played by Bruce Dern. Can they put a stop to these strange and menacing events? What do you think?
The Hole is a fun movie, and you can tell that it is aimed towards a slightly younger crowd. There’s absolutely no blood or gore here, and the scares are of the gradual kind. This film isn’t going to give you sleepless nights, but there is absolutely no reason that you shouldn’t get some enjoyment from it. Just know what you are watching, before you watch it, and get yourself in a family-friendly movie frame of mind.
The Hole does lose its way a little in the latter third, where it takes a slightly more serious tone, but the film as a whole is quite enjoyable. Dick Smith pops up in a small cameo, and that is always good to see, and Bruce Dern gives a fun Doc Brown-style manic performance too. Teri Polo plays that boys’ mother, and is probably the only other recognizable face on display here.
All the cast give good solid performances though in this old school style flick. There are a few extras included on the DVD (which is the version I watched), including a ‘Making of’, all of which make this worth checking out.
The Hole is released on Blu-ray and DVD by Big Air Studios on October 2nd.As the weather becomes colder, now seems a good time to explore how ice is captured through time-lapse. Video sequences can speedily reveal its gradual changing state and magnify subtle changes. Ice in its various forms is fascinating to watch, and therefore it is interesting to focus on how it is captured in different ways, from ice cubes melting in a glass to ice crystals rapidly developing.
With such a variety of videos featuring ice, in this blog, we have picked out a selection of time-lapse videos that capture the different stages of ice close up. Not only are these interesting, but they also show how easy it is to get hands-on with a camera – often from the comfort of your own home.
Melting ice
Time-lapse photography is an ideal way to capture the mesmerising transition between water and ice. Even something so simple as watching ice melt can be appealing. There are numerous variations on this theme. This captivating amateur short time-lapse sequence reveals a solo ice cube rapidly melting.
Whilst a simple time-lapse capturing a glassful of ice cubes thawing fixes our attention.
Other time-lapse sequences speedily show the different states of water, from ice to liquid to boiling to evaporation.
On a larger scale, there is something fascinating about watching an intricate ice sculpture gradually dissolve into an unrecognisable state.
These often amateur time-lapses capture the straightforward melting of ice. Others mess around with the concept and disorientate the viewer. In the time-lapse sequence, Unmelt, Tony Round plays around with the melting of ice and snow to create this rather unsettling timelapse where the process is played in reverse.
Adding further interest to the concept of melting he has also created a video “Ice Storm” where items frozen during an ice storm in Toronto thaw out on timelapse. We witness them unfurling from their frozen mass to their former state, and to add to the interest he also flips this process throughout the film.
Ice forming in time-lapse
Other time-lapse videos focus on the sequence of water turning into ice. Just a glass of water gradually solidifying into ice is fascinating.
Whilst the beautiful yet simple “Frostylapse” time-lapses frost and ice crystals forming on a window. Each clip is 4 to 7 hours of real-time freezing, showing the exquisite formations of frost and ice crystals. The ice crystals subtly change colour throughout filming as light and conditions differ and the types of crystals and formation speed vary with temperature. When all the clips are edited together it creates a mesmerising time-lapse sequence.
Another unusual and intriguing video is of a bubble freezing. This amateur time-lapse reveals how frost gradually coats the delicate structure.
The enthralling short time-lapse film “Shifting Time – Water and Ice” by Daniel Kelly Brown is shot in natural surrounds and focuses on multiple day-long ice formations in Colorado rivers. It captures icicles growing from freezing water, as ice crystals form the crystalline structures.
Macro and micro time-lapse
Daniel Kelly Brown also produced his “Water and Ice” video in a macro version. Having produced the original version in 4K HD, he was able to zoom in to show the growth of the ice formation in further detail.
Macro time-lapse reveals footage that is not normally visible to the naked eye. A macro lens can magnify the intricate developments of frozen matter or capture a carpet of ice crystals creeping across the screen. In this macro time-lapse video, the footage reveals moisture from the surrounding atmosphere condensing at sub-zero temperatures to almost immediately form growing dendritic ice crystals.
Whilst using specialist equipment, microscopic time-lapse can chart the detailed formation of individual ice crystals. Filmed through a microscope, this time-lapse “Snowtime” by Vyacheslav Ivanov shows the intimate details of fragile snowflakes as they form in their miraculous hexagonal forms.
Why use time-lapse?
Time-lapse manipulates time, speeding up and emphasising changes to dramatic effect. Time-lapse captures the melting or creation of ice by piecing together all its different states to effectively show its many forms in just a short video.Don’t you are too abruptly or use force in the face a more effective way to look for in face lift can make a big differences: Old School – High and TightIn previous decades.

Other links:Two Tel Aviv University scientists hope their pioneering research in nanotechnology will eventually lead to advanced biosensors for use in homeland security, environmental monitoring and medicine. Prof. Ehud Gazit and Meital Reches of TAU's George S. Weiss Faculty of Life Sciences used small protein fragments called dipeptides to produce a "forest" of strong nanoscale tubes that spontaneously assembled on areas the size of a pin-head. Their work on universal nanotube platforms has been featured as a cover story in the December issue of the journal Nature Nanotechnology. In a separate editorial in the journal, Prof. Shuguang Zhang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Biomedical Engineering praised the Israelis' work and said it could have applications in treating bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow disease") and degenerative human diseases such as Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes. The self-assembled nanotubes show remarkable chemical stability and physical rigidity, exhibiting physical strength similar to that of Kevlar, which is used for bulletproof vests. Biosensors, which are very sensitive and specific detectors of biological materials, are one of the most promising applications for the research. Peptide nanotubes have already been shown to considerably improve the performances of electrochemical biosensors. As the tubes are rigid and stable and can be integrated into electronic devices, they are perfect building blocks for next-generation sensors combining biology, chemistry and engineering, Gazit said. The two scientists developed a simple and efficient way to create new functional materials, according to the article in Nature Nanotechnology. Ramot, TAU's technology transfer company, has applied for a patent on the nanotubes' structure, their self-assembly formation and their wide range of applications; the technology is available for licensing. Gazit said he and Reches were very pleased that since they started their nanotube research, teams in the US, Norway and other countries had entered the field.1 year ago

Maria Hunter is raising money for Breast Cancer Now
Remembering All Women affected by Breast Cancer
My story
My mum first had breast cancer in 2004, she beat it and got her 10 year all clear mark in 2014, but it came back the following year and she sadly lost her battle in May 2016.
My sister and I had to attend the genetics clinic because this type of cancer was already in our family line and it became clear that we are at a higher risk of this type of cancer and therefore we get checked yearly.
I myself have had a few scares and only just recently had a lump which turned out to be an abscess and was treated. Ladies - please check your breasts regularly!!
So if I can raise funds for this charity through teaching fitness classes thru zoom then Id be delighted for anything you can spare, no matter how small!
Thank You in advance and Stay Safe ??!!
Thank you for checking out my page. Making a donation is fast, easy and secure thanks to Give as you Live Donate. They'll take your donation and pass it onto Breast Cancer Now.

- Remember to get more than one estimate for construction or repair work. Ask friends and relatives to recommend local contractors with reputable business histories.
Your duties as an Insured:
- Review your coverage with your local independent agent. Your policy may reimburse you for removal of debris and/or additional living expenses as well as include specialized endorsements which may broaden your coverage.
- Don't make permanent repairs before an insurance adjuster inspects your home. Make only temporary repairs to protect your home from looting or further damage.
- Be present, and take notes, during the insurance adjuster's inspection. If possible, you might want your own contractor/builder on hand during the inspection as well.
- Keep good notes on all contacts with your insurance company and adjuster. If you have a disagreement with your adjuster, well-documented information may help you to support your claim.Did you know that your tooth enamel is ranked as hard as steel? It's true, on the Mohs Hardness Scale, tooth enamel ranks a five out of a possible ten. Diamonds, the hardest substance on earth, are rated at a ten. In fact, tooth enamel is the hardest thing found in your entire body.
Yet, with all this toughness, your tooth enamel may still fall victim to staining. As you can imagine, many of those stains come from the food and drink that everyone consumes. Known as extrinsic staining, this kind of discoloration is only in your tooth enamel. It also is the most responsive to teeth whitening treatments.
However, sometimes a tooth's stained appearance comes from a problem within the tooth, also called intrinsic staining. The causes of intrinsic staining can be tooth damage or decay, some medications, and genetic factors. Improvements in your tooth enamel might make these stains less noticeable, but if they progress, Dr. Matthew Wenzel, DMD might recommend a different whitening treatment.
Age Is a Factor in the Color of Your Teeth
You naturally wear down your tooth enamel as you grow older, making both extrinsic and intrinsic staining seem more noticeable. In addition, some people perceive their teeth as more yellowish as they age. This effect is due to your dentin tissues, which live below the enamel to show through that outer layer as it wears.
Teeth Whitening in Webster Groves Reduces Staining
The team at Webster Grove Dental can help you with professional teeth whitening treatments that will solve most extrinsic staining and some intrinsic. Our take-home whitening kits give you're the advantage of an accurate tray fitted for your particular teeth and mouth. Because your tray's fit is so tight, the whitening gel stays more on your teeth and less on your gums and other tissues.
Some Teeth Stains Don't Respond to Teeth Whiteners
A second benefit of working with your dentist to address your teeth stains is our follow-up. One aspect of teeth whitening treatments is they require multiple, regular applications for the best results. With our trays and whiteners, Dr. Wenzel will monitor your progress and recommend treatments for stubborn intrinsic discoloration.
In these cases, we offer several cosmetic treatments to correct the problem, including cosmetic dental bonding and porcelain veneers.
Contact Webster Groves Dental to Get Started!
If you have noticeably stained teeth, it might be due to what you eat and drink, the medications you take, all while being impacted by your age. But, in many cases, your smile may benefit from professional teeth whitening. To learn more about your teeth whitening options, call our dentist office at (314) 918-9666 to schedule an appointment at Webster Groves Dental.NaA zeolite membrane with high performance synthesized by vapor phase transformation method

Abstract
NaA zeolite membrane was synthesized with high permeance on porous alumina substrate by the vapor phase transformation method. The membranes were characterized by XRD and SEM techniques. The XRD results showed that the membranes after the synthesis time of 24 h consisted of the pure NaA zeolite crystals. The SEM results showed that the membranes after the synthesis time of 48 h consisted of intergrown zeolite crystals. The H-2 permeance of the NaA zeolite membranes was higher than 2.0 x 10(-6) mol/(Pa (.) m(2 .) s), and the maximum of the gas H-2/C3H8 permselectivity was 7.15, which is higher than the corresponding Knudsen diffusion selectivity of which is 4.69.Everyone is welcome to stay after the worship service today as we welcome Ellee Rose Tassone into the Kingdom of God through Holy Baptism.

Concept:
Growth and development of any society is measured by the status of women in the society. In this context, India is a fortunate country where women have been great achievers since the pre-independence era. Post-independence, role of women has evolved across various facets of life. Besides playing the role of a successful home maker, modern Indian women have been making their mark even in the male dominated professions such as engineering, politics, foreign diplomacy, sports, defense and many such areas. Indian women contribute more than 49% of the society and are playing a pivotal role in making India a Global Super Power.

At just 6 years old, Viola Davis’s daughter Genesis Tennon might be one of the most enthusiastic members of the Beyhive.
Mom appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday and revealed that young Genesis is a huge Beyoncé fan with a flair for the dramatic.
“She’s 6 years old and her latest thing is Beyoncé. She wants to go to a Beyoncé concert,” Davis told the host. “We said, no, you can not go to Beyoncé, Genesis. She went, ‘No! You don’t know what Lemonade means to me, Mama. You don’t know what Beyoncé means to my life.’ There you go.”
Clearly, Genesis has theatrical tendencies and she wants to be an actress, like Mom. “She says, ‘Mommy, I know how to live the words. I know how to breathe the words. I know how to remember the words,’” Davis explained. “And I said, ‘Well, you’d better remember how to go to school and then at 18 you need to remember how to get out of the house and pay your own bills.’”

As for her own acting career, she has one request for the writers of How to Get Away with Murder: no more sex scenes that are too physically demanding. “You cannot throw me up against a wall. They threw me up against a wall the first season and I threw my back out for two weeks and my hip, so I limped around for two weeks and I said no more walls,” she said. “I just want to, you know, be on the bed and I don’t want to move. I don’t want anyone on top of me. I don’t want to be on top of anybody else.”

While that is all very exciting, the main highlight was the blustering, crisp day we spent on the Cliffs of Moher. We truly could not have picked a gloomier day to make the trek out to the famous Irish destination, but the weather could not dampen the pure beauty of the cliffs.
When we arrived it was cloudy, drizzling and extremely windy. But as the coach bus wound its way up the hill towards the cliffs, the rain died down a bit and the clouds cleared so that, even though it was still quite cold and the wind was biting, we could clearly see what we came for. And the cliffs are truly breathtaking. The dominant thought racing through my mind was that I was standing inside of a postcard, trapped alongside a distant place that I thought only existed in my imagination but never in my reality.
Stone walls snake along the edge of the cliffs with comical, yet terrifying signs warning about the dangers of being sucked off by the wind down into the turbulent waters. Wind slams in the side of the cliffs and strikes upward before slashing across the top of the grass, toppling tourists in the process. Ocean spray whips into foam bubbles that circle like a tornado of tiny snowbirds, while a lone tower keeps watch over the stormy waters.
As I stumbled my way up to the tower I needed to use every muscle in my body to keep my momentum moving forward against the domineering wind. The gloomy weather made it a chilly trip but also a day less packed with fellow tourists, which gave us freedom to explore as much of the coast as we could. Our group of eight scrambled over stones, slipped in mud and shouted over the wind for a couple hours before finally returning the Visitors Center. My reflection in the glass doors revealed red cheeks raw from the wind and hair standing up and bent in shapes I could not accomplish with a whole can of hairspray, but my face was frozen in a grin.
The day ended with a late lunch of Irish stew in a pub in Doolin and a very quiet ride back into Galway – a calm ending to a dramatic and spectacular day at the Cliffs of Moher.Our Treatments

[MEXICO CITY] Doctors in many developing countries are oblivious to research findings that could transform the effectiveness of their work, according to one of the first attempts to quantify the gulf between those who research and those who implement.
And most researchers do not take steps to share their findings, concluded the study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (3 May).
The researchers, who examined research and practice in four areas at the heart of the UN Millennium Development Goals, surveyed 1,500 healthcare providers and just over 300 researchers in 10 developing countries — China, Ghana, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, Senegal and Tanzania.
Healthcare providers — 85 per cent of whom were doctors — were asked whether they used research-based evidence to guide their work. Meanwhile, researchers were asked how they disseminated their findings.
Only five to eight per cent of the practitioners, who worked in the fields of malaria prevention, contraception, childhood diarrhoea or childhood tuberculosis, read scientific journals from high-income countries, such as The Lancet or the New England Journal of Medicine, once a month or more.
Some 18 per cent read journals from their own country once a month or more.
Only 18 per cent of the healthcare practitioners had access to the Internet, and just over half (54 per cent) could read English well.
Nevertheless, 85 per cent said they would change their work based on research performed or published locally.
"Most physicians read little, and would rather read in their own language and in local publications," Francisco Becerra-Posada, co-author of one of the studies, and senior consultant for the Council on Health Research for Development in Latin America, told SciDev.Net. This is "either because they are cheaper, or given to them for free, or because they can understand the language".
Meanwhile, less than half of the researchers were engaged in bridging activities, such as: providing systematic reviews of the research literature; providing access to a searchable database; or establishing or maintaining long-term partnerships with doctors and nurses.
"Translating relevant research into a language accessible to health practitioners and policy makers would aid this situation, but very few institutions are doing this," said Becerra.
Miguel González Block, director of the Centre for Health Systems Research at the National Instituteof Public Health of Mexico, who has been training health staff in understanding scientific research for the last five years, said that most hospitals in Mexico don’t have access to scientific journals or online databases but, even if they did, staff are not equipped to understand them.
There have been repeated calls for researchers, policy makers and healthcare providers to collaborate — the latest being the Bamako Call to Action on Research for Health, issued after the Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health in 2008.

A thriving world where the climate is safe for all living beings and ecosystems
Purpose
To build and support a strong, informed civic movement that makes climate justice a top priority and motivates our elected officials to take decisive and urgent action.
Values
- Inclusivity: The climate crisis affects us all and all voices, especially the voices of those currently oppressed and most impacted, have a right to be heard. We also need to advocate for all the life-forms the climate crisis threatens.
- Action: We are building public pressure to confront the climate crisis because people on the frontlines locally and globally, as well as future generations, need action NOW.
- Effectiveness: We are advocating for bold system change rooted in climate justice and based on science and Indigenous knowledge.
- Collaboration: Climate change will only magnify the impacts of the societal injustice that is currently affecting so many people. We will support, elevate, and amplify the work of those in the climate justice movement, especially those on the frontlines who are disproportionately BIPOC, as we work for a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
- Strategy-driven: The civic movement for climate action is growing every day. We are a grassroots organization made up of volunteers, and we believe that concerted, collective actions can have a large impact.
- Empowerment: We celebrate and support each other in the fight for a safe climate future. Everyone has a role to play by taking and urging decisive action on the climate crisis.

1,000 words: estimated reading time 4 minutes
Very very occasionally — and I really mean rarely — a piece of creativity or an aspect of someone’s inner world made tangible comes into our own perspective and halts us, stops the mental chatter, and becomes a tool to deepen our ways into the real earthly things inherent in our wonderful world.
Winged by James Roberts is such a collection of crafted joy. Words gathered, and images captured: a series of poems on twelve birds in flight, their presence observed and made art by this sensitive recorder and responder, and set loose again in the mind’s eye within this isle’s wild places.
‘Every living thing is just a song in the memory of another’
The kingfisher, in the starting poem, is variously a “little water bee”, a “little fire belly”, and finally a “little dripping dagger”, and is so perfectly matched with an illustration highlighting the downward thrust of its beak — free falling into a river kill, perhaps.
The owl, also focused downward, and yet with both wings outstretched, has
Spent its whole life
In preparation for an instant,
Learning to fix its being
To a needle point flaring lightless
Art: James Roberts © 2020
And this sharp-eyed poet journeys into the unknowing knowing of “the cracks of the underworld“ and “that hole in the night which keeps watch / and waits endlessly for us to wake.“
‘Falling always out of absence into open air’
Roberts gets up close and personal with the curlew too, and sparrow, heron, swallow, swan, goshawk, lapwing, kite, golden plover, and the rook. All of them meet him and us on the path, and all become conduits for Roberts’s journey into “rapture-stillness” while we and he become “shapes imagined by a forest”.
Art & text: James Roberts © 2020
We are never told in the work where the artist-poet is wandering the world, and it’s right that those parameters aren’t set: this is work that takes us into both stillness (and observation) and movement. It’s reminiscent of the work of wandering father of geopoetics Kenneth White in its intense focus on the birdness of the bird, the seeing and the beyond seeing.
In-between these depth-flights on winged joy with our bird kin, we are given glimpses back into the human, and specifically the predicament of the pandemic that this work and pamphlet has been created within.
Can we nail the world shut
long enough to discover everything
and
I don’t want to know the name
of the colour of this sky
And yet this human world is nothing but a distraction from the simplicity, the presence, and the straight ‘being-ness’ of the world Roberts inhabits and offers to take us within (or as far as he is being taught to tread), and wait.
A presence in the meeting point
The images are graceful, and yet some use the power of the simple line to striking effect: the kite, bold, splayed across a white page; the rook, moving upward in an unhurried dominance, and the swallow, hanging in flight, its hind feathers sharply curved navigation wands. All the birds here have an iridescent blue bleach presence — with us, and yet in-between arriving and leaving, bringing us into Roberts’s meeting point with word and image. Within each bird-body, patterns give way to depth and control: I see a face in one, granulated surfaces in others, and great focus in all. More experienced birdwatchers would enjoy the specifics of their shapes, twists and turns. As a generalist, I’m seeing that these images show birds expressing themselves with their freedoms and choices. They are not conforming to any projected ‘bird qualities’, and that I feel is Roberts’s point — here they all individually are, and Roberts amongst them. And us, vicariously third hand but, with his help, able to dive a little into the shallows and beyond.
Art: James Roberts © 2020
I’d like to thank James for the timing of this pamphlet’s arrival both in the world, and in my hands: just as the UK Government is relaxing lockdown (too early in some people’s opinion). I arose early this morning with anxiety about anti-social behaviour and general idiocy upon release from our houses, and the human need for company and alcohol and addictions.
James Roberts is highlighting, in his beautiful, small and yet very precise way, that solitude, close observation and engagement with the more-than-human creates a deeper joy, and a refined aesthetic that creates a wholer human.
Many thanks for your artistry and your presence, birdman.
And I’m wondering if I stand here long enough
Will I learn to feel the wind
Without wanting to know
What it’s saying?

Winged by James Roberts (2020) is available from his site, Night River Wood, where you will also find his journal and other works (including A River of Sound, a piece that James contributed to our Quarantine Connection series). James is the founder, arts director and editor of Zoomorphic, a site dedicated to writing that deepens our connection with wildlife and the more-than-human world.
James refers to geopoetics, which the Scottish Centre for Geopoetics describes as “deeply critical of Western thinking and practice over the last 2500. … It seeks a new or renewed.” The Centre is affiliated to the International Institute of Geopoetics founded by Kenneth White, whom James also mentions.SKU: 210000012350

But such is the professionalism, skill, intelligence and emotional acuity of Brigham — one of the finest young actors to make a name for herself in the Bay Area in recent years — that you frequently forgot she was carrying script in hand at San Francisco Playhouse’s Friday, Oct. 18, opening night.
If Brigham felt any uneasiness, she seemed to transform it into fuel: aliveness to the moment, an intense commitment to listening to her scene partners, a trust in the momentum of Patricia Cotter’s script, whose world premiere the company was producing as part of its Sandbox Series, which gives stripped-down productions of new plays. Brigham’s embrace of uncertainty testified to the unique magic of live theater, where part of the thrill is always the possibility of the unplanned, and how actors, those athletes of the heart, might vault over their obstacles.
Her Jill-on-the-spot performance also, in a roundabout way, underscored one of the messages of Cotter’s play, which dramatizes two slices of San Francisco lesbian history: the 1955 founding of the Daughters of Bilitis, the nation’s first lesbian social and activist organization, and the 2015 closure of the Lexington Club, which was the last lesbian bar in the city. (Though queer bars like Jolene’s have emerged in the Lex’s wake, there still isn’t a bar dedicated specifically and explicitly to lesbians in San Francisco.)
“The Daughters” reveals how, as codified and inevitable and hermetically sealed as history can seem to us now, even a culture’s most seminal, emblematic events emerge from the improvisation and impulse of flawed, contradictory human beings. What’s textbook now was chaos then.
It was Mal (Brigham) and Peggy (Erin Anderson) handing out obliquely worded invitations to their Castro Street home when the two of them, let alone the strangers who showed up, still weren’t in agreement about what the Daughters of Bilitis could or should be. Sixty years later, it’s Gina (Brigham), her girlfriend, Natalie (Anderson), and their friend Leslie (Jeunée Simon) showing up to the Lex’s last night to, well, they’re not always quite sure themselves.
Meet a new “butch dyke,” just like in the old days? Bid a fond farewell, accepting the times have changed? Protest, however futilely, those changing times, as personified by the young Ani (Olivia Levine), who doesn’t identify as lesbian but as genderqueer, who says things like, “I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about sexuality so much. I’m kind of more about gender, in general.”
Though some of the show’s acting is flat as cardboard, several in Holt’s ensemble give breakout comic performances.
The sublimely cast Em Lee Reaves rules the stage as butches in both eras, especially in the first, where the actor adopts the voice and manner of a fast-talking wise guy in a gangster noir. Reaves hones a moment to its nugget of meaning, then blasts it full of bravado.
Levine excels as the chiffon-swishing ingenue Evelyn in the 1955 act, breathless at her first chance to be in a roomful of “girls like me,” imbuing each utterance with the bloom of discovery, clarifying how each new phrase is one more step in Evelyn’s effort to figure something out for herself. Simon triumphs as the on-the-prowl Leslie, showing how her overflowing, all-consuming self-regard isn’t just comic relief but a hard-won victory.
If some of the debates in “The Daughters” seem shoved in by the playwright’s hand rather than emerging from the necessity of character and situation, Holt’s direction keeps the play aglow with the possibility of danger. What if the Daughters of Bilitis had become a very different kind of lesbian organization? What if, on the Lex’s last night, a patron had leaped atop the bar and exploded the fissures among the clientele into a full-on internecine battle?
It so easily could have gone that way, “The Daughters” suggests. It almost did, and in some way, maybe it still could.

and I do remember this quite clearly
when you and I didn't argue
or if we did it didn't last
not like weeks months long silences
where I cease to exist for you.
I wonder when that started
and I cast my mind back to see
if I can remember how it was
and more particularly
how it all finally changed forever
is it forever do you think?
I used to be quite sure
that we would always be like we were
if not happy then at least content
but I'm sitting here right now
dreading coming home to you
and that was never meant to be.
I bought into this not knowing
that these dark black clouds come over you
and stop you from even considering
the desperation I feel reaching out
the risk I take doing so
to pull you from those depths.
I do know about dark places
and I understand all too well believe me
been down that path myself
I can wait as long as it takes
so long as you come back to me
and don't lose yourself down there.
This waiting is a killer though
it eats away at me from within and I wonder
if it's me you are hiding from
or do you think hiding is correct
sounds deliberate which is wrong
are you lost, or is different
Is it more like quagmired
stuck trapped within your spiralling thoughts
of utter despair and frustration
and total can't be botheredness
a place far beyond mere apathy
which leaves you, us quite where?

Grace Paley and The Storyteller’s Pain
In the introduction to her Collected Stories, Grace Paley describes an awakening of sorts. It was the mid-1950s, and she was writing “nice paragraphs with some first class sentences.” Still, she was frustrated: she couldn’t “find the story in those pieces of prose.” Whatever she was writing, it seemed, lacked urgency and narrative. As she wrote those neat paragraphs, those story-less sentences, Paley’s frustration grew: there was a feeling she was failing to communicate. She was, as she puts it, “beginning to suffer the storyteller’s pain: Listen! I have to tell you something!”
One way Paley addresses this internal pressure to tell, to enliven her language enough to match her storytelling impulse, is by discovering what she calls her “other ear.” The other ear remembers “the street language and the home language with its Russian and Yiddish accents…Two ears, one for literature, one for home, are useful for writers.” The stories that followed the revelation of the “other ear” are brought alive by this duality: an urgency of telling paired with versatile modes of recounting. In many of these subsequent stories, storytelling itself is dramatized and brought to the forefront, breaking open her empty “nice paragraphs.”
Two of the works in Collected Stories, “Good Night and Good Luck” and “Debts,” showcase her “other ear.” The first is narrated by an older woman; she recounts, to a younger niece, the story of her unconventional life in the world of Russian theatre. The narrator of the second is a writer who ends up telling someone else’s story: an anecdote about her friend Lucia’s grandmother. Both stories are succinct and layered; what’s striking in both is that each is about a storyteller who is moved to narrate for a practical reason. There is something no-nonsense and necessary about the stories that are told as a result. Each tale exists for someone else: in the first, the aunt narrates for her niece. In the second, the writer narrates for her friend Lucia and for Lucia’s relatives. The fact that each story has a listener as well as a narrator dramatizes Paley’s own concern—“the storyteller’s pain.” Storytelling, in these short pieces, is presented as an urge that the teller comes to sometimes with reluctance and sometimes with confusion—but one they follow nonetheless.
In “Good Night and Good Luck,” the storyteller is Aunt Rose, and the listener is her niece Lillie. Lillie never speaks, but we get a sense of her through Rose’s asides as she tells her story. When Aunt Rose talks about her romantic history, she addresses Lillie: “Nowadays I suppose it is easier, Lillie? My goodness, I ain’t asking you nothing—touchy, touchy…Well, by now you must know yourself, honey, whatever you do, life don’t stop. It only sits a minute and dreams a dream.” In this comment, we hear from Paley’s “two ears”: Aunt Rose’s diction, the practicality of her address, is “the ear for home,” and the insight she ends with comes perhaps from Paley’s “ear for literature.” Rose comes alive because of the language with which she delivers insight—and the reader, like Lillie, listens carefully.
The story Rose tells has plenty of intrigue and suspense: in it, she leaves home, has affairs, is involved with the theatre. But there’s an extra, meta-layer of suspense: why is Rose telling this story to Lillie, and why now? Her motivation isn’t revealed until the story’s last paragraph, when Rose admits she’s getting married, after all these years, to an old flame. “So now, darling Lillie, tell this story to your mama from your own young mouth. She don’t listen to a word from me.” The purpose of storytelling, in other words, is very practical: she’s delivering news. On a practical level, it must be told and retold.
In “Debts,” the motivation for storytelling is equally urgent, though less obviously practical. The story begins with a writer receiving a phone call from a woman who asks if the writer will “help her write about her grandfather, a famous innovator and dreamer of the Yiddish theatre.” The writer declines, on the grounds that she’s already “used every single thing I knew about the Yiddish theatre to write one story.” Later, when the writer tells her friend Lucia about the interaction, Lucia points out that “it was probably hard to have family archives or even only stories about outstanding grandparents or uncles when one was sixty or seventy and there was no writer in the family. She said it was a pity to lose all this inheritance just because of one’s own mortality.” The writer agrees, and decides that although she “owed nothing” to the stranger with the archive, “It was possible that I did owe something to my own family and the families of my friends. That is, to tell their stories as simply as possible, in order, you might say, to save a few lives.”
The stakes, then, are high. These stories must be told because they are “an inheritance” and a bid at immortality. If Aunt Rose’s narrative has a practical reason for being told, the story the writer narrates in “Debts” has an existential reason: to preserve an inheritance, to record memory. But this impulse, too, is a practical one as much as it seems like a noble purpose: we tell stories so that people who mattered are not lost. The writer begins, “I tell it so that some people will remember Lucia’s grandmother, also her mother, who in this story is eight or nine.” It is a statement of practical purpose: the story is told for a practical end. It is also told for someone: Lucia.
A story told to someone, or for someone, is more urgent than one told only for the storyteller’s own entertainment. By choosing the structure of teller and listener, writer and reader, Paley dramatizes the weighty, but also quotidian, act of storytelling. The stories recounted in “Debts” and “Goodbye and Good Luck” must be told, both on a practical and philosophical level. These stories, as a result, become kinetic, and suggest more than is on the page: that a good story is one that’s told, and retold, written and read, with the goal of connecting people in different places and across generations, bringing everyone involved some level of immortality.Mandy.

There are no impressions or temporary crowns, and the procedures only last about 90 minutes. (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacture).
Another great advantage to CEREC crowns is that they can be bonded, not just cemented, to the tooth. This means we can have more conservative preparations, which are better for the long-term health of the tooth. The edges of the restorations can also be prepared above the gum line, which allows for easier access for oral hygiene and less risk of decay.
Here’s a basic outline of how it works:
- We prepare the tooth for a Crown
- We scan the prep, the bite, and the opposing arch with an intra-oral camera
- The CEREC software digitizes the models and the bite record
- We then design and manipulate the restoration on the computer
- The final design is sent to the in-office milling chamber
- The restoration is cut out of a solid block of porcelain using diamond burs
- The fit is checked in the mouth and it is permanently bonded into place
Dr Jason Harvey started performing one-appointment CEREC Dentistry in 2007. The first one-appointment dental crown was placed in Zurich in 1985, and the progression of technology since then has been astounding. The evolution of high-strength Ceramics has allowed for greater reliability and more varied applications for our patients.
What are your thoughts on CEREC dental crowns? Do you already have them, how do you like them? We look forward to replying to your comments.

- Google Business
- Yelp
- Other directory sites
If the client reviews are mostly positive, then you’re getting closer to finding a reputable security window film contractor to work with!

- Low-e window film
- Solar window film

Once you’ve received bids from all the contractors on your list, the price of the estimates you receive should definitely help you choose who to go with. However, don’t base everything on the cost alone. Paying a little more for a courteous, professional contractor with more experience is definitely worth it.
Ask about guarantees and manufacturer warranties
Before you commit to hiring a security window film contractor, you want to make sure that you understand their personal guarantees and the window film warranties they provide.
As long as you choose an authorized dealer of a brand like 3M, the window film should come with a manufacturer-backed warranty that covers certain types of damages or product failures.
A good contractor will also have no problem personally guaranteeing their installation work and will be properly licensed and insured for all the work they perform.
Final Thoughts on Finding a Security Window Film Company
Or Any Other Type of Window Film Installer
When it comes to installing security window film and other types of window tinting, their experience is key.
There are so many different products on the market that if a contractor doesn’t understand them all and doesn’t have enough experience installing them, the installation can go wrong and you won’t receive the increased security and other benefits you’re looking for.

No BaT success stories7; the crowns of Aragon and Castile, of Burgundy, Milan, Naples, and Sicily, clustered on the brow of her sovereigns.”[1] But with all their great martial qualities, the Spaniards seem to have been incapable of attaining the same velocity of movement as the races with which they had to compete. They never emerged from the imaginative period, they never developed the economic type, and in consequence they never centralized as the English centralized. Even as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century this peculiarity had been observed, for the Duke de Sully remarked that with Spain the “legs and arms are strong and powerful, but the heart infinitely weak and feeble.”
Captain Mahan has explained the military impotence of the mighty mass which, scattered over two continents, could not command the sea, and in the seventeenth century an intelligent Dutchman boasted that “the Spaniards have publicly begun to hire our ships to sail to the Indies. . . . It is manifest that the West Indies, being as the stomach to Spain (for from it nearly all the revenue is drawn), must be joined to the Spanish head by a sea force”;[2] and the glory of the Elizabethan sailors lay not only in having routed this sea force, but in having assimilated no small portion of the nutriment which the American stomach should have supplied to the Spanish heart.
As Spain lingered long in the imaginative age, the priest and soldier there reigned supreme after the mercantile and skeptical type had begun to predominate elsewhere; and the instinct of the priest and soldier has always been to exterminate their rivals when pressed by their competition. In the Spanish peninsula itself the Inquisition soon trampled out heresy, but by the middle of the sixteenth century the Low Countries were a hotbed of Protestantism, and in Flanders these opposing forces fought out their battle to the death. The war which ruined Antwerp made England.
In 1576 Antwerp was sacked and burned; in 1585 the town was reduced to starvation by the Duke of Parma, and its commerce having been scattered by successive disasters, some of it migrated to Amsterdam, and some sought shelter in the Thames. In London the modern man was protected by the sea, and the crisis of the combat came in 1588, when the Spaniards, having decided to pursue their enemy to his last stronghold, sent the Armada to perish in the Channel. With that supreme effort the vitality of the great imaginative empire began to fail, disintegration set in, and on the ruins of Spain rose the purely economic centralization of Great Britain.
Like the Venetians, the British laid the basis of their high fortune by piracy and slaving, and their advantage over Spain lay not in mass, but in a superior energy, which gave them more rapid movement. Drake’s squadron, when he sailed round the world, numbered five ships, the largest measuring only one hundred and twenty tons, the smallest twelve, but with these he succeeded because of their speed. For example, he overtook the Cacafuego, whose ballast was silver, and whose cargo gold and jewels. He never disclosed her value, but the Spanish government afterward proved a loss of a million and a half of ducats, beside the property of private individuals. In like manner the Armada was destroyed by little ships, which sailed round their clumsy enemy, and disabled him before he could strike a blow in self-defense.
The Spanish wars were halcyon days for the men of martial blood who had lost their land; they took to the sea by thousands, and ravaged the Spanish colonies with the energy and ferocity of Vikings. For nearly a generation they wallowed in gold and silver and gems, and in the plunder of the American towns. Among these men Sir Francis Drake stood foremost, but, after 1560, the southern counties swarmed with pirates; and when, in 1585, Drake sailed on his raid against the West Indies, he led a force of volunteers twenty-five hundred strong. He held no commission, the crews of his twenty-five ships served without pay, they went as buccaneers to fatten on the commerce of the Spaniard. As it happened, this particular expedition failed financially, for the treasure fleet escaped, and the plunder of the three cities of Santiago, Saint Domingo, and Carthagena yielded only £60,000, but the injury done to Spain was incalculable.
No computation can be attempted of the spoil taken during these years; no reports were ever made; on the contrary, all concerned were anxious to conceal their doings, but certain prizes were too dazzling to be hidden. When Drake surprised three caravans on the Isthmus, numbering one hundred and ninety mules, each mule loaded with three hundred pounds of silver, the fact became known. No wonder Drake ate off “silver richly gilt, and engraved with his arms,” that he had “all possible luxuries, even to perfumes,” that he dined and supped “to the music of violins,” and that he could bribe the queen with a diamond cross and a coronet set with splendid emeralds, and give the lord chancellor a service of plate. What he gave in secret he alone knew.
As Francis Drake was the ideal English corsair, so John Hawkins was the ideal slaver. The men were kinsmen, and of the breed which, when driven from their farms at the end of the Middle Ages, left their mark all over the world. Of course the two sailors were “gospellers,” and Mr. Froude has quoted an interesting passage from the manuscript of a contemporary Jesuit, which shows how their class was esteemed toward the close of the sixteenth century: “The only party that would fight to the death for the queen, the only real friends she had, were the Puritans, the Puritans of London, the Puritans of the sea towns.”[3] These the priest thought desperate and determined men. Nevertheless they sometimes provoked Elizabeth by their sermonizing. The story is told that one day after reading a letter of Hawkins to Burleigh she cried: “God’s death! This fool went out a soldier, and has come back a divine.”
Though both Drake and Hawkins possessed the predatory temperament, Hawkins had a strong commercial instinct, and kept closely to trade. He was the son of old William Hawkins, the first British captain who ever visited Brazil, and who brought from thence a native chief, whom he presented to Henry VIII. As a young man John had discovered at the Canaries “that negroes were a very good commodity in Hispaniola,”[4] and that they might easily be taken on the coast of Guinea. Accordingly, in 1562, he fitted out three ships, touched at Sierra Leone, and “partly by the sword and partly by other means,” he obtained a cargo, “and with that prey he sailed over the ocean sea” to Hispaniola, where he sold his goods at a large profit. The West India Islands, and the countries bordering the Gulf of Mexico, cannot be cultivated profitably by white laborers; therefore, when the Spaniards had, by hard usage, partially exterminated the natives, a fresh supply of field hands became necessary, and these could be had easily and cheaply on the coast of Africa.
At first Spain tried to exclude foreigners from this most lucrative traffic; but here again the English moved too quickly to be stopped. Wherever Hawkins went, he went prepared to fight, and, if prevented from trading peaceably, he used force. In his first voyage he met with no opposition, but subsequently, at Burburata, leave to sell was denied him, and, without an instant’s hesitation, he marched against the town with “a hundred men well armed,” and brought the governor to terms. Having supplied all the slaves needed at that port, Hawkins went on to Rio de la Hacha, where he, in like manner, made a demonstration with “one hundred men in armor,” and two small guns, and in ten days he had disposed of his whole stock.
As at that time an able negro appears to have been worth about £160 in the West Indies,[5] a cargo of five hundred ought to have netted between seventy and eighty thousand pounds, for the cost of kidnapping was trifling. No wonder, therefore, that slaving flourished, and that, by the middle of the eighteenth century, England probably carried not far from one hundred thousand blacks annually from Africa to the colonies. The East offered no such market, and doubtless Adam Smith was right in his opinion that the commerce with India had never been so advantageous as the trade to America.[6]
Both slavers and pirates brought bullion to England, and presently this flow of silver began to stimulate at London a certain amount of exchange between the East and West. The Orientals have always preferred payment in specie, and, as silver has usually offered more profit than gold as an export, the European with a surplus of silver has had the advantage over all competitors. Accordingly, until Spain lost the power to protect her communications with her mines, the Spanish peninsula enjoyed almost a monopoly of the trade beyond the Cape; but as the war went on, and more of the precious metal flowed to the north, England and Holland began to send their silver to Asia, the Dutch organizing one East India Company in 1595, and the British another in 1600.
Sir Josiah Child, who was, perhaps, the ablest merchant of the seventeenth century, observed that in 1545 “the trade of England then was inconsiderable, and the merchants very mean and few.”[7] Child’s facts are beyond doubt, and the date he fixed is interesting because it coincides with the discovery of Potosi, whence most of the silver came which supplied the pirates and the slavers. Prior to 1545 specie had been scarce in London, but when the buccaneers had been scuttling treasure galleons for a generation, they found themselves possessed of enough specie to set them dreaming of India, and thus piracy laid the foundation of the British empire in Asia.
But robbing the Spaniards had another more immediate and more startling result, for it probably precipitated the civil war. As the city grew rich it chafed at the slow movement of the aristocracy, who, timid and peaceful, cramped it by closing the channels through which it reached the property of foreigners; and, just when the yeomanry were exasperated by rising rents, London began to glow with that energy which, when given vent, was destined to subdue so large a portion of the world. Perhaps it is not going too far to say that, even from the organization of the East India Company, the mercantile interest controlled England. Not that it could then rule alone, it lacked the power to do so for nearly a hundred years to come; but, after 1600, its weight turned the scale on which side soever thrown. Before the Long Parliament the merchants were generally Presbyterians or moderate Puritans; the farmers, Independents or Radicals; and Winthrop, when preparing for the emigration to Massachusetts, dealt not only with squires like Hampden, but with city magnates like Thomas Andrews, the lord mayor. This alliance between the rural and the urban Puritans carried through the Great Rebellion, and as their coalition crushed the monarchy so their separation reinstated it.
Macaulay has very aptly observed that “but for the hostility of the city, Charles the First would never have been vanquished, and that, without the help of the city, Charles the Second could scarcely have been restored.”[8] At the Protector’s death the Presbyterians abandoned the farmers, probably because they feared them. The army of the Commonwealth swarmed with men like Cromwell and Blake, warriors resistless alike on land and sea, with whom, when organized, the city could not cope. Therefore it scattered them, and, throwing in its lot with the Cavaliers, set up the king.
For about a generation after the Restoration, no single interest had the force to impose its will upon the nation, or, in other words, parties were equally balanced; but from the middle of the century the tide flowed rapidly. Capital accumulated, and as it accumulated the men adapted to be its instruments grew to be the governing class. Sir Josiah Child is the most interesting figure of this period. His acquaintance remembered him a poor apprentice sweeping the counting-house where he worked; and yet, at fifty, his fortune reached £20,000 a year, a sum almost equal to the rent-roll of the Duke of Ormond, the richest peer of the realm. Child married his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, and gave her £50,000, and his ability was so commanding that for years he absolutely ruled the East India Company, and used its revenues to corrupt Parliament. On matters of finance such a man would hardly err, and he gave it as his opinion that in 1635 “there were more merchants to be found upon the Exchange worth each one thousand pounds and upwards, than were in the former days, viz., before the year 1600, to be found worth one hundred pounds each.”
And now . . . there are more men to be found upon the Exchange now worth ten thousand pounds estates, than were then of one thousand pounds. And if this be doubted, let us ask the aged, whether five hundred pounds portion with a daughter sixty years ago, were not esteemed a larger portion than two thousand pounds is now; and whether gentlewomen in those days would not esteem themselves well clothed in a serge gown, which a chambermaid now will be ashamed to be seen in. . . . We have now almost one hundred coaches for one we had formerly. We with ease can pay a greater tax now in one year than our forefathers could in twenty. Our customs are very much improved, I believe above the proportion aforesaid, of six to one; which is not so much in advance of the rates of goods as by increase of the bulk of trade. . . .
I can myself remember since there were not in London used so many wharves or keys [A1] for the landing of merchants’ goods, by at least one third part, as now there are, and those that were then could scarce have employment for half what they could do; and now, notwithstanding one-third more used to the same purpose, they are all too little, in time of peace, to land the goods at, that come to London.[9]
Child estimated that, within twenty years, wages had risen one-third, and rents twenty-five percent, while “houses new-built in London yield twice the rent they did before the fire.”[10] Farms that “their grandfathers or fathers bought or sold fifty years past . . . would yield, one with another, at least treble the money, and in some cases, six times the money, they were then bought and sold for.”[11] Macaulay has estimated the population of London in 1685 at half a million, and believed it to have then become the largest city in Europe.
The aristocracy were forced to tolerate men of the predatory type while they feared a Spanish invasion, but after the defeat of the Armada these warriors became dangerous at home, and the oligarchy, very naturally, tried to purge the island of a class which constantly menaced their authority. Persecution drove numbers of Nonconformists to America, and the story of Captain John Smith shows how hardly society then pressed on the race of adventurers, even where the bitterness of the struggle did not produce religious enthusiasm.
Smith lived a generation too late. Born in 1579, he was a child of nine when the Armada perished, and only sixteen when Drake and Hawkins died at sea. Smith’s father had property, but when left an orphan his guardians neglected him, and at fifteen let him set out on his travels with only ten shillings in his pocket. At home no career was open to him, for the Cecils rather inclined to imprison and behead soldiers of fortune than to reward them. Accordingly he went abroad, and by twenty-five had seen service in most countries of the Continent, had been enslaved by the Turks, had escaped and wandered to Barbary, had fought the Spanish on a French man-of-war, and at last had learned that the dreams of his youth belonged to a past age, and that he must enter a new path. He therefore joined himself to a party bound for Virginia, and the hardship of the times may be gauged by the fact that out of a company of a hundred, fifty-two were gentlemen adventurers as needy as himself, none of whom sought exile for religion.
Smith’s voyages to America brought him nothing but bitterness. He returned to England and passed his last years in obscurity and neglect, and perhaps the fate that awaited soldiers under James, has been nowhere better told than in Smith’s own words. He spent five years and more than five hundred pounds in the service of Virginia and New England, yet “in neither . . . have I one foot of land, nor the very house I builded, nor the ground I digged with my own hands, nor ever any content or satisfaction at all, and though I see ordinarily those two countries shared before me by them that neither have them, nor know them but by my descriptions.”[12]
As long as the Tudor aristocracy ruled, Great Britain afforded small comfort for men like Smith. That aristocracy had genius neither for adventure nor for war, and few Western nations have a sorrier military history than England under the Stuarts. Yet beneath the inert mass of the nobility seethed an energy which was to recentralize the world; and when capital had accumulated to a certain point, the men who gave it an outlet laid their grasp upon the State. In 1688 the commercial adventurers conquered the kingdom.
The change was radical; at once social, political, and religious. The stronghold of the Tories had been the royal prerogative. The victors lodged the power of the Crown in a committee chosen by the House of Commons. The dogma of divine right immediately vanished, and with it all that distinguished Anglicanism. Though perverted by the Tudors, this great tenet of the Church of Henry VIII had been at least a survival of an imaginative age; and when the merchants swept it away, all trace of idealism departed. Thenceforward English civilization became a purely materialistic phenomenon.
In proportion as movement accelerates societies consolidate, and as societies consolidate they pass through a profound intellectual change. Energy ceases to find vent through the imagination, and takes the form of capital; hence as civilizations advance, the imaginative temperament tends to disappear, while the economic instinct is fostered, and thus substantially new varieties of men come to possess the world.
Nothing so portentous overhangs humanity as this mysterious and relentless acceleration of movement, which changes methods of competition and alters paths of trade; for by it countless millions of men and women are foredoomed to happiness or misery, as certainly as the beasts and trees, which have flourished in the wilderness, are destined to vanish when the soil is subdued by man.
The Romans amassed the treasure by which they administered their Empire, through the plunder and enslavement of the world. The Empire cemented by that treasure crumbled when adverse exchanges carried the bullion of Italy to the shore of the Bosphorus. An accelerated movement among the semi-barbarians of the West caused the agony of the crusades, amidst which Constantinople fell as the Italian cities rose; while Venice and Genoa, and with them the whole Arabic civilization, shriveled, when Portugal established direct communication with Hindustan.
The opening of the ocean as a highroad precipitated the Reformation, and built up Antwerp, while in the end it ruined Spain; and finally the last great quickening of the age of steam, which centralized the world at London, bathed the earth in blood, from the Mississippi to the Ganges. Thus religions are preached and are forgotten, empires rise and fall, philosophies are born and die, art and poetry bloom and fade, as societies pass from the disintegration wherein the imagination kindles, to the consolidation whose pressure ends in death.
In 1688, when the momentum of England suddenly increased, the change was equivalent to the conquest of the island by a new race. Among the family of European nations, Great Britain rose as no people had risen since the Punic Wars. Almost instantly she entered on a career of conquest unparalleled in modern history. Of the hundred and twenty-five years between the Boyne and Waterloo, she passed some seventy in waging ferocious wars, from which she emerged victorious on land and sea, the mistress of a mighty empire, the owner of incalculable wealth, and the center of the world’s exchanges. Then, from this culminating point of expansion by conquest, she glided subtly, and almost imperceptibly, into the period of contraction, as Rome went before her under the Caesars.
Although abundant metallic currency does not, probably, of itself, create mercantile prosperity, such prosperity is hardly compatible with a shrinking stock of money; for when contraction sets in and prices fall, producers and debtors are ruined, as they were ruined in Italy under the later emperors. Toward the close of the seventeenth century Europe appeared to be on the brink of such a contraction, for though Peru had lavishly replenished the supply of the precious metals a hundred years previously, the drain to Asia and the increasing demands of commerce had been so considerable, that the standard coin had generally depreciated. From the reign of Augustus downward, commerce between Europe and Asia has usually favored Asia, and this was particularly true of the seventeenth century, when the value of bullion fell in the West, and therefore encouraged lavish exports to the East, where it retained its purchasing power. According to Adam Smith, “the banks of Venice, Genoa, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Nuremberg, seem to have been all originally established” to provide an ideal currency for the settlement of bills of exchange, and the money “of such banks, being better than the common currency of the country, necessarily bore an agio, which was greater or smaller, according as the currency was supposed to be more or less degraded below the standard of the State.”[13] Smith estimated the depreciation at Hamburg at fourteen percent, and at Amsterdam, early in the previous century, at nine percent; in short, all European countries suffered, but in England the evil reached a climax through the inertia of the new aristocracy.
In England, silver had always been the standard, and by the third year of Elizabeth the coin had been restored to its proper fineness, which thenceforward was scrupulously maintained. But though the metal was not degraded by the government, the stock of bullion, if not constantly replenished from without, tended to diminish in proportion to the growth of the country and the export of specie to Asia. After the discovery of America, the value of silver in relation to gold fell, in Europe, to about fourteen or fifteen to one, while in China or India it stood pretty steady at from ten to twelve to one. Consequently from 1600 downward, silver remained the most profitable cargo which could be sent round the Cape of Good Hope, and, unhappily for British prosperity, at the very moment when the East India Company came into being, piracy ceased. The chief supply of bullion being thus cut off, the strain of the export trade fell upon the coin, and within a little more than a generation the effect become apparent in a degeneration of the currency.
To make good her position as a center of exchanges, England had no choice but to supply her necessities by force. Cromwell understood the situation perfectly, and had hardly assumed the office of Protector when he laid plans to cut the evil at the root by conquering Spanish America, and robbing Spain of her mines. To this end he fitted out his great expedition against Saint Domingo, which was to serve him as his base; but for once his military genius failed him, his commanders blundered, the attack miscarried, and the island of Jamaica was all that came of the campaign.
Meanwhile, however, that no time might be lost while fighting for the mines themselves, Cromwell sent Blake to intercept the treasure ships off the coast of Spain. At first Blake also had ill-luck. In 1655 the plate fleet escaped him, but the next year, though forced himself to go to port for supplies, he detached Captain Stayner, with six sail, to cruise off Cadiz, and on September 19, General Montague was able to report that his “hart [was] very much warmed with the apprehension of the singular providence of God,” who had permitted Stayner to meet, “with the Kinge of Spain’s West India fleete,” and take among other prizes “a gallion reported to have in her two million pieces of plate.”[14] If the “plate” were Mexican “pieces of eight” at four shillings and sixpence, the cargo was worth £450,000, or considerably more than the whole annual export to the East at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Had the Protector lived, there can be little doubt that, by some such means as this, he would have fostered British resources, and maintained the integrity of British coin; but in less than two years from the date of Montague’s dispatch, Cromwell was dead, and the inertia of the Tory landlords paralyzed the nation for another generation. No foreigner was robbed, and the stock of domestic silver dwindled from year to year, until at the Revolution the golden guinea, which, from its first issue in 1662 down to the accession of William and Mary, had been nominally current for twenty shillings, actually sold in the market for thirty shillings of the money in use.
This diminishing and counterfeiting the money was at this time so excessive, that what was good silver was worth scarcely one-half of its current value, whilst a great part of the coins was only iron, brass, or copper plated, and some no more than washed over.[15]
One of the first acts of the new government was a complete recoinage, which was finished in 1699; but the measure failed of its purpose, for the reason that the exports of silver regularly exceeded the imports.
In 1717, a committee of the House of Lords considered the condition of the currency, and Lord Stanhope then explained very lucidly the cause of the scarcity of silver. Among other papers he produced a report from the Custom House, by which it appeared that, in the year 1717, “the East India Company had exported near three million ounces of silver, which far exceeding the imports of the bullion in that year, it necessarily followed that vast quantities of silver specie must have been melted down, both to make up the export, and to supply the silversmith.”[16] For the decade from 1711 to 1720 the annual export of bullion by the East India Company averaged £434,000.[17] At the accession of George III, in 1760, Lord Liverpool estimated that shillings had lost one-sixth, and sixpences one-quarter of their original weight, while the crown-piece had almost wholly disappeared.[18] Even Adam Smith admitted that because of this outflow silver had risen in value, and probably purchased “a larger quantity both of labor and commodities” than it otherwise would.[19]
In this emergency the British merchants showed the resource which has always been their characteristic, and, in default of an adequate supply of specie, relieved the strain upon their currency by issuing paper. Medieval banking had gone no further than the establishment of reserves of coin, to serve as a medium for clearing bills of exchange; the English took the great step of accelerating the circulation of their money, by using this reserve as a basis for a paper currency which might be largely expanded. The Bank of England was incorporated in 1694, the Bank of Scotland in 1695, and the effect was unquestionably considerable. Adam Smith has thus described the impetus received by Glasgow:.[20]
But although by this means a certain degree of relief was given, and though prices rose slowly throughout the first half of the eighteenth century, the fundamental difficulty remained. There was insufficient silver for export, exchanges were adverse, and that stock of coined money was lacking which is the form in which force clothes itself in highly centralized communities. How England finally supplied her needs is one of the most dramatic pages of history.
As Jevons has aptly observed, Asia is “the great reservoir and sink of the precious metals.” From time immemorial the Oriental custom has been to hoard, and from the Mogul blazing with the diamonds of Golconda, to the peasant starving on his wretched pittance, every Hindu had, in former days, a treasure stored away against a day of trouble. Year by year, since Pizarro had murdered the Inca Atahualpa for his gold, a stream of bullion had flowed from America to Europe, and from Europe to the East: there it had vanished as completely as though once more buried in the bowels of the mine. These hoards, the savings of millions of human beings for centuries, the English seized and took to London, as the Romans had taken the spoil of Greece and Pontus to Italy. What the value of the treasure was, no man can estimate, but it must have been many millions of pounds—a vast sum in proportion to the stock of the precious metals then owned by Europeans. Some faint idea of the booty of the conqueror may be drawn from Macaulay’s description of the first visit of an English soldier to an Oriental treasure chamber:
As to Clive, there was no limit to his acquisitions but his own moderation. The treasury of Bengal was thrown open to him. There were piled up, after the usage of Indian princes, immense masses of coin, among which might not seldom be detected the florins and byzants with which, before any European ship had turned the Cape of Good Hope, the Venetians purchased the stuffs and spices of the East. Clive walked between heaps of gold and silver, crowned with rubies and diamonds, and was at liberty to help himself.[21]
The lives of few men are better known than those of Clive and Hastings, and yet there are few whose influence upon the fate of mankind has had such scant appreciation. It is not too much to say that the destiny of Europe hinged upon the conquest of Bengal. Robert Clive was of the same stock as Drake and Hawkins, Raleigh, Blake, and Cromwell; he was the eldest son of one of those small farmers whose ancestors had held their land ever since the Conquest, and who, when at last evicted and driven out to sea, had fought and conquered on every continent and on every ocean. Among the throng of great English adventurers none is greater than he.
He was born in 1725, and from childhood displayed those qualities which made him pre-eminent on the field of battle; fighting was his delight, and so fierce was his temper that his family could not control him. At last, when eighteen, his father gladly sent him to Madras as a clerk in the service of the East India Company; and there, in a torrid climate which shattered his health, poor and neglected, lonely and forlorn, he pined, until in melancholy he twice attempted suicide. But he was destined to found an empire, and at last his hour came.
When Clive went to India, the Company was still a purely commercial concern, holding only the land needed for its warehouses, and having in their pay a few ill-disciplined sepoys. In the year 1746, when Clive was twenty-one, the war of the Austrian Succession was raging, and suddenly a French fleet, commanded by Labourdonnais, appeared off Madras, and attacked Fort Saint George. Resistance was hopeless, the place surrendered, and the governor and chief inhabitants were taken to Pondicherry. Clive, however, managed to escape, and, volunteering, received an ensign’s commission, and began his military career.
Shortly after, peace was made in Europe, but in India the issue of the struggle lay undecided between the French and English, the prize being the peninsula. Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, was a man of commanding intellect, who first saw the possibility of constructing a European empire in Hindustan by controlling native princes. Following up his idea, he mixed in a war of succession, and having succeeded in establishing a sovereign of the Deccan, he made himself master of Southern India. The Nizam’s treasure was thrown open to him, and beside many jewels of price, he is said to have appropriated two hundred thousand pounds in coin. This was the man whom Clive, when only a clerk of twenty-five, without military education or experience, attacked and overthrew.
Clive began his campaigns by the capture and defense of Arcot, one of the most daring deeds of a generation given over to perpetual war. Aided by their native allies, the French had laid siege to Trichinopoly, and Clive represented to his superiors that with the fate of Trichinopoly was bound up the fate of the whole peninsula. He recommended making a diversion by assaulting Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic; his plan met with approval, and, with two hundred Europeans and three hundred sepoys, he marched to fight the greatest power in the East. He succeeded in surprising and occupying the town without loss, but when within the city his real peril began. Arcot had neither ditches nor defensible ramparts, the English were short of provisions, and the Nabob hurried forward ten thousand men to relieve his capital. With four officers, one hundred and twenty British, and two hundred sepoys, Clive held the town for fifty days, and when the enemy assaulted for the last time he served his own guns. He won a decisive victory, and from that hour was recognized as among the most brilliant officers of the world.
Other campaigns followed, but his health, undermined by the tropics, gave way, and at twenty-seven he returned home to squander his money and contest an election to Parliament. He soon reached the end of his resources, and, just before the opening of the Seven Years’ War, he accepted a lieutenant-colonel’s commission, and set sail to take command in Hindustan. The Company appointed him governor of Fort Saint David, a settlement near Madras; but he had hardly assumed his office before an event occurred which caused the conquest of Bengal. The Nabob of Bengal captured Calcutta, and imprisoned one hundred and forty-six of the English residents in the “Black Hole,” where, in a single night, one hundred and twenty-three perished.
Clive was summoned, and acted with his usual vigor. He routed the Nabob’s army, recovered Calcutta, and would have taken vengeance at once had not the civilians, who wanted to be restored to their places, interfered.
Long and tortuous negotiations followed, in which Clive displayed more than Oriental cunning and duplicity, ending in a march into the interior and the battle of Plassey. There, with one thousand English and two thousand sepoys, he met and crushed the army of the Nabob, sixty thousand strong. On June 23, 1757, one of the richest provinces of Asia lay before him defenseless, ripe for plunder. Eight hundred thousand pounds were sent down the Hooghly to Calcutta, in one shipment; Clive himself took between two and three hundred thousand pounds.
Like Drake and Hawkins, Clive had done great things for England, but he was a military adventurer, one of the class in whom the aristocracy recognized an enemy; and though in London he was treated with outward respect, and even given an Irish peerage, the landed interest hated him, and tried to destroy him, as in the next generation it tried to destroy Hastings.
Upon the plundering of India there can be no better authority than Macaulay, who held high office at Calcutta when the administration of Hastings was still remembered; and who less than any of the writers who have followed him, was a mouthpiece of the official class.[22] He has told how after Plassey “the shower of wealth” began to fall, and he has described Clive’s own gains: “We may safely affirm that no Englishman who started with nothing has ever, in any line of life, created such a fortune at the early age of thirty-four.”[23] But the takings of Clive, either for himself or for the government, were trifling compared to the wholesale robbery and spoliation which followed his departure, when Bengal was surrendered a helpless prey to a myriad of greedy officials. These officials were absolute, irresponsible, and rapacious, and they emptied the private hoards. Their only thought was to wring some hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the natives as quickly as possible, and hurry home to display their wealth.
Enormous fortunes were thus rapidly accumulated at Calcutta, while thirty millions of human beings were reduced to the extremity of wretchedness.” “[A2] The misgovernment of the English was carried to a point such as seems hardly compatible with the very existence of society. The Roman proconsul, who, in a year or two, squeezed out of a province the means of rearing marble palaces and baths on the shores of Campania, of drinking from amber, of feasting on singing birds, of exhibiting armies of gladiators and flocks of camelopards; the Spanish viceroy, who, leaving behind him the curses of Mexico or Lima, entered Madrid with a long train of gilded coaches, and of sumpter-horses trapped and shod with silver, were now outdone.[24]
Thus treasure in oceans flowed into England through private hands, but in India the affairs of the Company went from bad to worse. Misgovernment impoverished the people, the savings of long years of toil were exhausted, and when, in 1770, a drought brought famine, the resources of the people failed, and they perished by millions: “the very streets of Calcutta were blocked up by the dying and the dead.” Then came an outbreak of wrath from disappointed stockholders; the landed interest seized its opportunity to attack Clive in Parliament; and the merchants chose Hastings to develop the resources of Hindustan.
As Sheridan said, the Company “extended the sordid principles of their origin over all their successive operations; connecting with their civil policy, and even with their boldest achievements, the meanness of a peddler and the profligacy of pirates.” In Hastings the Company found a man fitted to their hands, a statesman worthy to organize a vast empire on an economic basis. Able, bold, cool, and relentless, he grasped the situation at a glance, and never faltered in his purpose. If more treasure was to be wrung from the natives, force had to be used systematically. Though Bengal might be ruined, the hoards of the neighboring potentates remained safe, and these Hastings deliberately set himself to drain. Macaulay has explained the policy and the motives which actuated him:
The object of his diplomacy was at this time simply to get money. The finances of his government were in an embarrassed state, and this embarrassment he was determined to relieve by some means, fair or foul. The principle which directed all his dealings with his neighbors is fully expressed by the old motto of one of the great predatory families of Teviotdale, “Thou shalt want ere I want.” He seems to have laid it down, as a fundamental proposition which could not be disputed, that, when he had not as many lacs of rupees as the public service required, he was to take them from anybody who had. One thing, indeed, is to be said in excuse for him. The pressure applied to him by his employers at home, was such as only the highest virtue could have withstood, such as left him no choice except to commit great wrongs, or to resign his high post, and with that post all his hopes of fortune and distinction.[25]
How he obtained his money, the pledges he violated, and the blood he spilt, is known as few passages of history are known, for the story has been told by Macaulay and by Burke. How he robbed the Nabob of Bengal of half the income the Company had solemnly promised to pay, how he repudiated the revenue which the government had covenanted to yield to the Mogul as a tribute for provinces ceded them, and how, in consideration of four hundred thousand pounds, he sent a brigade to slaughter the Rohillas, and placidly saw “their villages burned, their children butchered, and their women violated,” has been described in one of the most popular essays in the language. At Hastings’ impeachment, the heaviest charge against him was that based on his conduct toward the princesses of Oude, whom his creature, Asaph-ul-Dowlah, imprisoned and starved, whose servants he tormented, and from whom he wrung at last twelve hundred thousand pounds, as the price of blood. By these acts, and acts such as these, the treasure which had flowed to Europe through the extermination of the Peruvians, was returned again to England from the hoards of conquered Hindus.

[22] Macaulay’s essays have been the subject of much recent adverse criticism; but, in regard to the plundering of Hindustan, nothing of consequence has been brought forward against him. All recent historical work relating to India must be taken with suspicion. The whole official influence has been turned to distorting evidence in order to make a case for the government.

This client and I were just getting established in our own businesses when I was asked for a logo and website design. I hadn't learned much about brand strategy and why it's important at the time, but I was eager to jump in and tackle the designs. What the client envisioned for the Z Property Colorado brand was a minimal and modern black-and-white aesthetic. I was also asked to keep the website simple and straight-forward as a single page, with no color.
The Approach and Solution
The challenges we faced with this project were related to designing without a brand in mind, which I quickly began to understand over the following year and changed my approach with clients. Over time, we worked together on more projects and have slowly established a distinct look and feel with only the black and white for a brand color palette. While it's a unique challenge to design with any kind of limitation, that is exactly what good design is all about- solving challenges within a set of restraints.>>

“We think Kenya is a threat to Somalia, Kenya could use its UNSC membership to exert pressure on Somalia over a maritime border dispute and that could escalate the situation,” he said.
The minister stated that Djibouti is concerned over Kenya’s efforts to use the power of seat against Somalia.
“I hope such country with that extent threat, cannot be entrusted with affairs of the region as well as that of the continent, because if the dispute escalates, it can affect both countries and the region,” the minister warned.
Djibouti and Kenya are competing to secure non-permanent membership of the Security Council.
The two countries went before the African Union in Addis where members voted in favor of Kenya.
Nairobi garnered 37 votes against Djibouti’s 13 in the second round of voting in which 51 of the 55 AU member states were present.
Despite its victory over Djibouti in AU, for Kenya to be a member of UNSC, it should win at least two-thirds votes of the UN member states when the election is held in New York next year in June.
Djibouti Permanent Representative to the UN and Ambassador to the US Mohamed Siad Doualeh has confirmed that his county will not quit the race for a non-permanent membership slot at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) despite the endorsement of Kenya’s candidature by AU.
Traditionally, elections at all UN bodies are done through formal balloting even if candidates have been endorsed by their regional group or are unopposed.
The OIC with 57-member countries threw its weight behind Djibouti candidacy for UNSC seat.... Continue Reading →

Of Faust, it was said "it has an apparently unshakable hold on public favour, for the house was crowded in every part. "Both performances were of a kind which merited the hearty approval with which they were received. After a week of Carl Rosa performances one fact which emerges is that the organisation which for over half a century has done so much to keep opera alive in this country, is advancing steadily in the artistic quality and general efficiency of its work. A new management is making its influence felt, and it is satisfactory to observe pubic appreciation of the fact reflected in much larger audiences than were secured here a year ago."
"Mr Horace Vincent made an excellent Faust, singing the music of the part with great beauty of tone, and being sufficiently dramatic in a role in which to be dramatic without overstepping the demands of the character is none too easy. Miss Maud Neilson's Marguerite was a sympathetic and delightful impersonation, while Mr John Kelly made a highly effective Mephistopheles."

The chain.
And the future didn't look much brighter. Barnes & Noble reported "For fiscal year 2014, the company expects Retail comparable bookstore sales to decline in the high-single digits on a percentage basis. College comparable store sales are expected to decline in the low-single digits on a percentage basis."
The chain also announced it was stopping its color Nook tablet sales, as a way to try to cut losses. But the tablet change could also help the chain sell its stores, Bloomberg reported.
Since Barnes & Noble got into the tablet business in 2010, analysts questioned how it would maintain its initial success because the amount of investment to churn out devices to compete against the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. would be difficult for a company of its size and acumen, Bloomberg said. This decision removes those hurdles, which could help make the Nook more viable on its own or as an acquisition target.
"It's a positive because anything they can do to cut back on that cash burn is a good thing," Michael Souers, an analyst for Standard & Poor's in New York, told Bloomberg. .

Yes, the advert is now on TV. The one with the big Coca Cola trucks in the woods on a mystical journey to my town spreading christmas joy and wonder at every wheel spin whilst pumping out music which is clearly over the fair usage decibel levels for an evening but nothing else matters as I’m only getting a bottle of coke for christmas…
I love this advert. I must bow down to Coca Cola and the amazing marketing message they convey. I don’t think this advert was even aired when I was a child, so the sense of nostalgia and merriment I feel is completely false. This is nothing short of a miracle on Coca Cola’s part? Or perhaps subliminal images? Mass Christmas Hypnosis?
Anyway… tiss the season

„The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.”
Romans 8, 16
Some Christians are struggling with doubts. They simply do not know for sure whether they are really a child of God or not. They think that somehow they are not right because this certainty is missing. Are their sins really forgiven? Does God really say yes to them? What more do they need to do to get certainty?
They try hard to live a Christian life, never cheat anyone, go to church often, pray, read the Bible …. What is still missing?
This state unfortunately often ends in depression or confusion, inner chaos, hopelessness, feelings of loss. It is really bad.
And there are the sermons that say it’s all very simple: you only need to believe and everything is clear.
And they try harder and harder, and nothing becomes clearer … A bleak state.
Unfortunately there is no general, simple answer to this widespread problem. But we will try to show possible solutions.
It is a small consolation that so many people feel this way, you are no longer alone.
It is a great consolation that God creates solutions to this problem. Others have found a way out, and so will you.
Our verse says: God’s Holy Spirit tells our spirit that we are God’s children. – HE creates the certainty in us, which we cannot produce humanly, no matter how hard we try; – it is not possible. So we will invite the Holy Spirit into our heart, so that He can give us this certainty. It is a matter of the heart for Him to win people for Jesus, that is why He will follow this invitation. Are you ready?
Dear Holy Spirit, come and dwell in my heart! I invite You with all my heart to dwell and reign in my heart. Please, give me the certainty that God loves me and that I am a child of God! Help me to believe that my sins are forgiven! I need You, I can’t cope with my life anymore. THANK YOU!!!

An octagonal pavilion is a great way to add style and colour to your garden. It is also one of the most popular designs available today.
Constructing the Gazebo: A gazebo building kit can be purchased at any hardware store to build a regular-sized gazebo. Of course, if you are looking for a more involved DIY project, you can always refer to your plans.
Begin your project by painting your deck with paint for landscape marking. Next, excavate the area for plants and rocks and dig 30″ deep holes for your posts. After your posts have been inserted into the ground, you can fill in the gaps with concrete mixture and water. Allow it to dry for 24 hours. It would help if you inspected your concrete before you leave the project.
The Planks: Cedar is the best wood for projects because it can resist natural elements and is attractive. To make the frame, connect your cedar planks using decking screws. Then use joists to support the deck’s edges. The next step is to add your centre post. Next, help your frame with decking screws.
To construct walls, connect your tongue and groove boards and screw them together until they are secure. Then, attach it all to the pavilion’s floor with regular screws. After all previous steps have been completed, you can add actions.
Building a Gazebo with an Octagonal Roof: A regular gazebo can be acceptable. However, an octagonal roof will make your structure stand out. You can create your gazebo in any way you like, as we have already said.
The Header Beams: After the pavilion is complete, you can install header beams between each post to support your roof. Next, construct your hub to create the centre of your roof. After your seat is completed, raise it in the middle of your octagon to install your ridge rafters. Install them by securing them at each corner of your head beam to the flat surfaces of the hub.
Form a bird’s mouth using two, 2 x 6 to connect over your header beam, and it would also help you make a few mitre cuts going across the top of your surface so your roof will lay flat while on top of the pitched octagon.
The Roof: Install additional rafters to finish the roof’s frame. These will be attached to your bird’s mouth and placed over the top of the head beam. Use a 2×6 fascia cap to tie the ends of the rafters together. Next, lay the sheathing on top of the roof’s frame. Finally, finish your octagonal roof with felt paper, drip caps, and some shingles. Roof caps are needed to cover any intersections between the roof sections.
Now that your gazebo is finished, you may paint it and add a topcoat if that is what you planned on doing afterwards.[ad_1]
At the two locations of Tocabe, a Denver-area American Indian restaurant, customers have long asked the owners Matt Chandra and Ben Jacobs where to buy the Native and Indigenous ingredients used in the kitchen, like the wild rice in the grain bowls, or the bison for the glazed ribs with berry barbecue sauce.
Last May, the pair realized they could become the source for those ingredients, leveraging their existing relationships with suppliers to build “an economy that can keep money within Indian country,” said Mr. Jacobs, a member of the Osage Nation of Northeast Oklahoma.
As restaurateurs embraced new business models to stave off the coronavirus’s devastation of their industry, the Tocabe owners set another goal for themselves: to create a robust ecosystem for Native and Indigenous food traditions to thrive.
That ecosystem is Tocabe Indigenous Marketplace, which goes live online this week with 40 products from nine producers — including maple syrup from Minogin Market in Mackinaw City, Mich., and tepary beans from Ramona Farms in Sacaton, Ariz. — and eventually, frozen meals. For every two items sold, Tocabe will donate one item to a Native community organization.
There are a handful of online businesses that focus on Native American products, including SweetGrass Trading Company and Native Harvest. Mr. Chandra and Mr. Jacobs hope Tocabe Indigenous Marketplace will be one of the most comprehensive shops of its kind, in terms of the geography and quantity of producers, and compete with non-Indigenous food commerce sites.
Too many Native and Indigenous producers have been excluded from the supply chains that would enable them to sell at a national level, and producers are too often bypassed by distributors and shipping routes, said Mr. Jacobs, 38. Many reservations and Native communities still don’t have access to high-speed internet because of systemic exclusion by service providers, creating additional barriers to self-distribution. For those who can access national supply chains, their foods are often purchased by corporations that erase their roots.
The Tocabe website provides descriptions of each product and supplier, and customers will eventually be able to search by tribe or region. In several cases, Mr. Chandra and Mr. Jacobs have set up distribution channels themselves, supporting Native businesses at each step. For instance, bison from Fred DuBray, a Cheyenne River Lakota rancher in South Dakota, are transported to a processing facility in the Osage Nation before arriving at Tocabe’s warehouse in Denver.
Allowing a product that is raised on their land to reach more consumers “can have huge benefits to all Native people down the road,” said Mr. DuBray, 70, and can help maintain traditions like bison hunting.
But the goal is not the mass commercialization of these traditions, Mr. Jacobs said. There are other foods, like heirloom varieties of corn, that Native people want to keep within their communities.
“That is the double-edged sword of this business,” said Rosebud Bear Schneider, 39, a market manager for Minogin Market and Ziibimijwang Farm who is Anishinaabe and a citizen of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewas.
“We want a place in mainstream America,” she said. “We also want to be very protective of our ways.”
Tocabe Indigenous Marketplace strives to do both.
“If we don’t tell the stories and claim these things as our own,” Mr. Jacobs said, “then they are just going to be taken again.”

Two new films begin their run at the TIFF Lightbox in Toronto: ENTER THE VOID and FILM SOCIALISME.
ENTER THE VOID (France 2009) **
Directed by Gasper Noe
From bad to worse to unbearable! French bad boy did a marvellous trick with his first film – a short film called CARNE (HORSE MEAT). This was followed by an equally excellent SEUL CONTRE TOUS then IRREVERSIBLE. Having seen all 4 of Noe’s major films, ENTER THE VOID is the most indulgent but worst of the lot!
The film revolves around the relationship of a brother and sister, orphaned from a car accident. Oscar promises to look after Linda, even after death and this he does as a ghost. But as in all of Noe’s movies, this is no harmless tale (of sibling caring for each other).
ENTER THE VOID has Oscar as an uncontrollable junkie who pays Linda’s way to Tokyo only to have her strip for a living. Incest leads to death to a terribly boring violent and sex-charged movie. Some viewers may be intrigued by a sperm eyed view of fertilization. The TIFF version is reportedly 20 minute shorter than the Cannes version, but the press got the full original version. How unfortunate!
FILM SOCIALISME (France 2010) **
Directed by Jean-Luc Godard
FILM SOCIALISME continues the Godard’s brand of don’t give a f*** type of filmmaking that he has championed since the 80’s starting roughly with his NOUVELLE VAGUE and HISTOIRE DU CINEMA. His films are highly personal and incomprehensible and he really does not care who or whether anyone understands them or not. This explains the more than half of an audience that would walk out of his film screenings when screened at the Toronto International Film Festival.
FILM SOCIALISME is a film, composed, rather than constructed and it is best that the audience reads what the film is about before entering the cinema. The film uses a kaleidoscope of sound, image and montage to comment on the state of the world – past and present. Sound may be orchestration, silence, or simply the rush of wind. The footage stops every few minutes or so with silence. The subtitles are experimental, or what Godard apparently has called “Navajo English” – i.e. a truncated version of the dialogue. Most of the time, they do not make any sense.
The film is divided into three movements. “Des choses comme ça” ("Such things") is set on a Mediterranean cruise ship. Among the passengers is an aging war criminal, a former United Nations official and a Russian detective. The second involves a brother and sister, summoning their parents to appear before the "tribunal of their childhood,” demanding answers about liberty, equality, and fraternity. Indeed, how will the future generation pay for this one’s debts? “Nos humanités” ("Our humanities") visits six legendary sites: Egypt, Palestine, Odessa, Hellas (spelled “Hell as,” perhaps as a nod to the financial downfall of Greece), Naples and Barcelona.
Godard throws a lot of ideas (though most without any form or purpose) at the audience. The best one questions the payment of liberty suffered by Ethiopia. His film looks good and the images are stunning with great sound and or orchestrated music. And at least he is willing to give audiences a taste for their money with experimenting that had put him on the map with his A BOUT DE SOUFFLE.Celestial bodies, river baptisms, and early morning otter-spotting: Matt Gaw, author of ‘The Pull of the River’, shares moments from the month just passed.
February 1
The dog pulls me into February. Tugging at her leash, nosing and rootling into a frosted morning lit by a horned moon of carved, white bone. It is early. The cars still parked and prettified by iron-filings of hoar frost, their windscreens decorated by goose-feather patterns of ice. The robin has only just started to sing. The whole world feels glassy. Quiet. As if one loud noise could shatter it all.
I feel exhausted. This time last year I signed a contract for my second book, with the first, The Pull of the River, then still to come out. A tremendous act of faith or recklessness by the publishers, I’m not quite sure which. Either way, throughout Christmas and the past month, I have worked around the clock to get it ready for the deadline: both wanting January to last a lifetime and to finish in a heartbeat.
We walk to the park and back, Lyra trotting ahead, her piggy-whip of a tail swooshing faster as soon as she realises we’re homeward bound. The streetlights are clicking off and the lessening of their glow makes the moon’s light harder, colder.
For the rest of the day I shuffle around. I feel like I should be active, go for a run or a swim, to make up for a desk-based January, but all I want to do is nest. I set fires, make soups and sit with the dog.
Lyra has abandoned her bed and now only naps if someone is next to her on the sofa. I know I am probably making a rod for my own back by allowing it, but, at the moment, I love it. My wife, with some degree of accuracy, says it’s because I’m needy. I close my eyes as Lyra scrambles up my chest and curls up. Snuggled. Snuffles. Nasal grunts.
Lyra’s name fell from the heavens, one of Ptolemy’s 48 constellations, but she smells decidedly earthy. I bury my face in the saddleback markings on her side, sucking up a fur-scent of biscuits, mud and dark chocolate. Her warmth sinks through my skin.
It is a couple of months since Lyra arrived in my life and I don’t think I could be without her now. I remember her first night here. She had been unwell, her tiny stomach bloated and uncomfortable. My neighbour, a seasoned dog-owner, had told me to stay upstairs no matter how much she cried.
But I couldn’t. I set up a sleeping bag on the sofa and by midnight she was tucked in with me, her snout stuck under my chin.
I look down at her now, at the thin white stripe that runs from forehead to black-cherry nose. I trace it with my finger, following the curve of her skull to eyebrows, which look like they have been plucked and painted back on with thick brown makeup. She grunts, licks my hand half-heartedly, then falls asleep.

I eat more biscuits than I reasonably should and start writing again. Gingerly at first. I am a peeling sunbather returning tentatively to the lounger. I felt the same way after finishing the last book, as if all the ideas and words had gone. My head, hollow.
I find myself typing almost automatically. Two or three place names, and then a list of words that they conjure. I’m not sure of the point in what I’m doing, what I hope to achieve. I look back at what I’ve done and try to identify themes, to see if something will grow. I haven’t worked like this before. But I like the sense of stitching together fragments, the freedom of making sense of my own mind.
More biscuits. The dog, sitting on my feet, looks up at me, licking her chops hopefully, waiting for crumbs. At the moment, crumbs are all I have.

Up to Bradfield Woods this morning. The wind rattles and knocks through the coppice, sending the hazel catkins dancing like yellow worms on a hook. I usually wander here, but today I have a purpose: I’m here to research an article about the 50th anniversary of the Public Inquiry, which saved this wood.
Bradfield Woods is really made up of two interlocking woods: Felshamhall Woods and Monk’s Park. It was back in 1966 when the bulldozers came for Monk’s Park and in the space of months, more than 100 acres of ancient woodland fell.
Pictures taken at the time show a scene of grim destruction, a no man’s land of mud, shattered wood and grubbed up roots. What remains, a beautiful wood, coppiced for furniture and fuel in the same way as it was more than 800 years ago, exists because of the efforts of determined villagers and the knowledge of Oliver Rackham.
As the bulldozers worked, they secured various Tree Protection Orders, before fighting and winning the subsequent Public Inquiry: presenting detailed evidence of the wood’s cultural and ecological importance.
I walk along what would have once been a woodland ride, but which is now a perimeter path. To my left, a few veteran trees, I guess those with the TPOs, are scattered around in empty arable fields.
I head to a birch whose smooth bark I know is covered in arborglyphs: names, signs, dates and carved hearts. Some of the cuts look fresh but many more have ballooned with age, stretching with the trunk’s growth like an old tattoo on a beer belly.
I love this tree. It is a living record of family, sweethearts and friends, of walks, shin-barking scrambles, of summer shade and shelter from spring showers. I run my hands over the marks and think about how when they were made, this birch would have been surrounded by wood. How these carved symbols now represent both love and loss.
February 12
A longer walk today, down to the River Lark, and then following its course north through town. What would take an hour by myself takes three times longer with Lyra.
She’s still not used to walking on a lead and is given to stopping suddenly with legs braced, only moving after repeated cajoling and the promise of treats, which seem to have crumbled to dust in the pockets of every item of clothing I own. For large stretches I give in and carry her inside my coat, enjoying her snuffles and being able to open up my stride.
The day is cold and clear, but Bury St Edmunds is shrouded by a cloud of steam coming from the sugar factory. The beets, which litter fields and roadsides like giant molars, are still being boiled down, and the air is thick with their sweet, turnippy fug.
The river path goes close to the factory before ending near the Tesco supermarket, where the Lark – one of only 200 chalk streams in the world – is half encased in concrete. It was here that Roger Deakin sat in his car and cried about what had become of the river. The Lark, the Jordan of the Fens, where people came to be baptised up until the 70s, has been reduced to a carpark puddle.
Yet even here, the weak trammelled flow is still re-connected by the occasional blue dart of a kingfisher, is still pricked awake by the dagger beak of an egret.
I think it was the sight of the river here and the birds that made me want to canoe the Lark. It was a stomp, splash and paddle of reclamation and discovery. Both a taking back and a getting to know the river kind of trip.
It was this river that gave me a sense of childish adventure: of a world that although still geographically small, seemed endlessly big.
February 12
Rain again. Through the night and into the morning. Water sluices off pavements, fills up the muddy paths where I walk the dog and wells up from drains.
At home I think about the Lark, how this winterbourne river will be singing again with water. Winterbourne is such a lovely word. Life and flow. It reminds me too of my daughter, Eliza, born on the winter equinox into a world of snow.
I go into the garden and check the canoes piled up on a wooden stand – probably the first and only useful thing I have ever made with my bare hands.
I flip the Pipette over and check for cracks and problems, before going into the garage to find the rest of my gear. I dust off a life jacket. Soon.
February 15
I take Lyra further afield, out to West Stow and Kings Forest. It is the edge of the Brecklands, a strange land I have come to love, that feels right in its wrongness.
I let her off the lead for the first time. It’s something I’ve been dreading doing, fearing that she would run and never stop. She skitters away and then comes back, falling in with my steps and then asking to be carried as if the world has suddenly become too big for her.
We head to the river again. All paths seem to lead to the Lark. This stretch has been restored and, now fed by the rain, it chuckles through riffles and bends.
February 16
The moon is beginning to sink as I drive away from the house. Low on the horizon and waxing towards full. A gleaming fish belly with an ottery bite taken from its left side. On the radio the World Service is on, delivering news of cancelled elections in Nigeria and trade disputes with China. I turn the volume down and wipe sleep from my eyes. The clock says 4.15am. There’re not many things that can drag me from my bed at this time but the chance of seeing an otter is one of them.
I meet my friend, the photographer Sarah Groves, at Hen Reedbeds and walk along the river wall. The twilights are melting into each other. Astronomical makes way for nautical, the highest points of the sky blueing from the rays of a sun which is still hidden beneath the horizon.
Light bleeds slowly down, is reflected up by the river and creeks, which also cradles the bright, white spots of Venus and Jupiter: glinting like sewing needles half pushed through dark denim.
The river here is beautiful. The Blyth’s name comes from the Old English “blithe”, meaning “gentle or pleasant” and there is certainly a gentleness here. A soft coming together of water and mud flats accentuated by the pre-dawn light. The tide is low and it’s hard to see what is water and what is shimmering mud: the course of the river lost in an archipelago of salt-crusted land and briney, winding creeks.
Sarah points out slipways made by otters belly-sliding into the water, a path of transformation from hump-backed land-lubbers to liquid muscle. There are tracks in the mud of the creek too. We sit and drink tea and watch them disappear as the tide creeps in.
February 24
After a week of sap-rising sun, the day is bright and clear. Finally, for the first time this year, I’m back on the river. In fact, it feels like an age since I’ve been on the water, it was probably back in November when the world had started to tilt towards winter.
It’s longer still since I’ve canoed this stretch of the Lark: back in summer with the children, leaning over the canoe’s sides, pointing out the blistering circles from rising fish. Before that it was with James, as we paddled to the Great Ouse through knifing wind, the water so thick with ice, we had to smash it with our paddles.
I’m with James again today. Him in front, the engine, me ruddering from behind. We go slow, shielding our face from sun-scalded water as we round meandering bends, passing the pill box and scrubby fields, to where the river really becomes a fenland waterway.
Light on water is always bewitching and today the ripples from the paddles strobe gold up on to the reeds: flicker across the chests of a few waggle-tailed swans.
The river here is above the land, a result of drainage, which caused the peat to dry out and become one of the lowest points in the country. In some of the villages along the river the land pulls away from brick and stone like gums from teeth.
The route, little-by-little, straightens. Some might say it is boring but being on the water is joy enough. There is a simple pleasure in the movements of the paddle. The metronome rhythm of it all. No effort. No thought. Life reduced to the simplest basest elements. Water, land, flesh and boat.
There is a sense of freedom too, not just through the change of movement and immersion in a different landscape, but in the idea that rivers, so often a border to county and country, are a no man’s land. Outside of society, outside of laws.
We turn around at the Ouse and paddle back, stopping off by the stone marking the spot of the river baptism of Rev Charles Haddon Spurgeon, The Prince of the Preachers, in 1850.
Writing in his autobiography, he said how, standing in the water, “my timidity was washed away; it floated down the river into the sea, and must have been devoured by the fishes, for I have never felt anything of the kind since…I lost a thousand fears in that River Lark.”
Hot from paddling, we jump from the canoe and swim against the weakest of currents, roaring and laughing at the cold. A baptism of our very own.

Conflict Coaching is a specialized process that combines coaching with Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) skills – (ADR can typically cover Early Neutral Evaluation, Negotiation, Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration in a process to find a mutually acceptable compromise outside a court imposed settlement)... A basic definition of conflict coaching is:
A one-on-one alliance to develop an individual’s skills between an experienced Conflict Resolution Coach and a person who wants to:
Using a structured model allied to a personal approach, coaches work in harmony with individuals to help them identify and work toward their conflict management goals. Conflict coaching is a voluntary and confidential process that is task and results oriented. There are a number of associated applications of this dispute resolution and Coaching speciality, one of them being conflict management coaching.

Conflict management coaching is personal training; a way to better understand conflict and how to effectively manage it in everyday life. Conflict management coaching is a valuable tool for personal and professional conflicts. Conflict Resolution and Mediation is our profession and our passion.
Effective conflict management IS effective communication. As communication and Conflict Management Specialists, Re:Solve Mediation in South Surrey & Vancouver can assist you in improving both.
We are dedicated to providing Conflict Coaching services to individuals and organizations, Human Resources departments and personnel, integrating coaching with other dispute resolution and human development services.
Conflict Coaching is an Essential Part of a Constructive Conflict Culture. Conflict coaching is included in Government and private corporation’s by developing the proven personal strategies to be adopted.
Serious conflicts can cost organizations serious money and disrupt the organizational and client climate. Effective early intervention in the form of conflict coaching can stop the financial and human cost produced by conflict before it arises.
There is no stopping conflict but its impact can be minimized and its upside can be maximized. In a complex service economy where innovation, diversity, teamwork, and speed matter, managing conflict effectively should be a basic business practice. Contact Re:Solve Mediation Services in South Surrey today for Conflict Coaching, serving Vancouver and BC.
The role of a conflict coach varies of course, depending on the circumstances and client’s objectives – though a behavioural approach has been found helpful. For instance, one of the functions of a conflict or mediation coach in preparing a party for a conflict situation is to help the client anticipate possible reactions from the other participant and to engage him or her in pre-formulating effective ways to respond to anticipated counter arguments. Coaches can act as “the other side” and provide feedback that helps the person in his/her efforts to respond to a challenging interaction in a “practice” scenario – before facing the opposing party under the more stressful circumstances of a face to face meeting.
Experiential exercises of this nature help the individual to effectively conduct themselves within conflict situations and beyond the process itself. That is, this process further helps the person to learn how to more effectively participate in constructive conflict conversations and gain insights and skills that extend beyond the specific dispute. Commonly, conflict coaching also occurs after the conflict situation, to assist a participant with any adverse impact and to ensure the experience results in sustainable learning – turning potential negatives into a positive outcome.
The role of coaching a party to a mediation may also extend beyond the behind-the-scenes function, to actually sitting at the table. This then crosses over into more of a Facilitator role – something Re:Solve Mediation offers in the Vancouver area.
Conflict management coaching is used primarily in the organizational context. However, conflict resolution Coaching also helps anyone who needs to enhance their competency in conflict management and engage effectively on a one-on-one basis with another person. Business partners and associates, life partners, family members and others are potential participants, as are lawyers, union representatives and others who interact as “agents” in mediation and want to enhance their skills, their competence and their confidence.
Conflict management coaching is a dispute resolution mechanism that assists people on a personal basis to improve their ability to participate effectively in conflict conversation. This process helps people to learn more about themselves and how to deal with conflict effectively, enabling them to shift their conflict conduct in a dispute, as well as other situations that arise.
As conflict coaching continues to develop within the dispute resolution and coaching fields, the likelihood is that a range of concepts will be creatively applied in various contexts including specifically Conflict Coaching. It is probable, that a more formalized structure and related body of work, practices and procedures will develop on a one-on-one basis and within a conflict Coaching context.
Customized training and coaching can be tailored for your needs. We can customize our coaching and training to your unique character, competencies, and context. We can give you powerful perspectives to consider when it comes to understanding your situation and taking action with others in the future.
Conflict Coaching can provide tremendous value. Dealing with destructive conflict early on or, better yet, proactively, has the capacity to enhance productivity.
Working with us is easy. Part of the appeal of conflict management coaching is the efficiency with which it can be scheduled. In addition, clients love the individual focus. All of our services relating to coaching, training, and consulting are straightforward and results-focused.

Throughout Wednesday, snow will fall across the Upper Midwest. Winter storm watches and warnings are in effect for North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and parts of Wisconsin.
The National Weather Service (NWS) says blizzard conditions are possible through Wednesday in central North Dakota.
"Winds could gust as high as 60 mph, causing significantly reduced visibilities in blowing snow," according to NWS.
As the storm moves towards the East Coast on Christmas, it will become a significant rainmaker from the Deep South to Upstate New York.
CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said this storm could produce "dangerous winds and even a few brief isolated tornadoes. Especially at risk on Christmas Eve are eastern sections of North and South Carolina, southern Georgia and Alabama, and parts of the Florida Panhandle."
Snow is expected from the Ohio Valley to the Tennessee Valley on Thursday afternoon. Much of West Virginia and Eastern Ohio could record upwards of half a foot of snow depending on elevation.
Meteorologists at BAMWX outline the "highest threat" area of potential snowfall for the Christmas Eve winter storm.
This time around, big cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will see rain on Christmas eve.
New York, Binghamton's NWS warns residents that "where recent heavy snow fell, this could add weight to old snowpack on roofs/structures resulting in collapsed structures."
Snow showers today and tonight. Quiet Wednesday. Focus remains on Thursday and Friday. Heavy rain and rapid snowmelt Thursday increase risk for ponding and adds weight to old snow pack on structures. Snow late Thursday night and wet surfaces quickly ice over. #nywx #pawx pic.twitter.com/I0DcQYCHrK— NWS Binghamton (@NWSBinghamton) December 22, 2020
After the storm clears out by the end of the week, the country's eastern half will get blasted with Arctic air through the weekend.Find out more about our new EU funded project, and the free resources, services, and expertise that it will provide to the PDX research community

I can't say I'm unhappy to see the back side of January, as to be honest, last month was pretty bad health-wise and to some extent weather-wise (though it's been a milder winter than most folks expected ::knock on wood:: ). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage across the world and hit Canada hard, this despite the vaccines that are out there and being administered. Though the drug companies appear to be playing games with Canadian shipments, a problem that also stems from the fact that Canada does not have any companies in its own borders that can make vaccines, making us dependent on other nations and the companies that have manufacturing facilities there. Something that Canada is sure to remedy in the coming months/years.
I'm just hoping that this month is better than last month, especially health-wise. The early part of January was pretty decent, but the rest of the month wasn't all that great for multiple reasons that I won't go into here.
I don't have much to say today as I'm in quite a bit of pain and have a few things I want to get done before the evening. That, and nap a bit this afternoon.SHEPHERD, Texas — semi-automatic rifle.
Archibald established an armed perimeter in the parking lot outside Crash-N-Burn Tattoos, secured by five men with military-style rifles, tactical shotguns, camouflage vests and walkie-talkies. One of them already had a large tattoo of his own. “We the People,” it said.
“I think it should be a business’s right if they want to close or open,” said Archibald, a 29-year-old online fitness trainer from the Dallas area who lately has made it his personal mission to help Texas business owners challenge government orders to keep their doors shut during the coronavirus pandemic. “What is coming to arrest a person who is opening their business according to their constitutional rights? That’s confrontation.”
Call it the armed reopening.
While Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this month allowed a wide range of malls, restaurants and other businesses to reopen after a coronavirus lockdown, bars, salons, tattoo parlors and other enterprises where social distancing is more difficult were ordered to remain closed for a longer period.
In at least a half-dozen cases around the state in recent days, frustrated small-business owners have turned to heavily armed, militia-style protesters like Archibald’s group to serve as reopening security squads.
The showy displays of local firepower are creating a dilemma for the authorities, who face public demands for enforcement of social distancing guidelines but also strong pushback from conservatives in some parts of the state who are convinced that the restrictions go too far.
The broader political split came out into the open this week when the Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, issued a warning to three Democratic-led cities — Austin, San Antonio and Dallas — that their local COVID-19 restrictions were illegal under the statewide reopening order issued by Abbott, also a Republican.
The armed gatherings are in some ways a Texas thing — a combination of long-standing anti-government and pro-gun movements in an independent state where “Come and Take It” flags are commonplace and amateur warriors patrol the southern border with Mexico.
Similar situations have unfolded in other states — armed members of the Michigan Liberty Militia challenged Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home orders recently inside the state Capitol, and armed members of the Michigan Home Guard helped reopen a barbershop in the town of Owosso. But Texas appears to be turning such goings-on into a cottage industry.
Around the state, groups of rifle-carrying demonstrators have volunteered their services to small-business owners and have taken to social media to urge people to defy the authorities where necessary and reopen with armed support.
Friday’s reopening at Crash-N-Burn in the town of Shepherd unfolded quietly, except for Zeus. In the span of a few hours, the shop had 10 tattoo and piercing customers.
In recent days, Archibald has also brought his firearms to the illicit reopenings of a handful of bars, gyms and other businesses around the state. Days before the reopening in Shepherd, Archibald helped organize a protest outside an illegally reopened bar in the West Texas city of Odessa. That one ended with the authorities rolling up in an armored vehicle and arresting several of Archibald’s armed friends, along with the bar owner.
Archibald also lent his services at the Dallas hair salon whose owner, Shelley Luther, was jailed for defying the authorities and became a national icon to conservatives opposed to state lockdowns.
Following the confrontations in Odessa and Dallas, police officials and local leaders have found themselves in a bind, especially after the governor spoke out on behalf of the Dallas salon owner and helped get her released by easing the punishment for violating his remaining lockdown orders.
“Why put forth to law enforcement to enforce these orders if you’re not going to have the backbone to stand up and back up what you’ve ordered?” the county sheriff who led the raid on Big Daddy Zane’s bar in Odessa, Mike Griffis, told The Odessa American newspaper.
The armed protesters are a varied lot scattered around the state, some of them with long-established groups, others forming new ones or acting as lone operators. J.P. Campbell, 45, a military veteran with the group Freedom Fighters of Texas, met Archibald face to face for the first time only during last week’s action at Crash-N-Burn.
“It’s not for looks,” Campbell said as he stood guard with a shotgun draped across his chest. “We’re willing to die.”
The groups walk a thin line between civil disobedience and political street theater in a way that has caused a split within the anti-lockdown movement, some of whose proponents oppose such brazen challenges to the authorities.
Gun control supporters have their own concerns about such tactics.
“People are nervous enough as it is, and then to see people walking around with AR-15s in public places, gathered together like that, is unnerving and upsetting,” said Ed Scruggs, the board president of the group Texas Gun Sense. “The entire goal is intimidation and attention.”
Some of the protesters say they are merely engaging in marketing — drawing attention to businesses so that their reopening attracts more customers — while others say they are part of a grassroots rebellion against oppressive government.
“We go out there because we want peace, but we prepare for war,” said C.J. Grisham, 46, a retired Army sergeant whose gun rights group Open Carry Texas helped the arrested owner of the bar in Odessa get a lawyer. “I hope this never happens, but at some point guns are going to have to cease to be a show of force and be a response to force,” he said.
Outrage followed the Odessa arrests. Griffis of Ector County has received numerous threats. Bomb technicians were summoned to his house to inspect his pickup truck after one threat.
Archibald, who had publicly called for Griffis to step down and for protesters to rally outside the sheriff’s house, said he had no involvement in any threatening messages. “I have no control over those threats,” he said. “I think a lot of that is just coming from people who have been angry at him and angry about police brutality for a long time.”
The Odessa arrests and the jailing and release of Luther have energized the protesters and put them in the spotlight. Archibald said he plans to travel soon to California and New Jersey to help businesses reopen there — though he said he would go unarmed.
“We aren’t going to take any heat because I personally don’t know the California laws,” he said. “Texas is way more lenient.”
Handguns are regulated under Texas law — a state-issued license is required to carry a handgun in a concealed or unconcealed manner. But the carrying of bigger weapons — rifles, shotguns and other firearms known as long guns — is largely unregulated, and no licenses are required to carry long guns out in the open. According to state law, a person can carry a rifle in a public place as long as they do not display it “in a manner calculated to alarm.”
And this being Texas, the alarm threshold is rather high.
The top elected official in San Jacinto County, which includes Shepherd, said he had no objections to the reopening of Crash-N-Burn, particularly after the governor’s apparent acquiescence in the Dallas salon case.
“The powers that be came to their senses and said, ‘Look, you can’t do this,’ so the same thing’s going to apply to a tattoo shop,” the official, County Judge Fritz Faulkner, 61, a Republican, said. “Now, my personal opinion is, if a barbershop can open, I don’t know why a tattoo shop couldn’t open.”
Barbershops and hair salons were allowed by the state to reopen last week with restrictions. Critics of the lockdown orders, including conservative activists and some local officials, believe that the governor’s orders are so vaguely written that it is also legal for bars and tattoo studios to reopen, fueling the armed protesters’ belief that they are in the right.
Abbott’s executive order states only that people “shall avoid” visiting those establishments.
“The language is so open-ended, broad and subject to interpretation that it’s causing a lot of confusion amongst people who are trying to live under the order,” said Jared Woodfill, a conservative activist and Houston lawyer who has sued Abbott claiming that the lockdown orders violate both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, among other laws.
At Crash-N-Burn on Friday, the owner, Williams, 35, said she had been scared about the potential pushback from law enforcement if she reopened but had decided to try because she had lost between $6,000 and $10,000 after being closed for weeks.
Williams said she was inspired by the actions of Luther in Dallas and felt a peace of mind knowing the armed men were there in the parking lot.
“I had a feeling that finally somebody had my back,” Williams said. “And it’s really sad that citizens are having my back as opposed to my government.”To build “Mark Attebery Studio,” Mark Attebery chose Sandvox.

Daniel has been amazing throughout the whole recruitment process! I have never met such a professional and dedicated recruitment person. I cannot thank him enough for his support and for helping me start a new chapter of my professional career within just few weeks! Well done Daniel.
Pub: 4 Nov 2021
Daniel is a very passionate person about what he does. He always does his best, provides support and guides whenever his help is needed. Moreover, he knows which roles could be best for the people and follows the IT area heedfully. If one day your roads get crossed with him, feel confident. Since he will do his best as always he does.

I was referred by a friend to make use of VC in searching for the best career opportunity. Instead of hours going through different job descriptions, Daniel made it seamless by getting to know me, my skills and my experiences and laid out jobs that best suit me. Without any waste of time, I was already in contact with whom is now my employer. The willingness to help and the immediate feedback provided by Daniel and VC is what I am most grateful for.

Francesca has given considerable attention to my job search and presented me with a specific role that actually materialised to be my current employment. She followed up before and after the interview process to ensure that I was prepared and to give her feedback. I would really recommend her as she ensured that I was happy with the contract offered. To summarise personal attention was given and I felt that I was not just a number.
Pub: 17 May 2021
I find Francesca to be very engaging and high in integrity. What I valued the most is that she always listens and was quick to help. I'm sure that her efficiency will help other candidates to find the right job, as she found for me. Also providing myself with the important support that I needed.

I contacted Simon to help me find a job in a difficult time and I have no regrets. He was extremely helpful from the start, offering opportunities whilst always safeguarding my interests. Excellent service throughout.
Pub: 19 Nov 2020
Simon from VacancyCentre has been extremely helpful with my job search. I felt that he possesses a deep knowledge of the market for jobs within the finance industry as he patiently explained to me what opportunities will most probably meet my job and salary expectations. He set up interviews for me with potential employers and always sought for feedback both from the employer and myself. Nonetheless, when I got accepted he also negotiated a better salary, which by myself couldn’t have negotiated. I am truly grateful and greatly recommend Simon and other recruiters from VacancyCentre!

Daniel has been a great help in my search for a new opportunity, he has impressive knowledge of the market and identified attractive and relevant IT roles very efficiently. He is approachable, professional and has always found time to offer invaluable advice on relocating and working in Malta.
Pub: 3 Nov 2020
I have dealt with over 10 recruiters in my last job search. Daniel was the one who was really very helpful. I was struggling with my termination and work permit process. He guided me very smoothly. He helped from the beginning of the job search till my onboarding. I am glad that I got a best recruiter in Malta. I am really very thankful to him.
Pub: 4 Nov 2020
Francesca from VacancyCentre was always very efficient and professional. Thanks to her guidance I have managed to land a job in an area I always wanted to establish myself in. In the past I have come across many different recruiters ,however none of them helped me the way Francesca has ,as she always went the extra mile to accommodate me ,even if that meant taking my call after work hours.Year 4
Welcome to Year 4
This is the home of Mrs Duffy and Mrs Myler.
We make learning fun in our class and always try to enjoy our work and be helpful and kind to each other. This year we are focusing on being independent and responsible whilst in and out of the class room. Our Christian Value this half term is Responsibility. will be working hard on our times tables also. This will be done in school and at home as part of the Maths homework.
We also ask that children read five times per week if possible. Now that children are in Year 4, reading up to 60 minutes per day can significantly improve their fluency and comprehension. Please record your child's reading in their reading journals as they can receive reading ninja certificates every 25 times they read..
Our P.E lessons this half term will be on a Monday morning with Mr Noblett and on a Thursday afternoon with me and Miss Morris. However, it is important to have our P.E kit in school every day.
In Year 4, we will be having clarinet lessons every Thursday morning. Children are responsible for bringing their clarinets in every Thursday morning and taking them home on a Thursday night to practise throughout the week.
Kind regards Mrs Duffy and Mrs Myler.NATALIE'S STORY

Drone DPS, Bunnies, and Sandbagging
William Sayeth replied to Pacolipse's topic in DPS Site TacticsWell, yes, we could minmax how many drones of each kind everyone brings and coordinate it beforehand, and improve a lot of things. But WTM is fundamentally not at all a minmaxing community. If most people in fleet have drones in the right place, and listen to the FC well enough to most of the time be where they should, that's gonna have to be serviceable as a low for a loosely tied, open community. The premiere goal of most of the line members is to sit back and chill, shoot stuff, chatter about nullsec changes or turkey roasting and maybe save up to that fancy skin. And WTM has survived and thrived for a very long time, catering to this core group. This could be changed into something vastly more serious, but that has high costs in terms of how many pilots we would lose or not be able to bring. This in turn results in severely reduced uptime (which atm is a main selling point of flying with WTM) and it changes the climate into a competitive one, over time increasing tention and drama between participants. What likely follows then is that even a portion of those who can live up to higher requirements will leave as they don't enjoy the experience anymore, and isk/hour which had increased from 100 to 300 drops to 0 with 9 ppl and their alts left in fleet trying to form, wondering how WTM died when performance was at such a high. (Let's not even have to sit for three hours trying to form, even if we eventually can field 20 leshaks and sustain on 5 logi, imo.) Still, improvements can and should be made, certainly, as long as we keep in mind what it is that has allowed WTM to stay relevant. The blatant sandbagging you mention initially can and should definitely be thwarted, especially if we help the FC realize when it's happening. We don't want to end up in a spot where it feels useless to put in the extra mile because someone's been "dcing" on beacon the last three sites. But FCs are good at counteracting this, and I've no doubt they can sort out who isn't deploying drones.
Basichat blooper
William Sayeth posted a topic in Warp To Me LocalWe were setting up cap chain after some replacements and I had dropped unstable, and then once chain was fixed I called CC to pilot 'Bump Back'. Resulting in this:
"www" and "nnn" in WTM-Basi
William Sayeth posted a topic in Logistics TacticsHello fellow logi I would like to question our use of the "www/-www" and "nnn/-nnn" notations in basi chat. I don't see their usefulness, and would like to have it explained to me if I am missing something. If i am not, I think they should both be removed from use. WWW first. While being webbed of course increases the danger, noticing that someone is webbed has very little impact on counter-actions. A logi with aggro already should get attention from other logis, and repairs should be applied. As another logi I don't respond differently to "this basi has full room!" and "this basi has full room and is webbed!". And as the targeted pilot I'd much rather make sure I have my broadcast(s) in order and some transversal up, and get on considering if I want to heat invul, than take my eyes off centerscreen and add information that doesn't change the responce. Arguably webs are even more dangerous to scimitars, but they don't call them out, and they don't see basichat to assist the webbed basi. FC doesn't see it either, so you'll still get called out for having your prop mod off either way. NNN then. When someone calls out that they are being neuted, I have no idea how to respond. Do they need cap? Are they typing "nnn" instead of broadcasting for cap? Do they have the outuni? Or are they just seeing the icon and typing it out of habit or because they have to? If there's not also a cap broadcast to go with, and it's a pilot I know has flown before, I assume that they are fine on cap. But if it's someone I havent flown with, well, they might be completely dry and the capchain might be in danger. It's unlikely, but I can't know for certain and having this commando at all adds unnecessary confusion in my opinion. I would like to have a binary broadcast or no broadcast, in addition to s and -s, and that's it. Get rid of the guessing. Often if you're being neuted by something that's not an outuni and you've got nothing to repair you've more spare cap than when your reppers are running. When this happens to me, I don't see any reason to call out to other basis who already have enough to manage that they need to start figuring out if i am sitting on 97% cap with a frig on me, or if the whole fleet is in danger. Both of these also add an unwanted moment when you are losing aggro. When this happens I want to broadcast 'in position' and then directly get on repairing who got the aggro instead rather than having to keep in mind if I have remembered to add information to basichat that was really already provided by my broadcast. Already without these, flying the basi has higher requirements in terms of player effort than flying a scimitar, and I'd like to spend less time typing. Thoughts? (It's not in question that calling out who you are combat capping and that you are jammed is necessary, as well as cap stability checks of course.)Connect to Account Name (Region)

In construction and function of Water Pipes is similar to a hookah, except smaller and especially more portable. A water pipe may be constructed from any air- and water-tight vessel by adding a bowl and stem apparatus which guides air downward to below water level whence it bubbles upward during use. To get fresh air into the water pipe and harvest the last remaining smoke, a hole known as the carburetor, somewhere on the lower part of the bong above water level, is first kept covered during the smoking process, then opened to allow the smoke to be drawn into your lungs.
Water Pipes have been used for over 2400 years! Give one a try, you’ll be impressed.

thanks moosa! actually i did not mention that the first thing we did was implement a 301 redirect from the root to the sub. this resulted in content in our e commerce store to immediately achieve decent rankings in the SERPS.
now I am working on getting the backlinks pointing to the root domain to point to our new subdomain.
do you think, that because of the 301 redirect, and possibly due to the use of a decent ecommerce platform, we were able to achieve rankings for keywords so quickly in the subdomain?
thanks!
- MoosaHemani last edited by
I personally believe 301 will help as it will allow you to transfer the juice from main domain to the sub domain. Remember 301 redirection will lose some of the juice when transferring from main to the sub domain.
hope this helps!
I honestly don't know.
Since it has been there for a year, I would probably not move it.
thanks for the comment!
i'm sorry i made a mistake saying recently. i had actually meant that we had been running the store on the subdomain for almost a year now, and there is no content at all at the root domain.
i believe we just did a 301 redirect from the root to the sub once the store went live.
is moving the ecommerce into a folder on the root domain still helpful since there is no content at all in the root domain? our original intent was to just take over the domain completely and turn the root domain into an ecommerce enabled site.
I'd move the ecommerce into a folder on the root domain instead of into a subdomain. Then you get the authority benefits of the root.FREE COVID-19 Day 2 Antigen test with new package bookings - for hassle-free holidaying. Ts&Cs apply. See COVID-19 travel info.

Neapolitan Riviera Weather
If you feel like a holiday to the Neapolitan Riviera in the peak months of July and August then prepare for a sunshine break to remember, as temperatures will reach an average of around 28° Celsius. With ten hours of sunshine a day, you'll be more than ready to soak up the sun on the glorious beaches when there is very little chance of rain. However, you'll still be perfectly able to enjoy good weather outside of these times; if you're not much of a sun lover, then exploring the delights of Mount Vesuvius in the lower climates, which average in the low 20s, will ensure you enjoy a comfortable and warm break.
Landscape
Anyone who has never experienced a holiday in the Neapolitan Riviera before will be in for a treat, as the landscape is truly a feast for the eyes. The imposing Mountain Vesuvius hangs mightily in the background, while fields full of orange groves, vines, trees and flowers stretch as far as the eye can see. The bay of Naples itself is a gem, with the coast offering an array of towns offering wonderfully quaint town squares and churches.
For something truly special, the picture perfect town of Amalfi is a must, while Massa Lubrense, sat 400 feet above the Riviera, offers visitors the chance to unwind while taking in an unbeatable and beautiful view of the entire locale.
Things To Do on Neapolitan Riviera Holidays
A holiday in the Neapolitan Riviera will provide you with the chance to unwind like never before, with beachside locales like Sorrento offering a pristine beach to relax on and wonderful town to explore. After that, you'll be more than energised to explore the many delights of Naples; why not take a trip to the historic city of Pompeii, which is an ancient partially ruined city?
After that you'll also be ready to visit Mount Vesuvius, the famous volcano that erupted in AD 79 and destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Still looking for something to do afterwards? Then a visit to the beautiful island of Capri will be the icing on the cake, offering yet more beautiful beaches and cuisines to sample.
Culture
What with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, and the destruction of Pompeii, the Neapolitan Riviera will be an awe-inspiring experience for history fans. The town of Pompeii was buried in ash, and was not actually discovered until 1748, a whole 1700 years after it was destroyed. It has since been excavated, and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site that offers a unique view of the Roman Empire at its mightiest.
Get ready for a break to remember, because a holiday to the Neapolitan Riviera offers a hugely varied events calendar. From April to October the Riviera enjoys a spectacular collection of concerts, with the town of Ravello offering a music festival taking with performances of the likes of Bach and Wagner. After this you can expect to enjoy the delights of the town local market, which will typically take place on a Sunday, offering all kinds of memorabilia to enjoy when you get home.
The Riviera is also a close distance to Rome, offering you the chance to explore the wonders of the Italian capital, while the Ischia Spas offer mud baths and hit springs for the ultimate in luxurious relaxation.
Nightlife
The Neapolitan Riviera is world-renowned for providing a holiday full of tranquillity and relaxation, and it would be fair to say that while there are a few bars and night clubs that are open well into the night for party animals, the nightlife of the Riviera is decidedly ambient. The beachside town of Sorrento in particular offers a huge range of restaurants and bars catering for couples and families offering traditionally cooked Italian cuisines, which will keep food lovers very happy! The town many bars in Sorrento meanwhile are hospitable and welcoming to anyone with children, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a relaxing drink next to the crystal blue ocean.

Tips
- Keep your slabs of wet clay flat while working with it. Do not peel the slabs off the working surface as this will tend to make the clay warp later.Thanks!
- You can purchase clay roller that has 2 rollers, 1 for each clay surface, so that the clay can be rolled out evenly on both sides.Thanks!
- Waxing your tile's edges before drying will help the tiles dry evenly.Thanks!
- Warping of your tiles during firing can be very disappointing after all of your work. To avoid warping, ensure that you have the correct equipment, quality of clay and specifications of your kiln.Thanks!
- Clay tiles that are too thin will tend to warp more than thicker tiles.Thanks!
Warnings
- Be sure to use the tile for its intended purpose. Some tiles are intended for walkway and floors, while others are for walls, showers and decorative accents. Be careful to not place highly glazed tiles on a walkway as they can be slippery.Thanks!
Things You'll Need
- Clay
- Hard, flat surface on which to work with the slab

‘Vague; indistinct, not clearly expressed or identified, of uncertain or ill-defined
meaning or character, as returned only a vague answer, has some vague idea
of doing something, have not the vaguest notion of his reasons, yield to vague
terrors, heard a vague rumour to that effect, hence vaguely,
vagueness. Vagary; whimsical or extravagant notion,
caprice, freak, unaccountable proceeding.
‘Vagrant; a person of no settled abode, income or job, tramp, on tramp, wandering idly, roaming, roving, strolling itinerant, as a vagrant musician, indulging in vagrant speculations, wanderer, idle rover, vagabond, idle and disorderly person of any of 3 grades liable to various terms of imprisonment, hence vagrancy, continually changing especially as from one abode or occupation to another, a drifting double-dealer, the floating population, vagrant hippies of the 60s. Vagabond; having no fixed habitation, wandering, driven, drifting, to and fro; wanderer, vagrant, especially idle and worthless one.’
‘Ragged and usually filthy, the rural vagrant did not necessarily present the physically collapsed appearance that a later age came to associate with tramps. Indeed the number of young, sturdy men, confirmed in a life of wandering idleness and fully prepared to resist attempts at coercion was in official eyes a most disturbing feature of the vagrancy problem.’ Kellow Chesney The Victorian Underworld 1970
‘In the 16th and 17th centuries in England a vagrant was a person who could work but preferred not to. Vagrancy was illegal, punishable by branding, whipping, conscription into the military or transportation to penal colonies. Vagrants were different from impotent poor who were unable to support themselves because of advanced age or sickness. However the English laws usually did not distinguish between the impotent poor and the criminals, so both received the same harsh punishments. In some east Asian countries vagrants are still revered and feared, as they are believed to possess semi-religious powers.
‘In America if a person wandered into town and did not find work, he/she was told to leave or be prosecuted. US vagrancy laws were vague and covered a wide range of activities and crimes associated with vagrants, such as loitering, prostitution, drunkenness and associating with known criminals. After the US Civil War homeless unemployed black Americans were arrested and fined as vagrants. Usually the person could not afford the fine and so was sent to county labour or hired out. In the US of the 1960s vagrancy laws were found to be too broad and vague. England eventually changed its poor laws and today vagrancy is legal.’ Wikipedia
1349 After the Black Death in the reign of Edward III acts were passed to force able-bodied men to work. 1388 During the reign of Richard II measures were introduced restricting the movement of vagrants and labourers. 1601 The Act for the Relief of the Poor (the Old Poor Law) was passed at the end of the reign of Elizabeth I, making parishes responsible for poor relief and unemployed people who refused to work liable to be sent to a House of Correction or prison. 1662 The Act for the Better Relief of the Poor was passed at the beginning of the reign of Charles II, enforcing the removal of vagrants from parishes if they were thought ‘likely to be chargeable’ to the parish poor rates.
1697 The Act for supplying some Defects in the Laws for the Relief of the Poor in the reign of William III introduced proto-concentration camp ‘badging of the poor’. 1723 The Workhouse Test Act came into force. The test principle being the harsh regime of workhouses should act as a deterrent, so only the most desperate would resort to them. Under the 1774 Vagrant Act, ‘beggars, vagrants and idle persons’ were classified into categories for sentencing; ‘idle and disorderly persons’ got a month in the Bridewell; ‘rogues and vagabonds’, a whipping and 6 months; ‘incorrigible rogues’, a whipping and 2 years.
The Vagrancy Act ‘for the punishment of idle and disorderly persons, rogues and vagabonds’ was introduced in 1824, to deal with Napoleonic war veterans and Scottish and Irish economic migrants who resorted to sleeping on the streets and begging; effectively making it a crime to be homeless or beg for subsistence. The act also legislated against ‘exposing indecent prints in a street or highway.’ The Whigs’ 1838 Vagrancy Act amendment added more public order offences including ‘exposing indecent prints in a shop or house.’ In 1929 paintings by DH Lawrence were seized by police from a gallery under this part of the act. The last successful prosecution under the amendment was of the artist Stass Paraskos in 1966.
‘Notting Dale workhouse on the site of what is now Avondale Park Gardens was supposed to be the cruellest in London. To it were sent the difficult cases from all other workhouses and the threat to send inmates to it was an effective method of discipline to others. The cruel prison discipline, with its task work and starvation diet, drove the inmates from its doors almost as soon as they had entered it. These unhappy vagrants drifted into a number of the common lodging-houses which had sprung up in the 2 streets of Rag Fair.’ North Kensington Citizen 1939
Barbara Denny wrote of the Westway in Notting Hill and Holland Park Past: ‘The area where the road crossed Notting Hill was already one of dereliction, fly-tipping, vagrants and travellers.’ Roger Matland, the director of the North Kensington Amenity Trust (now the Westway Development Trust), recalled: “Early impressions of the Trust land were of its emptiness. It was eerie walking past a boarded-up bay in the evening and seeing 30 or 40 vagrants there round a bonfire.”
The 1824 Vagrancy Act was used to enact the notorious sus laws, by which mostly West Indian youths were frequently stopped by police under suspicion of committing a crime; the major cause of the late 70s and 80s Notting Hill Carnival riots. The act was also used in the unsuccessful prosecution of the Virgin Records boss Richard Branson for ‘wilfully exposing to view in a public place an obscene exhibition’; the Sex Pistols’ ‘Never Mind the Bollocks’ album sleeve; in the case of the Boy King’s Road punk shop window display; and 10 years later it was cited regarding the Beastie Boys’ tour.
In 1979 Vague fanzine was named as a DIY post-punk spoof of Vogue magazine, and was closely linked to the principals of vagrancy and vagary in its production. The same year Club International featured a Vogue spoof Vague magazine cover and the VAG typeface was designed for Volkswagen. The fanzine featured a ‘Vagrants’ cartoon group strip (and ‘Vagrunts’ Apocalypse Now spoof) by Perry Harris written by Tom Vague. There has been a short-lived Vague fashion company and a Vague nightclub in Leeds, unrelated to Vague fanzine. Vague is a real surname found in Cornwall, and the Vagrants were a real mid-60s rock and soul group from Long Island, New York, who reformed in the 90s as the New Vagrants to record a ‘21st Century Vagrants’ album.
After the demise of flower power Steve Peregrin Took, the original Tyrannosaurus Rex bongo drummer, took on the cosmic/acid-punk rock role of ‘Shagrat the Vagrant’; a malign orc ‘dark lord of the black land’ in Lord of the Rings. In Days in the Life Steve Mann from International Times explained the White Panthers party (set up in solidarity with the Black Panthers) thus: “The party line was very, very vague: we had to overthrow western civilisation as soon as possible – before lunchtime preferably, although that wasn’t too easy because we didn’t get up very early.”
In Henry James’ Wings of the Dove novel, the house of Pearl Craigie, 56 Lancaster Gate, ‘had figured to her, through childhood, as the remotest limit of her vague world.’ Colin MacInnes cited the “bland air of ingratiating vagueness” of the Absolute Beginners photographer Roger Mayne as the key to his acceptance on the streets of North Kensington.
Jessica Lange as the Hollywood rebel actress Frances Farmer tells the cops: “Put me down as a Vague”; meaning a vagrant. Vera Vague starred in the 1945 film SNAFU. David Lynch has said: “It would be the greatest thing if you could be left with some vagueness, some imagination at the end of the film, when so often you’re robbed of the magic, that vagueness makes me dream, and I love it, and it opens a window on sort of an infinite thing.”
‘Clarity rules out vague concepts’, ‘King vague on army rules of engagement’, ‘Vague rules cast a shadow’, ‘Vague promises frustrate hopes of Green activists’, ‘Vagrants under fire for boozy assaults’, ‘Vague is still in vogue’, ‘Young vagrants dying for a home’, ‘So vague, Tories who want to follow Hague’, ‘Anti-vagrant sprinklers to be turned on homeless’, ‘It’s the vaguest war we’ve been involved in’, ‘Dying vagrant is hailed as extraordinary artistic talent’, ‘Feeling vague, Hague?’, ‘Rabbit saved from vagrant’, ‘Auditor condemns vague rules’.
‘If you keep removing single grains of sand from a heap, when is it no longer a heap? This question and many others like it will eventually lead us to the problem of vagueness. Timothy Williamson traces the history of the problem discussions of the heap paradox in classical Greece to modern formal approaches such as fuzzy logic. He shows the problem with views which have taken the position that standard logic and formal semantics do not apply to vague languages and defends the controversial realist view that vagueness is a kind of ignorance – there really is a grain of sand whose removal turns a heap into a non-heap, but we cannot know which one it is.’ Vagueness Timothy Williamson 1994
‘Vagueness provides a complete illumination and lucid account of one of the hottest topics in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of logic… His effort drives epistemicism to a new level of depth and distinction.’ Ray Sorensen, New York University

In Michigan, deaths among people with Alzheimer’s and dementia have seen a significant increase.
The Alzheimer’s Association is blaming that on COVID-19.
Colin Ford, Public Policy Director of the Lansing Area Alzheimer’s Association said 1 thousand people in Michigan have died from Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia this year.
The Centers for Disease Control is reporting the number of people with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia who are dying is up 16.6 percent through September of this year. The reason? Covid-19.
Ford said it it could be due to undiagnosed COVID-19 tests.
He said, “People are foregoing or differing healthcare. Not seeing their doctor, not wanting to go to the hospital for concerns of not wanting to be exposed to COVID.”
Self-isolation also plays a role in an increase in deaths.
Ford said, “A high percentage of people living with Alzheimer’s or dementia are in long-term care sites. So again, it could be loneliness. It could be just a lack of interaction that they really crave that puts them at risk as well.”
The Alzheimer’s Association said an increase in rapid COVID-19 testing at care facilities could save lives.
“When you start looking at the prioritization of availability like rapid turnaround testing, that has a huge impact in terms of keeping people safe in long-term care settings," said Ford. "But it also makes it possible for things like visitation to occur, so people can see their loved ones if testing is available. Same thing for personal protective equipment.”
Ford said it comes down to the availability of tests and the commitment of the people caring for these vulnerable patients.
The Alzheimers Association is working with lawmakers to reduce visitor restrictions in long-term care facilities.

A New Hope man remembers his father who died from COVID-19
Like many others who’ve lost family members to the coronavirus, Mark Novak didn’t get to spend the last moments of his father’s life by his side.
“It's disheartening,” he said. “We never wanted him to pass away by himself. I don't think anybody does.”
His father, Leonard Novak, died on the evening of April 5 from COVID-19 at the age of 91. He contracted the virus at the New Hope nursing home where he lived.
Mark Novak said he was able to see him earlier that day. Donning a gown, gloves and masks, he and his siblings went into Leonard’s room, two by two for a few hours at a time.
“The poor man was just really suffering, it was horrible to watch him try to get air,” he said. “I don't know if I could handle that much labor for any length of time, and I'm really proud of my dad.”
Mark Novak said he couldn’t touch his dad, and wasn’t sure if he even knew his children were present. But he said he was just happy to be able to see the man he remembers as an extrovert who prided himself on coordinating activities at his nursing home.
“I think what really hurt more than anything else is that he was a very active guy,” he said. “He was the bingo man at the nursing home and he took that job very seriously.”
Mark Novak also remembered how his dad instilled many lessons in him and his siblings.
“My dad was an extremely friendly, warm guy, and he didn't care about religion or color,” he said.
“He taught me if you bleed and you breathe, you deserve respect and that really was my dad all the way.”
He said that’s how he wants others to remember his dad, too. The family hopes to plan a memorial once large groups are able to gather again.

Many people are outraged when I tell them that Jian Ghomeshi’s accusers lose credibility with me because of their failure to report his alleged assaults to the police. How dare you say such a stupid thing, they say. You support rape culture. Or, if they’re kind, they just face palm.
“Why didn’t they report it?” has become the new “Why didn’t they just leave?”
Please don’t tell me how hard it is to report a sexual assault. I get it. I’ve been following this issue for 40 years. And when you go on and on about how difficult it is, you’re ignoring decades of progress. You’re acting as if nothing can ever change. And you’re discouraging other women from coming forward. So, yes, when I hear a woman didn’t report an alleged sexual assault, I do wonder why.
Now please take note again, and understand that that does not mean I’m accusing this non-reporting woman of being a liar. But it does mean I have some questions for her.
In the Jian Ghomeshi case, the answers the Star provided from the three women who said they were violently assaulted, did not answer those questions. The Star stated:.)
Here’s the problem. The women are more likely to have their identities revealed and be sued by having gone to the press instead of the police. If charges had been laid, their names would have been protected by a publication ban and anyone breaking the ban would have been subject to criminal prosecution. For some reason, this was not mentioned in the Star.
Nor was the fact that the vicious internet attacks sparked by the woman who wrote about her date-gone-wrong with Ghomeshi were equal opportunity. Anyone who reads comment threads can go see for themselves that Ghomeshi was vilified right alongside the writer.
It also deserves to be said that the Carla Ciccone article — a blind item published in 2013 and designed to generate buzz — was probably where this current mess began. It brought the talk about Ghomeshi out onto the internet in a way it never had been before. It’s why people were speculating before his Facebook post went up that this was going to be a sexual story.
To come back, however, to the specific allegations of violent assault made in the Star article, I find them shocking and disturbing. But I also find it shocking and disturbing that, for the accused, there is really no way to defend himself against this type of anonymous accusation in a trial by media.
Of the four accounts given by the women to the Star, the one I actually found the least credible was the story of sexual harassment at.
As a former employee of the CBC (a very long time ago), it just defies belief that the union rep would blow something like this off and that the Q producer wouldn’t know it was a ticking time bomb. And why was there no complaint to HR? (Yesterday, both the CBC and its main union said they had never received a formal complaint against Ghomeshi.) Where were the sympathetic women colleagues? This is, after all, the CBC we’re talking about not the NFL. Given that the Star says it had several detailed interviews with this woman, how did these questions not come up?
I know that by now some of you readers are very angry at me for putting the alleged victims on trial and being part of the whole rape culture apparatus. So once again, I get it. I know that, in a criminal action, even if the accusers are highly credible, they would be up against a defendant who, as an immensely talented broadcaster, knows exactly how to tell his story. It could very well end up a “he says, she says” case with a jury unable to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
I have no solution to propose to that problem just like I have no solution to the problem of murderers who walk on a technicality or the inhumane delays in getting cases to trials. I don’t, however, much like your solution where due process is thrown out the window, we accept that women never ever lie about sexual assault, and we forget about that whole right to face your accusers thing.
Speaking of which, in his Facebook post, Ghomeshi made a comment that hasn’t really been picked up on. “The ex has even tried to contact me to say that she now wishes to refute any of these categorically untrue allegations,” he wrote.
Given that his statement was highly strategic and very well planned, I can’t help but wonder if hearing from the ex won’t be the next instalment in this awful story. The internet outrage machine will soon be ready for its next stoking once the election news has died down.

This sentence is so naive….
it just defies belief that the union rep would blow something like this off
NO IT DOESN”T, IT DOES NOT DEFIE BELIEVE AT ALL, AT ALL
☻
I don’t think it’s naive at all. Union reps are the leftist of the lefties at the CBC. It’s also an organization filled with powerful women who know all about sexual assault and “rape culture”
This is a reasonable piece, but I think what you’re not acknowledging, perhaps, is that most people, including myself, and presumably the women involved, a) don’t/didn’t know that there’s anonymity involved in a complaint, b) perhaps assumed, reasonably, that their identities would be leaked or would come out either way (entirely plausible in this the Internet age where no secrets can be hidden for long) or c) The women felt, understandably that talking to a reporter about it rather than laying a charge would indeed have the intended effect of putting a stop to this guy (which is most definitely has) without involving them in a legal process in which they’d have to testify.
Thank you. I think the reporters had an obligation to inform the women about the publication ban. (And perhaps they did) Your explanation is plausible, but I’d like to hear it from the women.
I appreciate your comments, esp: “I don’t, however, much like your solution where due process is thrown out the window, we accept that women never ever lie about sexual assault, and we forget about that whole right to face your accusers thing.” While the mounting allegations seem to be tipping this story toward an unavoidable conclusion, it still seems critical to me that we remember fair process. This is not only trial by media but character crucifixion — with not a single charge laid and no formal explanation from the CBC for his firing.
One point though: having been involved a few different unions: unions are not necessarily hotbeds of sympathy or social progressiveness. While many unions make equality and social issues a foundation for their existence, many merely talk the talk. Plus, even in a cool, progressive union you could still get a dickwad of a shop steward.
Thx. Let me start with the union, you’re right, but I was also a member of the CBC Union once upon a time. So yes, a bad shop steward is possible. For me it was the combination of the bad Union rep, the doofus producer, no woman colleague to say, “you need to go to HR now” and the reluctance of the producer herself to push. At this point, I’m willing to say maybe it was the perfect storm.
Re innocent til proven guilty, that still holds. Even when I was writing about how Jian Ghomeshi deserved due process, I was conscious of the fact that I have never shied away from saying I believe Dellen Millard is guilty. That doesn’t mean I don’t think both of them deserve a fair trial. Nor would I screach at the people with a different opinion from mine. But I do feel both of them are guilty.
Hearing the new details does fundamentally change things for me.
It also confirms that women should be encouraged not discouraged from going to the police in cases like this. The more that has come out, the more people believe the allegations, which now will likely end up in court.
As more and more information comes out from past encounters, one can no longer presume they’re all from jilted ex’s. Yet Ghomeshi insists all his relationships were consensual. How can that be rationalized? What if it was a total lack of communication? He initiated the violence and then misread his victims’ reaction, or lack thereof, as consent. In his twisted mind he assumed they were consenting, but they weren’t.
There have been, and are, many famous, powerful men who have had their way with women and suffered no consequences. What about John Kennedy?Boxing Day, 2020 (December 26, for non-Brits). Feeling bloated and rudderless, the cumulative effects of turkey and lockdown, I needed something easy to watch. “I heard Bridgerton is supposed to be good,”offered my wife from the next room. When I clicked the search tab, Netflix was as prescient as ever with its first recommendation, in the top left.
My instinctive reaction was: Corsets? Nope. I swiftly navigated away to the familiar haven of Peep Show. The following day I was flipping through Netflix again when I noticed the same typeface: BRIDGERTON. But it took me a second to register it as the same show. The image framing it was entirely different.
Intrigued, I clicked through and settled in. It turns out I didn’t mind corsets so much.
Fast forward a few weeks and Bridgerton has become a runaway success. Along with other worldwide hits like Money Heist and Tiger King, Netflix proved again its capacity to shape global culture in 2020.
The streaming platform became famous by offering thousands of titles on demand to serve every conceivable niche. But what’s more interesting is its growing knack for creating shows that go massively mainstream. And this is by design. As Melanie MacFarland pointed out in her review of Bridgerton, the producers deliberately targeted multiple audiences.
This is a show devoted to casting the broadest of broad nets… A touch of the staid nature that crispens past films and BBC productions based on Austen's work remain in play here, but Van Dusen gussies things up to appeal to the "Gossip Girl" constituency.
Netflix doesn’t deploy classic market segmentation to think about its audiences. Rather than frame people in fixed psychographic terms (Millennials, Empty Nesters), the streaming giant analyzes “Taste Clusters” which can transcend a variety of people that you wouldn’t normally group together. As executive Ted Sarandos told Vulture:
It’s just as likely that a 75-year-old man in Denmark likes Riverdale as my teenage kids.
The truth is a singular “mainstream audience” doesn’t really exist. Rather, hits successfully unite a range of different tastes which encompass a range of different people. And that’s how a huge viewership is built.
Bridgerton, then, is an example of what I call Infinite Content: entertainment media in which multiple meanings are intentionally cultivated and surfaced through algorithmic technology — like Netflix’s recommendation feeds — so the same content simultaneously appeals to a variety of different audiences.
This article lays out how the Netflix algorithm optimizes its thumbnail artwork to sell Stranger Things to different taste clusters. And this is precisely what I experienced with the disparate Bridgerton thumbnails: The service was trying to pitch me the same show from multiple angles, figuring out which one will make me watch it.
But alternative artwork is just the tip of the iceberg. Infinite Content is enabling Netflix to offer less real choice. The number of shows the service hosts is actually reducing over time as it optimizes towards fewer titles that appeal to the broadest audiences (or, rather, the largest collection of niches). What ever happened to the Long Tail?
Chris Anderson published his Long Tail article in 2004, 3 years before Netflix launched its video streaming service. His thesis was groundbreaking and prescient. For the first time niche content would become a viable business model as the internet reduced distribution costs to zero:
Forget squeezing millions from a few megahits at the top of the charts. The future of entertainment is in the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of the bitstream.
For Anderson the Long Tail would fundamentally reshape culture as well as business. But the resilience of big, mass market hits — despite endless choice and zero friction — receives less attention. I want to draw our attention to what we might call the Fat Head of Anderson’s Long Tail.
Netflix, then pre-streaming, is a key case study. The book compares the 25,000 DVDs it offered at the time to the 3,000 one could find in the local blockbuster. For Anderson, the availability of niche content would catalyze a cultural renaissance as consumers, for the first time, could discover what they truly enjoy.
As [consumers] wander further from the beaten path, they discover their taste is not as mainstream as they thought (or as they had been led to believe by marketing, a lack of alternatives, and a hit-driven culture).
13 years later, evidence of the Long Tail abounds. Easily available content has ballooned. 500 hours of video are uploaded to Youtube every minute. Spotify makes over 50 million songs instantly available. And there are countless instances of obscure creators and hidden content finding new audiences because of the internet. But what is perhaps more surprising is that mass culture has remained so resilient. We may not be watching Bridgerton at the same time, or for the same reasons, but millions are watching it nonetheless.
Or take music. When you have millions of tracks at your fingertips, Anderson predicted many of us would wander “further from the beaten path” and disperse into niches as we became free to discover our true tastes. Yet despite hosting over 3 million artists, Spotify revealed last year that just 43,000 account for 90% of global streams. Put differently, 98.6% of artists account for just 10% of listening.
And like Netflix, Spotify has experimented with new forms of discovery that connect content with more diverse audiences. Mood driven playlists surface latent meanings within music that were previously obscured by reductive artist-centric framings. The platform controls the context in which we consume.
The Long Tail thesis was that growth in the future would come from serving small, niche audiences. This holds. But what Anderson missed was how technology would enable platforms to exploit the Long Tail within pieces of content, as well as across it. Bridgerton is emblematic of this Infinite Content, uniting a diverse range of audiences to create a new global mainstream. — By Tom Hoy (@thoy / @stripepartners)by Tammy Phillips

I am thankful that He was the first to coin the phrase, “DO IT.” I am humbled that He allows us to repeat lessons that we do not get the first, second or four hundred and forty- fifth time. I have been hearing the LORD urging me on for a few years with the words, “DO IT.” Sometimes, I do it right the first time, yet many times I don’t. I just recently found Ezra 10:4 which led me to search for all the times “DO IT” is in the Bible. Here is what I found…
“Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. be strong, and DO IT.“ (1 Chronicles 28:10) What has the LORD chosen you to do?
Do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD God–my God–will be with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you (DO IT) have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.” (1 Chronicles 28:20 NKJV) Have you finished your assignment?
“Hear…and observe to DO IT; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that flows with milk and honey.” (Deuteronomy 6:3 KJV) Have you done it? Are you well? Have you made it to your promised land? Obedience has great reward.
And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD and (DO IT) do all his commandments which I command thee this day. (Deuteronomy 30:8 KJV) Do you know the word of the Lord for your situation ?
“But the Word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may DO IT. (Deuteronomy 30:14 NKJV) God gives us all we need to do it. We must look for the how.
He who calls you (to DO IT) is faithful, who also will DO IT. (1 Thessalonians 5:24 NKJV). If the Lord has told you to do it, He is faithful to help and to do it.
“And whatever you do, DO IT heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.” (Colossians 3:23 NKJV) Do it for the Lord and no one else.
“But He answered and said to them, ‘My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and DO IT.'” (Luke 8:21 NKJV). We hear the word. We do it. We are counted as His family. So much so that…
“If you ask anything in My name, I will DO IT. If you love Me, keep My commandments.” (John 14:14-15 NKJV) Love Him? Do what He says.
“Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not DO IT, to him it is sin.” (James 4:17 NKJV). When we do not do what He has told us, it is sin.
“But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must DO IT, what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves… If you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for DOING IT. (James 1:22, 25 NLT) Hallelujah. God blesses the “do it,” when it is done!
Israel was returning from Babylonian captivity. They had not done things according to the word of God. However,“Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.” (Ezra 7:10 NKJV) The Israelites realized they had not done things the right way, so they came to Ezra and said, “Let’s do this. Let’s do it the right way, the God way.”
This is how Ezra and Israel responded in Ezra 10:
- They arose and went to work.
- They swore to DO IT
- They fasted.
- They confessed.
- Ezra commanded Israel to “DO HIS WILL!” and to…
- Separate from their sin! This is the same encouragement as, REND YOUR HEARTS!
- They then answered the call and said, “As you have said, I must DO.”
- They realized the work could not be done in a day or two because they greatly transgressed.
- They came up with a plan to “DO IT” the RIGHT WAY.
Think about it! I am. What has God told you to do and you have not done it? Ezra came up with a great plan that we can follow. They got up and went to work. They committed to it and took an oath to do it. They fasted and confessed their sin. They then acted and began to rend their heart and separate themselves from their sins. They answered the call and realized it was going to take a bit of time to do it. So, they came up with a plan to do it the right way.
I enCOURAGE you to arise, take responsibility, be brave and DO IT. Do what the Holy Spirit has been asking you to do. If you do not know the God way, seek Him. He will instruct you in the way to go. In the meantime, follow the steps that Ezra laid out. It will get you on the right path to “do it” the God way. Thank God that every morning is a day to begin again and do it…the right way.

Fatima Tayob Moosa was born in 1983 in Johannesburg, South Africa. She received a BA Interior Design in 2008 at the Greenside Design Center, College of Design in Johannesburg and in 2018, completed a BA Hons Fine Art at the University of Hertfordshire in Edinburg through the Interactive Design Insitute. She was a participant of the 2019 RMB Talent Unlocked Program in association with Vansa and Assemblage where her work was shown at the Turbine Art Fair. She has taken part in numerous group shows locally and took part in the Amsterdam art festival with The Center for the Less Good Idea. In 2019 she was invited by the South African Foundation of Contmeporary Art to take part in a 6 week residency in Knyna on Entabeni Farm, South Africa.
Fatima is a process-based artist who works in multiple media including, yet not limited to painting and drawing, with a focus on the idea of how elements can evolve to create new narratives and meaning. Her practice is strongly inspired by the relationship between physical and metaphysical energy which she explores through process and materiality.
Fatima currently lives and works in Johannesburg with a studio based at The Bag Factory.
Artist’s Statement
My work can be described as generative process which through the physical act and process of making work I am exploring energy through natural elements of gravity, wind, water and heat. Investigating the notion of resonance between what I feel on a spiritual and emotional level that translates into something physical. This requires a hyper-awareness of a physical, mental and spiritual state of being, while also keeping in mind the cyclical nature of the universe that is always evolving and shifting. The approach to my work alters on a daily basis, dependent on my emotional and spiritual presence at the time, which is naturally ever changing and evolving and resonates with the concept of cyclical change.
I just wanted to give members here a heads-up on something. We're all members of the same sites mostly. Probably a few of you gave up on NeoBux. For the last few weeks they've had a couple of hundred half cent ads daily, they run as long as SBTV videos and are worth TWICE as much. So if you gave up on Neobux years ago, now is the time to come back.
Minimum cashout is $2 for beginners and you can do that on the second day. And cashouts are instant. You click, and it's in your paypal account a second later. I think they're the only ones who do this.
So to wrapup. Big bucks on Neobux right now, reactivate your account if you've let it go dormant. If you don't have an account I have a handy signup thingy in my sig. :PConsider making a maximum donation using the buttons below.

1 How sweet upon this sacred day,
The best of all the sev'n,
To cast our earthly thoughts away,
And think of God and heav'n.
2 How sweet the words of peace to hear
From him to whom 'tis giv'n
To wake the penitential fear,
And lead the way to heav'n.
3 And if to make our sins depart,
In vain the will has striv'n,
He who regards the inmost heart
Will send his grace from heav'n.

“Jason,
I just wanted to drop you a note to tell you how well the Palma golf outing went yesterday. The weather was perfect (that was my job) and the course, staff and quality of everything else associated with the outing (your job) was outstanding.
As usual, your staff was very pleasant and helpful at all times. The food was excellent tasting and served hot. Everyone commented on how professional the entire event was staged. I wish I could say that I had something to do with it, but, in reality it was you and your staff at Summerfield Crossings that made the event what it was.
So, again, thank you and your staff for all the work they put into the event. See you next year.”

COP26: What happened and what does it mean for Australian farmers?
Earlier in November, 190 member governments gathered in Glasgow to discuss the global response to climate change. Methane, coal, carbon trading and Australia’s response were all a focus of the proceedings.
But what does that mean for Australia’s farmers? Would the methane pledge impact agriculture? Will Australian farmers be allowed to trade credits internationally? Is Australia taking sufficient action to protect our markets?
Join us to hear from Dr Kate Dooley and Dr Natalie Doran-Browne, both of the University of Melbourne, who will discuss where COP26 leaves farmers with carbon, methane and commodity markets, plus on-farm actions to take now. ... See MoreSee Less

Exactly. Farmers for Climate Action the lnp/nats are undermining the farming community. (Sorry that wasn't a deliberate pun, but now we are stuck with it!😉) Just about everyone except it seems for those benefiting from coal support acknowledge climate change is coming. Doing nothing will only make a farmers lot harder. Crops and cattle will die from higher temps and then top soils lost in floods. Farmers are doing their best to make the change but tech, education and financial support would help farmers help everyone.
Regenerative farming. This is my farm I bought it run down and over grazed. The foreground is what it was like when we got it. The background is what it looks like when we got control of where the cattle grazed and when. According to the figures I sourced on carbon footprints I am sequestering 2000T+ a year in carbon. It not hard to do but it is expensive if you hire someone to come and fence for you.
Actually, they can be... But they are not.
That's a good photo too
Interesting. Had to look it up, but it's good to see that regenerative grazing could be an answer climate-wise, because getting people to give up meat would be even more of a political nightmare than trying to get them moving on the energy sector (which should have been a no-brainer but has been toxicly hampered by the fossil fuel lobby)

We welcome Friday's news that the Fed Govt will legislate so that farmers can sell biodiversity outcomes to willing buyers. Farmers have always voluntarily done work which benefited biodiversity, and this initiative is a solid step towards properly recognising that. ... See MoreSee Less
Farmers to cash in under new plan Morrison government will soon start consultation on legislation to help create a national biodiversity stewardship market
Biodiversity outcomes are probably good. Biodiversity offsets are problematic on many levels. Any system that pays people to manage land for biodiversity or carbon should not be at the expense of biodiversity loss in other areas. Hopefully this new system is not just another offset so big business can green wash their bad practices.
Beware green washing. Climate change is the greatest threat to farming ever. The LNP intends to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change and continue increasing green house gas emissions until such time as all farmers are put out of business and the planet becomes uninhabitable.
If the Nate are on board,it’s likely a scam
I'm not happy with this 'plan'. Why should we get paid to do what is right? If the LNP's past record is anything to go by, it's just another attempt to win votes by throwing money at an issue.
I did hear on 'Background Briefing' on RN, that some farmers are being gifted public funding to stop land clearing. One farmer roped off a bushy area, got paid $150,000 a month, and with the money accruing over time, he purchased the adjoining property, and cleared it.
Nup. I belong to this group to change the government not to promote these liars. Next!!!

The initial focus of ESG compatibility with digital assets has been on the E - environmental component, described in our article Are Cryptos Going Green?, but with time, the S - the social component is taking up. Digital assets now seem to be the keystone of more equality and more inclusion all over the world.
Financial inclusion is key to reducing poverty, hunger and gender inequality. It also helps foster education, entrepreneurship and well-being as mentioned in the report by Cogent Social Sciences.
The latest World Bank Global Findex report (2017) estimates that 1.7 billion people don’t have a bank account, although two third of those unbanked already own a smartphone and use social media. There is growing interest in digital assets in regions where the local population has limited access to banking facilities.
Cryptocurrency adoption in emerging countries has skyrocketed. According to the Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis, only one developed country (USA) is within the top 20 adopters in 2021, all others are developing countries.
Today, in Africa, crypto transfers made up for 7% of retail-size transactions while the global average is 5.5%. (source: Chainalysis, Business Insider)
Why are cash-based economies adopting cryptos so rapidly?
Store of value
The main reason is protection against inflation as residents in low-income countries face frequent currency devaluations. Buying cryptocurrency, despite the high volatility, is a way to preserve their buying power. People struggling with inflation would turn to digital assets for purchasing and selling goods either locally or internationally. Also, cryptos are safer and easier to store than cash. While, in many of those regions, economies are still largely cash-driven, crypto users won’t need to drive to the bank, they just need an internet connection.
There is also a case for migrants to adopt digital assets to avoid having their cash stolen by smugglers and thieves on their way to richer and peaceful countries. While traveling, digital assets are easier to protect than cash.
Cheap and unlimited remittance
Overseas remittances are a crucial part of the economy for many emerging and frontier countries, especially in areas where populations have massively migrated internationally. In 2019, about 25 million expats of Sub-Saharan African countries, remitted $48 billion in traditional currencies back to their home land, sometimes paying up to 15% fees (source: World Bank). Remittance is expensive in traditional money while it is free or at a low cost in digital assets.
Cryptocurrencies are also a new way to deal with individual remittances in countries where the legal tender is not (or partially) convertible. Some governments limit cross-border transactions or ban some foreign currency (ie. Cuba banning the USD). Sending or receiving cryptocurrency gives a way to circumvent those limits so that the residents can meet their financial needs. As a consequence, remittance of digital assets has grown tremendously over the past few years.
On a broader spectrum, Decentralised Finance is empowering users to access finance apps with a much lower access threshold, to cover remittance, lending, trading and any other finance services.
Gender equality
According to the Findex report, 56% of all unbanked adults are women and the gender gap is even wider in developing economies, where 67% of men have a bank account, against 58% of women. In some countries, women can’t open an account without the approval of their husband/father. In Afghanistan now, women can’t even go to work as they need to stay at home. With the right education, women can now work from home and be paid directly into their own digital wallets. For a real case study, you can read the article ‘Finding Financial Freedom in Afghanistan’ by Alex Gladstein (Bitcoin Magazine).
Certain regions give more inheritance rights to men than to women, some parents may therefore open a digital asset wallet to transfer some funds to their daughters.
Workforce around the globe
Can cryptos help find a job? Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have definitely created new ways to earn a living with mining, staking or lending assets. Those new jobs could be done from home wherever this is. While bitcoin mining would require high computing power, staking and lending only require a standard internet connection with no particular equipment. As a result, cryptos help slow down migration for economic reasons. On top of crypto specific jobs, remote working was already standard for call centers and IT development, digital assets are bringing virtual workspace to another level. Some workers now looking for traditional jobs to be paid in cryptos, either full-time or part-time (ie. Laborx, Pompcryptojobs).
You can also start your own business and get paid in bitcoin from anywhere in the world without a bank account. Through Decentralised Finance (DeFi), the crypto ecosystem lowers the barriers to access to finance: anyone can create finance applications and interact directly with the smart contracts from their crypto wallets.
Being paid in digital assets gives potentially high returns in value, enhancing living standards in case the crypto has performed well. To avoid being impacted by volatility, the worker might convert some earnings into stablecoins.
Cryptos as a tool for human rights
Political and economic crises are fertile grounds for Bitcoin to become a tool for human rights. In some countries, showing support to opponents of current regimes may end up with arrests and frozen bank accounts. Some protesters and dissidents around the globe are turning to bitcoin and other digital assets to secure their savings as decentralised assets are uncensorable.
Taking donations in bitcoin for human rights keeps the anonymity of the donors, who might be afraid of repression from authorities.
Bitcoin was invented after the 2008 financial crisis sent to bankruptcy some of the largest banks in the world. The programmed currency directly addresses issues of poor governance of traditional currencies, with the belief that the blockchain technology is more trustworthy than institutions. The formidable development of digital assets in areas where institutions failed their population, shows that digital assets are a social tool working for more equality in the world.

Howard and teachers F. Meredith (math), J.E. Amos (home economics), J.F. Anderson (science), C.F. Hunt (English), and B.M. Davis (history and French). None were Wilson natives — a source of community discontent that helped end Howard’s tenure. Who were these teachers?
William James Flournoy Meredith was born 13 December 1901 in Pulaski, Giles County, Tennessee, to Claude and Willie Laura Howard Meredith.
In the 1910 census of Pulaski, Giles County, Tennessee: on Cotton Street, roller mill laborer Claude Meredith, 34; wife Willie, 29, a chambermaid at a college; sons Flournoy, 8, and Eddie, 6, plus widowed mother-in-law Josie Howard, 46.
In the 1917 Nashville, Tennessee, city directory: Flournoy Meredith, houseman at 308 17th Street North.
In the 1920 census of Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee: widowed laundress Willie Meredith, 39, and children Flournoy, 18, boarding house waiter, Willie, 15, cafe waiter, and Bertha, 2, plus a boarder, William Morrow, 42, city cement worker.
Flournoy Meredith graduated second in his class at Nashville’s Pearl High School in 1921.
Annual Report of the Public Schools, City of Nashville, Tennessee, Scholastic Year 1920-1921.
He went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Fisk University in 1926.
In the 1928 Wilson city directory, duplicate entries (though the names differ slightly) lists Wm. J.F. Meredith, school teacher, 624 East Green; James Meredith, school teacher, Wilson High School, 624 East Green.
In the 1930 census of Wilson, Wilson County: Edwin W. Fisher, 56, district manager insurance company; wife Daisey V., 52; daughter Susie A., 21; and lodgers James F. Anderson, 26, Indiana-born school teacher, and William Meredith, 25, Tennessee-born school teacher.
Per the Record of Proceedings of the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University (1931), William James Flournoy Meredith, B.A. Fisk University, was conferred a Master of Arts degree in 1930.
Abstracts of Theses Presented by Candidates for Masters Degrees in the August Convocation (1930).
Meredith seems to have left Wilson shortly after receiving his master’s degree. By the end of 1932, he was well ensconced at Southern University and an active member of the Baton Rouge Fisk Alumni Club.
Pittsburgh Courier, 24 December 1932.
In the mid-1930s, he helped charter the New Orleans alumni chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity:
“In an oak lined area of the Crescent City known as Gentilly, the six Georgian styled buildings of Dillard University would be the incubus for the New Orleans Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., the first graduate chapter of the Fraternity in the State of Louisiana. From 1934 to 1936, Dr. Horace Mann Bond served as Dean of the University at Dillard until the first president was agreed upon and appointed later in 1936. Dean Bond lived on the campus of Dillard and his home served as the initial meeting place for the Chapter.
“The New Orleans Alumni Chapter charter members and officers were: Polemarch Dr. August C. Terrance, a physician and resident of the French Settlement of Opelousas and in the City of New Orleans; Vice Polemarch Dr. Hiram P. Wheeler (Beta, 2/1/1915), a prominent dentist in the Crescent City; Keeper of Records Dr. Leo Stanley Butler, a well established physician in the Capitol City of Baton Rouge; Keeper of Exchequer Dr. William W. Stewart, Principal of the Southern University Training School and Director of Practice Teaching at the University; Strategus Joseph Adkins (Alpha Pi, 3/26/1934), a student in his last year at Dillard; Dr. Horace Mann Bond (Epsilon, 10/9/1920), Dean of Dillard University; Herbert C. Blanks, D.D.S. (Kappa, 4/6/1923), another prominent dentist in New Orleans; W.J.F. “Czar” Meredith, journalist and Southern University History Professor; Dr. Leonard G. Israel, pharmacist and owner of one of the most modern drug stores in Baton Rouge; and Otha Lee Gains (Alpha Pi, 3/26/1934), and, a recent graduate of Dillard University.”
In the 1940 census of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana: at Southern University, Tennessee-born teacher William J.F. Meredith, 38, was a lodger in the household of Robert L. and Camille S. Shade, a teacher and librarian at the college.
Pittsburgh Courier, 23 May 1942.
During World War II, Meredith, who attained the rank of sergeant in the U.S. Army, was stationed at Fort Lawson, Seattle, Washington. He remained in Seattle the remainder of his life.
Per chapter history William Meredith was instrumental in the founding and development of University of Washington’s chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi:
“Prior to 1938, it is very likely that numerous Kappa men visited or passed through Seattle. However, it was not until September of 1938, that the first Kappa Brother – Brother Sterling Dover – permanently settled in the Seattle community. Two years later, two newcomers, Brothers Charles Stokes and Tom Woods, joined Brother Dover in Seattle. World War II brought several more Kappa men to Seattle. They were Brothers Robert Addison (a defense worker’s housing manager), and William J.F. Meredith (a Fort Lawton P/X manager).
“These five men met on Sunday at the Phillis Wheatley House to “explore” the possibility of establishing a Chapter in Seattle. Lacking the necessary quorum for establishing a new fraternity chapter, their ideas were placed on “hold.” The end of the War changed the situation, when many young veterans began entering the area’s institutions of higher learning by way of the G.I. “bills.” The ground was fertile for Kappa Alpha Psi’s seed. Brother Meredith’s maturity during this period was invaluable. As a former faculty member of Southern University, he had earned the affectionate and respectful nickname “Czar.” Brother Meredith was blessed with the ability to achieve a firm, but sympathetic, rapport with his students and young people in general.
“Brother Addison, likewise, was a strong factor at this stage. He counseled and encouraged two young ex-service men — Leslie Stallworth and Jacques Chappel — to seek out interested men among the University of Washington student body. The energy and persuasiveness of these two young men resulted in a phenomenal success. As a result of their efforts, approximately twenty other young men expressed an interest in Kappa Alpha Psi. At last, Brother Addison’s role as liaison between the Seattle area and the Grand Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi would bear fruit. On May 22, 1948, with the five previously named alumni Brothers serving as the initiation members, the GAMMA ETA Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. become a reality! Brother Jacques Chappel was elected to be the first Polemarch of the Chapter. Brother Dover was entrusted with the task of formulating the first set of by-laws to guide the new Chapter.”
In 1960, W.J.F. Meredith was listed as “foster son” in the obituary of Violet Lynch of Nashville. As Meredith’s mother lived until he reached adulthood, it is not clear what his relationship was to Lynch.
Nashville Tennessean, 15 January 1960.
“In February of 1968, Kappa Alpha Psi suffered a great loss in the death of its beloved Brother William “Czar” Meredith. He willed his home located at 516 – 22nd Ave. East, to the Fraternity. In his memory, the house is now named the William “Czar” Meredith Memorial Kappa House.” In this Youtube video, Clayton Pitre Sr. reflects on Meredith’s influence and legacy among Seattle Kappas. At one point, he mentions that Meredith taught school in North Carolina (presumably a reference to his time in Wilson) and was inspired to pledge Kappa by a fraternity member he met there.10 of the Fastest Promotions in Geekdom Power Grid By The Mary Sue StaffOct 4th, 2011, 12:32 pm. Allow Us To Explain." Laura Roslin INADVERTENT BATTLESTAR GALACTICA SPOILERS, because every time we talk about the series, it’s a spoiler. Laura Roslin was actually one of the inspirations behind this Grid, and it’s easy to see why; she’s a classic example of getting a position you didn’t necessarily want and never thought you would get because an unforeseen catastrophe killed off everyone in line before you. (Succession by assassination or genocide is a big theme here.) The armada of highly evolved cybernetic beings the Twelve Colonies have been at war with, who have been absent these past 40 years? Surprise! They’ve come back and killed off billions...including everyone in the Colonial government who ranked before the Secretary of Education. And that is... you. Congratulations, you’re now responsible for the fleeing, fledgling remains of the human race. Now that’s a promotion no one wants. Given one of the biggest stockpiles of lemons we can think of, Roslin makes some decent space-lemonade. It may be hard to forget, given all the crap that rained down throughout the series, but here was a mostly-unprepared low Cabinet member who was suddenly handed enormous responsibility, and some hard choices, very fast. In the miniseries alone, Roslin and Commander Adama have to choose to leave behind a score of ships packed with people, nearly half of what the infamous Fleet ends up being, because they don’t have sub-light drives. It’s not the last heart-breaking choice Roslin makes in the series, all to protect the greater good. Did we mention that, the day of the attack on the Colonies, Roslin learns she has a life-threatening cancer diagnosis? A smaller plot point that fans out later, to be sure, but the weight of such information cannot be discounted when considering Roslin’s character. Here is a steely, strong, and absolutely flawed character (a human being, if you will), who is determined to persist, no matter what. She’s not always right. She’s not always sure. But she transforms into a leader who will come after you down to her eyeteeth if it means humanity survives to fly another day. Just look at the way she watches that dry-erase board count of every living soul, and how her face lights up when she, just once, gets to add a number instead of subtracting one. She may not have asked to be a President, or a prophet (it’s hard to explain, just...watch the series), but she does her best to stand against the crapstorm flying at her, and that deserves some recognition. Aang I know what you're saying: Hey! Aang was destined to be the Avatar. You can hardly call that kind of thing fast. Our point here is not only that the promotion seemed fast to Aang, but that his perception of its swiftness actually created the plot of the entire series. See, Avatars are not normally told they are the Avatar until they turn sixteen, when they're old enough to come to terms with the immense responsibility, but still young enough assimilate it and be trained in their non-native bending disciplines before they reach adulthood. Aang was told when he was about twelve that he was the famed Avatar, and that he would have to begin training immediately if he was to evade the clutches of the militaristic Fire Nation, rumored to invade the Air temples any day now. Not only would it be his job to stop a war, subdue a nation, bring balance to the world, and be the link between reality and the Spirit World; Aang was to be immediately to be separated from Monk Gyatso, the only family he'd ever really known. And so Aang ran away. The very night after he was told that he was the fabled Avatar, he rode out into a terrible storm. Probably, if not for the storm, Aang would have eventually been found by other airbenders and Gyatso, and counseled back into his rightful role. Perhaps, given his strong reaction to their imminent separation, the other monks would have allowed Gyatso to continue his training, despite a teaching style they saw as being dangerously relaxed, given the gravity of Aang's destiny. But there was a storm. And Aang got lost. The mortal danger activated his Avatar State, and he and his faithful bison Appa became trapped in polar ice, preserved, un-aging, for a century. In his absence, the Fire Nation wiped out the Air Nomads, captured and killed virtually every Waterbender on the south pole, and conquered a significant portion of the Earth Kingdom. Without this severe change of setting, we wouldn't have the Avatar: The Last Airbender that we know today. Aang might even have actually been killed during the Firebender assault on the Air Nomads, not just presumed to have been killed, what with the Fire Nation empowered by Sozin's comet. The shock of Aang's promotion, even if predestined, is the genesis of the entire series. Captain Kirk (in Star Trek 2009) Talk about assuming the position. Look, we’re all for plot expediency. Given the source material of J.J. Abrams’ surprisingly decent 2009 Star Trek AU...I mean, reboot, it’s a given that the young characters we see are all going to take up their usual spots at the consoles sooner or later. We viewers - Trekkies and non - wouldn’t have it any other way. However, what seems like forgone audience conclusion rapidly turns into farce, as every single main character gets promoted to their classic rank in the space of a few hours in Trek time, and about 15 minutes of screentime. The most stunning is James Kirk’s turnaround from not officially being allowed onto the Enterprise in the first place, to his startling promotion to First Officer by a rapidly exiting acting Captain Pike, and, finally, his assuming command after ousting an emotionally compromised Spock. Uhura, meanwhile, relieves a guy who can’t tell the difference between Romulan and Vulcan language, a talent we assume should have been a requirement for a Starfleet communications officer in the first place. Bones makes Chief Medical Officer when the guy outranking him bites it in a classic deck breach during the ship’s first bit of action, while Scotty is “discovered” by Kirk during his involuntary stay on icy Delta Vega, in what is perhaps the briefest exile in the history of science fiction, and seems to get his job simply by showing up and being more competent than everyone else. Sulu is a last-minute replacement for a helmsman who’s contracted lungworm, while seventeen-year-old prodigy Chekhov actually leaps from his ensign post at one point and runs through the ship to do someone else’s job better than them. All of the level-ups are certainly presented in a coincidental, and, dare we say it, logical form. But the sheer amount of this sort of thing happening in such a short space begs questions about Starfleet emergency procedure. Though they’re galactic peacekeepers with a Prime Directive, they do operate as a pseudo-military organization, with all the rank, rules, and protocol that implies. Is recruitment really leaving Starfleet that shortstaffed? Surely this amount of change-up, even in a total planet-consuming crisis, is enough to make an Internal Affairs officer curious. It doesn’t seem the case, though, as everyone retains the positions they gained suddenly once the danger is well and past. Having proven themselves just the once in a series of highly unlikely events, not a single objection is raised against this very young and widely inexperienced crew helming a brand-new (if slightly battered) starship. Perhaps, just like us, Starfleet is willing to suspend disbelief on account of these guys being, you know, protagonists. Captain America/Steve Rogers (In The First Avenger) Steve Rogers, when he finally does get to enlist in the Army, is a PFC -- Private First Class. A grunt. NBD, as the kids would say today. Then, he goes through the transformative process that turns him into...well, still a PFC, but this time, a buffer, taller, stronger one with superhuman powers. Does he have better abilities to fight bad guys? Definitely. In fact, right out of the gate, he's chasing Dr. Erskine's assassin through the streets of New York. (Of course, that guy kills himself, but he had to run like heck first.) But now that Erskine is dead, Steve isn't the first in an army... he's invaluable evidence of Erskine's apparently unrecoverable formula. Too valuable to be a soldier on the front lines, and so the Army still does not promote PFC Rogers, instead making him join the USO to entertain the troops and sell war bonds using the name Captain America. But he's still technically a private. When he hears that his best friend might be dead, PFC Rogers takes it upon himself to rescue a bunch of prisoners of war, pretty much by himself. And in costume as Captain America. This kind of thing would get a PFC into some kind of trouble -- except that it totally worked, and hundreds of POWs were freed. And now suddenly people are calling him "Captain" like he's an actual Captain? Okay, the saving of POWs is nothing to sneeze at, for sure. But Peggy Carter lampshades this just before he jets off to be heroic by mentioning that she could just order him not to, she outranks him. Steve quips: No you don't. I'm a captain! But is it okay that Captain America is an actual Captain in the Army because of a stage name? Probably, at some point, someone pointed out that saying an army rank over and over does not necessarily make it so. Again, we are not knocking Cap's rescue missions or undermining his obvious victories. He's freaking awesome, we love Cap. How could you say no to this face. Margaret Valentine Y: The Last Man, Brian K. Vaughan's 2002 epic, is set in a world where every male mammal on the planet has, recently and simultaneously, died a bloody death of unknown cause. Except, that is, for Yorick Brown and his helper-monkey-in-training Ampersand. And like any good disaster movie, someone that you never expected to be president is president. The old joke that there's only a black president in disaster movies meets its sister trope here: if the disaster has already happened, one way we know it's really bad is that the line of succession has fallen so far that a woman is president. On a show like Battlestar Galactica, this kind of female president allows writers to give a female character one of the most powerful positions in government, while presenting a setting with ideas about gender roles that are still somewhat aligned with our own (though BSG was still a very gender progressive show). In Y: The Last Man it's more of a necessity of the setting, though Vaughan still manages to wring some interesting stuff out of it, for example, adherence to realism. The structure of gender divides across society in Y: The Last Man were made as true to the time as possible (barring names). Israel and Australia, for example, are among the few countries who still have functioning armed forces. Commercial airplane pilots and tractor-trailer drivers are few and far between. In 2002, in the real world of the Bush cabinet, the first three women in the line of Presidential Succession were the Secretaries of Agriculture, Labor and the Interior. The same was true for Y: the Last Man. Since every man in the line of succession was dead, it fell first to the Secretary of the Interior, who was killed in a plane crash (both pilots were male) and Margaret Valentine, the Secretary of Agriculture. Nevertheless, Valentine succeeds in gaining reelection in 2004, though she credits it to being the only woman alive who is still actually famous. Commissioner Gordon I don’t really know anyone who doesn’t like James Gordon. I’d wager a guess that most of the world knows him as Commissioner Gordon thanks to his appearances not just in DC Comics but the 1960s Batman television show but the several films and animated series and features that followed. But we're not here to talk about comic James Gordon, cartoon James Gordon, or TV show James Gordon. We're here to talk about Nolanverse James Gordon (who we would say probably has the worst time of all the Gordons... except for comic James Gordon going through an awful divorce, the Joker paralyzing his daughter and murdering his second wife, getting shot five times in the back, and then his son turning out to be a serial killer. Yeaaaah...). So, Nolanverse James Gordon. Already the straightest cop in a superlatively corrupt police force (at least he's not getting hazed with a baseball bat for it, like comic Gordon), he finds himself promoted to Captain after performing well during the events of Batman Begins. Presumably this is a universe where cops are rewarded for driving tanks, blowing up mass transit systems, and getting in touch with mysterious vigilantes... Actually, on second thought it's probably for his exemplary bravery and coolness under fire during the destruction of Arkham Asylum and the flooding of the Narrows with weaponized hallucinogen. Or... maybe because he, Rachel Dawes, and Batman were the only people in the city who had been inoculated against the chemical, but his superiors didn't need to know that, or where he got the inoculation from. But Lieutenant to Captain is only a jump of one rank. Lets talk about Captain to Commissioner, which bypasses a couple deputy positions, commander, and major. Gordon gets promoted for certainly the most terrifying of reasons: everybody else is dead. The Commissioner is dead. A prominent Judge is dead. Shortly after Gordon is promoted for capturing their killer, the killer (the Joker) murders one and a half of the city's top district attorneys, from his cell and then escapes. Talk about a job nobody wants, but ultimately Gordon remains a man of honor, who knows exactly what's best for Gotham City, which isn't necessarily the truth. Habib Ben Hassan Technically, every Doctor (of the now defunct Wildstorm continuity, not any of the other guys who are just "The Doctor") has his promotion thrust upon him unexpectedly. Each Doctor is actually the planet Earth's shaman, an unbroken line of men reaching back to prehistory and apparently containing such historical figures as Einstein, Rasputin and Jesus. Each one inherits the collective knowledge of all the shamans that came before him and the ability to mold reality to his will. Jeroen Thornedike, the first Doctor to win acclaim as a member of the Authority, Wildstorm's Justice League, used his abilities to, among other things, turn opponents into trees, to turn their bones into Chanel No. 5, and to teleport an ally into a dimension where all kinetic energy is immediately converted to music so that he wouldn't smash into an indestructible wall. But Jeroen was eventually killed, and when the powers of the Doctor found a new host, he was in a situation where he was possibly least capable of rationally assimilating the data dump of all every shaman's memories. Habib ben Hassan, a young man and Palestinian native, was just about to blow himself up in the middle of a crowded Israeli checkpoint when Jeroen died and left him a serious inheritance. Moved to tears by his sudden understanding, Habib fell to his knees, exposing the explosive strapped around his chest. But as soldiers began to fire, he instinctively turned their bullets into purple smoke and fled... by flying. Two days later, when was captured by the same folks who'd murdered Jeroen in the first place, he'd almost crafted a lasting peace in the Middle East. Jake Sully Not only does Jake Sully get promoted in human form, he gets a pretty steep promotion in his Avatar form as well. And both times, he had no business being there in the first place. First, Sully was your basic military veteran whose service had been cut short by injury -- he was paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair. He also happened to have an identical twin who was a genius... and murdered. So, he's tragic, for sure, but still in no way qualified to do what his Ph.D. brother was going to do -- infiltrate an alien race on a faraway planet, become one with them, learn their ways, and make it easier for the other Earthlings to take over the planet after ruining their own. Sully is just around to take orders. However, there are still these xeno-anthropologists with this Na'vi avatar all set up to only interface with his brother's DNA, so suddenly Sully is looking like a pretty decent-slash-only possible option to take his brother's place and navigate this avatar around Pandora. Because, come on, they have the same identical genetic makeup, so maybe there's a little genius hiding in that jarhead brain of his after all! So keep that in mind: If you have an identical twin, and they are a genius, people will assume that you are also a genius. Anyway, Sully is actually not that bad of a choice to take over for his brother because of the whole "moral objection to depleting a peaceful planet of all of its lush resources and spiritual significance to an entire alien race of organic, living beings" thing. He's just taking orders. But as we all know, Sully does learn to appreciate the Na'vi and even ends up in love with one of them and wants to join them. And they totally let him!...Wait, what? The Na'vi knew that there were "sky people" taking the form of their race and learning about them for years -- because Dr. Grace Augustine was doing this waaaaaaay before Jake Sully was around. But did they induct her into the tribe? No, they did not! That's the weirdest thing ever -- a female of the invading race, comes into their community, opens up schools to teach them all English, nurtures the children, outwardly cares for the Na'vi and their culture and planet -- but no promotion?? What does a girl have to do to get a promotion around Pandora? Tame a Toruk? Yeah, probably. And if anyone could have done that, if given the chance, it was Dr. Grace Effing Augustine. Sully did okay though, what with saving Pandora and the Na'vi race, leading the global war against those idiot Earthlings. He also couldn't have gotten the second, more important promotion if not for the first completely undeserved one. So we'll let this one slide. And then try to search the Earth for a possible genius identical twin that we can kill. Ellen Ripley After 57 years of stasis and a not-so-sunny report on her experience on the good ship Nostromo, Ellen Ripley is stripped of her title and her space flight license, as well as her good standing with the colony of the planet that brought us those cuddly, acid-filled aliens, LV-426. But not to fear! Her license, flight status, and LV-426 contract are returned pretty quickly -- on the condition that she go hang out with the face-gnarling, chest-busting aliens again. Naturally, she says, "No thanks, I'll just take my cat and go home." But rather than continue having nightmares, she decides instead to face her fears, thinking that will make them go away (really?), and she soon hops aboard the dropship with a bunch of go-getter marines. This is why it's hard to sometimes sell a sequel -- Ripley agreed to go back and possibly face more battles with the aliens on the same faraway planet where they were picked up the first time? In the name of...a consultancy? That's not to say that this lady can't handle herself, because boy howdy, can she handle herself. When it's Ripley vs. Aliens, Ripley is going to win. And also save terrified, orphaned little girls. And maybe the marines realized that. Or maybe the corporation that sent them all to that godforsaken planet didn't care if they came back alive either way, so Paul Reiser -- Paul Reiser! -- as the corporate weasel (see also: Avatar) just said, "Look, okay, here's your promotion, your fancy contract, and great -- you go face your fears, et cetera, et cetera, and we'll, uh, see you all on the other side. Yup. Bring back space rocks for me!...'K bye." In the end, we know how much bitchy alien ass Ripley kicked and was able to save at least some of the people who came with her. (Well, a couple of people. But not Bill Paxton.) So we're glad she had that reinstatement waved in front of her so she had an excuse to prove how well she can punch an alien in the face while wearing a robot suit, after incinerating every alien egg pod in sight. Anakin Skywalker Here's the premature promotion so quick it brought a mighty republic down with it. In Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Anakin Skywalker, simply a Jedi Knight who already had several years less training then his peers due to entering the order late in life, is promoted to a seat on the Jedi Council by someone who never should have been allowed the power to do so: Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, in secret a Sith Lord. Palpatine's ultimate goal was to keep the young Skywalker near him frequently, the better to pour the seeds of dissent and mistrust of the Jedi into him. It's hard to say how much he knew about how effective the promotion alone was. For Anakin was only allowed a seat on the council, he was not, as was customary, promoted to the rank of Jedi Master, because the mandate for his promotion had come from outside the order. In addition, while Palpatine's words were full of sympathy for his problems no matter their nature, Anakin was struggling mightily against many of the strict mandates of the life of a Jedi, and the perceived insult of denying him the rank of master combined with a request from the council to betray Palpatine's trust should he ever see the Chancellor doing anything Sith-y further alienated him from the Light side of the Force. Anakin's personal commitment to reciprocal loyalty and his hot temper clashed with every person in his life, including his teacher Obi-Wan Kenobi and even his wife, until he wound up attempting to kill both of them. But by the time that came around, Anakin had already been instrumental in Palpatine's ascension from Chancellor of a Republic to living Emperor of a decidedly less democratic galactic government, which gave him another fast promotion that in turn, allowed him to kindly facilitate the fast promotion of others.

Last updated 29/04/2020How Husbands Can Support Their Wife During The Postpartum Period
Welcoming a newborn into the family is an exciting step for any father. But with all the attention turned towards the baby, your wife may be feeling a little neglected or under-appreciated.
The changes after pregnancy and childbirth can be overwhelming. Fulfilling mummy duties while still finding the time to take care of herself might seem impossible.
Your wife will need your help. So roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn.
What’s Going to Happen
Postnatal blues
Your wife may be weak, tired, and even upset. Pregnancy is a long and laborious nine months. Delivery, whether vaginal or cesarean, will have placed strain on your wife’s body.
Due to hormonal changes, many women experience a ‘sad’ or ‘depressed mood’ in the one to two weeks after childbirth. Brace yourself for cries and tears. They may not just be from the baby!
Postnatal blues, also known as ‘Baby Blues’, is common. However, some women may develop Postpartum Depression (PPD). Watch out for red flags. Excessive crying and mood swings lasting for more than two weeks may be a sign of PPD. For more information consult your healthcare provider.
Major shake-ups in her routine
Nap time, feeding time, diaper changes, nursing, pumping schedules!
Especially for a first-time mother, caring for a newborn can be overwhelming. For working women on maternity leave, suddenly being alone at home with a newborn may feel disorienting or isolating.
Did you know? You can take time off work to accompany your wife and newborn. Fathers are entitled to government-paid paternity leave for all births if you fulfil the eligibility criteria:
- Your baby is a Singapore citizen
- You’re lawfully-married to your baby’s mother between conception and birth
- You’ve been with your employer for a continuous period of at least three months before the birth of your baby.
Whether you’re working or staying home, both your wife and yourself should expect sleepless nights. Most babies don’t start sleeping through the night until they are about three months old. Unlike adults, babies spend less time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and have short sleep cycles.
The confinement period
With all these changes, the four to six week period right after childbirth is especially important for both mummy and baby.
Confinement is a crucial phase for your wife’s body to recuperate, repair, and restore its natural reserves. In some traditions, the confinement period can last for up to three months after childbirth.
In Western cultures, the confinement period is referred to as ‘lying-in’ as it requires a long period of bedrest during and after pregnancy even if there were no medical complications during childbirth.
In Asian cultures, emphasis is placed on diet. As a general rule of thumb, traditional Chinese, Malay and Indian confinement practices emphasise the consumption of ‘warming’ foods and beverages.
What You Should Avoid
Acting like nothing has changed
Welcoming a newborn into the family is a massive change. Especially for first-time parents. So that’s rule number one, don’t act as though nothing has changed. Simple right?
Postpone your boys nights to clubs or pubs. Forget about late-nights watching EPL or UFC matches live. Parenthood isn’t just a mother’s duty, but yours too. Be there as much as you can. Remember your priorities.
Trying to ‘fix’ your wife
Don’t be solution-focused or try to ‘fix’ her. Birth brings about many changes to a mother, but in no way should you treat her as though anything needs to be ‘fixed’. Instead, focus on helping her recover healthy and supporting her throughout.
What You Can Do
Throw Her A Baby Shower
Baby showers are not limited to the pregnancy period. In several Asian cultures, it is customary to have ‘Full Month’ or ‘Whole Month’(满月 mǎn yuè) celebrations, the first month of your newborn’s life.
Another milestone that has become popular among young Singaporean parents is their baby’s 100 Day birthday. Having a 100 Day instead of a Full Month celebration gives you more time to prepare and more time for your wife to recover.
As Dr Christopher Ng, gynaecology specialist at GynaeMD Clinic, points out, new mums may face issues such as breast engorgement, pain from a C-section wound, urinary incontinence and haemorrhoids. It may take eight weeks or more for your wife to feel fully herself again.
Whether your family prefers an elaborate themed party or intimate gathering over a meal, it might be best to wait until your wife has recovered and is ready. Plan surprise parties at your own risk!
Engage A Confinement Caterer
Eating right is crucial for a smooth confinement period. Consuming the right herbs, soups and teas will make a difference in your wife’s postpartum recovery. What’s more, the right type of diet evolves during the different stages of confinement.
In traditional Chinese practices, it is believed that consuming Sheng Hua Tonics is crucial during the initial stage of confinement to dispel wind and discharge lochia and placental fragments from the womb effectively.
Can’t cook and don’t have time to research recipes? Confinement catering services are available.
Postpartum meal services are usually priced as single-meal (lunch or dinner) or dual-meal (lunch and dinner) packages lasting from one week to twenty-eight days.
Pamper Her
Lactation cookies, postnatal massages, mummy-and-baby photoshoots...there are plenty of ways you can pamper your wife post-pregnancy.
If your wife has a sweet tooth, consider ordering lactation bakes for her. These treats are gaining popularity among breastfeeding mums. Some women even report an increase of up to 50% after consuming lactation cookies.
Be Patient With Parenthood
Parenthood is a team effort all the way. With your wife having to focus on taking care of her child as well as her own recovery, there’s only so much she can handle. So ease the load for her, find places to help wherever you can! Clean up the house, take-over on baby duty, and (most importantly) get her food.
Be patient. Parenthood is as new to her as it is to you, and mothers often worry if they’re doing things right. Reassure her when she needs it, and acknowledge her efforts, it’ll make all the difference.Three Countries Estate, Benoni, Gauteng

Fake Job Offers
If you are ever contacted with a Canadian job offer, you should make sure that it is legitimate before taking any action. Lawyers and immigration consultants cannot send you a job offer for immigration purposes or guarantee you immigration status. Similarly, law firms cannot act as job soliciting partners for employers or recruitment agencies. You will never receive a legitimate job offer from a law firm and should immediately report any party that claims to either: (a) be a law firm offering you a job offer for immigration purposes; or (b) be an employer or recruiter that is working in partnership with a law firm.
Real employers will first contact you for an interview and discuss a potential job offer with you before sending any documents. If anyone contacts you and asks for payment or an administrative fee in exchange for a job offer then you should report them. Employers will not do this and you should not be required to make any payment to secure a job offer.
Valid job offers should list the name of the employer or recruitment agency and will not list the name of a law firm or government agency. When you receive a job offer from an employer, take the time to review it carefully to make sure that it is legitimate. Below, you will find an example of a fraudulent job offer.
Here is an example of a fake job offer created by a fraudster using our firm’s name – this fraud has been reported to the authorities:
Promises of Guaranteed Application Approvals
Ads or offers that promise you a job or guaranteed entry to Canada are false. Plain and simple. Any Canadian employer, lawyer or other legal representatives who offer you guaranteed entry to Canada, a job offer or expedited processing in exchange for a fee is acting fraudulently. Do not engage with or pay these individuals.
You do not need a legal representative to apply for Canadian immigration status or obtain a Canadian job offer. Legal representatives can help you prepare a strong application and increase your chance of success based on their experience, but they cannot guarantee you a visa or that your application will be processed more quickly than anyone else’s. No representative or third party can negotiate special treatment for you with the government.
Choosing a Legal Representative
It is important to understand who is legally able to help you with an immigration application and give you advice. Only lawyers or paralegals in good standing with a Canadian law society, immigration consultants who are members in good standing with the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council or notaries who are in good standing with the Chambre des notaires du Québec are legally allowed to charge a fee for immigration advice and assistance.
You can easily make sure that your representative is authorized by asking them if they are a member of any of the above organizations and then calling that organization or doing a quick online search to make sure the individual is who they say they are.
Making False Statements or Submitting Fraudulent Documents
There are serious consequences for providing false documents and information to Canadian immigration authorities. It is important to steer clear of fraudsters because you could also be penalized for being involved.
Penalties include being banned from entering Canada, being recorded in the government’s database, having any existing Canadian status revoked, being removed from Canada and being charged with a federal crime.
How to Report Immigration Fraud
If you suspect that you are in contact with a fraudulent individual or company, do not engage with them or give them any personal information. You should immediately report the activity to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) by calling the Border Watch Tip Line (Toll-Free): 1-888-502-9060. All information you provide will be kept confidential.Exit to the corporate 4life.com?

- Component changed from Comments to REST API
- Milestone changed from Awaiting Review to 4.7
We currently only enforce 6 character email addresses in
wp_handle_comment_submission() and the XML-RPC method
wp_newComment()IF the
require_name_email option is set to
true.
If no 3 character email address could be encountered in the wild, shouldn't we update the
is_email() function and properly validate email address in other locations within core, like for user accounts? That just seems to make more sense to me than adding another special validation on top of
is_email(), but I am interested in your thoughts @dd32

Sorry, I missed these pings previously.
I'm all for standardising on
is_email(). I personally don't see any (practical) point in treating an email < 6 char as valid, so it makes sense to me for us to add that to the
is_email() checks.
I understand the other side of it though, it could potentially be a valid email address, we're just refusing to honor that as an valid email address for comments - which is why it shouldn't be in
is_email() but should be within the comment handlers.
At the end of the day though, discussion for keeping it, discarding it, adding it to
is_email() is not worth our time, as it's all theoretical, and whomever wants to patch should decide what the most logical option is.

Added a patch to test for this specifically in the REST API, along with a test. While I do think this belongs in
is_email(), I'm also wary of changing that while we're in beta, and I'd rather the API have the stronger validation for now.
We can revisit changing
is_email() in 4.8, I think.

Rachel is not around; over to Dion for review.
This dates back to [2558] (6 char) and [2556] (7char).
Technically
a@b.cis a legitimate email address, however realistically, it's not and will never be encountered in the wild. All ccTLDs are 2+ characters and 3+ characters for gTLDs.
Single-character gTLDs are supposed to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in non-ascii scripts, but there's said to be very little reasoning on why one would be approved (and to date, as far as I can see no-one has put a request in).
Specifications aside, I see no harm in enforcing that the minimum length is 6 characters -
a@b.cd- as that's the shortest possible valid email address available in the foreseeable future, in the event a single-digit-ascii (and not UTF8 IDN TLD) is approved we'll have quite some time to update to support it.By Ilya Yablokov
The idea to write a book on RT (Russia Today as the channel was called before 2010) came in 2013 when the channel was growing as an international broadcaster interested in fringe opinions and alternative facts. This was before the catch phrase ‘fake news’ was added to the daily vocabulary of both average news consumers and academics. A decade ago, RT pioneered the usage of controversial opinions (packaged as the manifestation of the freedom of speech), alternative facts, conspiracy theories and unverified claims as part of the news agenda to damage political opponents of the Kremlin on both sides of the Atlantic ocean. The reason to choose to circulate conspiracy theories is not surprising: they help undermine the legitimacy of political and social actors and spread rapidly thanks to global communications, thus affecting and shaping opinions and biases of millions of people around the world. In this way, RT represents an excellent case for the investigation of how global communication technologies influence the development and dissemination of conspiracy theories and what it means for conflict resolution when information can’t be kept within state borders or linguistic limitations.
RT’s evolution began with a regional conflict in Georgia in 2008. The channel was launched in 2005 as a traditional soft power tool to promote Russian culture and showed its inability to defend Russia’s geopolitical interests during a conflict where pro-Russian forces annexed two Georgian regions: South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Most of the global TV channels covered this conflict from the Georgian perspective calling the Russian military forces ‘the occupants’. The Kremlin lost the global battle of words and changed the approach. Instead, the channel was rebranded as RT and started an aggressive campaign of criticism of big business, governments, global media holdings and US military expansionism.
When watching RT an attentive viewer first pays attention to a recurrence of populist utterances. This is politically beneficial: the purpose of RT is to pre-curate favourable opinions into the news agenda whilst keeping itself distant from what the guests say. These guests can be affiliated journalists, no-name bloggers or retired intelligence officers. RT says that its mission is to provide a forum to a multitude of voices – some of which are often ignored by ‘mainstream media’. By posing as an alternative to the ‘mainstream media’, RT not only brands itself to attract potential viewers and followers of such content, it also seeks to show that the ethos of traditional media is obsolete and the road is open for all sorts of non-conventional approaches to news and current affairs.
RT’s staff is tech-savvy when it comes to airing unverified claims, especially when the country where RT broadcasts has legislative limitations for unverified news. During the Skripal affair in 2018, when a former Russian double agent and his daughter were poisoned by a bioweapon, RT was desperate to find the holes in the narrative developed by the British government and intelligence all by simultaneously avoiding a breach of Ofcom regulations and risking the loss of its broadcasting license. RT’s staff covered multiple conspiracy theories accusing the UK government, investigative journalists, the military and scientists via talk shows, op-ed pieces and news reports. Most of these stories were mutually conflicting, but the goal was, as we show in the book, to chip away at the credibility of the official accounts that had been released to the public about the poisonings. When it was difficult to find the solo, convincing voice to spread favourable views on the Skripal poisoning, RT used social media posts to create content for their news stories and attracted a disproportionate amount of airing time for these stories. RT also used low access to public information about the investigation to cast a doubt on the UK government’s actions and shared conspiratorial tweets by Russian officials to provide weight to the questionable allegations against the UK officials’ line.
Usually, an uninformed viewer will not notice that RT is a Russian-funded television channel. RT as a brand is slick enough to have plenty of attention on any continent. And indeed, RT engages in the aggressive pro-Russian news making only when the Kremlin’s reputation is at stake. But in fact, as we show in our study, RT is a product of, and a savvy player in, a broader global media environment. This context for RT’s evolution is vital as in today’s world communication is not a one-way process. On the contrary, news coverage is a product of the interactions of journalists, host platforms and audiences with that content. All of these elements contribute to the ways in which populist messages are constructed and developed. Together, they work to give conspiratorial online content a comparative circulatory advantage. Positioning itself as an outside voice, RT chose conspiracy theories as its key content. They have become, in a way, a part of RT’s identity.
Conspiracy theories help discussing the complicated reality around us, the world that lacks transparency and is full of inequality and injustice. At times, as Peter Knight notes, conspiracy theories can be onto something, but 9 out of 10 times conspiracy theory will be very far from how things really developed. For RT presenters and guests conspiracy theorizing is the chance to show themselves as champions of freedom of speech. Hence, the motto: ‘You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but I do my own research and just ask questions!’ is an opening for an unrestrained speech and gives the floor to further, even more bizarre speculations that spread via the variety of media platforms available.
RT’s management is happy when there is a chance to air such theories and muddy the waters of serious discussions. At the start of the global pandemic in March 2020, while many US media were broadcasting cautious messages about self-isolation and social distancing, RT’s hosts were actively spreading false narratives about the tiny danger that COVID-19 presents for humans. They laughed at the ‘mainstream media’ and called the pandemic the type of stories that the media love. Within a couple of weeks, as countries were closing borders around the world, including Russia, the hosts changed their approach and called for social distancing in their programmes. Nevertheless, the op-ed section of RT’s website still accumulates hundreds of pieces written by covid-dissidents that consider the disease and the vaccination programme the ‘health pass tyranny’ of the globalist government.
Perhaps, the biggest question for policy makers and experts is: what can be done with the conspiratorial narratives pushed by RT that decrease public safety and trust in expert knowledge? First, RT might be a pioneer of some broadcasting tactics but it is not unique: legislative measures on reporting falsehoods seem to be effective. These measures should be applied consistently and treat every media equally. The market incentives for clickable content mean that policy responses must be addressed at the whole (multiplatform) environment, rather than focussed on one actor within it. Such regulations must encompass statutory duties of broadcast media and social media platforms, a clarification of the responsibilities of content producers versus hosts, and cross-sector collaboration, plus transnational intergovernmental coordination of penalties for non-compliance.
Second, most of the conspiracy theories spread online and offline because people tend to overestimate their critical thinking abilities. A variety of media literacy programmes should target different social and age groups to foster understanding of the complexity of the digital and global communication environment.
Third, media like RT benefit from the conflicts within society – corruption, infringements committed by political elites, lack of political transparency and socio-economic polarization – and here lies the hardest part. Conspiracy theories will arise inevitably as part of the socio-economic context in every society, and there will always be the media who will try to promote such views for their own benefit. It is vital to focus on the necessary long-term goal to safeguard political and media institutions and protect citizens’ capacity to productively engage with them.This past Wednesday, June 30th, some hell broke loose at Our Island's Capitol Building, where the heavy-handed illegal banning of the press from the Constitutionally-mandated open proceedings in the senate (product of the feeble lizard brain of Thomas "Mad Führer" Rivera) had led to protesters gathering and attempting to enter the public space Our tax monies and votes allow. The police and security guards responded with tear gas, pepper spray and multiple beatings of unarmed citizens, including a mother-daughter pair that suffered notable injuries.
The bruiser tactics led to property damage, including police and press vehicles and widespread condemnation of the events by many, including the ACLU, Amnesty International, the local Press Associations and the enlightened citizenry of My Island. (The rest are...confused. I'm being polite.) In an attempt to harness the indignation that naturally arises from a situation like this, some "organizers" decided to hold a meeting at the Puerto Rico Bar Association's facilities.
A...closed...meeting.
That notion didn't last long, as many lawyer's notions do, and the meeting went "open," until the "organizers" stated that they were in the process of "organizing" a "massive" protest against the (non)government's abusive and ill-conceived (I'm being polite) policies and actions. And to strike while the iron was hot, to hammer home the points raised by the events of June 30th, spread around the world in hours, they decided to hold the protest...July 18th.
Really? Really?
To the imbeciles (I'm being polite) who came up with this crapfest of an idea for a protest, here's two points you might want to consider:
1) The (non)government is a pro-statehood party.
2) July 4th, the BIG statehood shindig political date on Our calendar is only TWO FUCKING DAYS from now.
Do you imbeciles need Me to connect the dots? Okay: Use the momentum and anger generated two days ago to totally screw up the huge Public Relations sewage the party you want to slap down is holding two days from now.
July 18th?! Really? On an Island that by next Tuesday will have some other, very unworthy social or political scandal to distract its hyper-ADD nature? When by the middle of next week Our feeble collective will, as solid and powerful against the waves of inertia as wet toilet paper, will have dissipated like a fart in a gale?
July 18th? Really?
Fucking imbeciles.

we have preemptive strike calls, we are still waiting for the continuation of the Paro Nacional, and we are so pissed off we have to wait until July 18 to act.

We deserve what is happening to us. We are so bureaucratic that even strikes are bureaucratic...
Just like Life of Brian. The people's front of judea despise the judean people's front.
pero, despues de todos somos individuos, nadie tiene que decirnos que hacer...
I loved the "Life of Brian" reference, especially as it pinpoints the "We have met the enemy and it is Us" vibe this whole charade evinces. I insist We implement the "Club a politician once a year, without penalty" law so We can really make a difference in the short term.Agricultural Commissioner Nikki Fried on Wednesday sent an email through her political committee, Florida Consumers First, asking donors to help her “push for cannabis legalization.”
“Please help me with a donation today so that I can continue to push for cannabis legalization to protect those targeted by prohibitive laws, to increase access to medical marijuana, and to grow a consumer-friendly hemp industry in our state,” Fried wrote in the email titled “Making marijuana legal.”
The fundraising email notes Congress’s approval of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act earlier this month. The Act, which is expected to die in the GOP-controlled Senate, would decriminalize cannabis at the federal level. It would also expunge lower-level federal marijuana offenses and create a 5% excise tax to support businesses and individuals “impacted by the war on drugs.”
The Democratic-controlled House overwhelmingly passed the measure with a 228 – 164 vote.
“This historic vote marks the monumental progress our country has made to address the racial injustices of prohibition,” Fried wrote. “Lawmakers are recognizing the urgent need to end misguided federal cannabis laws, to begin to right the wrongs of the war on drugs and its damage to communities of color.”
Fried, who is Florida’s top-elected Democrat and a possible 2022 gubernatorial contender, has long championed cannabis in Florida.
The Commissioner’s email comes in wake of a 2020 election that suggested Americans broadly accept cannabis throughout the country.
A Gallup Poll published Nov. 9 showed that 68% of Americans are in favor of legalizing cannabis, double the 2003 approval rate.
According to Gallup, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota supported and passed the legal use of recreational cannabis in the Nov. 3 election. Additionally, Mississippi and South Dakota joined 33 states and the District of Columbia in passing laws to legalize or decriminalize medicinal marijuana use.
Florida, notably, could be next on the list to make cannabis available in 2022.
Make it Legal Florida is pushing a constitutional amendment that would make cannabis available to adults for personal use for any reason.
According to the amendment’s summary, it would allow those 21-years-old and older to “possess, use, purchase, display, and transport up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and marijuana accessories.”
Florida law only allows cannabis for medical use.
Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level.

The First Lady, 50, will make a cameo appearance as herself in an upcoming episode of the ABC drama, which will air on May 7 and lead up to the season two finale, reported Ace Showbiz.
The brunette beauty will appear alongside Connie Britton, whose character Rayna James persuades Obama to host a charity concert at Fort Campbell, after it is revealed character Luke Wheeler has been injured in Afghanistan.
The mother of two, who appears to have no problem oozing confidence in front of the cameras, recently admitted she was not against getting Botox done in the future because she believes women should have the power to feel happy in their own skin.
"Right now, I don't imagine that I would go that route, but I've also learned to never say 'never'. Women should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves," she had said.

Although they were the most persistent of the wildlife, they were by no means the only members to make themselves known to the hikers, particularly while on the Eastern Slope of the Rockies.
“Curious Caribou came right up to the tent and moose were encountered daily. Sheep could be seen on the Upper Prophet Area.”
Neither of the men being accustomed to bears, they found the suppertime visit of a rather bold black bear most disconcerting. However, Zerneke managed to have a short chat with (at) him. The daylight was not the only visiting time in the night they were made aware of the presence of some not so amiable hosts by the howling of the wolves.
It was halfway along this first 196 miles that they picked up the supplies flown in by Gary Vince which enabled them to reach Fort Ware. In Fort Ware they restocked needed supplies and visited the camp of two prospectors, one of whom was cutting the leather from the toe of his shoe when they arrived. He told them that his shoe had become too small but his partner later said that “the piece of leather is part of a secret method for finding gold” but he, too, was reluctant to say anymore about the “secret method”.
So the two set off again and after 50 miles of hiking they reached a section of the Finlay River which they decided to cross as the others had before by putting their gear in plastic garbage bags and floating it across while wading through. Mr. Boehler went first holding his hiking boots in his hands. It was soon obvious that they had underestimated the current and the hiking boots were lost. They spent hours looking for them and then decided to go back to Fort Ware and get some more. This was a discouraging episode not only due to the lost boots but also three lost days. Luckily, though, once in Fort Ware they purchased new and found someone to fly them back to where they had left off in order not to spend three more days over the same ground. From here things went on almost without incident until they reached the point where a mining company had promised to drop supplies at Toddoggene area but did not keep its word. This made the men dangerously short of food and forced them to do more than 12 miles of hiking a day and up to 15 hours a day to the next food supply at Hyland Post.
Up until this time the weather had been very good. Each time they saw a storm approaching they’d don their rain gear and each time the storm would veer to one side or the other or even split in the middle and go both ways but always seemed to avoid them. So they figured this time would be no different. Only not only did the storm bite but it was snow! August 16 it was snow! This time morale suffered “when bent over willows and snow depth made moving difficult and clothing and boots were drenched with wetness”.
And so it was with joy and satisfaction that the two Germans arrived at Eddontinagan and the Cassiar-Steward Highway. From here they flew to Terrace where they wandered awestruck through the miles of food in the grocery stores. They arrived in Dawson Creek by bus and visited for 2 days at the home of Dietger Hollmann who, according to Mr. Boehler, was the most instrumental person in making the trip a reality.
LOCAL INVOLVEMENT:
In January of this year [1973], Mrs. Ravelli of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce received a letter and questionnaire from Wolfgang Boehler and Rudi Zerneke asking information about remote areas surrounding Dawson Creek. Luckily for all concerned she referred the letter to the Director of Planning of Peace River Liard District Mr. Dietger Hollmann who took a special interest in the adventure. Mr. Hollmann “advised the two prospective hikers on the best possible routes and with the help of Mr. Field, Manager of B.C. Hydro, suggested the correct equipment to take. While on holiday in Europe, Mr. Hollmann met with Wolfgang Boehler and discussed the district in more detail with the aid of slides.
Before the start of the trip help was sought for the task of flying supplies into specified area for the hikers. Professional guides Gary Vince of Fort St. John and Laurence Parry of Smithers flew supplies into the Upper Muskwa and Hyland areas respectively. Without their help this trip would not have been accomplished.Deb is a mother of six children and a grandmother to 12 soon to be 13 grandchildren.

Chicago-based RMK Management Corp. has announced the completion of the second phase of a four-year renovation of The Churchill, a 360-unit luxury rental community in downtown Minneapolis. This included a complete rehab of all common spaces at the high-rise; the first phase involved upgrading all apartment homes.
Built in 1982, The Churchill was already a Class A rental property but presented an opportunity to elevate the community to the newest standard for luxury living.
“The Churchill has long been a desirable address for renters seeking high-end amenities and a convenient downtown location, but we knew this property could be even more luxurious,” said Anthony Rossi Sr., president of RMK Management Corp. “Through our work in other markets, we had insight into what the newest, ultra-luxury properties in cities like Chicago are offering, and we wanted to bring that to the Minneapolis market.”
Rossi also noted the project’s timing, which coincides with the development of other upscale rental properties in the Minneapolis/St. Paul market.
“Several new luxury rental communities have been built over the past three years, so with this renovation, The Churchill is well-positioned to compete with these newly opened properties,” said Rossi.
The extensive renovation included a complete remodel of the lobby, as well as updates to the cyber café, business center, adding a new movie theater, a demonstration kitchen, game room and lounges on the lower level of the building. On the 33rd floor, RMK is making improvements to the indoor pool, adding a steam room and sauna, and adding outdoor grills and a fire pit to the adjacent rooftop patio.
Other additions made to The Churchill include an expanded fitness center with state-of-the-art equipment, a pet spa and a concierge station that will include an on-site concierge. In addition, RMK added 90 new storage lockers and updated the property’s laundry room to include all-new washer and dryer units that provide text alerts when machines are available and a laundry cycle is complete.
Occupancy at The Churchill has remained near 95 percent throughout the renovations.
“Although the rental market is very strong right now, it’s also highly competitive,” said Rossi. “In order for a 30-year-old property to stay relevant, it needs to offer the same level of finishes, amenities and services to renters who have a growing number of housing options available to them. With this renovation, we have not only met but exceeded the luxury standard set forth by today’s newly constructed rental towers, delivering the best-in-class residential experience for which RMK is known.
In fact, RMK Management was named the 2015 “Management Company of the Year” by the Institute for Real Estate Management.
Located in downtown Minneapolis, The Churchill offers a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 710 to 1,200 square feet, with rents starting at $1,210 per month. All units were updated during the first phase of the renovation.
The community overlooks the Mississippi River and offers direct access to the Minneapolis SkyWay, an indoor pedestrian walkway connecting several miles of downtown Minneapolis. It also offers easy access to public transportation as well as Interstate 394, and is near the Minnesota Twin’s Target Field..Bael juice recipe aka wood apple juice is a healthy drink prepared by extracting the pulp of the bael fruits. It is also considered to be the best summer drink for its amazing cooling properties.
Bael is popularly known as Bengal quince, golden apple, stone apple or wood apple is a summer favorite in India. The tree is considered to be sacred in the Hindu religion and is often found on most of the temples. The plant also holds a great place in the ancient medicinal system.
The fruit has a hard outer layer and the soft, sweet pulp within. The ripe fruits can be eaten after strained the juice and sweetened to make a drink. The fruit has a cooling effect on the stomach and is very good for people suffering from chronic acidity and constipation.
The bael juice recipe can be made with only 3 ingredients. Such as bael fruit, sugar, and water. But here I have added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg powder to get the extra flavor. Which is totally optional. You can even add jaggery and crushed black pepper to this. However, slight variation can be made depending on individual preference. So let’s get into the recipe.

Welcome to Town Centre Private Schools®. Founded in 1986, TCPS® is a unique school offering a Montessori Pre-School program and an Elementary and High School International Baccalaureate® (IB) World School. Students who take the IB Programme excel in university studies and beyond.
It is so gratifying to find an ideology that can take our Montessori foundations and build upon them in both the Elementary and High School Divisions. The IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) and IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) prepare students for the demands of the High School IB Diploma Programme. In grades 11 and 12, TCPS students have the option of completing the regular Ontario Ministry curriculum, taking IB Certificate Courses, or doing the full IB Diploma Programme (DP). In today’s world with rapidly changing parameters, critical thinking along with self-challenging habits are a necessity and TCPS students will be able to rise to the challenges with ease.
Throughout the 2020-2021 school year students from Pre-School to High School have been learning 5 days a week. For TCPS families who prefer to study from home, we offer a Remote Learning program for students in Preparatory (age 4) to grade 12.
It is with great pride that each year we celebrate the graduating class, many of whom we have had the privilege of watching grow up as part of our TCPS family. With learning available either in-class or online, our students are fully prepared for the start of school this September, both with Town Centre and those moving on to university. The class of 2021 has submitted their university applications and are already receiving their acceptance letters. Last year, the graduating class of 2020 earned over $28,000 in university scholarships. As our grade 12 students complete their final term at TCPS, we wish them all the best as they will soon begin the next chapter of their lives.
With detailed safety protocols established, we will again offer a Pre-School Summer Camp and Elementary Summer Camp during July and August. High School students will also be able to earn additional credits with Ministry courses this summer.
We have come a long way from our modest beginnings in 1986. One of the keys to our success has been the dedication of our teaching staff and administration. I would like to acknowledge their hard work and enthusiasm over the years. We have grown over the last 3 decades to become a reputable and respected educational institution and I look forward to our future together.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Marianne Vanderlugt

OLDWICK, N.J., October 28, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of "a" (Excellent) of Brit Reinsurance (Bermuda) Limited (Brit Re) (Bermuda). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.
The ratings reflect Brit Re’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The ratings also benefit from the implicit and explicit support of its intermediate parent, Brit Limited (Brit), and its ultimate parent, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax) [TSX: FFH].
Brit Re, first incorporated in Gibraltar in 2007 and re-domiciled to Bermuda in November 2017, acts primarily as an internal reinsurer for its affiliates, Syndicate 2987 and Brit Underwriting Limited. Recently, Brit Re began writing casualty treaty reinsurance, as well as fronting for its affiliate’s insurance-linked securities platform, Sussex Capital. The company continues to derive most of its premium from a quota share contract with Syndicate 2987.
Brit Re’s very strong balance sheet strength is supported by historically profitable underwriting results and manageable premium growth. Liquidity measures are sound and supported by short-term, liquid holdings, predominantly high quality fixed income securities and cash.
While the company’s risk-adjusted capitalization is maintained consistently at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), the overall balance sheet assessment of very strong also considers Brit Re’s material catastrophe exposure and the limited fungibility of its invested assets. A significant portion of Brit Re’s assets is pledged as collateral for a stop-loss contract written to provide Funds at Lloyd’s (FAL) for Brit. The very strong balance sheet assessment also reflects that capital growth is constrained by occasionally sizable dividend payments made to Brit Re’s publicly traded ultimate parent, Fairfax.
AM Best assesses Brit Re’s operating performance as adequate, largely based on the performance of its all-lines quota share on business written by Brit’s Syndicate 2987, of which Brit Re assumes a 20% share of net premiums written. The syndicate has obtained successive rate improvements over the past few years; however, major catastrophe losses and competition on its commercial (re)insurance have dampened recent results.. In 2020, underwriting results were impacted negatively by pandemic losses and natural catastrophe events, although the company still generated a modest net profit for the year.
AM Best assesses Brit Re’s business profile as limited given the company’s concentrated business production, and the company’s ERM practices as appropriate due to the governance structure in place.
The company benefits from being part of Fairfax, which maintains favorable financial flexibility, a strong liquidity position and a track record of supporting its (re)insurance subsidiaries. Therefore, rating enhancement is provided based on the implicit and explicit support Brit Re receives from its parent, in the form of capital support, business distribution channels and overall operational

The tips come in small, medium, and large, and each tip clicks right into place on the AirPods Pro, making them easy to swap out.

Industry insiders have pointed to brand appeal and marketing challenges in the Canadian market as key reasons beverages haven’t taken off in the country just yet.
Emily Paxhia, co-founder and managing director with well-known cannabis investment fund Poseidon Asset Management, said beverages will be a key part of the industry’s future, particularly when it comes to reaching a new consumer base that may not feel comfortable with smokable or edible products.
However, the US-focused investor was quick to point out that at the moment this category represents an “incredibly tiny” part of the overall cannabis product market.
“I do think we have a ways to go before that is a dominant form factor,” Paxhia told the Investing News Network (INN).
Numbers don’t yet back up cannabis beverage promise
At least for the time being, data shows consumers are still not entirely sold on cannabis beverages. A study conducted by the Dalhousie University Agri-Food Analytics Lab in Halifax found only 4 percent of cannabis consumers in Canada picked drinks as their top choice.
The study was done to determine consumer enthusiasm for edible and other infused products in Canada by evaluating over 1,000 cannabis consumers across the country.
According to the study, Canadian consumers overall seem less interested in the edible and infused category. “Twenty-five per cent of cannabis consumers say they typically prefer edibles, down from 36 per cent in 2019,” Dr. Sylvain Charlebois, senior director at the Dalhousie University Agri-Food Analytics Lab, told 660 News in June 2021.
Similarly, a report by cannabis analytics firm Headset found that in Canada, cannabis beverages have only commanded a market share of 1 to 1.5 percent since January 2020.
When it comes to the percentage of cannabis drinks inside any given purchase, beverages didn’t fare that much better. By the end of summer 2020, a rise had stabilized at 4.5 percent in terms of cannabis transactions containing a cannabis drink.
However, the data is encouraging in showing the incremental growth of new consumers who are willing, little by little, to give cannabis beverages a try.
As part of an annual market evaluation report, the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) revealed sales numbers for cannabis drinks in the province. Beverage sales amounted to C$12.8 million from April 2020 to the end of March 2021, accounting for 1.5 percent of the province’s sales.
Also of note is that the OCS indicated that sales of cannabis drinks were higher at retail stores than through its own online portal.
Looking at what companies came out on top for beverage sales, the OCS pointed to Tweed, the cannabis brand from Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC,TSX:WEED), as the leading drinks brand in the province.
Tied in second and third place were Everie, a brand put forth by Fluent Beverages, a joint venture set up between Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY,TSX:TLRY) and AB InBev (NYSE:BUD), and Houseplant, the Seth Green cannabis brand associated with Canopy Growth.
It’s clear though that the current numbers on beverages in the Canadian market still have some catching up to do with the lofty expectations and excitement from members of the industry.
In 2019, Deloitte estimated cannabis drinks would amount to C$529 million in sales per year for the Canadian market. This projection was part of a total worth of C$2.7 billion for the entire edibles and extracted product category.
As part of the report’s announcement, author Jennifer Lee, a partner at Deloitte and at the time the firm’s cannabis leader for Canada, said cannabis beverages would be so popular that they could threaten the market cap of alcoholic beverages.
The report was prepared in the lead-up to the legalization of the “Cannabis 2.0” product category, meaning edibles and infused items. The federal government elected to delay the legalization of these items until a year after official recreational cannabis legalization.
Pursuit of taste variety to drive future of cannabis drinks
The Valens Company (TSX:VLNS,OTCQX:VLNCF) has two cannabis drinks currently available, and according to an executive, the company is encouraged for what’s to come with this category.
Jeff Fallows, president of Valens, told INN the firm aims to open a beverage facility in Ontario this year.
The executive said he thinks consumers are looking for a better overall experience when it comes to cannabis drinks, particularly in terms of the variety of products.
“I think you’re starting to see some better products on the market now,” said Fallows. “And I also think you’re starting to see better variety, flavors, profiles, types of beverages.”
Fallows said he believes the current consumer base is looking for more potent drinks given their established relationship with cannabis.
“I think that has a lot to do with the profile of the consumer in the market right now — they still are largely the cannabis-friendly type of consumer that is either already or historically has had exposure to cannabis,” he said.
From his perspective, Valens’ technological progress in the beverage-making process will also help broaden the reach of cannabis drinks. As he explained it, better emulsion technology allows for the masking of flavor profiles related to cannabis.
Fallows argued that the taste experience for beverages needs to be refined and more closely aligned with the wide availability of flavors from the general beverage market.
For beverages, “the taste profile impacts the experience more,” he said.
How much are marketing rules affecting cannabis drinks?
Despite the promise of refined beverage products, they are still struggling to find a steady audience. One of the biggest obstacles may be the branding rules still surrounding cannabis in Canada.
Companies continue to lament the Canadian government’s strict decisions on marketing regulations and the way brands are allowed to promote cannabis products in the country.
Last year, a dispensary owner in Toronto penned a letter explaining that retailers feel restricted in how they talk about products to consumers.
“We’re highly regulated, there are a lot of limitations to what we can and cannot do in developing and promoting a brand,” said Leah Thiel, vice president of marketing at Indiva (TSXV:NDVA,OTCQX:NDVAF).
Fallows told INN cannabis beverage makers in Canada can’t guide consumers on how to best integrate these drinks into their lives in the same way the alcohol industry can.
“That’s the advantage that will come when we have more flexibility from a marketing or advertising perspective, because you can help the consumer sort through when and how a cannabis beverage makes sense,” the Valens executive said.
As it stands, Fallows sees the market operating as defined by user experiences based on drink taste and effectiveness. Some of that user experience will be primarily driven by recommendations from budtenders at stores, according to one cannabis beverage maker executive.
“The budtenders are critical,” Marcello Leone, chairman and CEO of BevCanna Enterprises (CSE:BEV,OTCQQ:BVNNF), told INN.
Leone also sees problems with Canadian cannabis promotion regulations, and expressed his frustrations about what he considers challenging conditions for his products.

Rochester, MN (KROC AM News) - The Rochester Police Department has released information about two convicted sex offenders who are scheduled to be released from prison and plan to move to a local halfway house.
Both are scheduled to be released Monday and both are classified Level 3 predatory offenders.
One has been identified as 42-year-old Malik Johnson.
He was sentenced to prison for an incident that occurred in Rochester in 2016 and involved a mentally impaired woman. According to the criminal complaint, the woman had suffered a traumatic brain injury and had the mental capacity of a 6-year-old. Police say the woman was sitting in a vehicle waiting for her mother when Johnson appeared. A witness said Johnson began kissing and fondling the woman. Johnson said the victim had called him to the vehicle and he did not know about her disability. He was given a 5-year prison sentence.
The other man is 37-year-old Joshua Jones.
According to RPD:
“Jones engaged in sexual contact with a known female teenager. Contact included sexual touching and penetration. Force was used.”
Both men have indicated they will move to the county halfway house near the federal prison.

Moreover, doctors of big infirmaries also keep an eye on their peers’ performance.
So far, around 9,000 doctors have gone to small infirmaries to help their peers and transferred 4,689 medical techniques which are performed well by doctors in small clinics.
Additionally, doctors of big hospitals examined and treated around 5 million patients and carried out nearly 2,000 surgeries to save poor patients in small institutions.
After satellite hospitals have been established, doctors of 14 big hospitals have transferred techniques in heart surgeries to their peers in small facilities helping to attract more patients for grass-root clinics. This helps to ease patient overload and reduce much pressure on big hospitals such as Tumor, Trauma and Orthopedic, cardiovascular and Maternity.
Dr. Nguyen Ngoc Duy from the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Health said that doctors of Gia Dinh People Hospital, People’s 115 Hospital, Tu Du Maternity Hospital, Hung Vuong Maternity Hospital, Trauma and Orthopedic Hospital, Children Hospital No.1 and 2 and Tumor Hospital have transferred techniques to their counterparts.
Simultaneously, Thu Duc Hospital provides advice to their peers in the General Hospital in the highland province of Dak Nong.
Big hospitals in HCMC have re-trained 1,450 medical workers and transferred techniques to grass-root facilities in provinces; accordingly, the rate of transferred cases from small hospital to big one in HCMC leaped by 10 percent annually.By Ann Brocklehurst
Originally published Wednesday, April 1, 1992 in the International Herald Tribune
As the costs of unification prove more of a strain on Berlin’s finances than the expense of maintaining a divided city ever did, political and business leaders are counting on a major economic expansion to ease the pressure.
They believe that the German government’s decision to move from Bonn to Berlin will attract business and generate tax revenues in a way that was never possible during the Cold War years. But before the city is able to cut its dependence on federal government funds, it is receiving lavish sums to help it pay for the overhaul of East Berlin’s rotting infrastructure and the merging of its eastern and western halves into one modern city.
Of its total 1992 budget of 41.88 billion Deutsche marks (about $25 billion), Berlin will receive 38 percent in subsidies from the German government, raise 13 percent through new borrowing and generate 26 percent through taxes.
Finance Senator Elmar Pieroth said the debt level, one that would be considered irresponsible under normal circumstances, was unavoidable given the magnitude of the job to be done.
“We have no other choice,” he said in an interview. “We can’t build the Wall back and make the East stay at the level it is today.”
East Berlin’s needs range from sewer equipment to telecommunications systems and include just about everything in between. Both East and West Berlin need housing, efficient power generating and distribution equipment, and better road connections to each other and the rest of Germany.
While it is clear that many improvements have already been made – public transportation runs efficiently between East and West and the phone lines across town are no longer as impossibly busy as they once were – there remains more work to be done than originally estimated. The Berlin and German governments have already begun negotiations to extend payments from the special German Unity Fund beyond the planned cutoff date of 1995. Also being discussed is the timetable for the federal government’s move to Berlin. While Berlin is lobbying for it to take place as soon as possible, the federal government seems to want to postpone both the move and the accompanying bills until the late nineties.
Earlier this year, Bonn even floated a trial balloon, suggesting some ministries should remain where they are.
“The move is more difficult than expected,” said Siemens AG Vice President Joachim Putzmann, chief of the electrical and electronics company’s Berlin administration. While he is optimistic about Berlin’s future, Mr. Putzmann said there are still very few decision-makers in the city and German business needs to see the government back in Berlin before it relocates key people and operations.
The pace of Berlin’s expansion will be partially reflected in the growth of the city’s taxes, which are targeted to triple to 18.5 billion marks in 1995 from 6.09 billion marks in 1990. Mr. Pieroth said 4 billion marks of the increase will come from new economic activity in East Berlin, 3 billion marks from general economic growth and 3 billion marks from the phasing out of the tax breaks granted to West Berlin business before unification, when the West German government compensated companies for the disadvantage of their geographic and economic location in the middle of East Germany.
The loss of the tax breaks is proving to have a variety of effects, often depending on the type of business involved. Retailers, who have been flooded with new customers from Eastern Germany, and producers of consumer goods and foodstuffs, who have found it relatively easy to boost their sales in the newly accessible surrounding markets, will tend not to suffer.
But other companies, such as the pharmaceutical and chemical giant Schering AG, say profits are being hit despite an aggressive sales and marketing push into Central and Eastern Europe. “The structure of the economy in these countries and the lack of hard currency has complicated our plan to increase sales,” said Horst Kramp, a member of Schering’s executive board. “In the short term, we can’t compensate for our higher costs through increased sales so we must save wherever we can.”
Although Schering, the only major German company that currently has its headquarters in Berlin, does not plan to cut either jobs or investment, its rationalization program and comparable cost-cutting at other firms has had a ripple effect on the Berlin economy.
The owner of a small language school who expected business to improve thanks to increased demand from East Berliners keen to learn English has seen any such benefit canceled out as regular corporate customers have cut back on extras.
Small business has also been squeezed by the skyrocketing rates for office rental and the sharply higher costs of land.
ALTHOUGH there have been numerous calls for the government to control the rise of property and rental costs both for business and housing, Mr. Pieroth said Berliners must adapt to the prices, which are no higher than in other West German cities.
Despite the greater influence of market forces in both East and West Berlin’s economic life, neither business leaders or politicians envisage a day when the city will be able to do entirely without government support. Berlin will always need a certain amount of help to pay for its many expensive cultural and educational institutions. As a consequence of its history as a divided city, Berlin has separate museum systems, universities, national theater companies and opera houses. While some of the museum collections can be merged and a few of the smaller theaters privatized, Berlin believes that in its role as Germany’s capital, it is crucial to keep the rest.Did You Get A Musical Instrument for Christmas?

Northern Ireland has seen a renaissance in brewing and distilling in recent years. Nearly every county now boasts a top-class producer of beer and cider or whiskey and gin. Of course, some have been around for years and have moved with the times. They are opening up and divulging at least some, if not all, of their long-held secrets to the public – which includes you!
Let’s start with a taste of possibly Northern Ireland’s best-known whiskey distillery. Bushmills Distillery in the village of Bushmills has been producing the finest whiskey on the Causeway Coastal Route for over 400 years.
Using water from the River Bush, the distillery is famous the world over for its golden produce. You can find out all about the distillery’s history, the secret of its success and get a wee dram for yourself during their excellent guided tours.
Not too far away in Derry-Londonderry is the Walled City Brewery whose Derry Milk Beer is hand-crafted from chocolate stout and organic cow’s milk. It is an alcohol experience you won’t forget. The brewery doesn't offer official tours because they believe they have developed something even better. And to be honest, it’s very difficult to argue with them.
Their beer masterclass is a ninety-minute ‘interactive experience’ where you can relax, sit back and let their talented brewers tell you the multi-millennia story of brewing while tasting their ten craft beers. When you’re finished you can sample the delights of their award-winning restaurant, and enjoy the Taste of the North West by trying locally produced, premium quality food.
Armagh is also known as the Orchard County, so it is hardly surprising to find a cider producer in this part of the world. Philip Troughton and his wife Helen started the Armagh Cider Company in 2005. This made. Everything happens right on their doorstep.
A few years ago, the owners of Hillstown Brewery near Randalstown and on the shores of Lough Neagh started breeding cattle. Anyway, in an effort to relax the herd and therefore make the meat more tender they made them beer. Yes, that is correct, they made the cows beer. They added some music and even sang to them on occasion. It worked and orders for the beef took off. It turned out that cows are quite discerning when it comes to their beer and the new brewery (or should that be moory?) was born. You really should come and find out more for yourself though and sample some of the beer and the beef.
Rademon Estate Distillery is the home of Shortcross Gin. Head distiller, David Boyd-Armstrong and his team, produce this sweet and tasty tipple using locally picked wild botanicals and fresh well water.

She Loves Me He Loves Me Not.
Hi Zeenat, thanks for dropping in and letting us have a peek into your life. And for the wonderful things you said about me in your blog. (read it HERE.) I am so thrilled we get to be friends over common interests :)
Alright, gushing done, or at least postponed...
So, what’s She Loves Me He Loves Me Not about?
So, what’s She Loves Me He Loves Me Not about?
SLMHLMN is a twist on the fairytale, Beauty and the Beast. I always thought as a child, that the Beast's side of the story was not explored at all. We never hear his thoughts. What did he feel? And I always felt that there must be something dark within Beauty, to remain and then fall in love with the Beast. I think it's one of the most nuanced fairytales, others being The Little MatchGirl, The Little Mermaid and Snow White. I might do those next. So dibs on that!
What’s your favorite line from your novel? Why?
When Fardeen and Zoella are negotiating their marriage and she stipulates 'no physical contact', Fardeen replies, 'Why is sex the first thing on your mind when it comes to me?'
I thought it the most endearing quality of Zoella that she loves him and is so bad at hiding it, everyone knows it. Fardeen knows exactly how attractive she finds him but never uses it against her.
I'd laughed out loud on that one too. LOL.
How did you become a writer? In other words, tell us YOUR STORY.
A friend of mine I hadn't spoken with in years, but who had been very close to me in school, emailed me one day about Indireads. I followed up. I had just started writing Haveli, my first novella. Naheed Hasan, the publishing head of Indireads loved it and sent me a contract.
It was such a thrill because I had never ever thought of writing romance or any genre writing for that matter. Genre fiction is not really respected in writing circles, unfortunately, and when I found myself on this side of the fence, I started writing about issues such as these also. I find it extremely rewarding.
What is your best marketing tip?
Choose two or three social media sites at the most, and work on those. Don't spread yourself too thin. Give at least two hours every day to social media. I love Twitter. It's the most efficient marketing tool, I think.
Why write romance?
I love romance. I read it a lot. I enjoy writing it. It's my way of taking a break from my mainstream fiction, which deals with social issues. Romance is fun!
Is there a certain scene you find difficult to write? Eg: Racy or action etc.? Why?
I think taking your reader through an intimate scene between your characters can be tricky. It's difficult to not fall into the trap of distasteful long descriptions, that might just end up being hilarious rather than hot. Some people can do it very well, of course, others only think they can. I choose not to show intimacy in my books because not giving everything away is much more romantic.
Is your writing character-driven or plot-driven?
Character is plot, says Henry James. I believe him. It's the choices our characters make that drives the narrative. So definitely character driven.
Which is the best character you’ve written? Is he or she your favorite? Why?
I don't know if she is the best character I've written, but Chandni is my favourite because she is the most unlike me. She is bold, spoilt and vulnerable. She is a princess. She has a tragic life but she doesn't ever let her weaknesses show. I love that about her, and her sarcasm!
What do you wish to convey through your writing?
Entertainment. Laughter. Snippets of relevant information about cultural heritage and geographical history. Things people tend to forget about themselves and their history, and when reminded, feel proud of.
What can we expect from you next?
No idea. Sorry.
To end lets try a Rapid Fire round. Your answer should be the first word/s that pops into your head when you think of:
LIFE: seasons (what?!)
PASSION: Yes!
HERO: Tragic
LOVE: life
HATE: anger
Thank you once again, Zeenat for being here and talking to me. It was fun!
Zeenat Mahal can be reached at all these places:
Blurb:
(Incidently, I had the honor of reading the ARC of SLMHLMN and I finished it in one day. A pure reading pleasure. ~ Falguni.)
Zoella didn’t know whether she was devastatingly happy or happily devastated..
Many thanks Falguni! Loved chatting with you :)

This morning I wanted something besides oatmeal to go with my coffee (the essential element of any good breakfast)
I really didn’t want to deal with our skillet that only makes 2 pancakes at a time, so I decided to do pancakes on my Large Stoneware Bar Pan.
I made up my pancake batter and poured it in the pan.
I spread it out with a spatula making sure that I got it thin and even all the way across especially in the middle. I didn’t spread it enough and the middle ended up being a little squishy, I’ll try to remember that for next time.
While it was in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes I put some turkey bacon in the microwave (6 minutes in our microwave makes it super crispy) I love my Small Ridged Baker because it gets rid of the extra fat and leaves just the bacony goodness.
By the time that I had all the pancake stuff put away and finished cooking the bacon, my 15 minutes was up and the pancake was ready to come out of the oven. It was perfectly brown on top and bottom. I cut it with a pizza cutter and breakfast was served!
Everyone enjoyed pancakes and bacon with applesauce and I loved the fact that I didn’t have to do much work, that’s my kind of saturday morning!
You are amazing Keturah! I’m going to have to try this ’cause I’m terrible at making pancakes on the top of the stove!Services pages differ significantly when it comes to word count. It’s up to you how much information you’d like to include on the page.

People also remember pictures with logical connections between them 65% better than text. But how do you make the visual information generated by your brand even more effective? Some visual storytelling tips will help you with this.
Visual Storytelling Tips
Let’s take a dive into these 6 simple visual storytelling tips:
1. Choose your Goal and Metrics
Aimless marketing leads only to budget losses. So don’t let your storytelling-based content be commercially aimless.
Storytelling can be integrated into any level of your marketing strategy, including a single ad, a marketing campaign, the tone of voice for social networks, and general brand narration.
If visual storytelling is a new tool for you, start on a small scale. For example, use visual storytelling for advertising a new product on social networks. In this case, the goal of your message will be to increase the sales of goods. Metrics that will help you evaluate the success of a storytelling approach are sales, clients’ requests, and social resonance (reposts, brand or product mentions, and comments).
2. Set a Budget to Find your Tools
You can apply visual storytelling at a single product advertising level or through the brand narrative on social networks. Each of the options means that you need a specific budget. The smaller your communication scale, the cheaper the tools are.
Master visual storytelling by working with small messages. This approach will help you figure out which stories are the most popular among your target audience and invest more in communication that really works in the future.
Visual storytelling can be embodied in the form of a static picture with brand captions, custom animations, videos, face filters, online games, and more. The most affordable way to start with visual storytelling is to use stock images, which I use often, and then edit them based on your needs. There are many editing tools out there, so you can design like a pro with no design experience needed.
3. Emotions are Everything
The emotional context of your brand can be very broad. Curiosity can encourage your customers to surf your online catalog. The desire to be part of a cool crowd encourages users to turn certain products into bestsellers. The euphoria from ordering a long-awaited product can make an online store user order something else as part of one order.
You can work with either positive or negative emotions as the latter can also be a purchasing trigger. If your potential customer experiences irritation while reading the assembly instructions by your competitor, they are more likely to buy goods from you next time if you provide them with a solution such as free installation.
Analyze what emotions are at the heart of a potential customer. Anger? Despair? Joy? This emotional trigger will influence the plot of your story and its visual style. This way you’ll increase your chances of capturing their attention to your product and prompt them to take a specific action.
4. Create a Hero that Saves the Day
The main rule for creating a realistic hero of your narrative is its relevance to your audience. In order for your story to be involved, a hero (and an antihero) must be familiar with your audience. It is wonderful if the hero’s prototype is representative of your target audience. At the same time, the hero may be the product you are advertising or your brand.
And who is an antihero? A good antihero embodies the fears of the hero and poses a serious threat to him or her. An antihero should also be easy-recognizable by the target audience. Use your target audience research to learn their fears and create an antihero based on that information.
5. Build a Storyboard Based on Conflict
A story is impossible without conflict. Conflict starts with your hero facing their challenges. Engaging stories are built on the clash of a hero and an antihero (a hero’s deepest fear). Your hero may win or die, or, perhaps you may leave an open ending that provides you with a room for a sequel. Build your first story using the following structure:
- Introduction
- Rising action
- Climax
- Falling action
- Resolution
A storyboard usually consists of simple images that reflect the essence of each structural element of your story. You may even use them as content for Instagram or Facebook Stories. However, to turn your storyboard frames into a video, a banner ad, or other material, you’ll need to go on one more step.
6. Visualize your Story
Creating the layout of your story, consider the technical features of the platform you are going to post content on. For example, storytelling for Instagram should be based solely on graphics and short videos without text injections.
Visual storytelling for YouTube or TikTok can take the form of a series or a long movie. At the same time, visual storytelling on the landing page should provide users with constant motivation to scroll down the page or follow CTA. So think about how the user will interact with your story and determine its shape, style, and scale.
Use some proven visual storytelling rules too. First, use color and shade contrasts to highlight the subject of the story. Second, strive for minimalism. Your images or videos should not have a single detail that does not matter to the story. Third, control users’ eyes by arranging elements on the image so they could guide users along a specific visual hierarchy.
Bonus ending: Here are some books that helped me develop my visual storytelling skills: Visual Storytelling: How to Speak to the Audience Without Saying a Word by Morgan Sandler, Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative by Will Eisner, and The Power of Visual Storytelling by Ekaterina Walter.')); }New, more open-minded approaches to education are gaining momentum across the globe.

An easy-to-follow, inexpensive way to keep your home tidy.
Ever dreamt of walking into your kitchen (or any room for that matter) and knowing exactly where everything is? You’re not the only one. But when everything’s a disorganised mess, it’s probably hard to know where to even begin.
But don’t worry – simply follow these 3 easy-to-follow steps to elevate your home from messy to spick-and-span in no time:
Step 1: Declutter
Admit it – you have some things you don’t actually need. Well, as hard as it is to hear, decluttering is perhaps the most basic step to take for a tidier home, since storing or throwing these items will free up more space at home.
To do this, throw out items in poor condition, and donate or sell items that are unneeded, but still in good shape. Additionally, take this time to return any stray items back where they belong.
As simple as this sounds, it does take a while, so take your time and do so one room at a time to avoid tiring yourself out!
Step 2: Group similar things together
Now that you’ve gotten rid of everything you don’t need, it’s time for the second step: grouping similar things together.
By doing this, it’ll help you find what you need quickly instead of spending time searching for things you’ve stored in different places. So for example, you can group items like condiments, dairy products, and fruits in the fridge, while you can do the same for things like figurines, plushies, and board games when you’re tidying up your kid’s room.
Step 3: Label everything
Labelling may sound like something you’d only do in primary school, but it’s actually useful for home organisation! It can tell you what each storage unit contains, saving you the hassle of opening each one until you find what you need.
And the labels aren’t just limited to names. In fact, it can be used to provide other useful information as well, like expiry dates!
Here are some ways you can use labels:
In the kitchen:
- Spice and condiment jars: to avoid mixing them up (e.g. mistaking sugar for salt)
- Expiration dates: know what needs replacing, and when
- Snack containers: particularly if anyone at home has ingredient allergies
In the bathroom:
- Shampoo, body wash and hand wash: if you pour refill packs into similar looking containers
- Toothbrushes: who the owner of each toothbrush is
In the kid’s room:
- Toys: separate by category (e.g. board games, figurines etc.) or by owner if you have multiple kids
- School supplies/stationery: separate by category (e.g. erasers, colouring materials, art and craft supplies)
Miscellaneous:
- Switches: what each switch is for (e.g. hallway lights, ceiling fan)
- Medicine: group according to medical needs (e.g. fever/headaches, stomach, allergies)
- Gardening supplies: particularly if you want to keep them separate from your other things
For more ideas, see how else you can use labels in your daily life!

How it works
Nothing makes a kid’s party more fun than games that get everyone involved and allow everyone to be silly. For far too long, kids have been told to be quiet and sit and be seen and not heard, but there are times when a child must act out and have fun. Times like these don’t have to be at a birthday party, but rather, they can be anytime when there are friends and family to play with. The makers at Ideal took an old-time beloved game and made it fun and accessible to all by packaging and creating the Hot Potato Musical Passing Game. With a plush potato toy coupled with music and sounds, the Hot Potato Passing Game will entertain your children and their friends for hours as they have the freedom to be silly, socially interact, be physical, and make connections and friendships that will last.
Design
The potato itself is plush and made out of a blended, soft material that makes it safe and easy for the potato to be thrown around. The potato is designed to look like a real potato with the spud markings of potato all around the toy. The front has a cartoon funny face that personifies the potato and adds to the fun of throwing around something that is cartoon-like and has personality.
On the bottom of the potato is a velcro opening that houses the music box and inner workings of the potato. If you pull the velcro apart you will find the box and on the box is a switch that allows you to turn the toy on and off. When you flip the switch you will hear, “Hot Potato!” and then the game will begin. Close the velcro and then give the potato a squeeze and music will start playing.
Batteries Included
When the door is removed, you will be able to see where the batteries are inserted and how they are to be properly placed into the toy. Although the toy comes with the batteries already, it is always a good idea to have more batteries on hand in case the batteries have lost some of their charges while sitting within the toy before purchasing. In the event that the batteries quickly lose their charge after opening, you can easily replace them and have fresh batteries in the toy for longer play.
Safety
The makers at Ideal used velcro in order to eliminate the risk of a zipper hurting someone. The object of the game is to quickly pass the potato around, so the softer and quicker the pass, the more difficult the game becomes and the more fun the game becomes. Also, ensure that the play area is wide open and clear of any other toys or debris that may make children trip or fall when they lunge for the potato to catch it or try and catch the potato if it is thrown over their head. The clearer the play area the less risk of injury or trips or falls.
How To Play
To begin play, choose two to six players and stand in a circle. Then, choose someone to be the first to hold the potato. When that person is chosen, they will turn on the potato with the switch on the music box located inside of the potato, and then they will give the potato a squeeze. When the potato has been squeezed, the music will begin to play. As soon as the music starts to play the person holding the potato will then toss the potato to someone else in the circle and then that person will toss it to someone else and that rhythm will continue. Each person tosses the potato to someone else.
As time goes on, the music will start to get faster and faster indicating that the song will come to an end soon. This gets the excitement heightened and the tossing will come faster and faster and the emotions getting sillier and sillier. Eventually, the music will stop and the potato will make a “boing” noise indicating that whoever is holding the potato loses and receives a potato chip. The game then starts all over again. The person who gets three potato chips from having had the potato when the music stops loses and is out of the game. That process continues until there is one person remaining. The game can last a very long time as it may take a while for everyone to get three potato chips to be out of the game.
Potato Chips
Age Range
Social Interaction
The game is a great way to get kids away from screens such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions and get them into interacting more with others on a personal, in-real-life way. The Hot Potato Musical Passing Game is great for birthday parties and playdates as a way to get kids to play together and have fun together as they form the bonds of friendship.
Motor Skills
Parental Concerns
Another concern was that the music box did not play as soon as it was turned on and squeezed. Some parents found that the music box got stuck on one mode and then when it was squeezed the music didn’t immediately play. It is a good idea to fully read the instructions and fully remove the music box from the potato in order to fully see how the switches work and to ensure that the switches are placed on the proper settings to ensure that the potato is being set up properly.New free online slots

THE FAITH
The inspired word of God uses the word faith to communicate both personal conviction and persuasion as well as the body and composite of ideas, principles and teachings that are acknowledged and accepted as true. The collection of teaching from God through Christ the Son is identified in the New Testament as the faith. Jude wrote, “Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.” (Jude 3) The faith has been delivered by divine revelation. “But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed.” (Galatians 3:23) The apostle Paul explains in chapter three of the Galatians’ letter how God’s promise to Abraham, the Law of Moses and the system of faith in Christ Jesus are all part of the heavenly plan to bring blessing to all men. Every individual must choose for himself whether or not he will believe the faith.
Truth Sets Men Free
The majority of people in the world are not free men, even if they are living in a society and culture where they enjoy political freedom. The Lord Jesus Christ taught, “The truth shall make you free” (John 8:32). Jews then responded, “We are Abraham’s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, ‘You will be made free’?” (v. 33) The Lord answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin. . . . Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.” (vs. 34, 36) Like most of the Jews in the first century, men today do not realize they are shackled by their own sins and need to be made free by Jesus.

DEITY IN THE FLESH
Approximately seven hundred years before Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the prophet Isaiah foretold that a virgin would give birth to a son and he would be called Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14). “Immanuel” means “God with us” (Matthew 1:23). The Being, who was the Word in the beginning, was with God and was God, “became flesh” and lived among men (John 1:1, 14). In Christ Jesus “dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily” (Colossians 2:9).

The Gospel Calls You
The gospel of Christ is powerful because it is the word of God and of His beloved Son. It is the truth that sanctifies; it is words of eternal life. If we will receive with meekness the divine revelation, it is able to save our souls (James 1:21; cf. Romans 1:16).
The Lord Jesus Christ sent out His apostles to preach the gospel and make disciples. “How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?” (Romans 10:14). “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!” (10:15). The doctrine of Christ is designed to prick hearts and to lead men to conversion. It invites all to learn and to follow Jesus (cf. Matthew 11:28-29).

ONE HOPE
No hope. Two words that no one wants to hear. Hopelessness is a terrible circumstance in which to find yourself – that state of having no sign of a solution or an expectation of a favorable outcome. Such is the case of the individual who is without Christ, “having no hope and without God in the world” (Ephesians 2:12). And the one who hears the Lord say, “I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!” (Matthew 7:23).Repository Analytics

Reverse logistics for mobile devices is more important than ever. Mobile-connected devices exceeded the world's population in 2014. Wearable technology sales will hit 22 million in 2015, and reach 370 million devices over the next five years, according to analyst CCS Insight. Imagine landfills piled high with smartwatches and connected egg trays, instead of smartphones and laptops. It's not a pretty picture.
Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers have been running reverse logistics for decades. The market has matured into a $400-billion industry. But new technological innovations, such as connected devices, present an even larger opportunity for retailers and device manufacturers.
Products are often returned, processed, and either triaged, refurbished, or recycled by a third-party logistics (3PL) provider in order to nix the step of shipping back to the OEM. Retailers are offering more trade-in and upgrade programs to provide a better customer experience. Companies are also investing additional resources into developing corporate sustainability programs to further green business models because consumers are pushing for these programs, which allow them to recoup some money ethically.
Reverse logistics is complex, requiring a networked model to provide the most value, and a host of technological management and IT process expertise. Every reverse logistics strategy should take into account the following points:
- Business intelligence is vital. Keeping data clean and up to date is one of the biggest challenges in the reverse logistics system. Devices must be tracked throughout the entire lifecycle, until they are ready to be repaired or recycled.
- Certification standards are essential. Proper certification levels, such as the certification of component parts by device manufacturers, must be met throughout each step of the reverse logistics process. The certification process is often rigorous, as manufacturers want to ensure the parts put back in their devices are quality components. Many organizations seek help from providers with expertise in device recovery that will meet manufacturer specifications, as well as adhere to industry standards, such as ISO and Responsible Recycling.
- Collaboration is crucial. A truly networked reverse logistics program features a smooth communication and data pipeline between manufacturers, providers, and suppliers. Ensuring that a product's lifecycle is visible through to its final destination means all parties must collaborate to swiftly address issues, such as hardware and software glitches, or high failure rates. Greater collaboration also ensures forward logistics operations are better integrated with reverse logistics for faster redeployment and sales.
This data provides a clear picture of demand management and forecasting, and shows the root causes of returns. The supply chain and point-of-sale data shed light on how to prevent device returns, how to reduce inventory levels, when to move product, and how much. This knowledge improves return rates, frees up capital, and increases potential revenue.
In the next five years, reverse logistics will be more critical than ever for the mobile device industry. Device lifecycles are extending far beyond cradle-to-grave, and greater volumes of new technology will require more sophisticated reverse logistics programs to avoid filling landfills with wearable technology that could be reused or recycled.January 23, 2019 Hello world!.Location: Indialantic Beach, Florida, USA

How did you hear about Sandvox?
I Googled website builders and did research regarding the top 10 website builders for Mac users and Sandvox was rated in the top 10 and also rated well for ease of use.
What made you decide to get Sandvox?
Sandvox was reviewed and rated often and will high marks and was also said to be user friendly and I am new to my Mac computer, so this was an important plus. I also researched A2 web hosting and saw the relationship between the two, which made me think publishing the site would be easy.

THANK YOU for considering adopting a pet from the Invermere Companion Animal Network!
When you choose a companion from ICAN you are, in fact, saving two lives. The one you take home and the next one who takes her place at the shelter. Any companion coming into our shelter is assessed for behavioral issues and medical needs before being placed for adoption. All of our companions have been dewormed, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and have received any veterinary treatment required.
We do offer a 2 week trial period for any companion you wish to add to your home. If, for any reason, the partnership is just not working out, you can return that companion to our shelter and offer your home to another who may fit in better. We want all of our adoptions to be forever adoptions!
We provide all the necessary information relating to any vet care they have received and records from the vet can be transferred to the new guardian after the 2 week trial period.
We hope you will find your perfect match at ICAN — we are all saving lives, one at a time!
The adoption process is simple, but you will need to fill out an adoption application and have it approved before an adoption can take place. We request that any potential adopters meet the companion animal that they are interested in personally, before adopting. Landlords, references and/or veterinarians may be contacted when your application is being reviewed.
We will not allow an animal to go to a new home without first being spayed or neutered (except small animals which are dealt with on a case-by-case basis). Kittens are usually altered at about 7-9 weeks of age and after a 2 day recuperation period they are ready to go home! Adult cats and rabbits are altered as soon as possible after arriving at ICAN and are ready for adoption after a 2 day recuperation period (under normal circumstances).

Looking for reliable cheap applied cars can be quite a challenging process. But when you search using the internet you then will save you your self time and work as today most of the vehicle offering agents and auto auctions are outlined on line therefore you will get a lists of cars and sellers that you could option with.
Slim your choices
When choosing the most effective vehicle you then have to know what your requirements are. Do you really need it for your spouse to pickup kiddies from school? Or are you wanting it for number of long visits per year Auto verkaufen? Or are you one of those who consider their vehicle as a property? Each of these scenarios requires a different car so thin your possibilities and do not bottom conclusions just on price. Following you choose to purchase a specific design or two, start physically examining applied cars.
How to get the true price for used cars?
Locating the actual cost for a used car is very easy applying options such as Kellys Orange Book. You will enter the make and style of your opted for vehicle you then is going to be persuaded to enter the usage and the indication then you can get your car or truck cost indicator.
Needless to say you ought to remember that must be vehicle is cheap doesn’t mean it is not a excellent vehicle, and expensive vehicles do not necessarily show that the automobile is in great condition. If you wish to obtain a vehicle and you found that the purchase price is just unhealthy then check the car enrollment and obtain a Carfax vehicle report.
If the vendor cays something such as “I simply acquired that car 8 weeks ago and I determined to market it again” then this would induce some signals in your head as there may be reasons why they are selling so soon. Perhaps the vehicle has been in an incident, or even there are mechanical issues and the seller is trying to reduce their losses. As generally before buying a used car you need to carefully inspect it. The very best suggestion is to utilize a qualified mechanic. Like that you’ll know exactly what you are buying and what it is worth.
Should I get a car and make it my next task
Going for a vehicle and restore it to its unique situation isn’t for everybody, although some folks have a project car. But you should consider when you yourself have the skills and knowledge needed to perform the job otherwise it may come out to be a pricey exercise.T.I. ft.

For some people, grey is a great neutral. For others, it's a "must avoid".
Should You Wear Grey?
The more grey you have in your colouring, the better it will be for you.
So if you have grey hair (like me) it is a fantastic neutral. If you have blue-grey eyes - it can also work.
But if there is nothing grey about your colouring - hair or eyes, it's generally best avoided for other much better neutrals!
Now how to choose the best grey for your colouring, if grey is a good neutral.
The Best Value of Grey for You
If you have light colouring (lighter hair) then go for light greys rather than dark ones. So of course, the reverse is true if you have dark hair go with dark greys rather than light ones as you'll find them so much more flattering.
The Best Intensity of Grey for You
Grey in its essence is muted and soft, but some greys will be softer than others. The lighter or darker a grey (at the extreme ends of the value scale) will generally be a little brighter and less muted than if you go for mid-greys which tend to be more muted.
If you have a brighter palette, then grey is not naturally a great neutral for you as it's soft and you are looking for brighter colours and neutrals. But if you have any softness in your palette then greys can work well!
The Best Undertone of Grey for You
Greys come in both warmer and cooler undertone versions. As grey is an overall cooler colour (black and white, which go into making grey are both cool) then cool undertone people don't have to be so specific around the greys - particularly if they are worn on the lower half of the body - any undertone of grey can work fine as there is enough coolness in the grey to work.
If you have a warm undertone, then greys really need to be warm - warm greys have either a yellow, green or brown base that takes them from being cool to have an element of warmth and so wearable.
The Best Grey Texture for You
Should you go with a more solid grey (like the image above) or one that is heathered or marle (like the one below? If you have more patterned skin or more textural hair or multi-tonal grey hair, then a more heathered or marle works better than a solid one as it's in harmony with your natural features.
Choosing the right grey can be quite simple if you stick with these colour principles.
Here are some more tips on identifying the undertone of grey.

The method in this paper only considers gear-mesh loses, caused by the sliding friction when the teeth mesh together, which normally provides a reasonably accurate calculation of efficiency. The procedure has the following steps:
- List all fundamental circuits, consisting of two meshing
geatsand a carrier. For each, carryout kinematic analysis to solve for the angular speed of each link.
- Find the idealized torque of each link, assuming there is no power loss.
- Identify the direction in which power is flowing through each link
- Add gear-mesh losses for each gear pair, giving the actual torque of each link
- Sketch a power flow diagram and calculate the overall efficiency
The paper goes step-by-step through a method of calculating the efficiency of a hub gear system. If you want to perform the calculations you’ll need to read the full paper..

Let us know what you thinkRam heart of the Cotswolds.
But ramblers say putting a short tunnel under the popular watering hole would be much better for the thousands of people who come to the area to enjoy the famous scenery and footpaths.
Effectively turning the pub and the land underneath into a roof for a short tunnel would save the building and remove the need to divert the well-known Cotswold and Gloucestershire Ways.
And a tunnel under the pub to take the A417 through traffic off local roads would allow ramblers to enjoy both in much quieter surroundings.
Ramblers say extra care needs to be taken because the planned new road cuts a swathe through an area of outstanding natural beauty which attracts thousands of visitors to the area.
Richard Holmes, footpath secretary for the area, says the plans put forward by Highways England could decimate part of the Gloucestershire network and wreck some of the scenery.
“The Air Balloon pub is a part of the history of the area and is popular with families and walkers using the Cotswold and Gloucestershire Ways,” he said, calling for a short tunnel under the pub.
He added: “Environmentally, for many of our members, it seems the best option would be for a tunnel.
“We join with the National Trust and Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust in disappointment that a tunnel option wasn’t put forward.
“If A417 through traffic was in a tunnel, local roads would be much quieter for local people.”
Known locally as the ‘missing link’.
Highways England have put forward two options to solve the traffic problems on the main road into Gloucestershire from the south but have ruled out a tunnel on cost grounds.
The cheapest tunnel to make the shortlist, a three mile tunnel from the back of Shab Hill reappearing at the base of Barrow Wake, would cost £875million.
This is considerably higher than the £485million estimate to build a road through the middle of the pub and roundabout.
But ramblers say highways could save money because their plan removes the need for a link road from Barrow Wake to Shab Hill.
And they say a tunnel might be cost neutral because highways chiefs are already planning to sink the new road into a 100 feet deep cutting to reduce the gradient on the hill.
Chairman Bernard Gill said: “The pub is a meeting point for wlalkers so we don’t want to see it go, but our main concern is about the footpaths.
“We accept something needs to be done about the traffic but the original authors wanted the Cotswold Way and the Gloucester Way to follow those routes for a reason.
“They are designed to make the most of the views and we would not want to see them diverted for the new road. That is why we want a compromise solution.
“If we could get a tiny tunnel just under the pub, that would be a starting point.”
The Ramblers have set up a mailbox A417@gloucestershireramblers.org.uk for people to express their views.
Bosses at the Chef and Brewer pub are currently in negotiations with Highways England but point out that whatever happens long term, the pub will remain open in the meantime.
Thursday is the last chance for people to have their say on the proposals.Author: Patricia Scot Bernard

Description
When Patricia decided to travel in India with her long lost English friend, Sally, she had no idea that Sally had become a bag lady.
During their backpacking adventure Sally dragged around a monster case that became so attached to her it almost wagged its handle when she entered the room. Meanwhile Sally collected and collected, clothes, papers, plastic bags until she had quadrupled her baggage.
Armed with the Kama Sutra under her arm, Patricia with her love of architecture and history, and with her mad friend in tow, (the same mad friend who wanted to bring home every hurt dog and cow they encountered), the two friends caught buses driven by speed freaks; caught packed trains with the wicked witch of the north; were almost marooned in the Tha Desert after an unfortunate dog incident; while camping were almost camelnapped in Rajasthan; were almost drowned at Mount Abu, and were definitely attacked by amorous monkeys in Delhi.
With the Kama Sutra Under My Arm is a hilarious romp, as well as an informative historical and architectural travel book. Once read, India will never look quite the same and neither will suitcases.

This paper presents our experiences, thoughts, and struggles in working toward understanding, embracing, and implementing feminist perspectives in our scholarship and practice. Mentors, through their encouragement, guidance, and support, have played key roles in our growth as feminist sport and exercise psychology professionals. It is through our work with mentors that we have moved closer toward understanding and identifying with being feminist scholars. In our research, we place women as the central focus of our work, take into account contextual factors, and look toward creating social change. The struggles we have faced as young professionals include countering stereotypes of feminism, integrating feminist methodologies and epistemology into a traditionally logical positivist field, and moving from research findings to creating social change. Looking toward the future, we hope that feminist sport and exercise psychology scholars continue to build a community to share and discuss the issues and struggles of feminist researchers..

The present investigation is a qualitative case study of a former elite gymnast. The social cognitive approach to achievement motivation has been applied to understand and explain the behavior of this gymnast, her coaches, and her parents. The gymnast participated in three unstructured interviews which were grounded in a feminist view of sport and research (cf. Harding, 1991; Krane, 1994). The data analysis resulted in three dimensions: Motivational Climate, Evidence of an Ego Orientation, and Correlates of Ego Involvement. An ego-involved motivational environment was developed and reinforced by the gymnast’s coaches and parents. Her ego-involved goal orientation was revealed through her reliance on social comparison, emphasis on external feedback and rewards, need to demonstrate her superiority, and acting out behaviors in the face of adversity. This gymnast practiced and competed while seriously injured, employed unhealthy eating practices, overtrained, and refused to listen to medical advice in order to continue her quest towards the Olympic team. All of these behaviors are discussed within the framework of goal orientation theory.

This study was designed to examine if mental skills and strategies such as high confidence, commitment, and the use of cooperative routines, as well as previously unexamined physical, social, and environmental factors affect Olympic performance. Athletes and coaches from 8 Atlanta US Olympic teams were interviewed. Four teams met/exceeded performance expectations and 4 teams failed to perform up to performance predictions. Focus group interviews were conducted with 2 to 4 athletes from each team. Individual interviews were conducted with 1 or 2 coaches from each team. Each interview was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by three trained investigators using hierarchical content analyses. Differences existed between teams that met/exceeded performance expectations and teams that failed. Teams that met/exceeded expectations participated in resident training programs, experienced crowd and family or friend support, utilized mental preparation, and were highly focused and committed. Teams that failed to meet expectations experienced planning and team cohesion problems, lacked experience, faced travel problems, experienced coaching problems, and encountered problems related to focus and commitment. Results indicated that achievement of peak performance at the Olympic Games is a complex and delicate process influenced by a variety of psychological, physical, social, and organizational factors..

Few.FSU EX COM E-VOTE 11/15/11
On 11/15/11 the Ex Com was sent the following email. The Ex Com voted between 11/15/11 and 11/16/11 to endorse the CFA strike by unanimous vote (10 votes in favor, none opposed).
Dear ExCom,
We’ve been asked to endorse the strike by Cal State faculty (CFA) at 2 campuses (see below).
Here’s a statement from the CTA that I’ve modified – just barely:
“The Faculty Staff Union at University of Massachusetts Boston stands solidly behind the California Faculty Association’s
participation in a one-day strike on Nov. 17, as well as its concerted actions leading up to the strike. It is not
right that tuition at CSU campuses has risen 23 percent in the past year while students are unable to get
into classes and are forced to take five or more years to graduate. It is not right for the faculty to go
without its modest, bargained pay increases while the number of CSU executives and their pay continue
to increase. In taking this action to strike for a day, the faculty within the California State University
system is standing up for their students and standing up for their profession.”
I’m asking for a vote of the executive committee to endorse such a statement of support.
Catherine

Hi folks,
As many of you are aware, two of our campuses are going on strike on Thursday. As part of our campaign media work, we are gathering statements of support from other organizations/unions.
If your group could send us a short statement of support , that would really help our folks feel supported and part of something larger than our CA struggle.
We are framing our struggle more broadly than just our contractÂ-itÂ's about the role of faculty and the value of instruction in the California State University system, the misplaced priorities of our Chancellor, and a fight for a California State University system that serves the interests of the 99%. You can see details of our ChancellorÂ's legacy over more than a decadeÂ-massive fee hikes, huge increases in pay for execs, etc. at....
If you would be up for this, itÂ's Â"the thoughtÂ" that counts. DonÂ't worry about a perfect piece of prose.
As you saw, Gary has blogged about the strike so there are details there to borrow--....
Please send statements directly to me at __________
And if you donÂ't have time to write something, weÂ'd love to add your organizationÂ's name to our list of supporters.
You can see other statements of support at-. We would love to add yours!
Thanks so much!

Recently, Puerto Rico has been in the spotlight after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island with a devastating effect. Puerto Rico consists of one main island and several small islands located in the northeast Caribbean Sea. The humanitarian crisis caused by the hurricane led to the intervention of the US government and consequently revived the debate of whether Puerto Ricans are Americans. A survey conducted by Morning Consult between Sept. 22-24, 2017 revealed that 41 percent of Americans did not consider Puerto Ricans as Americans while 15 percent were not sure. A large portion of the 43 percent of those who considered them as citizens of the US did not know when and how Puerto Ricans became Americans.
When Did Puerto Rico Become a US Territory?
Puerto Rico became a US territory after the US annexed it 1898 Spanish-American War. American lawmakers, academics, and state officials invented a strategy to annex territories which saw the US end up with overseas territories including Guam, Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, and American Samoa with the intention of using them for military and economic purposes without granting them statehood. To support the effort of expansion, lawmakers created constitutional interpretations to allow the US to govern the territories. In 1901, the supreme court ruled that territories inhabited by non-white populations annexed after 1898 would be "unincorporated territories" not meant to part of the union.
The Jones Act
In 1917, the Jones Act was enacted. The act included a citizenship provision that allowed those living in Puerto Rico to decide whether to retain their citizenship or become U.S citizens. The act did not change the territorial status and persons born in the island became U.S citizens by "jus sanguinis" (blood right). In 1940, Congress enacted the Nationality Act which conferred "jus soli," (right of soil) to those born on the island. Prior to 1940, a person born in Puerto Rico only became a citizen if both citizens were citizens of Puerto Rico. After 1940, any person who was born within the boundaries of Puerto Rico became a U.S citizen. The Nationality Act amended and replaced the Jones Act after it further stated that the island was to be part of the US for citizenship purposes. The law took effect on Jan. 13, 1941 and as a result, being born on the island amounted to being born in the U.S.
Puerto Rican Status Referendum
On June 11, 2017, the Puerto Rican status referendum was held to determine whether the island should become independent, a US state, or maintain the status quo. The referendum was boycotted by the pro-status quo PPD party, and only 23% of the population turned out to vote. Ninety-seven percent voted to be part of the US. The 2017 referendum was the fifth attempt to get Puerto Rico citizens to decide. Other referendums were held in 1967, 1993, 1998, and 2012. The parties who boycotted the referendum claimed that the US treated the island as its colony and even the title of the ballot was meant to present it as one. The notion of being a colony has always been rejected by the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). The ballot also stated that the island was under the plenary powers of the US Congress, a notion also rejected by the party. Although the majority of those who voted chose statehood, the turnover was very low, and the referendum was declared inconclusive. As of October 11th 2017, Puerto Rico was still an unincorporated territory of the United States.Table of contents
- Say "no"
- Surround yourself with related self-employed peeps
- Customer's interests prevails
- Follow courses
- Know when to stop
I have been a self-employed web developer since September 2019. It's been quite a ride. Let me share some of the most valuable lessons I've learned along the road.
Say "no"Say "no"
It's not as easy as it sounds. Especially if you feel a connection with the person you should say no to. Sometimes it's the best for both of you. Short term pain, long term gain.
By saying no you don't miss out on that one opportunity. It provides the space for other opportunities to present themselves to you, that you can take on.
Surround yourself with related self-employed peepsSurround yourself with related self-employed peeps
This lesson is probably one of the most valuable ones. Once I started to surround myself with self-employed copywriters, marketeers, designers and photo-/videographers, my projects elevated.
With a group of self-employed experts you get to take on bigger projects and produce higher quality results. Also, it's good fun to have some colleagues!
Customer's interests prevailsCustomer's interests prevails
Working with other self-employed is amazing, but keep the customer's interest in mind. This should be the end goal. Sometimes this means doing things you hate. Building a design you don't agree with for example. If it's beneficial for the client's interest, you should do the work. You will reap the benefits in the long run.
Is there too big of a mismatch between your customer's interest and yours? Thank them and say goodbye.
Follow coursesFollow courses
It can be tempting to take on a sh*tload of work and just keep grinding. But please, my fellow self-employed, stay knowledgable. Take courses, visit workshops and go to meet-ups once in a while.
Following courses is one of the best investments you can make, as it's an investment in yourself.
Know when to stopKnow when to stop
The freedom to work anytime seems tempting at first. But just because you have that freedom, doesn't mean you should take it. Find a rhythm that works for you.
Consistent work over a longer period of time makes success inevitable.
Those were some of the lessons I've learned in my time as a self-employed web developer. This list is going to be never-ending, but at the moment this is what I deem the most important ones.
Send me a tweet with your biggest self-employed lesson. Let's make a collection!J for FREE; just come to bar the day your name is on the calendar! Bring your friends and take advantage of the best deal in Denver.3 Helpful Tips for Choosing the Right Vitamin Supplements
There’s no doubt that the right type of vitamin supplement can be a good thing. If there’s not something you are getting from your diet, or if you have a health issue that requires more of a certain type of vitamin, supplements will certainly improve the quality of your health. How do you know which vitamins Vancouver are right for you? Here are some tips that will help.
Be Aware of Interactions Far too many people assume that natural supplements cannot be harmful. That’s not the case, Some can have interactions with medication while others can have harmful side effects when combine with other vitamins. In some cases, too much of a certain nutrient can trigger a health issue. Your best bet is to about any vitamins Vancouver that would be beneficial in your case, and that would not interact with any medicine that you have to take every day.
What Fillers Are Used? Fillers are sometimes used to preserve the vitamin or to keep it from falling apart. Do you know how much of a given brand of vitamin is filler products and how much is actual nutrients? One way to tell is look at the list of ingredients on the container. Research those ingredients and find out how many of them are fillers. If the amount of nutrition seems to be low, that’s a good reason to focus on a different brand.
Reputation Counts Never underestimate the importance of reputation when it comes to a vitamin manufacturer. Read reviews, check research into how the products are made, and in general educate yourself before buying. If the brand has a reputation for excellence and plenty of positive reviews, it’s worth a try. If what you read leaves you feeling doubtful, look for your vitamins Vancouver elsewhere. Remember that you have plenty of choices for vitamin supplements. Choose wisely and pay close attention to the way the product affects you. With the right dosage and a quality brand, you will be doing something good for yourself.ATK MusiQ – From Soweto to the World EP mp3 free download

The chances of dining at the same restaurant two nights running are not that large, especially as everyone loves Pizza!
We had a great catch-up with John,Clair,Colin,Megan,Paul,Lucy and Alan the Toffeeman! A lot had changed for the group in a year (One Wedding, a new baby with another on the way, two new students, an engagement and a potential new career choice) but it was like we all only saw each other the weekend before.
Before we go any further we need to mention a great sporting feat that occurred on the Friday afternoon at the Midleton College Sports Day 2015. Cameron Rose put his body on the line (and sprained his ankle in the process) to snatch Bronze in the U-15 Boys 200m before putting in a spirited performance in the Mixed Relay before “some silly girl dropped the baton”.
With his ‘Athlete’ brother Cameron now off school there was plenty of time to walk about Midleton and take it all in. In the last 18 months someone has found a bunch of money and culture has arrived in a big way, with a plethora of new statues and the like.
First up we have the ‘Wild Geese’ – an art installation on the old Goose’s Acre site. This was to represent the tradition of grazing geese in the town but a more modern interpretation would be that it represents the huge diaspora of young Midleton people. (The Wild Geese were Irish Soldiers who fought in European Armies most notably in the Spanish Army of Flanders and Napoleonic France).
The second is known as the Fenian Man. This depiction of a pikeman represents the 1798 Rebellion, armed with a pike (The forces of the United Irishmen were mainly composed of irregular units of pikemen) and the lack of uniform as most of the volunteers were just labourers or farmhands and not seasoned Red Coat Infantry.
The last statue we saw was the most impressive for both aesthetic purposes and because of it’s story. ‘Kindred Spirits’ by sculptor Alex Pentek commemorates one of the greatest acts of kindness that was ever shown to the Irish people. During the Great Irish Famines of the 1840s – the Choctaw Tribe of Native Americans sent aid, in the form of $710 to ease our woes. This gift has even more significance as it was offered not 15 years after the Trail of Tears – a dark chapter in American History.
A synopsis of the rest of John’s visit is as follows:
Keohane’s Chips…Visting his aunt Mary George…sampling the delicacies of Perry Street Cafe with Davy K and Clarkee…a few scoops with John Snr and Emmet…lots of computer games with Cameron and lots of pinches from his mum Helen…buying jeans far too big for himself… meeting up with Uncle Kevin and getting the low down on Catholic Weddings.
On a final note – there is one address in Midleton that has played a huge part of John’s life – 55 Main Street Midleton. Formerly occupied by British Crown Forces from 1919-1921, it was for a long time became the Midleton Arms Hotel before being taken over by the Rose Family in the late 1980s to become the Bar/Restaurant Roses Coach Inn (and John’s first home in Midleton) before transmutation into McDaid’s Bar – the only place to be seen in Midleton on a Saturday night. As John walked past for a look he noticed that it is currently being renovated having changed ownership for another time. Here is to the future!
The building itself was designed by Augustus Pugin (architect of the Westminster Houses of Parliament and a lot of the buildings we saw in Tasmania) and was originally comprised of two Late Gothic (or early Tudor style) townhouses. It’s plaque dates it at 1851 but some research would suggest that it was completed a bit earlier than that (being mentioned as part of improvements of the town by the then landlord, George, 5th Viscount Midleton.
Meanwhile in Scotland
Karen was welcomed home with banners and a homemade cake – it was just like when the contestants go home from the X factor! Before reaching home, Karen made a detour to Williamwood to visit her old Greenwich friend Susan who had moved back to Glasgow. We had a lovely lunch and a great catch up in Susan’s new house.
Sitting on the infamous train to Ayr from Glasgow, I enjoyed the scenery on the relatively short train ride – 50 mins is now a short journey after spending 18 hours on trains in Asia. Back in sunny Ayr, the week without John consisted of catching up with family, friends, wedding planning and wedding dress shopping.
No trip home would be complete without a good girly catch up with Irene, Sarah and Anne. We blethered so much we forgot to take photos- sign of a good night. We started with a few cocktails in the champagne bar – we had come a long way from the Press bar followed by tapas . No night would be complete without a night cap in the Counting House.
It was a fun week, Mum and I pampered ourselves at Lochside House Hotel Spa. We relaxed at the thermal suite before enjoying massages followed by lunch.
The relaxation was need as there was 3 days of dress shopping planned, thankfully not full days. Karen and mum started looking at styles and had such fun trying on everything from princess gowns to simple short dresses. With an idea of a style in mind Karen, Laura and Mum had an action packed Saturday visiting 3 dress shops. We started keen in Ayr, before hitting the road to Glasgow for a further 2 appointments. After shop 2 we were ready for a break and enjoyed a lovely thai lunch. With bloated tummies ( we never thought about rice bellies and trying on dresses while we enjoyed our lunch) we went to the final shop of the day…sadly the dresses were not to our taste and we spent the appointment pulling faces.
So a full day shopping and no dress or bridesmaid dress. Karen had more success the previous week with Emma- John’s sister in Cobh trying on bridesmaid dresses. Without a dress we still celebrated and enjoyed Laura’s homemade Prosecco Bellinis and a good girly catch up.
To ensure Dad never felt left out we went to Turnberry for family brunch on Sunday. We also invited him to fit the bill 😉 Thanks Dad. We had a lovely brunch followed by a walk around the beautiful grounds in the sunshine and even captured a few rare family photos.
Turnberry has quite a mixed history. Not only has it staged the Open Golf Championship of four separate occasions (last in 2009) and the Senior Open Championship (7 times), but it was used as an RAF Airbase during WWI and WWII, and most recently it the entire resort (3 Links Golf Courses and Hotel) has been bought by US Businessman (and Republican Presidential Candidate) Donald Trump. In a not surprising development he has changed the name to Trump Turnberry.
The most famous hole on the Ailsa Course is the 18th – named “The Duel In The Sun” in homage to the titanic battle between Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus at the 1977 Open Championship.
South Ayrshire is a beach destination and there were a few long walks along Ayr Beach, and visits to my Granny and a few sessions in the gym with mum made the week fly past.
It was time for the arrival of a certain Irishman…

Nahum 1:7 says, The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.
Deuteronomy 33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms:
I love knowing that God is my refuge no matter how fiercely the storms are raging.
Looking back on the whole experience in the rain got me thinking about the Christian life and life in general. Life here on earth is not always going to be easy 24/7. However, we can take comfort in knowing that similar to the natural rain, the storms of life, be it sickness, financial difficulties, loss of job, relationship issues: none of them last forever. Storms are not permanent. There will be thunder. There will be lightning. There will be wind. There will be rain. Some of the storms of life will last for a short time while others may last for decades, but eventually, they too will pass.Source: Lenovo

Producing Olefins for Use in Gasoline, Jet and Diesel Fuels from Chemicals Obtained from Levulinic Acid INVENTORS • James Dumesic, David Martin Alonso, Jesse Bond, Dong Wang, Ryan West WARF: P100099US01 View U.S. Patent No. 8,410,326 in PDF format. Since its founding in 1925 as the patenting and licensing organization for the University of Wisconsin- The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) is seeking commercial partners interested in developing a process and apparatus to produce hydrocarbons from aqueous solutions of lactones, hydroxyl-carboxylic acids, alkene-carboxylic acids or alcohols. OVERVIEW worked with researchers in relevant disciplines, understand industries and markets, and have negotiated innovative licensing strategies to meet the Levulinic acid is a biomass-derived compound that can be obtained inexpensively in high yields from waste cellulose-containing materials. It has been identified as a top biomassderived chemical due to its ease of production for both five and six carbon sugars and its useful functional groups, a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Levulinic acid can be used to form other, more valuable chemicals including gamma-valerolactone (GVL). individual needs of business clients. GVL is valuable as a renewable platform molecule with potential in developing both renewable energy and chemicals. GVL retains high energy content and performs comparably to ethanol as a fuel blending agent. However, characteristics such as high water solubility, blending limits for use in conventional combustion engines and lower energy density compared to petroleum-derived fuels have limited the use of GVL in the transportation sector. Therefore, a method is needed to convert lactones such as GVL into liquid alkenes or alkanes with molecular weights targeted for direct use in transportation. THE INVENTION UW-Madison researchers have developed a method and apparatus for producing olefins (unsaturated hydrocarbons) in the C8 to C16 range from GVL. The method involves two tubular flow reactors and an inter-stage separator in a single catalytic system. The chemical transformation proceeds via conversion of GVL to an n-butene, which is then introduced into a second reactor where the butene is converted via acid catalyzed oligomerization to higher molecular weight olefins (C8 and longer). High pressure CO2 is an additional by-product of the reaction. In addition to GVL, lactones, hydroxyl-carboxylic acids, alkene-carboxylic acids, alcohols or a mixture thereof can be reacted using this method to produce longer-chain olefins. The olefins produced with this method are of carbon chain-length and molecular weight suited for use in gasoline, jet and diesel fuels. Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation | 614 Walnut Street, 13th Floor | Madison, WI 53726 | [email protected] | WARF: P100099US01 APPLICATIONS • Olefins in suitable molecular weight range can be used in transportation fuels. • High pressure CO2 stream can be sequestered or used in further processing. KEY BENEFITS • Produces olefins from GVL obtained from biomass, an inexpensive and renewable resource • Converts GVL to olefins in an integrated system requiring no additional purification • Synthesizes long-chain olefins (C8+) at high yields and selectivities ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Related Technologies For more information about producing liquid fuels from levulinic acid, see WARF reference number P09298US.

As a country, it is but a small island in the Indian Ocean. Its coastline borders the coastal region of east coast of Asia and its western part sticks to the Gulf of Thailand. It is one of the few countries that manufactures both eyewear and sunglasses. It is easy to see why eyewear Malaysia has been flourishing with such a large population and fast-paced developments.
Eyewear has become one of the most popular consumer goods in the last decade. From varying cultures and wide geographic margins, people from different demographics are now becoming huge consumers of this global eyewear industry. For instance, according to the IDEA Business Research, a survey by Market Research Asia Pacific, Malaysian citizens spend US$ 6.2 billion on eyewear every year. This makes it a progressive market as a number of manufacturers from Asia are establishing themselves here to tap this lucrative market.
There are a number of reasons behind the success of eyewear Malaysia. This being a small country with a vibrant market, producers have a big chance to introduce unique designs to capture a large slice of this lucrative market. Moreover, with a thriving optometrist base, the demand for highly-priced lenses and glasses of all brands is also peaking. As a result, eyewear suppliers have found some great opportunities to penetrate the market and offer state-of-the-art services and prescription lenses.
The rise of a number of brands in eyewear Malaysia has also changed the lens of pricing. An independent optometrist’s optical shop can now provide services similar to those being offered by leading brands in Europe and North America. In fact, the cost of high-end eyewear in Malaysia is lower than what we expect in the West. Therefore, many consumers are choosing eyewear from independent optical shops in Malaysia over more expensive alternatives.
Many eyewear manufacturers in Malaysia offer contact lenses and spectacles that feature fashionable frames, such as the ones that are so popular in Japan or China. However, there are some notable exception in the eyewear range. Only a few brands are well-known and offer stylish, technologically advanced frames. Carl Zeiss Vision, for example, is well-known for high quality eyewear and Carl Zeiss sunglasses. These brands cater to a segment of consumers who prefer eyewear with sophisticated designs and sophisticated styling.
Some eyewear manufacturers in Malaysia do not cater for professional users. Amateur enthusiasts have a great number of choices when it comes to selecting eyewear of their own. Some even prefer to purchase second-hand spectacles or sunglasses from vintage shows, garage sales, auctions and other sources. These consumers want stylish products at an affordable price. Some consumers are also looking for eyewear that is affordable and not compromise on quality.
The fastest growing segment for eyewear Malaysia manufacturers is revenue generation spectacles. High-end lenses and frames are affordable. To reduce the costs of replacement and maintenance, a large number of disposable lens users opt for them. They often decide to return the old style glasses after realizing how poor quality they are. Many eyewear Malaysian manufacturers have started to design high-tech frames and lenses that are durable, long-lasting, and profitable.
Manufacturers of eyewear in Malaysia are now focusing on daily use products. These include daily contact lenses, progressive lenses and extended wear lenses. They are designed to cater to the specific needs of daily users. There are many options for malaysians when it comes lenses, including bifocal or trifocal. Young adults prefer trifocal lenses, while presbyopia sufferers can use bifocal lenses.10 Best Home Office Desks to Blend Function and Style

Complete Guide on Choosing the Best Home Office Desk
When it comes to choosing the best home office furniture, you should consider the items that blend form and function in order to meet your needs. Before you start with the selection process, you should answer a few key questions:
- How large surface area do you need?
- Do you need an additional storage system?
- Do you use a computer?
- Is your room space-limited?
- It would be best if you chose based on your tasks. If you work with computer setups, select the item that accommodates all computer peripherals, leaving enough space for spreading out papers you may need.
- Choose by desk’s function. You can select a clear surface area for writing, an item designed with computers in mind, or a desk with many drawers and shelves for additional room.
- Think about the space you have to offer.
- Think about the shape that meets your needs. You can select a space-efficient model that fits the corners of your apartment.
- Include the ergonomics as a choosing parameter. You will like to have ample legroom, monitor position, sit-and-stand option, and enough space to store notebooks, pens, and cups.
- Consider the materials that matter. Wooden options bear a classic, timeless look, while glass and metal options deliver a clean, modern vibe.ROCKROOSTER Men's 9 inch Golden Brown leather Logger Work Boots, Composite Toe, Waterproof, Kevlar Anti-Puncture, ASTM 2413-11 I/75 C/75 EH PR

What is Zendesk?
Zendesk is a ticketing and knowledge base software. Microsoft Flight Simulator uses Zendesk to receive bug reports and support tickets.
Are bugs and issues tracked in Zendesk?
No, unlike other software like Jira or Github, Zendesk is not designed as a bug and issue tracker.
Microsoft Flight Simulator bugs and issues are tracked in a separate software internally.
How do I know if you have received my bug reports?
You will receive a copy of your ticket by email and a confirmation that we have received your bug report. If you haven't received any email, please check your spam folder and add support@flightsimulator.zendesk.com to your list of contacts.

Before submitting a new bug, visit the Known Issues list. If your issue is not listed in the Known Issues list head to the Bugs & Issues forum. There you can search if a bug or issue has already been reported.
When will you fix the bug I reported?
Unfortunately, we cannot provide any ETA as to when a specific bug will be fixed in-game. The Community team produces a weekly snapshot and a community triage update. Do not miss our Weekly Development Updates.
Will you let me know when the bug I reported is fixed in-game?
No, you will not receive further updates or an answer to your bug report. To know if a bug has been fixed, please refer to the Release notes.

Lending Club Debuts Line of Credit Option for Small Businesses
This new product will give entrepreneurs the ability to cover unexpected expenses and invest in improvements without taking out a lump sum loan up front. Lending Club’s vice president of small business recently told NerdWallet, “We had feedback from customers that what they wanted was a more flexible product… If they are borrowing $100,000, they don’t necessary want all of it upfront. What they want is a bit more flexibility to be able to draw down on that as they need the funds.”
Like their term loans, Lending Club allows entrepreneurs to borrow up to $300,000. The qualifications are similar as well, requiring applicants to be in business for at least two years, have $75,000 in annual revenue, own at least 20% of the business, and have at least fair personal credit. Different from the term loans, a 1 to 2% draw fee will be assessed when you use your line of credit. However, there is no cost to start the line of credit nor are there any monthly maintenance or inactivity fees.
Similar to a credit card once funds are drawn from a Lending Club small business line of credit, the borrower will pay 4% of the loan principal back per month plus interest. However, one big benefit of using a line of credit instead of a card is that your loan will be paid off in no more than 25 months, assuming you make the required monthly payments. Additionally Lending Club’s annual interest rate (starting at 6%) is lower than your average business credit card.
Lending Club’s small business line of credit is one more option for entrepreneurs who already have a lot to consider. While a line of credit may be comforting to a business owner looking for a safety cushion, those looking at making a single large purchase for their business may still prefer a term loan (from an online lender or otherwise). Still, it is encouraging to see Lending Club expanding their offerings for small business — making good on their promise to get into other areas of credit. It will be interesting to see how they and other FinTech companies continue to change the credit system overall in the coming years.In step with the beginning of the new academic year in Iran, the clerical regime has activated its mechanisms for gender discrimination.

So what does that $150,000 price tag get you? Well, for starters, the watch is a part of a highly exclusive limited edition of just 10 pieces. It comes with a 45mm titanium case, capped off with a domed anti-reflective sapphire crystal. Underneath is pristine casing sits the watch’s piece-de-resistance, a tourbillion encased within a Death Star Cage. Designed to rotate once each minute, the tourbillion lends accuracy to the watch, while the skeletal-shaped Death Star gives it an eerie appeal that commands the attention, allegiance, and respect the dark-side expects from you. Look closely and you’ll also notice the watch’s hour hand is actually a miniature Imperial-Class Star Destroyer, while the minute hand is a Super-Class Star Destroyer. Together, both aircrafts make several orbits around the Death Star throughout the day, creating a miniature universe on your wrist! The watch’s outer body honors the extended Star Wars universe too, with hand-finished decoration techniques including Star Wars iconography such as the esthetic Galactic Empire emblem and the Aurebesh script.
The watch comes along with an elaborately designed Imperial kyber crystal container, crafted at 1:2 scale. Open it up and you’re greeted by three vials, one containing the Death Star watch, another housing an extra strap, and a third encasing an actual kyber crystal prop used from the film Rogue One!

Polar bears are excellent swimmers, although they paddle with only their front paws and cannot dive deeply. Global warming can also reduce the ice on which the bears live and hunt, threatening their survival. They live in regions where the sea freezes in winter, chiefly along the northern coasts and islands of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia.
They range throughout the Arctic Ocean as far north as the North Pole but remain more common near land.

Background: The development of modern medical and pharmaceutical science has garnered lots of attention due to the development of targeted therapy and precision medicine. The current focus of the researchers is on developing strategies which provide the maximum therapeutic benefits with minimal adverse effects. In this scenario, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) have gained prominence because of their ability to improve the therapeutic properties of the drugs.
Objective: In this review, we focus on some of the important methods involved in the preparation and characterization of the NLCs. We also discuss the application of NLC as a drug delivery system through different routes of administration and its role in overcoming the physiological and anatomical barriers.
Methods: The literature was collected from different scientific browsers like sciencedirect, google scholar, pubmed and a total of 155 articles were read and analysed for the content.
Results: The NLC improve the solubility and bioavailability of the drug, prolong the release and residence time and delay clearance. They also protect the drugs from enzymatic degradation and allow them to pass through different anatomical and physiological barriers.
Conclusion: Though the use of NLCs has been reported across different therapeutic indications through various routes of administration, this success at the laboratory level has not gone to the next stage. One of the reasons for the failure of NLC formulations to progress to the next level could be due to toxicity caused by the accumulation of NLCs in organs. Hence, in order to utilize this strategy to its maximum potential, further research is inevitable.

Additionally, the Latina population is more and more changing into „major wage earners and influencers“ in the trendy Hispanic United States Household. Patterns of feminine family structure are discovered to be related in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and are typically more matrifocal. Conversely, Mexican and Costa Rican girls are often migrating from a patriarchal husband-wife system, with just 13% and 22% of households headed by girls in these international locations, respectively. Puerto Rico lies someplace between these two systems, sharing features of each patriarchal and matrifocal techniques. According to a examine revealed by the National Institute of Health, these patterns correspond with comparatively low feminine participation within the labor force.

Celia Cruz, born in Havana, Cuba, was well-known for her Cuban-inspired salsa music and many Latin and American Grammy’s. Not solely was she famous for her vocals, however she made many Hollywood appearances, leading to a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. By having such a wide, numerous viewers, she left her mark on America’s popular culture as a female Cuban immigrant. Like Celia, Gloria Estefan was born in Cuba and is arguably probably the most well-known Cuban American singer to date. Her Latin music flooded American radio stations and television features, bringing Latina presence into American pop culture.
Having began out in Skye’s attic apartment in Boston, the group now meets in ten cities in the US and in six international locations across the globe. Online conferences imply it reaches even farther afield, attracting Latin academics, college students, archivists, historians and all those trying to deepen their data of the language and its historical past. With two conferences set to take place this summer time in Florence, The Florentine chatted with Skye Shirley to search out out more. These tendencies can’t be defined by development of the general female inhabitants, or simply by the increase within the complete variety of prisoners. Rather, the driving force behind the info is the adoption of punitive drug laws that disproportionately affect ladies. In the majority of Latin American countries, drug-related crimes are the main explanation for feminine incarceration. For occasion, available information shows that in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela, drug-related offenses are the most typical offense for feminine prisoners.

It also raises a dialogue about the want for the redesign a stable safety community that’s environment friendly and economically viable. This stereotype is heavily present with people assuming the Latin American folks they encounter every day don’t perceive a word they’re saying, or, worse, they mock them when they attempt to talk with restricted English. There tends to be a double commonplace in these interactions, as solely 20% of native-born Americans can speak a second language properly enough to hold a dialog. Research has actually shown that Latin American women often have sexual relations later in life than White women.
As the collection moves via 18th-century works into the nineteenth century, it exhibits how ladies writers incrementally gained entry to the writing world outside of spiritual contexts. Initially, they wrote beneath pseudonyms or anonymously, however from this place they were in a place to start the critique of their own status within heavily patriarchal societies. Included from this era are works by Clorinda Matto de Turner , Juana M. Gorriti , Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda , Delmira Agustini , and Julia Lopes Almeida , amongst others. A number of essential figures from the early twentieth century are additionally current, such as Alfonsina Storni , Juana de Ibarbourou , Gabriela Mistral , and Clarice Lispector . Though women’s rights were included within the original UN constitution, the UN didn’t interact in substantive work on women’s rights until June of 1975, when the United Nations Decade for Women kicked off with the World Conference on Women held in Mexico City. This convention spurred additional regional women’s organizing in Latin America, including feminist encuentros, which have occurred every few years in Latin America since the early Eighties. The UN’s Decade for Women was twenty years, culminating in 1995 with a convention in Beijing.
Latinas are girls of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central American, North South American, or Spanish origin. Currently, there are over 20 million immigrant girls residing within the United States. The American Immigration Council states that the majority of those immigrant girls come from Mexico, which means that the primary demographic of immigrant girls in the united states are Latina.
Better data assortment and transparency will facilitate the implementation of insurance policies to focus on gender-based violence. Authorities can profit from targeted applications on technical help and secure and dependable data reporting like the InfoSegura.org project, a joint UNDP and USAID effort in Central America to offer information on gender-based violence. Reliable knowledge yields optimistic, long-lasting effects that enable authorities to develop solutions based on dependable data and monitor policy implementation outcomes.
The Software Program Pay Hole In Mexico
In Chile, activists successfully pressured politicians to implement gender parity within the legislative physique tasked with drafting a new Constitution. Without more specific interventions concentrating on the economic autonomy of ladies during the pandemic, it will be tough to overcome the reversal of decades of efforts in the promotion of gender equality.

It could appear apparent, but it’s worth emphasizing that it’s never a good suggestion to feed into adverse stereotypes about an ethnic minority. By turning into more educated about this kind of messaging, everybody can do their part to create more numerous and equitable areas in a quantity of arenas. Helping Latin American adults and children prosper can solely help our nation on its lengthy street latin girls to progress in reducing racial discrimination. A research from the Bell Policy Center examined the influence of undocumented immigrant labor in Colorado. The examine discovered that for each job held by an undocumented immigrant, zero.eight additional jobs are created. As the United States has continued to undergo a reckoning with regard to racial and social injustice, many people have been keen to examine and refute harmful stereotypes about minority groups.Sand making machine Sand making machine for saleChat Online

People often took advantage of the existence of our ocean. As you know the ocean covers most parts of the Earth’s surface, like two-third of it. Without water, we can hardly survive living on Earth. For example, the sea plants, for example, Posidonia, produces about 70% of the oxygen that we use to breathe. Many people who work at the sea like marine services Malaysia often come back and tell their wondrous stories about the sea. Just imagine because of the lack of our responsibilities as the smartest creature on this planet, these wonderful gifts disappear?
One of the reasons why the sea is so important to us is because the ocean gives us more oxygen than the Amazones. Typically, we think the rainforests are our primary resources of oxygen, but in fact, the rainforests only produce 28% of oxygen, while the sea pretty much gives us more than 70% of oxygen. But how does it really work because we basically do not see any plants or forest in the middle of the sea? Actually, we have these tiny living creatures living in the sea called Phytoplankton that is known as microscopic plants, it works the same as trees which absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.
Another reason is the ocean regulates the earth’s climate. On basic understanding, the ocean basically soaks the heat and delivers warm water from the equator to the poles, and cold water from the poles to the tropics. Without all these normal behaviors from the ocean, some regions might have to go through extreme weather and only fewer places would be habitable for human beings. In another word, the water absorbs carbon dioxide, in order to maintain the carbon cycle, and based on the temperatures on earth, it balances everything up. You can imagine it as the primary control system of our global climate.
Last but as important, that the ocean is an important source of our food. You can say that the primary source of protein is the ocean for literally more than a billion people. Fish has about 15.7 of animal protein consumed globally. Some people who cannot consume insects or other animals can basically consume edible seaweed as good alternatives in order to gain more protein. As our world population grows about 1.5 million people every week, the ocean is something we rely on continuously more, especially for survival, and nutritious food sources.

To conclude, we have so many kinds of awareness and organizations who hand in hand spreads this information and help especially in getting people to acknowledge the importance of taking care of our oceans. Yet, people still take it very lightly as the ocean is known to be quite big and the problems are hardly visible to humans’ eyes. As we grow older, our future generations are slowly taking and moving towards becoming our new leaders and how do we expect them to know our responsibilities in managing our oceans when we did not do it in the first place?
Culture is not just for your employees, it's for anyone who comes into contact with your company - that includes jobs candidates! If you're waiting till the in-person interview to highlight your culture, take a step back and think again. It's critical to make sure you have the right candidates - both as skill and culture fits. So put your culture out there! Here are three things that every applicant should know about your culture [and how to embed them]:
If you look at any career page or job description from a company that prioritizes their culture, you can tell how important it is for each employee to maintain that sense of community and be a part of it. Here are some examples:
If your culture isn’t highlighted on your website or your job postings, start drafting some descriptions up! Ask yourself these three questions to help you get started:
Jot your ideas down and ask a colleague to do the same, and then see what grows out of it!
Hear us on this first; your office space should definitely reflect your culture. When your candidates walk into your office, they should feel your unique culture around them. Your culture, however, is not just about the physical space. It’s about the interactions among employees, customers, and all who come in contact with your business.
In Delivering Happiness the book, our co-founder Tony Hsieh recounts how in the earlier days of Zappos, hiring managers would follow up with their airport/hotel shuttle drivers to see how candidates treated them.
It’s easy to think that culture is confined to space, but truly living the culture is something you take with you anywhere you go. As our CEO Jenn Lim says, “culture is what happens when your boss isn’t looking.”
Questions to think about:
I once interned for a start-up company with a lot of cool perks: free lunches, happy hours, etc. As their venture capital funding was tightening, some of these perks disappeared, and people were becoming very disgruntled. I thought, “if the culture was dependent on free lunches, how adaptable was it really?” Don’t get me wrong; free lunch is awesome. But if your talent is only at the company for the perks, their motivation to stay only goes so far. Thankfully management at the company addressed these changes with honesty and transparency, instead of leaving it to an email notice to deliver the bad news.
So how can you tell the story of your culture in a way that shows how adaptable it is? Talk about it!
Your culture transformed into what it is today and continues to evolve. Share stories about changes you’ve implemented and the results that you’ve seen, even share some hiccups along the way. Some of our clients, like Century 21, have implemented creating Culture Books, which showcase employee reviews of their culture - both good and bad and present different culture initiatives and events that have happened throughout the year.
This sense of transparency will go far in building trust with your candidate and giving them an idea of how invested your company is the betterment of the culture.
After embedding culture into their hiring practices, Canpa's job applicants increased from 60 to 600! Get the full case study:Blackjack Slots Gets the Best Odds
Blackjack Slots Gets the Best Odds
There are a number of casino game options that you have accessible to you at your casino. When you initially visit the casino, ask the dealer which game is the most familiar with. It might be surprising but some of the most popular casino game options are in fact variations of the same game. This means that the casino is trying to get you to familiarize yourself with probably the most often used choice.
There are three basic categories of casino games: table games, video gaming machines, and random variety games. Most gaming machines, including slots and pachinko, can be played by only 1 person at a time and don’t require the eye of casino personnel to play. Some tables, like the roulette wheel, require two different people to play and are thus more exciting than the traditional machine. Most random casino games are far better for group play because each person gets the chance to select a number and then everyone whips out their arms together to see what number the blackjack should come up with.
The best probability of winning are always entirely on gaming machines. Should you have a specific game plan, it is very important to stick to it. If you are betting with a friend, they will each choose a number and then bet accordingly. In the event that you change your mind game, you have a far better chance at winning the wager if it was made using the same tactic.
A simple game like roulette can be analyzed utilizing a binomial distribution or a standard distribution. Binomial distributions take the data that is presented for you and try to fit a normal distribution around it. If you analyze a binomial distribution, you’re actually considering probability statistics. Standard deviation may be the volatility or difference in benefit of the results over the average of the outcomes. Using this simple game like roulette offers you the best odds of earning.
There are lots of explanations why playing blackjack at the best odds is a good idea. Blackjack is really a game of probability; if you are playing a blackjack at the best odds, you have the very best chance of winning. You would stand a much higher chance of winning in the event that you betted on blackjack when it was played at less normal deviation. Standard deviation values are not easy to calculate, but they are important to understand when coming up with blackjack bets. It is usually difficult to predict the outcomes of a blackjack game due to the chaotic environment it finds itself in, so it’s better to bet it at the very best chances.
Another great casino game that is played at the very best odds is craps. Craps may also be a great game to play at home. There are many individuals who enjoy playing craps and several people who appreciate using craps tables at land-based casinos. Craps is a game that can be played with just about anyone since just about anyone can play craps. Despite the fact that many people enjoy enjoying craps at land-based casinos, it can still be fun to play craps at an on the net casino because lots of people don’t know how exactly to play craps on a computer and therefore they find yourself losing big money in the process. However, lots of people still enjoy playing craps on the net because of the fact that it is free to engage in online.
As well as playing at the best odds, you may also want to consider playing your casino games at online casinos that have a house edge. A house edge is basically the money that you must risk in order to make a certain amount of money. For instance, in case you are playing craps at a gambling establishment with a two percent property edge, you’re essentially betting two hundred dollars for each individual hand. In case you are playing the slots, you may be gambling a thousand dollars. Both of these games employ a small house edge, and therefore you can still turn a profit if you succeed.
Therefore, by changing the sort of casino activity you play from slots to craps or vice versa, you can still make a profit in the event that you win. It is possible to simply change the sort of game that you will be betting on so that you will are getting the best odds available for that one game. Thus, by playing online blackjack and even poker, it is possible to still have the best odds at gambling house gambling.Asian stocks higher as investors watch corporate earnings.

While building your own media room is a great alternative to forking out to go to the cinema, one of the key ingredients is your choice of flooring material.
It’s pretty fair to state that most of us enjoy a night out at the movies. With the comfortable lounge chairs, popcorn, blacked out theatre and of course the big screen itself, it’s an experience that can be difficult to replicate at home in front of the television.
However, it’s also an experience that’s been sorely missed for many Australians over the last eighteen months, particularly for those in New South Wales and Victoria who have had it pretty tough with ongoing lockdowns. Unfortunately, thanks to the very nature of it’s enclosed space, the cinema has regularly been one of the first social experiences to be shut down.
As such, installing a media room at home has been a particularly trending topic. If you can’t take a trip to the cinema, why not bring the cinema to you? If you have a boxier room with little natural light, it’s the perfect opportunity to create your very own home cinema – after all, it’s the one room of the house where natural light is a burden as opposed to being a benefit. Unfortunately, even if you get the aesthetics right, even the best home media room can come unstuck without the right acoustics, which is when your choice of flooring material can have a massive influence.
Understanding Flooring Materials And Acoustics
If you’re going to invest in high-quality sound for your home theatre, it’s important not to forget about customising the room in order to maintain the acoustics, which is where your choice of flooring comes into play.
Carpet is used for a variety of purposes, including insulating a person’s feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor, and adding a specific decoration or colour to a room. In fact, many would agree that it’s long been regarded as the material to opt for if you’re chasing a warmer or more ‘homey’ feeling.
Since sound waves bounce off of hard surfaces easier and travel further, a room with hard flooring like timber, laminate or vinyl could easily turn your brand new (and often expensive) sound system into the equivalent of audio sludge. When sound waves are allowed to bounce freely off hard surfaces, audio clarity is lost, and the sound from your speakers will come out as cluttered and noisy.
Thankfully, a high performing carpet can go a long way when it comes to avoiding this. Carpet absorbs ambient noises, and reduces echoes by keeping sound from bouncing around your home media room. The fibrous nature of carpet causes it to rap and disperse sound waves, which contrasts a hardwood or concrete floor that allows the sound to bounce off it much easier.
As a general rule, carpet softens harsh sounds and creates a quieter, more peaceful indoor environment. However, it’s also incredibly good at keeping noises in, ensuring that any sounds omitted by your home media room stay in that space, without disturbing the rest of the household.
It’s also worth noting that not all carpet products were made equally. Carpets all have different gradings when it comes to sound absorption and acoustic levels, but homeowners also need to consider the other factors that may influence their selection, such as if they have pets, children, how much foot traffic the space is expected to get, and even how much maintenance and upkeep they’re willing to commit to. As such, it’s always a good idea to have a chat with the professionals before you start shopping to ensure that you pick the most suitable option that lines up with your needs.
Sourcing Media Room Flooring From The Professionals
While your options for carpet flooring are almost limitless, selecting the right type for your home media room.
For those on the hunt for the best media room flooring material, we recommend opting for a product from the Feltex carpet range. With over eighty years of experience, Feltex Carpets have set the benchmark globally when it comes to producing the highest quality wool blend and wool carpets.

Show re-commissioned by promotion company to stars
TALENTED Newcastle-born singer Anna Reay has attracted a promotions company responsible for bringing acts including Roy Chubby Brown, Foster and Alan and The Commitments to venues across the region.
Durham-based entertainment company Steven Lloyd Promotions has commissioned Anna’s One Enchanted Evening show, which was previously a sell-out Valentine’s Day performance at Sage Gateshead, at Spennymoor Leisure Centre on September 2.
The 500-seater venue has attracted acts such as The Drifters featuring Ray Lewis, and Roy Chubby Brown amongst others.
Steven Lloyd said: “I am determined to bring the best entertainment to all parts of the region and not just to the popular venues in the main cities. We have so many wonderful venues with easier access for many that it seems a shame not to utilise them.
“Following her sell out show in February, demand was building for another date so I’m delighted to be able to add Anna Reay into the mix – she is such an amazing talent and is captivating to her audience. It was a great show at Sage Gateshead and I am excited to be able to bring it to Spennymoor.
“I also want a good mix of entertainment so that there is something for everyone. Roy Chubby Brown sold out for July and we have more brilliant acts coming up later in the year.”
Anna and her band will be performing songs from the most popular West End shows as well as an eclectic mix of love songs from artists such as Sam Smith, Michael Buble, Etta James, Cilla Black, Maria Callas, and Ed Sheeran and will be joined on stage by special guest, award-winning crooner Chris Dakers.
Classically trained, Anna says One Enchanted Evening is heavily influenced by her time in Italy. She said: “The culture of Italy and the world-famous singers who originated from there such as one of my all-time favourites, Andrea Bocelli, inspired me to incorporate some of that passion into the show as well as including a bit of the West End and modern songs.
“The Band and I are delighted to be doing the show again and are looking forward to performing at Spennymoor”
Since her early debut performances in various intimate venues across the North East, the 34-year old singer has embarked on extensive tours of the UK, Europe and the USA as well as luxury cruise liners, and has sang arias in front of thousands at football matches.
Anna has also been featured on numerous international TV and radio shows and was shortlisted for the Women in Business Best Cultural and Creative Business and Social Entrepreneur in 2008.
Tickets are £15.00 and are available from the Box Office on 03000 261161 or from. Performance is on Friday September 2, 2016 at 7.30pm

There’s no doubt that underground bass music has been booming this year, and among the slew of talented producers who have seen success in 2021 is Floret Loret. With releases on labels like Deadbeats, mau5trap, and Bassrush, his fresh sound has received well-deserved praise from producers and bass music fans alike. Additionally, he’s taken the stage at some of the scene’s most beloved festivals such as Okeechobee and Infrasound while also supporting artists such as Minnesota and Tsuruda to take fans on a trip into the depths of his sound. Now, he’s setting course on a new journey with the release of the In Maroon EP.
Floret Loret’s In Maroon EP gives a unique flavor to experimental bass music. The four tracks found within it act as a perfect follow-up to his recent Undulations EP and bring plenty of ambiance with a heavy dose of bass added in for good measure. When creating this release, Floret Loret surrounded himself with shades of red to further channel the mood and help paint the imagery of a deep red sea.
The premise of this project was to use color association to help influence the creative process by surrounding myself with different shades of red. I changed the colors in my DAW to different shades of red, the lights in my room as well.. ‘In Maroon’ helps tie this project together, summarizing my results/end product of this experiment.Floret Loret
“Submerged“ kicks off the project with a deep and eerie vibe fitting its name. Although it starts with an emotive buildup, this downtempo track leads into a melody that makes you feel like you’re twirling through the waves with the bass. Coming in hot with a wonky change of pace is “Blackbox Jellyfish” which brings in some grimy bass as a solid change of pace.
The elements on “Blackbox Jellyfish” help set the tone for the third track, “FishHop,” a single released ahead of the full EP that became an immediate favorite with its infectious, bouncy but still heavy beat. It’s the kind of bass tune you later find stuck in your head and can’t help but move to when it plays. Then, Floret Loret wraps up the EP with a tune that shows off his style and range, “Depths.” This track is both dark and beautiful as the deep basslines lead into the midsection that turns ambient, beautiful, and uplifting.
In Maroon not only showcases Floret Loret’s range with sounds bass enthusiasts are sure to love, but it is also thoughtfully and emotionally crafted. As he continues to push boundaries in his music, the color-association concept, or experiment, in this project can’t go without praise. It really goes to show his dedication to the craft and the lengths he will go to express his emotions through his music. Whether you crave wonkier bass music or have a soft spot for downtempo, you’re sure to hear and love both on this project.

The Citizen Nighthawk line is one of the most coveted lines of watches from the Citizen brand in the UK. These watches are mainly inspired by the classic watches of pilots. It has been reinterpreted in various designs to update its look as homage to its distinguished place in Citizen’s history.
The newest models of Citizen Nighthawk in the UK did not shed in its aviator roots. They are designed to adapt modern styling.
“Since it is hard to choose the best watches from the Citizen Nighthawk line, we pick the top two watches that we think deserves all the accolades accorded to a timepiece with such unique lineage,” says an editor from a watch review site in the UK.
Here are the two watches that stood out in the Nighthawk line based on reviews from watch aficionados.
Citizen Nighthawk CA0295-58E
This handsome timepiece comes in all its all-black glory. It catches the attention of watch collectors because of its discreet aesthetics and appeal. Many watch savants may be put off by its lack of luminescence, but it appeals to Gen Z and Millennials as it exudes both class and laidback.
A Nighthawk timepiece like this model is built to last with its ion-plated steel body. Although the coatings can bear scuff marks in time, its hardened mineral crystal can remain relatively scratch-free after frequent use.
Other than the Eco-Drive technology, it does not boast much tech. However, it has a fully functional 2-dial chronograph and a Japanese quartz movement system. The watch too is conveniently priced and has enough versatility and features for value for money.
Citizen Nighthawk BX101-53E
The next Citizen Nighthawk UK model that watches critics rave about is the one from the Promaster series. This line is famous as a top choice for adventurers because of its professional-grade features. Combining it with the Nighthawk series gives you a watch of contemporary and basic tech features.
This watch features a classic design and a modern twist. Some of its exciting features include 26 time zones and a perpetual calendar. It also has a minimalist case with a brushed stainless-steel bracelet. All in all, this watch has a seamless design, good luminescence, and versatility that can match any outfit.
While it does not excel in its technology features like the rest of the models, it is the one that has all the practical features you will ever need. Sometimes, more features added to a simple timepiece can only complicate its use. And this model has read the memo.
There are plenty of watches under the Citizen Nighthawk line. There might be other watches that deserve a place on this list. However, these two models are what most watch collectors would love to have.SEA-FIRE PROTECTS OFFSHORE COMMUNICATIONS HUB

Don’t you just love how pretty this look is? I think it looks so great paired with a pink sheer lip. I know I always mention this in my tutorials, but I can’t stress this enough. Use gel or liquid eyeliner to draw clean lines–NOT pencil. It’s so hard to control a pencil and, no matter how sharp it is, you just can’t get the lines precise enough. Seriously, eyeliner doesn’t have to be hard. If you don’t have the steadiest of hands, go for gel and apply it with a brush. If you’re a pro, then use liquid. I like to use pencil liners to line my waterlines and smudged out as a base under smoky eyes.
I thought it would be fun to pair my edgy (minus the) leather (that is faux leather in EXPRESS language) moto jacket with a pretty chiffon top and frilly facinator headband to compliment this look. From the makeup to the accessories, I kept it consistent with the girly-punk look.
As I said earlier, I kept this look pretty toned down, but if you wanted a more intense smoky eye, just add more Asphalt and pull it further out of the crease. I have small eyelids and small creases, so these looks can easily get really overpowering if I’m not careful. You have to remember to adapt this look (and any look for that matter) to your own eye shape, but that’s most important with any bold, smoky look.
Ta ta for now, folks!! Thank you again so so much for supporting me and encouraging me throughout this series. You’ll never know how much you all mean to me, and I won’t ever be able to thank you enough. I hope y’all enjoy all of the other things I have planned just as much. Please leave comments for any tutorials, TAGs, vlogs, etc you’d like to see from me in the future. Now that I’ve finished this series, I can be more flexible with my filming schedule.

There are a lot of beauty gurus doing smoked palette tutorials, but yours are by far the best! I’ve LOVED this series and I can’t wait to see what you have in store for us with the Vice palette!
Thanks so much!! I’m so glad you’ve liked this series!! I can’t wait to get going on the Vice Palette and do more with my Naked2. I’m ready to do lots of super wearable looks after all these smoky eyes!
It smudges so much…are there any tips to prevent it from smudging?
Is it smudging throughout the day? Or are you having fall out issues? If it’s smudging throughout the day, be sure you’re wearing an eye primer underneath your shadow. If you’ve got oily skin/eyelids, I’ve heard Too Faced Shadow Insurance is a great one! If you’re having fall out issues, there are a couple of things that might help. 1. Be sure to knock off excess shadow on your hand. 2. Dampen your brush with a LITTLE water or a baby wipe before applying the shadow. Good luck! 🙂Hello-

Prime Minister, Peter O’Neill, remains unfazed by moves to oust him through a vote of no confidence.
He told a gathering today at Tatana in Port Moresby that the government still has the numbers.
However opposition leader, Don Polye, yesterday called on members of the government to side with him to overthrow the government.
The recent Supreme Court decision, which nullified amendments to section 145 and 142 of the constitution, allows for only 11 signatures and not 22 signatures to see a motion raised.
This could potentially see O’Neill removed come the October and November parliamentary sitting, should the opposition muster the numbers.
On the economic front, Prime Minister O’Neill admits a setback in the economy has hampered many projects, and has blamed the commodity price crisis for the result of this economic slowdown.
He says cuts to key priority areas of Health, Education and Infrastructure will not be enforced.
However, the opposition thinks otherwise, citing huge cuts to these priority areas.Bundle Packs

The second and final year of this biennial state legislative session is officially over. Our team accomplished a lot this year, and we have you to thank. Thousands of calls and emails to Columbia came from our legion of caregiver and patient advocates.
When the second of the two-year session started, time was of the essence for the South Carolina Compassionate Care Act. With support from you and our concerned citizens, we were able to host educational seminars throughout the state, which spread awareness about the benefits of medical cannabis. Education is key in preparing our advocates and legislators. We implemented targeted campaigns and spoke with legislators as well as law enforcement to convey the positive impact a comprehensive and well-regulated medical cannabis program could have for seriously ill patients in our state. CSC constituents banded together to tell their personal stories, which had a massive impact. We made great strides in gaining support for the amended S212, which became more conservative as lawmakers heard concerns. Our legislators have been busy, but the calendar has simply run out of time due to other pressing concerns taking priority.
We are proud and humbled by your action and support. Thank you so much, and don’t be discouraged. We made much progress this session. The fact that S212 passed through the full Medical Affairs committee and H3521 moved toward the House floor after being approved by the full 3M Committee is monumental for our conservative state. This was a big win for advocates and patients in South Carolina that need this medicine as an alternative treatment. It shows that don’t know who to contact in Columbia, start here.)
Can you please send a quick email to carry medical cannabis across the finish line? Let your legislators know you support our patients’ and our doctors’ right to determine if medical cannabis should be an alternative treatment option. If you believe that it is OUR HEALTH, OUR DECISION, please use this link to send them an email: Contact your legislators

We will also post our closed group and open Facebook page as well as our website and twitter addresses. Educational seminars and events will be scheduled throughout the off-season and our public service announcements will be released. You do not want to miss what we have planned!
We appreciate your engagement this session. CSC patients and caregivers could not have achieved so much without your help. A new bill will be pre-filed and in January when the new session begins, and advocates will hit the ground running. Please continue to contact your legislators and tell them your personal stories about how people you know and love can be relieved of pain and gain a better quality of life. Together, we can get this life-saving medicine to desperate patients in the communities we love!Instruction

As a left eye dominant shooter, I use all my long guns left handed, and after getting a left handed AR from Stag I'm dead set on using purpose built left handed guns from here on out. So, I've saved up just over $2,000 to spend on a really nice left handed semi auto shotgun that I can use for 3 gun, deer/hog hunting, and to learn clay shooting and bird hunting. After handling a Super Black Eagle 3 that fit like an old glove, I had my heart set on it until I read some troubling reviews online. My questions are these: do the newer models of the SBE3 still have major POI problems, and if not, is it a good gun for using in multiple disciplines, or is it too focused on waterfowling and bird hunting to be utilized as a jack of all trades?

In order to address this new reality, the nature of supply chain relationships must change fundamentally, and look towards a new horizon Return On Relationships.
For too long, organisations have based their procurement and supply chain activities around achieving incremental improvements. These businesses practices were drawn up during the industrial revolution and simply don’t stand up in today’s connected, technology driven procurement environment.
Myopic Metrics
Relationship success remains a fuzzy issue for most companies. Current business and supplier relationships tend to be focussed around measuring and managing metrics. These relationships also tend to be unidirectional (buyer dictating to the supplier). While these processes can produce incremental improvements their shortfalls are that they focus on past performance rather than future opportunity and do not facilitate multidirectional idea sharing and innovation between the partners.
It’s for this reason that Vizibl would like to introduce the concept of Return On Relationships (ROR).
Return On Relationships is a comprehensive, actionable, value-oriented framework that ensures organisations drive tangible returns and competitive advantage from their relationships with key partners.
Return On Relationships provides a structured approach that maps and measures the value deriving from commercial relationships among trading partners in a supply chain. The framework provides the basis for building a comprehensive, multi-directional, forward-thinking picture of relationship management activities and business success.
Return On Relationships reflects a cross-functional and cross-organisational approach, showing how different members of a supply chain can best contribute to relationship success and how this maps to corporate measures of success. It moves well beyond traditional supplier management tactics in order to establish an environment where innovation can flourish.
Our framework for Return On Relationships recognises that successful relationships:
- Are key to sustainable competitive advantage
- Are more than cost reduction and efficiency
- Span functional and organisational boundaries
- Acknowledge the intricacies of global businesses
- Emerge, rather than result, from strict control
Approaching this new collaborative way of thinking with a structured process provides organisations with a roadmap to optimise and redefine their commercial relationships and positions their business for ongoing success.
To find out more about how your organisation readdresses the way it engages with its critical partners and suppliers and to move from incremental improvements towards transformational change download our Return On Relationships White-paper.

About Lefties and Lefthandedness
This site celebrates the lefties and left-handedness with a happy salute.
Left-handedness is one of my lifelong interests. Although I’ve only decided to formally start this blog April 2009, serious collection of information and research started as far back in my youth, with a plan of someday writing about the left-handers and left-handedness.
Through the years, it’s a common knowledge that tools & gadgets, or anything we get hold of, are geared for the comfort of the righties. No longer. In modern times, there have been producers of lefty goods and lefty specialty stores that cater mainly for the lefties or the southpaws – from golf accessories to scissors, and few more tools and gadgets.
Simply because manufacturing and construction tools such as drill presses, industrial slicers of meat and carpenters’ band saws, among others, are designed with the right-handers in mind, it’s but sensible to think that the risk to lefties when using these gadgets & tools can obviously be greater than our right-handed workmates. Right?
This site is all about lefties, southpaws, and left-handedness – famous lefties, ordinary lefties, lefties myths and tests, trivia, and lefty gadgets & tools that will make it easier for lefties to live and enjoy equal privileges in a right-handed world.
Sure, I’m sure, lefties have significant place in history – from the left-handed conquests of the mighty Alexander the Great to the present world leaders.
Composers? Sorry, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wasn’t a lefty but Ludwig van Beethoven was! Scientists? Isaac Newton and Marie Curie were left-handers, and yes, Albert Einstein was a leftie, too!
Did you know that President Barrack Obama is a leftie? So is ex-president Bill Clinton and George Bush, the father. Another Bill is a leftie, Bill Gates, the name synonymous to Microsoft.
To name a few more lefties ~ there are Michelangelo, Napoleon, Marilyn Monroe, John McEnroe.
Enough or I might run out of lefties to feature here.
This blog offers a lot of information, links about left-handedness, lefty tools & gadgets. As well, we also hope readers will enjoy along the way, as we share insights about the lefties and left-handedness.
By the way, I’m a leftie, too, and so was my father.

Recent CommentsChoosing the right from a thousand locksmith services isn’t as simple as it sounds. We strongly believe that a reliable locksmith service has to offer more than just laying claims for the quality of their services. You don’t want to face a scam in an already stressful situation, right?
Let’s discuss some measures to be taken that will lead you to a trustable, skilled, and professional locksmith company.
Be Sure About the Service Required and If the Locksmith Can Perform It:
Never directly call a locksmith without asking about their services, this is an action leading to a blunder. Take your time to explain the problem, a professional will instantly spot the right type of service for you. This is a mandatory step because there are times, a locksmith service does not offer the set of services you require. Make sure to recheck if their services are accessible at the moment.
The Company Should Be Licensed and Insured:
Be certain of their verification by the ALOA, locksmiths are provided the license after the confirmation of their professional certificates and a background check. Even if they are open to showing their certifications, ask for their business card and match the both. This way, you will be at peace about your service and wouldn’t worry about security in an already rushed situation.
Get an Estimate for Their Fees:
This measure is extremely important to take. Get them in the clear about their fees for every step they are performing, people usually get charged an extra fee in the name of anything and there is not much they can do about it. To avoid such situations, ask everything! Make sure you are not paying for an overpriced company and get everything on paper. A professional locksmith service renders an invoice after their service too.
Get Referrals or Take an Online Review Survey:
Before opting for a locksmith service, it is better to look around for referrals. A service that has already been tried by a trusted someone will build a level of certainty within yourself. However, you can also judge a service by its online reviews and then hire them.
If the frontrunner of the locksmith’s team requests you to fill a form, it is nothing to be skeptical about. It is a normal procedure to ensure your ownership of the house or car.
Last Contemplations:
The measures stated above prove that every locksmith service is not worthy of your trust. We believe the best and so, we recommend Locksmith for NYC as a reputable, instant, and professional service. With our expertise, you can sit back and relax considering your situation is in experienced hands. We tend to deal with every lock situation differently with upgraded equipment and methods. We understand the urgency of lockout situations and so, to ensure safety and ease at the time of crisis to our customers, we offer 24/7 hours of availability.

For the last year or two, we've been using this sad purple reusable shopping bag from Steve Madden, mainly because it was big and I didn't care whether it got wet or covered in sunscreen. But this year, I decided I couldn't take it anymore. I sew things, gosh darn it, and it was time I sewed us a beach bag.
After much scouring of Pinterest and the Interwebs, I settled on this great tutorial from Muse of the Morning. I liked it because it was big (I mean, really big) and lined. A lot of the beach bag tutorials out there are for unlined canvas bags, and I just wasn't feeling that.
I did make a few minor changes to the tutorial. I decided not to use elastic in the side pockets and added snaps to them and the main bag instead. I also lined the pockets, which she doesn't do, and I added a smaller pocket inside for my cell phone, keys, whatevs. I used home dec fabric for the lining and handles and quilting cotton on the outside.
I decided not to use interfacing because I wanted this to be a slouchier bag that could be folded up small when not in use. My bag is also actually slightly smaller than the one in the tutorial because I had to shave an inch off the depth when I ran out of fabric. Oops. Still, I'm pretty sure we won't be hurting for space inside this monster.
The outside fabric is Ying Ming in Navy, an oldie from my stash. The side pockets are Painter's Canvas from Laura Gunn (I think in Lime, but it could be Grass), and the lining and handles are a home dec fabric from Ikea that has appeared in several other projects around here.
Now, we're really set. Beach, here we come.
Yahoo! Beach, here we come! You aren't going to want to get that pretty thing sandy though :)9,000… 11,000… 15,000… Interlock on… Fire Both… Roof Doors Open…

DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW....
There was actually some racing that took place over the holidays and the conditions couldn't have been more varied.
Right after Christmas, the Pre-Hangover 150 took place at the snow-covered Riverside Speedway in Groveton, New Hampshire. The race was won by Troy Randall.
On New Year's Day, the action was further south and there was no snow on the track as Rockingham Speedway hosted their first ever Polar Bear 150. Over 60 Street Stocks entered the race and Chuck Barnes, Sr. won the affair with his son, Super Late Model standout Chuck Barnes, Jr. serving as his crew chief. The winning ride was a 1984 Monte Carlo.
Anthony White, Clint Watkins, Timothy Jenson and Tony Conway rounded out the top five finishers.
Speed51.com will have more on that race this coming week.
Loftin, Bagwell and Morris placed eighth, ninth and tenth respectively in the 12-racer field of oval track and NHRA drag racers.

There have been a few announcements from CRA over the holidays. (51 Photo)One kind of flowing but whatever it is, she makes what she’s writing super fun to read.
Angel, our heroine, was pretty great. I enjoy female characters that feel like real people. Angel has good friends and what sounds like an amazing job. As you may have seen in other reviews, I like my heroines to be strong and to have a purpose. Angel fills that bill quite nicely. I really understood what she was going through regarding her crush on her hottie boss, Fernando. I mean, in the past, I have found myself attracted to a boss or two and it can be tough! I mean, they’re hot and on my mind and I was constantly distracted and I’m surprised I could get any work done! LOL! Luckily, Angel is not quite that bad! She only loses her mind when he’s in the room with her! Either way, I liked Angel and I identified with her so she was a great heroine.
Fernando, I also liked. I didn’t love the name but then again, I have literally never known anyone named Fernando. So it seemed a little out there but he was so cool that I didn’t mind. I liked how he was also career-minded, like Angel, and he was pretty great at his job too. There’s this one scene towards the beginning where Fernando is walking down the street, going to pick up his car at the shop and he just seemed so badass! I have no idea why! I guess it was maybe because he’s in a suit all the time with his job and I sort of pictured him striding down the street in more casual clothes and it just sort of “did” it for me. Seeing a suit and tie guy deconstructed is pretty hot, in my opinion! So he was an all around win for me.
Together, Angel and Fernando are dynamite! Like, for real! You can just about feel the tension radiating off of them in any scene they have together. I loved it. The first time they kiss was so hot… holy cow. It wasn’t just that they kissed in Angel’s office, a forbidden place. It was that AND it was just naturally hot!
I would highly recommend this novella to anyone who wants a great and quick read that has plenty of humor and TONS of heat! I loved it and the only reason it got 4 stars as opposed to 5 was because it was WAY TOO SHORT! Give me more! LOL! But seriously, this novella was a lot of fun and I can’t imagine anyone not having a blast while reading it!
Book Info
Fernando Durante knows lusting after someone at work is not an option. He has managed to avoid direct contact with her for years,?
Sharlene Wegner
I don’t mind novella’s, other than the fact that they are usually not print books! But, if I have to read on Kindle for PC, a novella is good! I will check this one out. Great review!Producing energy from waste rice husks in India

UN’s Sustainable Development Goals:
Biomass based cogeneration project at Saisons
As an Ecologi member your money goes towards supporting projects that are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Here are the goals recognised by the Biomass based cogeneration project at Saisons project:
-Internet marketing, also called e-marketing, is the most important part of internet marketing, which uses internet and digital media including mobile phones, smart phones and computer-based media and platforms for advertising and selling products. It includes online advertising, search engine optimization, search engine placement, affiliate marketing, web content creation, social media marketing, video marketing and more. This has become an increasingly popular way of making money online, especially from the UK.
Internet marketing companies use different methods for attracting people’s attention, and increasing traffic on websites. A common method used to do this is through advertisements on blogs, discussion boards and forum websites. Another method is through article marketing, in which articles are posted on sites that contain a high amount of traffic, in order to increase the amount of visitors to a website. Social media marketing is an innovative new strategy that aims to drive more people to a website by creating a positive buzz about the website by using a mixture of the social media platform such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and LinkedIn to create awareness about a company or a product, and also by distributing promotional items or free gifts, like T-shirts, pens or mouse pads.
There are various ways to improve the effectiveness of internet marketing. One of the main tools available is search engine optimization, in which websites are made to appear on search engines by making certain changes to their site content. Another way is through web copywriting, which is a combination of writing about the products or services and the content itself. All these are usually done by professional writers, who work with a company to make sure that they get the desired results.
Internet marketing companies are also able to offer online marketing services to clients who need them. These include creating marketing brochures, web design, SEO strategies, social media marketing, PPC campaigns, email marketing and search engine optimization. Many businesses also hire the help of SEO specialists for ensuring the growth of their website in search engines. Companies who have a large number of website visitors may require a wider range of services to ensure a greater return on investment and maintain their rankings in search engine results.
Internet marketing is not only a business tool but can be a successful way of earning an income too. Many online marketing companies are able to make the most of the opportunities it has to offer. However, the success of the company largely depends on its ability to understand the needs and requirements of clients. So, a company should be able to provide guidance and advice, and should have clear guidelines as well as to what it expects from its clients.
The internet marketing industry has created a niche for itself in the UK. The number of companies providing the service of internet marketing has increased dramatically over the years. Thus, it is important for businesses to know how to succeed in this field by applying the right strategies, especially in the area of search engine marketing. This will help businesses stay ahead of the competition and eventually reach success.Opened 9 months ago

Twenty Twenty-One has unit-less CSS variable unfit for calc()
Description
I was building something with calc on top of --global--admin-bar--height and found out through painful trail and error that why my code would not work.
--my-var: 10px; calc(var(--my-var) + var(--global--admin-bar--height, 0px));
The issue with this is that calc NEEDS a unit. Otherwise, it fails! And because the value on root the default value will never be used. For my case I think it's actually better to have no value on root at all (for default) but the root value should be
0px because its pretty much made for calc.
:root { /* Admin-bar height */ --global--admin-bar--height: 0; // should be 0px } .admin-bar { --global--admin-bar--height: 32px; } @media only screen and (max-width: 782px) { .admin-bar { --global--admin-bar--height: 46px; } }
The theme actually uses it with calc.
.admin-bar .primary-navigation > .primary-menu-container { height: calc(100vh - var(--global--admin-bar--height)); }
I have not tested this code, but I am pretty sure this will NOT work. When the admin bar is not active because calc will fail with unit-less value
0.
I think WordPress core should maybe just include this CSS on all pages so both themes and plugins can utilize it and not have to repeat the code. There is already global admin bar CSS included so why not with this.

How interesting! A unitless value is allowed in calc for multiplication and division, but not in addition/subtraction. Always something new to learn with CSS :)
The value is 0 by default for logged out users who don't have an admin bar, so you don't need to pass through a default in
var. You're right that the usage in the theme doesn't work, but it doesn't actually cause a bug. That said, we should fix it - the
:root value should get changed to
0px so all instances of this variable use the same unit.
Targeting this to 5.7 since it would be a quick fix if someone can write a patch soon.

@joyously
I meant the 21 theme obviously.
I do not get what you are saying. Work best with no units? I showed the opposite this BREAKS and not "works best". Then you follow up and say they should be percentages? I do not get what you are saying.
As I said with this case the --global--admin-bar--height is like the perfect example for a variable used to calc() positioning with (very likely with addition). It literally BREAKS and has unexpected consequences because you can not use it with in a unit calculation. Well not in addition/substation to be perfectly correct as @ryelle just pointed out.
I copied it to my plugin anyway, but what do you think about just adding this to core? I mean WP already puts out some
.admin-bar CSS anyway when you logged in. To not logged-in users the value could either be omitted completely, so people can use their own 0px default or just include it with
0px
I do not understand why this CSS spec does this, its possible there is a good reason but its pretty annoying to run into, especially when you work with SCSS rules that actually say you should use unitless 0 instead of 0px, 0em ... So I have to put an ignore comment for the lines in or globally allow the rules.

CSS variables work best with no units, because you can't manipulate them like strings. And because of that, it's best if they are percentages.
But you can use a unitless variable in calc(), by multiplying by the unit, like
1pxor

1%.The Jacksonville Jaguars won the coin toss.
So far, so good.
They deferred. Everybody in the NFL defers. Even a two-win team with the seventh-worst scoring defense in the league.
The 49ers fielded the kickoff and ran play after play after play after …
Twenty-three snaps later, the 49ers led 3-0. Jacksonville's offense had yet to step on the field.
"I didn't realize how long we were out there until I looked at the clock and there was like a minute, 50 left in the first quarter," 49ers tight end George Kittle said. "That's wild."
The final tally was 13 minutes, 5 seconds — the NFL's longest drive, time-wise, since Nov. 27, 1997, when the then-Tennessee Oilers had one that lasted 13:27 against Dallas.
"I needed a little break," Kittle said. "I think I got two plays off there in the middle, so shout out to [49ers tight ends coach Jon Embree] for taking me out for two.
"If I'm tired, I know the defense is tired. I feel like I'm in good shape, so if I'm winded I know everybody across from me is winded. We're a physical team."
The surging Vikings (5-5) will get a closer look at the equally surging 49ers (5-5) Sunday in Santa Clara, Calif. With an interesting mixture of runners, Kyle Shanahan's physical, ball-control attack has helped the up-and-down 49ers win three of their past four games, including Sunday's 30-10 rout at Jacksonville.
Time of possession isn't one of football's more vital statistics. The Packers, for example, needed only nine seconds to go 75 yards in one play to tie the Vikings in the closing minutes of Sunday's loss at U.S. Bank Stadium.
But time of possession isn't totally devoid of all importance. The top five teams in average time of possession — Baltimore (33:46), Tennessee (32:02), Arizona (32:00), Green Bay (31:49) and Cleveland (31:48) – have winning records. The bottom seven — Seattle (24:42), Jacksonville (26:48), Houston (28:00), Atlanta (28:27), the Jets (28:37), Detroit (28:42) and Philadelphia (28:45) — have losing records.
San Francisco jumped to 15th after Week 11, thanks in large part to an opening drive that went on and on. And on.
Officially, the drive covered 20 plays and 87 yards with two defensive penalties. There were seven first downs, including two by penalties on third down.
Jimmy Garoppolo completed 4 of 5 passes for 37 yards and was sacked three times, one of which was negated by defensive holding. Three running backs combined on 13 carries for 45 yards.
With leading rusher Elijah Mitchell out because of a finger injury, receiver Deebo Samuel showed some versatility that no doubt has caught the attention of Vikings coach Mike Zimmer.
Samuel has 994 receiving yards, second most in the NFL. Sunday, he caught only one pass for 15 yards, but led the 49ers in rushing with 79 yards and a touchdown on eight carries.
"He's an electric player," Vikings defensive end D.J. Wonnum said. "He's a receiver in a kind of a running back's body, so he's strong. He's physical. He can move. Just going into the week, we're going to prepare for it and we're going to get ready for it, but he's definitely a great player."
Through eight games, Samuel had just six carries for 22 yards and a touchdown. The 6-foot, 215-pounder has had 13 carries for 115 yards and two touchdowns in the 49ers' back-to-back wins over the Rams (31-10) and Jaguars.
In just 10 games, Samuel already has become the first 49er to post at least five receiving touchdowns (5) and at least three rushing touchdowns (3) since running back Ricky Watters had six rushing and five receiving in 1994.
Samuel carried the ball three times for 23 yards on the Sunday's first drive alone.
"I wish we would have scored a touchdown, but just getting points after a 22-play drive, that's awesome," Kittle said. "And when you're a defense and you're on the field for 22 plays, that's tough. But that's what we're built for — those long drives and the fact that we can stay on the field for those long drives. It tells you a lot about this team."
It also tells you a lot about Jacksonville with how the Jaguars responded to the NFL's longest drive in 24 years.
They went three-and-out in 1 minute, 35 seconds.

It’s the wedding season now. I know several family members, friends and even patients who are going to get married soon, including Nor.
Nor came to our clinic to do her dental check up before her big day this Saturday. Upon examination I told her the good news which was, she only needed a scaling and there were no cavities in her mouth.
She smiled happily and I proceeded with the scaling. In less than 20 minutes I finished her scaling and polishing.
Before she left I suggested that she do the Zoom! Whitening treatment since she had yellowish teeth. I also advised her to correct her overcrowded teeth by doing orthodontic treatment.
She said she would think about the orthodontic treatment but she definitely would want whiter teeth on her wedding day.
So… we set an appointment to do the Zoom! Whitening the next day since she was about to be on leave from her work for her wedding.
The next day, she came into the clinic with her fiancee. I proceeded with the Zoom! Whitening treatment after I explained to her the procedure.
I also explained, that she might feel some slight sensitivity during the treatment (usually at the last cycle) but we were going to provide her with the desensitizing gel to reduce and control the sensitivity should she have any.
It took about an hour and half to finish the treatment though it is usually advertised as a 45 minute procedure because of all the extra procedures we take!
I passed her the mirror and she said, “Wow!! It’s whiter than before. Now I can smile wider for my wedding pictures.”
I laughed and said, “Yes Nor… keep on smiling!”
Here’s wishing you a happy married life Nor, and yes, smile more now!NISKAYUNA — Niskayuna High School junior Adriana Holden’s career prospects are running hot and cold.

Holden has decided to follow in her father’s footsteps — and currently is training for work in the male-dominated Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration trade.
Holden is the only woman enrolled in the Capital Region BOCES HVAC/R program this year and one of just three to enter the program during the past 23 years.
Only one woman has graduated from the program — Kayleen Taber, a 2019 graduate of Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk Central School District.
The disparity is not just a local one. Nationally, industry officials say, women account for just 1.4 percent of the 332,900 workers in the field.
“It doesn’t bother me, the classroom is good,” Holden said in a recent interview. “They don’t treat me any different.
“I just like it,” she added, about the work. “It’s hands-on and fun.”
Holden received her first taste of the HVAC/R industry when she was 12 years old. She would accompany her father, Chris, on jobs.
“I went with my dad when I was 12 and I have been going ever since,” Holden said. “It’s fun and you get to help people and work on different systems.”
Asked why she is interested in a trade that attracts so few women, Holden said, “It just interests me … I like hands-on activities and just doing stuff.”
Holden’s favorite activities — so far — in HVAC/R are soldering and brazing (soldering with an alloy of copper and zinc at high temperature).
“There’s just something about it that is fun,” she said.
Besides being fun, the industry can offer strong career outlooks.
With a 15 percent workforce growth forecast by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the average age of HVAC technicians at 54, demand is in place for people who enter the industry.
“I want to graduate and get a job in the industry, maybe with my dad’s employer,” Adams Heating & Cooling, Holden said.
Adams is a partner with Capital Region BOCES and has hired BOCES HVAC graduates in the past, including Holden’s classmate Sam Boice, who worked for the company last summer.
Retired Capital Region BOCES teacher Frank Ando said the industry needs more women — especially at a time when companies are desperate for good workers.
“It’s an awareness issue,” Ando said. “I just think girls and women think of it as something that is not available to them, but it’s not only available, it’s a good option.”

Video above: Green Beret chaplains pivot ministry amid pandemic
A female soldier for the first time will join the Green Berets, one of the Army's most elite units, after graduating this week from U.S. Army Special Forces training.
The soldier graduated Thursday in a "COVID-compliant graduation ceremony," according to the U.S. Army. The Army doesn't name Special Forces members to protect their identities for future missions.
In a speech at the graduation ceremony, Lt. Gen. Fran Beaudette, the commanding general for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, referred to the graduates as "Green Beret Men and Women." And for the first time since the official founding of Special Forces in the 1950s, that was true.
"From here, you will go forward and join the storied formation of the Green Berets where you will do what you are trained to do: challenge assumptions, break down barriers, smash through stereotypes, innovate, and achieve the impossible," Beaudette said.
The Green Berets are one of the last forces of the Army to remain all-male. While women have had roles in the military since the Revolutionary War, it wasn't until 2016 that all combat positions were opened to women. That decision faced some opposition, most notably from the Marine Corps, which published a study that suggested all-male squads were more effective in combat than integrated groups.
The female soldier will be the first among the Green Berets, but she was not the first woman to graduate from Special Forces training. Capt. Kate Wilder wasn't allowed to graduate from training in 1980, so she filed a discrimination complaint the following year and was sent her certificate of graduation. She never became a Green Beret, though she remained in Special Forces until her retirement in 2013, the New York Times Magazine reported.
The Army's Special Forces soldiers are considered the military branch's foremost experts in "unconventional warfare." The small unit, nicknamed the Green Berets for their official headwear, is often deployed to intercept terrorist activity or insurgency abroad.Thank you for your interest in working with us.

There are different situations that can lead to the eviction process: from not paying for rent to causing damage to the property or physical harm to a person on the premises of the rental unit.
In the eviction notice template, a landlord is to include specific information that can vary from state to state. In Oregon, a landlord must choose the proper type of form and provide the correct title for the paper. Furthermore, the state demands that landlords write their personal details and contact information and details of the tenant (tenants), such as full names. Besides, a landlord is required to provide the complete address at which the property is located, the reason the landlord creates the notice, the date by which the renter has to deal with the issue or leave the premises, and the date that the owner created the form.
A tenant has rights that must be observed during the process of eviction. Before complying with the requests written in the notice, a tenant must read the document carefully. Sometimes a landlord may break the law when deciding to evict their tenant. For instance, changing locks before a tenant receives the notice is considered illegal. In this case, the tenant has a right to require financial compensation. Besides, a renter is allowed to consult with a free attorney and determine if the claim is valid.
Before starting the eviction process, one must find information about the laws regulating the process. In Oregon, all the rules and obligations are included in Chapter 90 and 105 of the Oregon Statutes.
According to Section 90.260(1)(a) of the state law, a landlord has no right to send an eviction notice before the four-day period (also known as Rent Grace Period) of not meeting a monthly or weekly deadline ends. As long as a landlord does not receive payment on the fifth day, they can draw up a letter and send it to the tenant.
In Chapter 105, one can look through all the laws regarding cases when one of the parties takes personal possessions of the other party without permission or makes an entry in a forcible manner. In the given cases, both parties have a legal right to bring the case into court.
In Oregon, an owner may choose among four particular forms if he or she decides to send such a notice. So, you have to choose a template in accordance with the reason your tenant must vacate the residency before you begin the completion. The list comprises the following types:
30-Day Notice to Quit (for Month-to-Month Lease Agreements)
When a landlord wants to vacate the space and sell, renew the contract, or use the rental unit for other purposes, such a notice should be delivered to a renter. The owner must give the document to the tenant not less than 30 calendar days before the eviction day.
14 or 10-Day Notice to Quit (for Non-Compliance)
If a renter has broken the conditions of a lease agreement, an owner has to send this form to initiate an eviction process and let the tenant deal with the issue within fourteen days. If the tenant violates the term of the contract for the second time within six months after the first conflict, the landlord can refuse to rent out the property to the tenant and give him or her a ten-day grant to move out. Keep in mind that this notice is not filled out to make the tenant pay for rent.
6-Day Notice to Quit (for Non-Payment of Rent)
In case a renter has not paid or has been refusing to pay the rent due time, an owner can choose this template to notify a tenant about the beginning of the eviction process. In Oregon, the form is also known as “144-hour Notice”. You should keep in mind that although the state of Oregon has the rent grace period (which is four days), a landlord is allowed to send this notice if the rent payment has been delayed for three days.
24-Hour Notice to Quit (for Imminent Danger or Illegal Activity on the Premises)
In case a tenant has done something illegal (for instance, he or she has taken or sold drugs or alcohol on the premises of the rental unit), an owner should notify him or her about leaving the property or changing the behavior within 24 hours. The illegal activity also includes prostitution and physical abuse.
72-Hour Eviction Notice (for Non-Payment of Rent)
This notice to pay or quit is created and sent by a landlord if it’s been eight days since the rent due date of a weekly tenancy agreement. If the tenant doesn’t pay the due amount within 72 hours, they must vacate the property. Otherwise, the landlord can file a lawsuit against the tenant to force the eviction.
Popular Local Eviction Notice Forms
If you, as an owner of the premises, seek eviction of your tenant, there are several steps that you must take:
If a tenant does not provide payment on the due day or breaks the lease, the lessor can choose one of the above-mentioned forms and deliver it to a tenant. To download a template, you can make use of our form-building software.
If a renter decides to ignore your eviction notice, you should apply to the local court. Prepare the necessary documentation (listed below) and be ready to pay some fees. If the court decides that there are grounds to conduct a trial, deliver the copies of the documents to a renter to be aware of the upcoming proceeding. As soon as a tenant receives the papers, he or she may respond with a certain legal form to defend themselves.
Wait for the final judgment in the court. After it has been delivered in favor of the owner, the tenant will have to move out immediately.
Applying to the court in Oregon demands the completion and submission of various legal forms. Below is the list of such forms:
The document is used to notify a renter about the claims against them and the future legal process.
This document describing all details of the claim is submitted to the court by the property owner.
If tenants wish to defend themselves by providing reasonable arguments to continue living on the premises, this form is normally filled out and submitted to the court.
This legal paper states the verdict of the judge.

While the streets steamed with unseasonably brutal weather on Sunday, June 6, the live blues wafting in and around White Street drew crowds closer. Abby Levine on drums and Stacy Werdin on keyboard were hot, hot, hot!
White Street’s closure provided plenty of space for parents, children, neighbors, musicians and artists to get inspired. The Happening! of the Church Street School for Music and Art (CSSMA) was definitely happening!
Located in the former The Flea Theater, CSSMA celebrated the rebirth of Tribeca with an afternoon in the street devoted to the arts— the core of this neighborhood institution.

Amir Diop, a member of Soho Art Renaissance Factory, a group of artists who met a year ago while painting the plywood on storefront windows in Soho, oversaw children painting a mural-type work of art on a huge sheet of plywood.
“I’m all about the community,” he said, while prepping the wood under the noon sweltering sun. Later that afternoon, children clamored to contribute to the group artistic endeavor.
First located 31 years ago on Church Street, hence the name, the school later moved to Warren St., and in 2018 to White Street, expanding with changes in the neighborhood. Surviving 9-11, Sandy, and the pandemic, it offers programming in music and the arts for children from 16 months through senior high schoolers and up. In a typical year, 1000 different students might be availing themselves to its programs.
“During the pandemic, all classes were virtual,” reports Associate Director Betsy Kerlin. Eighty percent of their students continued on Zoom. During last summer, their seasonal enrollment was higher than usual since even from afar students could continue their classes.Ia€™ve been using Tinder and Bumble recently and that I feel ita€™s all using the basic impression and sometimes If only I could find out about the individuality of these individual

Team bonding, not on the pxxxs.
bit difficult for the team to be on the piss when most of them are too short to see over the bar to order a drink, and most would need ID as they are so young.
Not sure I have seen many worse performances than today. Garner and Dixon were probably the only two to come out of that game with credit. Nothing was happening for us today and we desperately needed a game changer and from what we have Felix is our best option and should have come on at half time. Dowie was shocking today and struggled to complete simple passes. Would like to see us play 442 when we have the personnel available, instead of crowding the midfield play with two wide men who will cause the opposition problems. McGhee, Felix, Meadows, Dixon, Newsham and Southwell could be a good combination if we can get all of them fit together. The defence picks itself. Despite the players missing today no excuses can be made for that performance. Last season we played the same eleven for the first eight games (even using the same two subs in those games in Galinski and Fairclough) and only lost one. This season we haven't used the same eleven for any two game. Obviously injuries and suspension have played a big part in this but the players lacked an understanding today so hopefully we can get our best team playing together for several games and win games before we slip away.
Far too lightweight in midfield, doesn't take a genius to work it out, been watching Boston for forty years and that comes close to one of the worse displays yet, still, onwards to Leek.

Now we want to speak about another good electric toothbrush named Fairywill Pearl White which is already appreciated by many customers.
Fairywill Pearl White is using the sonic vibration technology and has 35,000 strokes per minute provided while using one of the 3 cleaning modes available.
In general the Fairywill Pearl White package should include the following:
package may vary
- 1 Pearl White Electric Toothbrush Handle
- 3 Replacement Heads
- 1 Protective Bristle Cover
- One USB Cable WITHOUT CHARGER
- 1 Charging base
- 1 Instruction Manual
But lets speak more about Fairywill Pearl White in the following section: (click ahead!)

Customer Reviews
Pro & Cons
Conclusion
Fairywill Pearl White features
Brush head
This electric toothbrush comes with the Pearl White brush head but is also compatible with the following heads from Fairywill:
Inter-dental brush heads HERE.
Crystal Black replacement heads HERE.
White replacement heads HERE.
Hard Bristles replacement heads HERE.
Cleaning Modes
You have 3 cleaning modes at your disposal. The Clean mode is for regular daily use of the toothbrush, the Soft mode is in case you have sensitive gums and teeth and the Massage mode is used especially for gum care and it known to improve the gums health in 2-3 weeks.
The cleaning mode is chosen before you start brushing and there is a LED icon which indicates the selected mode.
Using the available cleaning modes within Fairywill Pearl White it is said that you can get healthier teeth in just 7 days and also improve your gums health in around 2 weeks. Also same as many other electric toothbrushes this product removes up to 100% more plaque and stains than any manual toothbrush (but I guess this is already a known fact).
Timers
Fairywill Pearl White has two timers which are great in case you want to improve your brushing habits. Both these timers are features used by most of the electric toothbrushes because they really help you to brush properly.
The 30 second timer tells you when you change the brushed area and the 2 minutes smart timer lets you know when you can finish the brushing process. Actually after 2 minutes the toothbrush will turn off.
Other features of Fairywill Pearl White
Fairywill Pearl White has a slim and extra-lightweight design and is waterproof so you can use it even in the shower. Another good part is that is using an anti-slip handle so indeed is easy to use in the shower.
With this toothbrush you also know when you need to recharge because it has a low battery indicator which lets you know if the battery needs to be recharged.
There is also a bristles protective cover included in the package which protect the bristles of the brush head.
Charging
(Back to Top)
The Fairywill Pearl White battery can last for up to 30 days which is really great even compared with the most advanced electric toothbrushes like Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart or Oral-B Genius 8000.
The recharge is made using an USB and is compatible with chargers used for phones/tablets.
Being able to use an electric toothbrush for up to 30 days with no need to recharge is a great option and is nice to have such a battery when you go to a trip.
Customer Reviews
(Back to Top)
The Fairywill Pearl White can be considered a new entry in this industry but also a big surprise when it comes to the performances. Many people are considering this toothbrush to be even better than products from Oral-B or Philips Sonicare.
It does a great job in cleaning your teeth but also the price is low which is why is not hard to make you buy it.
Pros&Cons
(Back to Top)
Fairywill Pearl White pros:
- More than decent price
- Long lasting battery
- Recommended by many customers even if is something new
Fairywill Peral White cons:
- Fairywill is not a big player when it comes to electric toothbrushes but it may be in the future
- Just 3 cleaning modes but personally I do think they should be enough
Conclusion
(Back to Top)
Fairywill Pearl White has an upgraded version named Fairywill Sonic Crystal Black (see review HERE) but even so this electric toothbrush has everything you need to achieve a nice smile and breath fresh. Also the price for which Fairywill Pearl White is available is simply more than you can ask from a toothbrush. Beside all that the battery life is something which you should always consider when you choose an electric toothbrush and Fairywill PearlWhite has one of the best batteries available for a toothbrush at this moment.BLINDMANS BREWERY TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Police are now looking into the case of Jose Pop, the teenager who was assaulted by two civilians and taken to the Bella Vista Police Station on June 28 in San Isidro Village in the Toledo District. Pop’s family allege that he was taken from a neighbor’s house, where he sought refuge, by two men, one armed with a machete and another with a firearm. The family claim that police in Bella Vista and Independence have refused to take their statement. Today, police confirmed that Pop has indeed been charged for ammunition, but following the family’s allegation, they are now investigating the circumstances surrounding his detention. ACP Joseph Myvett briefed the media today.
ACP Joseph Myvett: Sometime around the 24th of June there was report of a burglary in progress where one of the Pop brothers was caught by some civilians during a burglary. He was then handed over to the police and has since been charged and is remanded to prison. Subsequently a few days later there was an attempt to burglarize the same house by the brother of the accused where he was again caught by some civilians and handed over to the police. In the process police conducted a search on him where I believe one 9mm round was found on him for which he has since been charged along with the attempted burglary and is now remanded in prison. As we speak the police is in the process of recording a statement from those person who are alleging that they were witnesses to the incident.
Reporter: Ok so now they’ve made multiple allegations that in fact one of the people who committed and aggravated assault on the young Mr. Pop the 15 year old in fact planted the single live round on him and that in fact there is complicity from the Bella Vista police in doing this. Would you speak about that allegation?
ACP Joseph Myvett: Well that allegation was not specifically brought to our attention but as I mention to you the police is in the process of recording a statement from those persons who are making that allegation.
ACP Myvett says that police are also looking into the allegation that one of the civilians who detained Pop was armed with a firearm.Picture Courtesy Of Flickr.”.

Crysta,
Years ago, every October on a sunny Sunday afternoon when the sun is highlighting the sparkling majesty of a rainbow of fall colors and the temperature has a nip in the air we would take our young children Jennifer and Jason to Goebberts Pumpkin Farm in Hoffman Estates on Route 72. Nature usually cooperated with this perfect fall day being on the same Sunday that the Bears had a bye week and were not playing.
Our pumpkin carving children would first get behind all the wood character cut outs so Mom could take their picture and Dad could do the video camcorder. Next was a pony or camel ride followed by a sticky caramel apple washed down by hot apple cider. Finally, the kids would pick out their pumpkins and gourds and we would drive home and start carving our Jack O’ Lanterns for Halloween. Those were fun days we will never forget.
Our daughter Jennifer, and Mike, our son-in-law, gave us our first grandbaby on Dec. 30th. In a few years we will be able to do it all over again as the circle of life goes round and round.

For those readers with young children who have always wondered what the bison feeding experience is that you can participate in at Lord’s Park Zoo, if you go to bocajump.com they have a bison feeding video.
I always wondered what it would be like but I work Saturdays so I could never go. If I had children of the right age for this I would definitely take them to do this.
I am thinking the next feeding at the end of October if the weather is Indian Summer weather with the leaves in their full glory would be the best month of the year to do this.
I believe you need to sign up so you might want to sign up early if you agree with me that end of October might be the best time.
It looks like it would be a very fun family event.

KeepingMonday in the Second Week of Lent, Year B
01 March 2021
Reading:Genesis 17: 1-7, 15-16
Scripture: “Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him, “As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations…your name shall be Abraham and kings shall come from you.’” (Genesis 17: 3,4,6)
Reflection: Covenants are promises or agreements between two parties. They are contractual and binding. Usually there are penalties for breaking a contract. Conditions and situations may change and alter the terms of the contract but we don’t have to worry about ANY covenant God makes with His people. He does not change. He is the same loving and gracious God now as He was then, and always will be. God’s covenants are all in keeping with His plan of redemption and salvation for us. His promises provide the framework for this plan. It is comforting to note that when the Lord establishes a covenant between Himself and humankind, He keeps His promise and fulfills it at the appointed time, further revealing another chapter in His plan.
When God spoke to Abram in Genesis 17 and made this covenant with him, – the Abrahamic Covenant – it was a seemingly impossible one. God promised Abram, land, descendants and blessings. The promised blessing would extend through him to all the peoples in the world. God also changed Abram’s name to Abraham., meaning ‘father of many nations’. In return, God would guide them and protect them and give them the land of Israel. Abram was 99 years old and his wife, Sarah, was way past child-bearing age. How would we have reacted if the Lord gave us similar news? Impossible for man, but for God, nothing is impossible. He is a way-maker and a miracle worker. The following year, Abraham and Sarah had a son. At 90 years old, Sarah gave birth to a son. And as God had promised, Abraham would go on to be the father of many nations.
As we take the time to reflect during this Lenten season, let us hold fast to the fact that God’s purpose is working itself out; His is a plan that would lead Jesus to the cross to pay the price to free us from sin. As we continue to face difficult circumstances, we must remember that He is in control. It may seem as if He is far away at times, or things may not happen when we imagine they will. We can, however, rest assured His plan is in action, taking its course – for our ultimate good, and in His perfect timing.
Meditation: “And without faith it is impossible to please God…By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called…And he went out not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised…” (Hebrews 11: 6, 8, 9) Faith never knows where it is being led, but it knows the One Who is leading.
Prayer: Thank You, Lord , that we can trust in Your promises, no matter how long they take to be fulfilled. Amen.

And Clarence Middleton had proved to be as capable at handling a boat and running whiskey as he was at so many things else. Harry headed for the north wing of the L and scaled a staircase to a catwalk, and when he opened his eyes.Mere words will never be enough. He knew there was a connection between Alexander the Great and his work? She felt the familiar stirring of excitement at the prospect of working alone to solve a puzzle that no one else seemed interested in. One that subsequently was shown to be prophetic.And now he was even more restless to get his hands on the dossiers that should be on their way to meet him. When he hurled the bricks aside, no more vicious than the rest of the anti-brigades, except for Skarpa.

Yamaha XV 125 Virago – Louis Special Custom Bike
The project of a group of Louis apprentices has proven than even a baroque Yamaha mini chopper can form a super basis for a custom bike: they converted the XV 125 into a unique drag racer.
Yamaha XV 125 Virago
– before the conversion
A project by Louis apprentices
On the workshop hoist stood a Yamaha XV 125 Virago, largely unmodified, fitted out with a baroque sissy bar and, both optically and technically, in far from top condition. Is it possible to take this as the basis to design a roadworthy, individual bike which is also stylish and attractive? Our small team of ambitious retail apprentices took on the challenge with enthusiasm.
The Louis youngsters had free rein when it came to implementing their ideas. The only condition was that the conversion had to be completed in five days and could not cost more than €2016. After a brief debate, the young customisers decided to aim for a vintage look, with a large amount of antique patina. However, under no circumstances did they want it to turn out as a chopper, but rather something like a racer. A bold plan!
Before the re-design, the little Virago had to be restored to roadworthiness. The chain set and the brake pads had to be replaced, the carburettor had to be cleaned and reassembled with new seals and float needle valve, the brittle intake rubber had to be replaced and a new battery had to be installed. A motor oil change on the old XV motor was overdue, and finally a fresh spark plug, along with a spark plug cable, made sure it was once more alive and kicking with its four-stroke melody. There were of course a whole load of other parts which had to be cleaned, derusted or relubricated in the process.
Then came the exciting part of the project: the Yamaha was to have a complete makeover. Chopper handlebars, for example, are no longer chopper handlebars when you simply install them the wrong way round, race style. The old seat was to make way for a cafe racer tail section. But how do you adapt it to the frame? What can be sawn off? How do you build stable metal mounts? Our master mechanic was on hand to provide the young creative team with help and advice. The rusty exhaust had to be kept for budgeting reasons, so it was cleaned with the wire brush, sprayed matt black and spruced up with a little heat wrap tape. That's right: a sinister black was also the colour of choice for the rest of the bike. But some contrast was needed, so both the side covers were sprayed rust brown at the front. Spray-painting was also a new experience for our young stylists – sanding back, carefully degreasing, guiding the spray can at the right distance, not too quick and not too slow, without leaving behind any drips, runs or orange peel effects – it's not as simple as it might seem!
And then the electronics – small LED turn signals were required, and an extra-bright LED headlight. Controlling the turn signals with a suitable relay, and cabling everything carefully is really fiddly work.
After five days of concentrated team work, our apprentices then showed the final results off to their amazed colleagues – a once-more functional, sub-zero cool custom bike which, due to the low seat height and the extreme handlebars, admittedly handles a little unusually but without being unrideable. Who can top that in such a short space of time and with such little prior experience?Chair of Nannofossils
Odysseus Archontikis (2019, DPhil in Earth and Environmental Sciences) has just been appointed the Chair of Nannofossils of The Micropalaeontological Society at its recent Annual Conference on Micropalaeontology and Geological Applications. The conference was held online at Charles University, Prague on 17–19 November 2021.
The Micropalaeontological Society (TMS) is a not-for-profit organisation that exists to advance the education of the public in the study of Micropalaeontology and is operated for scientific and educational purposes. The nannofossil working group aims to bring workers together to disseminate knowledge and facilitate research worldwide relating to the study of Calcareous Nannofossils.
Odysseus is currently pursuing a DPhil degree in Earth Sciences and is fascinated by the bidirectional interplay between plankton (palaeo)biology and the Earth’s climate. His DPhil project attempts to understand the evolutionary history of marine calcifying microplankton under past and future climate change through a combined analysis of fossil record, ocean biogeochemistry and evolutionary approaches. He is funded by NERC-DTP and an Oxford-Radcliffe Scholarship at University College. Previously, he completed a Master’s degree in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Lille, France and a BSc in Geology & Geoenvironment at the University of Athens, Greece.
Alongside his DPhil studies, Odysseus is a Council member and the Social Media Officer of the International Nannoplankton Association, a not-for-profit society to promote research and education in all subjects relating to nannoplankton. He has been the recipient of the international ECORD Graduate Research Award for conducting research on aspects of the International Ocean Drilling Program, and he has been a visiting researcher at CEREGE and Marseille University in 2021 to work on automated microscopy and machine-learning approaches. Odysseus has assisted in the demonstration of Geology courses in Oxford and has been invited to give lectures to undergraduates and post-graduates in France and Malta. He is currently the MCR Environment and Hall Officer in Univ and has also served in 2019–2020 as the Vice-President of Univ MCR.
Odysseus commented, “I am over the Moon to be informed I have been appointed the next TMS Nannofossil Group Chair! It is a splendid opportunity, and I am highly enthused to help promote the beautiful realm of nannofossils to the scientific and public audience. I warmly thank TMS committee members and Sarah Alvarez and Amy Jones for taking the leap of faith to appoint me to this position and my colleagues Giuliana Villa and Emanuela Mattioli for suggesting I apply. I also thank Jeremy Young and Mahdi Bendif for their kind encouragement and for adding excitement to the wonderful news of being appointed. I shall not forget my supervisor Prof. Ros Rickaby for her continuous support in my DPhil studies and Univ for supporting my research. I am looking forward to contributing to the initiatives of TMS and my wonderful task now is to fulfil their expectations.”

Step by step instructions to Photograph Jewelry
This post is a piece of an arrangement called Product Photography.
Step by step instructions to Photograph Your Everyday Essentials
You won't not be welcome to shoot adornments , but rather taking photos of your own gems can be an of fun, and a lesson about the way light works. Today, we'll walk you through the whole procedure.
The additional time you take to set up a shoot the less demanding it will be a short time later to complete a progression of shots and have the light consistent
The additional time you take to set up a shoot the less demanding it will be, subsequently, to complete a progression of shots and have predictable light.
1. Hardware
Shooting adornments isn't really a less demanding assignment since we have computerized cameras. It is genuine they help, giving you a prompt thought of the outcomes, yet they don't resolve the essential requirement for a comprehension of light. You need to know how you can influence it to function with you to get the most ideal pictures.
That being stated, to photo adornments you needn't bother with a great deal of hardware. Indeed, a sheet of white paper and some window light and reflectors will do, at an essential level. Indeed, even a minimized camera with a large scale or close up capacity will carry out the activity, as long as it likewise gives you a chance to control the introduction.
This apparently complex photo was influenced utilizing a divider to reflect as the base for the armlet and ring.
You'll additionally require some gems to photo. When you're beginning, you won't do contract work for Cartier, so look to your own family or even your own gems box and photo things that make them intend to you.
Making Your Set and Gathering Props
You needn't bother with an intricate setup to do great pictures Just play with little reflectors and a window light to begin with
You needn't bother with a mind boggling setup to make great pictures. Simply play with little reflectors and a window light to begin with.
There are an unending measure of areas and scenes that would bring about great adornments photography. For this instructional exercise, I utilized a tabletop studio with various hued foundations. These are moderately reasonable, yet in the event that you're not will to contribute yet, you could utilize a bed sheet or some butcher paper and still accomplish great outcomes.
You'll frequently need an option that is other than the bit of adornments in photograph to include profundity or recount a story. In the event that you end up snared on this kind of photography, make it a propensity to gather materials you can use as props or potentially foundation. Fired tiles, stones and bizarre bit of wood will give you different alternatives for more intricate work. In the meantime, oppose the impulse to mess up your picture with a bundle of garbage.
Picking a Camera
The outcomes with characteristic light can resemble this case here Focusing exactly and characterizing what ought to be in and out of center is fundamental
The outcomes with normal light can resemble this illustration. Centering with accuracy and characterizing what ought to be in and out of center is basic.
Current minimized cameras regularly have great large scale capacities because of the little sensor they house. Thusly they are extraordinary devices for adornments photography on the off chance that you can physically modify your presentation settings. This errand is less demanding on a DSLR, however most for most adornments, you'll require a large scale focal point. A full scale focal point is an extraordinary speculation, however they don't come shoddy.
Picking a Macro Lens
With a full scale focal point you go so near the subject now and then making a stow away for the focal point is a smart thought A white bit of paper with an opening cut in the center will do the trick And work as a reflector of light
With a full scale focal point you get so near the subject that, occasionally, making a "stow away" for the focal point is a smart thought. A white bit of paper with a gap cut in the center will get the job done. Furthermore, fill in as a reflector of light.
I utilize two full scale focal points, 60mm and 100mm, with an APS-C body. Having two focal points gives you a chance to work nearer or promote far from the subject. The 60mm can be tricky for a portion of the sets with little question since I need to get excessively near the protest fill the casing. The 100mm is more adaptable in that sense. While picking a full scale focal point, consider what you will utilize it for and how close you really need to be to your subject.
Utilize a Tripod and a Remote Shutter Release
A tripod keeps precisely the same and characterize profundity of field changes
A tripod is decent to have for this work. Now and then I will work with the camera in my grasp, particularly on the off chance that I am utilizing streak. All things considered, a tripod will help you to keep a subject encircled a similar way, which will enable you to exactly alter your core interest.
A remote screen trigger is basic, so you don't need to press the shade on the camera. As a few exposures can be on the more drawn out side, touching the camera would cause vibration that would appear on the picture.
Flashes, Diffusers and Reflectors
When you set the light right it doesn't make a difference what you change out of sight the introduction continues as before
When you set the light right, it doesn't make a difference what you change out of sight, the introduction continues as before
A great deal of my table best photography is finished with normal light and reflectors. See my article, 8 Reflectors You Already Have in Your Home, for some data on making your own reflectors. You can likewise utilize streak, that gives you a chance to shoot at any hour you need. One glimmer will be sufficient, two will be awesome, three is most likely excessively.
A glimmer and a solitary reflector (from business brands to a white bit of paper, froth, or cardboard) will offer you various alternatives. Your glimmer must "off camera" for proficient outcomes. You can utilize links or radio triggers to put you streak off to the side of the scene.
2. Making Soft, Even Light
Attempt with various foundations for various temperaments and results
The best photography area is nearer than you might suspect. Discover a window at home that offers great light you can control, set a table there and your studio is nearly in working request. A white froth board can be your working base, at that point include a couple of hand crafted reflectors, possibly some little mirrors.
Simply recollect that light has shading, and that light changes. On the off chance that you've a red divider out of sight its tone will presumably impact everything around. Likewise, don't blend lighting. In case you're utilizing window light, kill the various lights in the room. You can utilize streak, tungsten lights, fluorescent, yet don't utilize them together.
Differentiating hues help to make solid pictures that draw in consideration.
The objective for most gems photography is to make delicate even light with almost no shadow. Dealing with a dark foundation makes this somewhat less demanding. When you're first beginning, utilize the reflector to influence it to appear as though light is hitting the subject from all headings.
The Right Conditions
A LED light and a reflector can likewise be utilized for adornments photography
The keys to great adornments photography are sharpness, lighting, introduction, so it pays to examine every circumstance and characterize what you expect to do. Sharpness will be definitely influenced by your profundity of field, so I generally begin my introduction arrangement by focusing on my gap. When shooting large scale photographs, your profundity of field will be extremely shallow because of the little separation between the protest and your camera. Along these lines, it's normal to utilize openings above f/11.
The most ideal approach to control your lighting and introduction is to utilize your flashes in manual mode. Flashes offer predictable light that can be situated precisely. By utilizing manual mode, I can control the correct yield, regardless of whether I change foundations or hues in my setup. Try different things with the position of your glimmer and reflectors, and you'll locate a decent blend.
Utilizing a plain dim foundation or a mirror make diverse pictures of a similar ring
Persistence and practice are the most vital parts of shooting adornments. You should know about your concentration, yet above all, your light. Delicate, even light tends to create the best look. Make sure to keep batteries charging, both for camera and flashes, hear some out great music, and have a some espresso close by while you audit your pictures to perceive how the session is going. Roll out little improvements, and you'll end up making great pictures.

Fasting & Abstinence Guidelines
Fasting and abstinence are done to honor the suffering and death of Christ and to prepare ourselves to celebrate his resurrection.
Fasting refers to the amount of food consumed as well as the times food is eaten. Abstinence means the avoidance of certain types of food.
These guidelines are from the United States Council of Catholic Bishops:
Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are obligatory days of fasting and abstinence.
Fridays during Lent are obligatory days of abstinence for those age 14 and up. Church law specifies abstaining from eating meat, such as poultry, beef, lamb or pork, as an act of penitence.
Fasting is obligatory from age 18 until age 59. When fasting, a person is permitted to eat one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal.
In all cases, common sense should prevail, and people who are ill should not further jeopardize their health by fasting. Those that are excused from fast and abstinence (outside the age limits) include the physically or mentally ill, individuals suffering from a chronic illness, and pregnant or nursing women.DESIGN OF BELT CONVEYOR SYSTEM Prepared by: ANKIT KUMAR Dept of mechanical engineering WBUT UNIVERSITY (WEST BENGAL) 2 INTRODUCTION A conveyor system is a common piece of mechanical handling equipment that moves materials from one location to anotherGet PriceGet is the transportation of material from one location to another Belt conveyor has high load carrying capacity, large length of conveying path, simple design, easy maintenance and high reliability of operation Belt Conveyor system isGet PriceGet Price

.Ohsnap Grip ReviewFCB New Zealand and Keep New Zealand Beautiful (KNZB) have launched an anti-litter campaign, fronted by a new kind of Mother Nature – a no-nonsense Kiwi character known as ‘Mama Nature’.
‘Mama Nature’ was developed to get Kiwis to wake their ideas up about littering and start lifting their game. She’s still all about loving the planet and keeping New Zealand “Be-yooo-diful” but years of cleaning up after everyone has seen an end to her unconditional love. Unleashing the odd dose of natural-disaster onto litterers? Yeah, ‘Mama Nature’ can do that.
FCB New Zealand’s Executive Creative Director, Tony Clewett, commented on the creation of the ‘Mama Nature’ character, “How do you simultaneously look to change someone’s behaviour while getting them to love you? Easy – like this. And it was bloody fun to make too.”
This will be the first major above-the-line campaign for Keep New Zealand Beautiful since their iconic ‘Do the Right Thing’ and ‘Be A Tidy Kiwi’ campaigns, which ran in the 1980s and 1990s..”
KNZB CEO Heather Saunderson said the organisation will be undertaking more work to reach a holistic view of the country’s litter problem.
“The next stage of our litter prevention project will involve us partnering with Stats NZ to launch a national litter audit, physically inspecting litter in areas such as motorways, rest stops, residential streets, beaches, rural and industrial locations.”
Launched on 4 April, the campaign is fronted by a 30 second TVC combined with a series of 6 second online bumper ads and an OOH campaign.SOURCE: Concept2
Leading Manufacturer of Indoor Rowers Challenges the Sport’s Best
February 19, 2019 – Concept2, manufacturer of the Concept2 RowErg, has partnered with the World Rowing Federation (FISA), USRowing and the Long Beach Rowing Association to host the second World Rowing Indoor Championships on February 24, 2019, on the campus of the California State University in Long Beach, CA.
Athletes compete on the Concept2 Model D Indoor Rower, which has become the standard for indoor rowing competitions around the world. Each Model D Indoor Rower includes a powerful Performance Monitor that provides reliable data from race to race and between athletes. Over 700 competitors representing 171 clubs will race, 68 of them racing in para categories. The event is truly global, with athletes traveling from 36 different countries to event, hosted at the Walter Pyramid.
On race day, spectators can follow the racing on a visual display from Concept2 called ErgRace. ErgRace provides real-time data of athlete progress. Supporters can cheer on their favorite athletes as they watch the races unfold in front of them.
Indoor rowing racing has its origins in on water training: during the cold winter months up north, rowing athletes looked at ways to stay fit and competitive. Now, indoor rowing has become a sport of its own, attracting CrossFit athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and adaptive athletes at every level of ability.
This year, the race also launches the first ever USRowing Indoor National Championships. American athletes will be recognized for their performances in each age group and category. USRowing National Training Center athletes, many of them training for the 2020 Olympic Games, will be competing, ensuring a deep field of talent and exciting racing.
The World Rowing Indoor Championships will this year attract top international talent, including Olena Buryak (Ukraine), who owns the 2k world record of 6:22.8. She will also be challenging her own 500m sprint distance world record of 1:24.5.
In the men’s division, young phenom German Oliver Zeidler is one to watch. Zeidler is undefeated in his indoor rowing career and picked up his first win after only six months in the sport. He is now a single sculler with the German National Rowing Team. Fellow German Jason Osborne is also racing: Osborne set a new world’s fastest time on water at the 2018 World Rowing Championships in the lightweight men’s single. He will compete in Senior (Open) Lightweight Men’s division.
Concept2 is proud to support all competitors in Long Beach. Best of luck, athletes! See you at the World Rowing Erg Champs!
Concept2 began in 1976 when Dick and Pete Dreissigacker, fresh from their Olympic trial bid, started making composite racing oars. Concept2 oars have since gone on to become the oar of choice among the world's rowers, and innovations continue. Continuing in our tradition of building sport-based fitness ergometers, the SkiErg was introduced in 2009 and the BikeErg in 2017. Concept2 remains a family-owned business made up of athletes and fitness enthusiasts. We are dedicated to providing innovative, high performance training equipment and programs to our customers..

U.S. Junk Silver Coins
90 Percent Silver Coins
40 Percent Silver Coins
There are many reasons for folks to collect or invest in silver coinage versus pure bullion coins, rounds, or bars. The biggest of these is the ease of identification and quantification. Because of the threat of counterfeiting and the quest of the U.S. Mint to produce coins that are as exacting and identifiable to thwart that possibility, the coins are easily traded with confidence. If you are interested in buying or selling any other types of bullion coins, rounds, or bar material, please visit our Gold and Silver Bullion page.
Click here if you are ready to buy or sell U.S. Junk Silver Coins, 90 Percent Silver Coins, or 40 Percent Silver Coins.
Buying or Selling 90% and 40% Silver Coins
Since the silver dimes, quarters are already in a recognizable form of a coin, it is easy to just add them up. So these coins are commonly traded by their face value. It is common for 90 percent silver to be traded in $500 and $1,000 bag quantity. Weight, Dimes, Quarters, and Half Dollars in a $1,000 bag quantity equals 715 Troy ounces of pure silver, or for those of us using a bathroom scale, 49 pounds Avoirdupois of pure silver. Overall weight being 55 lbs.
90% and 40% Silver Coin Math is harder than for Bullion Bars and Rounds
Pricing for 90 percent silver coins and 40 percent silver coins is based on current Silver Spot Price. Our silver coin buyers purchase silver quarters, silver dimes, and silver half dollars of all types, in any quantity. Whether you want to sell junk silver coins or buy junk silver coins, just provide us with some specifics and our silver coin buyer/bullion specialist will contact you with an up-to-the-minute offer.
Storage requirements
One troy ounce of silver is equal in weight to one troy ounce of silver. That’s simple enough. However from a value standpoint things change quickly. As an example, one troy ounce of silver is worth $24.00 when one troy ounce of gold is worth $1,850. So to put things into perspective. 77 troy ounces of silver is equal in value to one troy ounce of gold. So from a value, weight and volumetric standpoint gold is a heck of a lot easier to store than silver.
Key Date and Rare Date Coins to Watch For in Your 90% Silver Coinage
Just because your 90 percent silver coins may be referred to as “junk silver,” that does not mean they do not have some numismatic value. Countless times, our coin buyers have found rarer, more valuable coins mixed in with a batch of otherwise mundane 90 percent silver quarters and 90 percent silver.

Introduction: This study aimed to assess the outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) as the primary treatment for transplant renal artery stenosis (TxRAS).Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of PTA of TxRAS from April 1999 to December 2008 was performed. Twenty-seven patients (17 males (M):10 females (F)) with the mean age of 49.5 years underwent PTA of TxRAS in the review period. Indications for PTA were suboptimal control of hypertension (n = 12), impaired renal function (n = 6) and both suboptimal control of hypertension and impaired renal function (n = 9). All patients had doppler ultrasound scans prior to their PTA. In addition, 5 of these patients had computed tomography angiography (CTA) and another 7 had magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) evaluation. Mean follow-up period was 57.0 months (range, 7 to 108 months). Results: The stenotic lesions were located proximal to the anastomosis (n = 2), at the anastomosis (n = 15), and distal to the anastomosis (n = 14). Technical success rate was 96.3%. One case was complicated by extensive dissection during PTA, resulting in subsequent graft failure. The overall clinical success rate was 76.9%. Seven out of 26 patients had restenoses (26.9% of cases). These were detected at a mean of 14.3 months post angioplasty (range, 5 to 38 months). All 7 patients underwent a second PTA successfully. Three of these patients required more than 1 repeat PTA. Conclusion: PTA is safe and effective in the management of symptomatic TxRAS and should be the primary treatment of choice. Close surveillance for restenosis is required and when diagnosed, re-angioplasty can be performed.
Renal transplantation has become a successful means of treatment for patients with end-stage renal failure. However, in patients with kidney transplants, graft dysfunction can occur as a result of transplant renal artery stenosis (TxRAS). This can present with raised creatinine levels or as refractory hypertension resulting in increased use of anti-hypertensive drugs. The incidence of renal artery stenosis in transplant kidneys is quoted as between 1% and 23%. The prevalence of arterial stenosis affecting renal grafts has increased in recent years due to the use of marginal donors and older recipients. TxRAS usually occurs between 3 months and 2 years after transplantation, but earlier or later presentations are not uncommon. Colour doppler ultrasound is used as a screening tool for TxRAS, but angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis.

Among the many changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), one that has been slow to develop, but far-reaching, is Commodity’s assertion of authority. Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to control insider trading and the misappropriation of confidential information in commodity markets. As the primary regulator of derivatives in a wide range of markets, spanning agriculture, energy, interest rates and beyond, the CFTC had limited authority to deal with insider trading during most of its history. From 2015, however, the agency began to sue individuals and businesses for trading on the basis of the misappropriation of confidential information. Since then, the CFTC has undertaken a series of actions which shed light on the extent of its new authority and has devoted substantial resources to pursuing new cases. Recent enforcement actions in 2020 and early 2021 have continued this trend.
This article reviews the evolution of the CFTC’s insider trading authority, summarizes the agency’s recent affairs and highlights key developments, including the advent of corporate accountability. “Tipping”, the use of data analysis to identify potential wrongdoing and the emergence of parallel criminal applications. Actions. Financial institutions and market participants should know that the CFTC – and now the Department of Justice (DOJ) as well – will continue to be on the lookout for other cases to pursue in this emerging area of enforcement.
Limited historical authority
Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC had limited powers to control the use of non-public information in its markets, as the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) included provisions prohibiting insider trading only in this regard. which concerns the misuse of information by CFTC’s own staff and those of the stock exchanges and self-regulatory bodies it oversees.1 The CFTC did not have any general market insider trading tool.
In this regard, the oversight of commodities markets by the CFTC and oversight of securities markets by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) differed considerably. As the two agencies noted in a joint report in 2009, “securities markets are concerned with capital formation”,2 and “Securities laws are based on a company’s obligations to disclose material information in order to protect shareholders from insiders of the company who have access to non-public information.”3 Securities laws and the rulings that enforce them have long prohibited insider trading by company insiders and others who trade in material non-public information in violation of an obligation to the source. these informations.4
On the other hand, one of the “main objectives” of commodity derivatives markets is to “facilitate the management and transfer of risks”, including by “allowing[ting] hedgers to use their material non-public information to protect themselves against the risks associated with their commodity positions, ”which also improves price discovery for all market participants.5As a result, the CEA did not contain general prohibitions on insider trading, but only the more limited provisions mentioned above.
New powers extended after the Dodd-Frank law
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress gave the CFTC extended new power to regulate the large swap market in addition to futures, as well as new enforcement powers to be enforced in its markets. This new authority has led to two important developments for the application of insider trading in commodities.
First, in the most heralded provision at the time, the Dodd-Frank Act extended the existing narrow ban on insider trading to apply not only to the misuse of information by corporate personnel. CFTC, self-regulatory organizations and stock exchanges, but also the misuse of information from any federal government source. This new provision targets government personnel who disclose confidential government information “by [their] personal ability and for personal gain with the intention of assisting another person, directly or indirectly, to use the information to enter “transactions”, as well as persons who “knowingly use” such confidential employee information government that were communicated in this way.6 Colloquially known as “Eddie Murphy’s Rule”,7 this provision broadened the enforcement power of the CFTC to include a wider range of actors and potential sources of confidential information. In the years since its enactment, the CFTC has not yet based an implementing measure on this provision, but it remains an area of interest for future application and development.
Second, in the change that has had the most impact to date, Section 753 of the Dodd-Frank Act broadly prohibits fraud and manipulation “in connection with any trade in, or contract for the sale of, any commodity. in interstate commerce, or for future delivery. “8 On July 14, 2011, in accordance with this provision, the CFTC promulgated Rule 180.1, a “general and catch-all provision, reaching any manipulative or deceptive device or device” modeled on SEC Rule 10b-5.9 In the years since the adoption of Rule 180.1, the CFTC has indeed used it as a broad tool in a variety of manipulation and fraud cases.
Of particular note in the current era of insider trading enforcement, the CFTC considers that Rule 180.1 prohibits “trading on the basis of material non-public information in violation of a pre-existing (established by some other law or rule, or agreement, agreement, or some other source), or by negotiating on the basis of material non-public information that has been obtained by fraud or deception. “ten When the CFTC announced in 2011 that it would pursue enforcement against the misappropriation of confidential information, the agency said it would be guided (but not bound) by the vast body of insider trading case law in under SEC Rule 10b-5.
The interpretation and use of Rule 180.1 by the CFTC focuses on the theory of misappropriation of insider trading. According to this theory, which has long been applied in the securities markets, fraud occurs when “a person misappropriates confidential information for commercial purposes, in violation of a duty to the source of the information”.11 Some commentators have criticized the CFTC for calling such conduct in commodities markets “insider trading” because these markets lack the traditional notion of “insider” associated with securities. Similar to cases of misappropriation under SEC Rule 10b-5, the applicability of Rule 180.1 to insider trading relies on the use of confidential information in breach of a pre-existing obligation to the company. source of information. Recent enforcement actions, as discussed below, highlight the wide range of obligations the CFTC takes into account in determining whether to prosecute a charge based on the misappropriation of confidential information.

This provision filled a legal vacuum highlighted by the 1983 film Trading Places, which involved a ploy to hijack information from a government source that arguably would not have been covered by the CEA at the time.

Time enough to drink a little something and do some boring but needed paperwork in peace. In spite of that, about once a week, someone manages to come in even earlier than you. And today is one of those days. A skinny, frail, androgynous, and almost anonymous in their plain sweatshirt and trainers, person is sitting on one of the four plastic chairs making up your waiting room. Well, //sitting// may not be the best of words seeing how much they're fidgeting and blatantly oozing with stress. You're not a morning person (OK, you're not particularly better at noon or midnight), but you're not so cold-hearted as to leave them be for another thirty minutes, so you invite them to enter. They nod, stand up as you unlock the door, and are unable to hide their surprise over how barren your office is. A couple of cheap chairs, similar to the one they were resting on, a table, a metallic cabinet, and that's all. At least you have a window, even if the view goes only as far as the concrete wall of a nearby building. "Sorry. Not the best one could dream of. Just the best the city was ready to offer." You could discuss at length how difficult it already was to simply get those few square meters. Or about your attempts to improve the setting with your own money, only to have to return it to its original state (the current one) after the administration, represented by the civil servant in charge of this building, said no. The guy personally hates you and so loves to make your life harder, his hierarchy turns a blind eye on anything concerning you, and there you are with the most uncomfortable chairs in town. But you're not here to complain about your petty problems, so you just ask your guest to take a seat and if they want something to drink. They grab a chair and refuse with a soft "No, thanks". As for you, you get something hot labeled as coffee from the machine, gulp it, and sit in front of the young person, ready to start. Your first visitor of the day is clearly intimidated, currently looking at some point between their feet. How do you proceed? * [[You encourage them to talk about themselves.->Joss]] * [[You explain who you are and what you do.->About me]] * [[You just wait for them to say something.->Onawa, not Psy]]
{ (set: $names to true) }\ You wait. The hardest part is not showing that you're getting bored, as you don't want to put any more pressure on their already shivering shoulders. So you don't play with your pen, you don't look at the clock, you make it look like you're perfectly fine with doing absolutely nothing for now. Finally, before your nerves break, they speak. Starting with the less unexpected question, the one you've already gotten too many times to count. "Is it true that you're Psy's daughter?" And you answer it with the weariness born from a thousand repetitions. "Yes, I am indeed the daughter of Onawa Rootless, the one the media nicknamed Psy." Your mother actually goes by far more than one alias, but Onawa is one of her favorite, and one she crafted herself, as opposed to this three-letter joke originating from an especially harsh satirical article. Your correction, that you tried to speak in the gentlest possible tone, nonetheless petrified your guest, and you must reassure them before they can continue. "Don't worry. Everyone tends to call her Psy. Even some of her friends of old do so when they're not focused. It's a short, cool-sounding, name, and the one you can see and hear everywhere." They nod, still afraid, but curiosity is slightly overcoming fear. "I... For her daughter... You don't look like how I thought you would." Typical. "And how did you imagine me?" "More... colorful? Wild? Outgoing? Unpredictable? //Exuberant//? I don't know exactly. It's just that Ps... Onawa's hair... her makeup... they're always so //awesome//." You grab this opportunity to move the conversation closer to today's subject. "A style you would like to adopt yourself?" They instantly put their hands forward, as if trying to defend themselves from an incoming assault. "No. No. No. Not at all. It's not my style. At all. It's just... that's Psy. Onawa I mean..." "Use whatever name you're most comfortable with." "Well, she is just //so awesome//. She doesn't care about what others may think, she just goes and does her thing." Nothing special in their speech for now. Shy, anxious people are often enthralled by your mother's extreme confidence. * [[If you want to shatter this image of a never-doubting Psy with a personal story.->Psy, behaving?!]] * [[If you rather tell an anecdote supporting this vision.->That time I met my mother]] * [[If you want to remind your guest that //they// are today's subject, and not your mother.->Joss]]
Extract from a series of conferences on ''Myths and legends in modern times'' --- That's it for the theory. You now know all there is to know about how to forge a legend from any petty fact, real or invented, and to nourish it until it is big enough to sustain itself. And since I see too much theory at once has sent several of you to sleep, let's do a practical study case. There are so many good legends that it broke my heart to have to choose just one for this extended review. I had several criteria though. It had to be recent and famous enough for information on it and its circumstances to be widely and easily available. To demonstrate the power of legends, the story it told had to be absurd, the kind no one should believe and yet which is still told again and again. It also has to be as genuine as possible, meaning not crafted especially for the purpose of becoming a legend. That left quite a handful of possibilities. In the end, I settled for Psy's Devil Eye. Ah, I see some eyes are opening up. So here we go. //The legend// Psy is the devil's child, a monster with superhuman strength whose eyes turn red when she reveals her true colors. //The facts// Look at this slide. What do you see? Sixteen pairs of perfectly normal eyes. And now, the same sixteen, except redder. They probably slept as little before the second photo shoot as some of you did before my lesson. You can notice that the red isn't as pronounced or spread depending on the person. There are genetics at work there. The final impression depends a lot on how pronounced the blood vessels are, how white the sclera is, the color of the iris... Nothing special, and you're probably wondering why I'm giving you a basic biology lesson. Well, because Psy's infamous devil's eyes are among the photos you're currently seeing, and you had no idea. Without all the decorum around, they actually look pretty normal. Perhaps a little more reddish than average, especially inside the iris, but not enough to raise attention under normal circumstances. Debunking the superhuman strength is even easier. This claim is based on only one scene, and all it shows is Psy breaking someone else's bones. Tell me, how many among you have managed to break their bones without much external help, playing soccer, skiing or whatever sport you do? The human body is both more fragile and more resistant than it looks like, it all depends on how you hit it. //The context// I cheated a little with these photos. They have been taken when Psy wore no makeup, or at least no makeup making her eyes stand out. Which was not the case with the picture you all know about. Which comes from this video. What do we see? A protest turning bad, for reasons we won't talk about here as I would like to avoid a war in this auditorium, filmed by a bad camera and a bad cameraman. Ah, here comes the moment. Zoom on Psy's face. Blurry shot of bodies, legs and the sky as the cameraman is jostled. Psy's fist hitting a security henchman, her bloody broken hand at the center of the screen as the man falls down. //Craft// Let's cut the middle part to make it a two-images movie, as someone on the Internet did soon after. Now, you have, side by side, an image of Psy's face displaying a nasty expression and one of a hand in a state it shouldn't be, egregious thus inhuman, moreover red with blood. See where I'm going? Psy indeed has reddish eyes, well one eye at least since the other is not visible from that angle, in this shot. Nothing unusual in a tear gases context, even if hers are slightly more pronounced and quick to change color than the norm. And she clearly chose her makeup to enhance that quirk, as a sort of war paint. But it's the //juxtaposition// with another gruesome albeit perfectly explainable image which gives those eyes their particular, disturbing, aura. From that single dual image, the legend started fueling itself. Other photos of Psy's red eyes were found, and associated somehow with other violent events. Soon, even pictures of her giving a dark look were enough. People started to see the red where they wanted to see it. And it spread. Because people wanted to hear unbelievable stories about a strange celebrity like Psy. She was already alien to them, she could easily be demonic too. //Endurance// Psy did nothing to stop the movement. Actually, she has subtly encouraged it, seeing the interest of having some of her political opponents making themselves ridiculous by branding her as some witch, and of more physical people having an unreasonable fear of her. Nowadays, it's pretty obvious that she can do her devil's eye expression at will. And that she uses it, sparingly, as a weapon in her fights, thus fueling the legend even more each time people flee before her sight, at least metaphorically. And once a legend has had time and relevance enough to root itself, it tends to remain for even longer. (display: "Back to appropriate")
"My name is Joss." After that good start, silence sets in again. You wait. And finally, they speak, so softly it's almost inaudible. "I am a street artist." You nod, even though your knowledge of the subject is quite limited. "I do //vanitases//." You have to think hard before you understand what they're referencing. "If I remember my history lessons well, that's a style of painting from the Renaissance. Gloomy oiled things, with skulls everywhere." You made your response obnoxious on purpose, and it worked. For the first time since they arrived, your shy visitor switches from whispering to speaking, fire now inhabiting their voice. "Their popularity indeed peaked during the XVII^^th^^ century, but they take their roots in far more ancient times, and never really went dead. Formats and styles just changed while the main concept remained. And I don't mean skulls. It's about how ephemeral human life is, how short and fragile it is. And I don't think that's gloom. Quite the opposite. It reminds us we need to live fully for the short time we have on earth." You acknowledge their definition. "Don't worry, I won't criticize something I know pretty much nothing about. However, should I guess that your passion is related to the reason you're here today?" Another hesitation. They still don't know if they can trust you. "I can turn... pretty obsessive about graffiti. There was one time I got sick from the paint fume, despite the mask. I was painting the walls of my room, there wasn't enough aeration, I went dizzy... I managed to get out in time, but that scared the shit out of my parents. They forbade me from touching a spray ever again." "And you didn't comply." That's not a question. Nor a judgment. "I couldn't." "How do you manage now?" "I have a part-time job to pay for my material, and I paint wherever I can." "So, also where you're not supposed to." "Indeed." You let them sum it up for you. "I can't paint at home anymore, and public authorized spots are rarer than unicorns. So I do like everyone else. I paint walls nobody cares about, in and out of abandoned buildings mainly. But that's still not legal, nor safe. There are the cops. There are the ones who call them. There are people with no more rights to be there than me, but stronger or more numerous." "It went badly at least once, did it?" "Yes. I escaped with just a few scratches, because they were too drunk to run straight. But now, I freak out about returning there. I got lucky once, I'm not sure I will be twice." They look at you from beyond their hood, with what you guess are eyes filled with hope. "Your mother had similar problems once. Even if she wasn't abiding by the law, she wasn't doing anything bad, yet bad people wanted to make her suffer. I was hoping you... could give me some advice." That's an extremely idealized summary of your mother's life, and you know firsthand things were and are more complicated, but you understand their comparison. The main reasons your mother was hated and hunted are the ones that make the least sense. However, similar problems don't imply similar solutions. What freed your mother from (some of) her problems was fame, celebrity she acquired through two not-so-fun decades of fighting for her rights. A quicker solution would probably be better. Do you advise them to: * [[Make peace with their parents?->Trust your parents]] * [[Join an association?->United we stand]] * [[Get dangerous?->Kick their asses]]
{ (set: $human_psy to true) }\ "When I was but a little kid, I was taken from by blood mother and put in a host family." "I've heard of it. That was that time they decided Onawa was too mad to raise a child." You're hearing righteous indignation in those last words. As if the idea of your mother not being able to do anything was downright stupid. But that's not your point, so you continue. "When things started to get better, but were still not good enough to remove the sanction entirely, a strange compromise was found. I had to stay with my host family, but Onawa obtained the right to visit me once a week. But //only// under some specific conditions." You start counting the restrictions on your fingers. "She had to put on some "decent clothes". Was not to talk about politics. Or about her activities. Or her private life. Or anything considered not //normal// or //too complex//. And to make sure she didn't cheat, all visits had to happen at the hospital, under medical surveillance." You smile. "Just try to imagine. I was a little girl full of life, and, once a week, they brought me to the hospital, this gloomy building that smelt bad, to see some awkward lady, looking unwell in her beautiful costume, to have loooooooooong discussions full of blanks because she was allowed to speak about pretty much nothing, while some bored doctor was observing us like lab rats. It was freaking hell! I hated those visits, as she did, but she kept making them just to be able to see me." Your guest is struggling with the idea of a properly dressed, tongue-tied Psy. You can't blame them, as this is the exact opposite of the model she's used to. Yet, this story is totally true, even if you deliberately cut out its explosive conclusion. After a little while, they finally accept this strange concept. "When you look at her now, it's hard to believe she may ever have had problems similar to... us." You've felt some hesitation on the last word, as if they didn't know if they had to bring you, or even them, into this invisible circle. "One should always remember than today's heroes are yesterday's commoners. Because it reminds us that we too can become heroes." Your quote isn't exactly right, and the translation certainly imperfect, but they got the idea. "On those good words, [[I would like to talk about //you//.->Joss]]"
"The first time I actually talked to my mother was in a hospital. It happened during some planned visit, one during which she wasn't supposed to speak about any subject supposedly harmful for the frail child I was supposed to be. Long story short, these subjects covered pretty everything concerning her, her life, her fights. Or anything remotely interesting for that matter. "She played along. For some time. Then, one day, she just had enough. "In the middle of the visit, she suddenly rose from her chair, broke the recorder of the doctor watching over us, kicked him out, and blocked the door with all the furniture at her disposal. "And then, in this rare moment of peace, she sat on the floor, and //asked// me to do the same. I hesitated, not used to adults making //requests// of me, then I accepted and we talked like that, face to face, quietly, until they manage to break the door open and part us. "That was a dreamlike thing. I was really little, it didn't last long, yet I could swear I remember everything we discussed that day." You choose to keep silent about the consequences of this outburst, namely the //years//, and you're not exaggerating, it took before the two of you were allowed to speak again. That's not the point you're trying to make right now. Your little tale has sent your guest somewhere near the heavens. "She is so //awesome//. If I only had one tenth of her courage..." You catch the ball instantly. "Well, since you're talking about //you//, [[that's a subject I would like to hear more about.->Joss]]"
{ (set: $fragile_joss to true) }\ You think aloud. "It all began when you got into a fight with you parents after your accident?" "Yes, but no. It was already barely bearable before. Can you imagine doing graffiti in a small room, with pretty much no surface available, needing to cover up the floor and the furniture, each work erasing the one before? I was dreaming of the outside world long before I was forbidden to work inside." "I understand, but the simple fact that they accepted your passion and tried to accommodate it, if only for a time, tends to prove that your parents are not bad people, and could make great allies." "You understand nothing!" They refrain from sobbing, their voice uncertain. "They are //parents//. They want me happy of course, but, before everything else, they want me safe. They were already dead worried about my behavior long before the incident, indeed too nice to cut me out of this dangerous universe I clearly love without a good excuse, but eagerly awaiting one. //For my own good//. If I cry a lot, I could probably shift the balance slightly, earning back the right to work in my room... in exchange for my liberty to work anywhere else." They stand up in the middle of the last sentence and mostly cry their conclusion. "How can you be the daughter of the most awesome person in the world and understand nothing?" And then they run out, slamming the door. Well, you didn't shine on this case. In their defense, when you were their age, you also went mad every time someone mentioned your parents. This did not change actually, you just learned to hide it better. But for now, and in spite of this failure, [[the workday is far from over.->Break]]
{ (set: $bibliography to it + (dataset: "n/a")) (set: $legal_mary to it+1) }\ "Do you know of any street art association in town?" "Yes, there is one, but..." "It is mostly composed of, and therefore controlled by, people you cannot identify with." She agrees, and you can feel their relief over you understanding the main problem so swiftly. But you take no pride in guessing the obvious. They don't fit with the current fauna of the world they want to live in, and that would be true inside an association too. With the usual consequences. //The nail that sticks out gets the hammer.// "Make a new one." "What?" They don't look as dumbfounded as they should, and you instantly know where this is going. They reached a similar conclusion by themselves, then discarded it as unrealistic. A word too often confused with impossible. "You heard me perfectly. If there is no association able to defend //your// rights, you have to make a new one." "But I cannot make an association all by myself." "Of course not. That's why you need to find people similar to you to join you on your fight." "But..." "No but." Here we go. You hate to appeal to authority, especially if the authority is your mother, but that's just what they need to hear, so you do it regardless. "Many people have blamed my mother for the sudden increase of people declaring themselves as n/a. After all, before her, there was none, and now, new ones appear to sprout out of nowhere every day. And each time she got the opportunity to answer this criticisim, she just said the same thing. "That those people had always been there. "That others were simply refusing to look at them for what they were. Worse, that they often refused to acknowledge themselves, suffering in denial. "And that now that the taboo had been broken, by Onawa and many others, not a week passed without her receiving some message of thanks from someone explaining that they were feeling alive for the first time in forever simply by assuming what they were." You take a short oratory break before firing your conclusion. "You have an audience. You're not the only one of your kind wanting to redesign all those stupidly bare walls. It's just that they don't dare speak it aloud. Perhaps they don't even realize it yet. And it's your job to help them, so you may help each other." They nod quietly. Disturbed, but not that much. Because what you said is just what they imagined her model, a.k.a your mother, would have said. In the end, they simply stand up silently after a couple of seconds, making a half-happy half-terrified face. (display: "Joss' exit")
{ (set: $rebel_joss to true) }\ "I could give you several sensible pieces of advice, reasonable guidance from a rational adult. But that's not what you need, not what you're here for. You came to this place to know what my mother would have done in such a situation. And I will tell you." You lean forward, closing the distance. "//Break loose//. You take great care to make art only on walls nobody cares about, and for what? To be hunted like a criminal regardless. If you are to take risks, to be pursued, at least it should be for something which will make a difference. Move your art where everybody will be able to see it rather than just a few lucky people and a lot of cockroaches. Paint where you want, not where you think you're tacitly allowed to." They wither, almost disappearing under their concealing clothes. "No! No! I've no doubt //Psy// would have covered the city hall with drawings from the basement to the attic if she were me. But that's not who //I// am. I don't want to make trouble for anyone else." "It's not about others. It's about you. Everyone deserves to exist, even if their existence must bother some." You just quoted, almost word for word (and unwillingly), one of your mother's speeches. Something Joss can't have missed. They look like they're about to reply, then stop, hesitate some more, and fall silent again. It takes several minutes before they finally raise their head, stand up and start whispering while looking at their feet. (display: "Joss' exit")
{ (save-game: "Main") }\ Today's schedule is, as usual, full of holes. On purpose. Because, if some people are organized enough to schedule an appointment beforehand, and others are regulars, always coming at the same day of the week at the same hour, most visits are unexpected, are either people in emergency situations or too unsure to call and yet suddenly finding themselves here on an unexpected outburst of courage. People who need your help first and foremost, hence why you're leaving that many blanks in your planning, so they may always be welcomed quickly. You're used to such a rhythm, and take advantage of your alone moments to do some writing work, your door remaining wide open to remind everyone you're available if need be. Right now, you've got an article to finish. And you start by checking your notes. You're no movie character, so, instead of looking at many pieces of newspapers pinned up to the wall and linked together with shaky strokes and covered with incomprehensible remarks, you instead open the directory of your computer where your sources await, properly stored in aptly named folders. Articles from newspapers or science magazines, found online or scanned, extracts from books and thesis, video from TV news, documentaries and conferences, audio from podcasts and interviews you yourself conducted... All of these add up to a really big amount of data. So much that you often feel the need to navigate through it randomly, counting on luck to put forward the files you've thrown down somewhere one day then forgot about. You also have a bad tendency to reread documents totally disconnected from the subject of your current article, only because something made you remember them earlier. In short, focusing is not your //forte//. [[Time to get lost.->Bibliography]]
"I must think about it." "Of course. Feel free to come back any time, my door is always open." They shake their head, move to the aforementioned door, open it, are about to pass it, then, suddenly, they turn back and take the final word from you. (if: $names)["I was wrong before. You totally are your mother's daughter." Their voice is so full of respect, almost adoration, that you can't help but feel bad.](else:)["Thanks." A single word, but a sincere one.] And then, they're out, their running escape echoing through the corridor. For lack of a better thing to do, [[you go back to work.->Break]]
Do not take anything for granted. You think you know things. Because you were there. Because you saw them with your own eyes, heard them with your own ears, felt them with all your senses. But remember that schizophrenics also firmly believe that what they perceive is real. And, technically, they are not wrong. The electrical/chemical signal poking their brain is in no point different from the one they could receive from their actual sensitive organs. ''It is no less real.'' For the afflicted person, without external help, it is not possible, at all, to distinguish between something only they see or hear and something "everyone" perceives. And getting help is quite hard when you cannot even trust the most basic mediums of communication. Even in the hypothesis that you do not suffer from any hallucinatory trouble, something I think hard to believe with your heredity, memories are brittle untrustworthy little things the brain often mixes, overwrites, or even creates from scratch. Therefore, you should regard all these documents, this one included, as reality checks, connexions to the world most people around you live in, as opposed to the one in your head. But, following the same suspicious reasoning, do not trust them too much. Of course, if you are indeed utterly insane, this whole warning is a waste of time. But giving up because there is an unproven possibility that your actions may be useless never did any good to anybody. You least of all. (display: "Back to appropriate")

"I have a good number of diplomas up there, but I'm not here as a sociologist, a psychiatrist or any position giving me authority over you.

Revision history for Wikipedia page on ''n/a (movement)'' ''Movement?'' ''Tinunn'': Movement is a politically-colored word. Perhaps it would be better to use "social category" instead. ''Lanktar'': I too find the current wording inappropriate, but the same goes for the aforementioned proposal. Maybe "social phenomenon"? ''Garden'': That's even worse! Won't a simple ''(person)'' do the trick? It's more neutral, and still makes it clear we're not using the word in its administrative senss. ''Non neutral iconography'' ''Elyth'': The article is illustrated only by photos of persons wearing heavy makeup, a mask and/or extravagant, brightly colored clothes. Yet, nowadays, most n/a people don't adorn themselves with such costumes. They were predominant at the movement's beginnings, sported by most of its early leaders (''Psy'', ''Rainbow'', ''John Smith''...) but with time passing on and many more people joining, such a fashion became the minority, not the norm. ''GLspirit'': And with what are we supposed to replace them? Photos of people casually clothed? ''Elyth'': Exactly. ''Off topic article?'' ''Faity'': Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It is supposed to define words. And this article, as long as it may be, does not. It does recount the whole history of the movement behind it, getting lost in many pedantic digressions on the way (for example, that long passage dedicated to the precursors), but never gives a proper definition. One can read it from the first to the last line and still have no idea what a "n/a" is. ''Muffin'': +1. I think the history part should be given a dedicated article (''n/a movement history''?) and this article refocused instead on listing its many definitions with the controversies each raised up. The plan should also be moved from chronological to thematic. ''Fake n/a?'' ''Max'': Some of the celebrities given as examples of n/a people have little if any relationship with the movement. ''DoWhatYouWant'': I don't get your point. They're all famous enough to each have their own article, and have all defined themselves as n/a. How come they shouldn't be listed there? ''Max'': It's obvious that, for several of them, it's just a cheap marketing tactic. They are has-beens trying to gain back some of their fame by linking themselves to anything popular lately. They are not n/a, they don't look n/a, they don't think n/a. ''DoWhatYouWant'': Non-relevant. Wikipedia is there to expose facts, not to judge the legitimacy of anyone. ''Unnecessary overcomplexity?'' ''Vilehard'': I just don't get why we need an article of several thousand words when a one-sentence definition would do a better job: "person not identifying themselves with any of the given options for a given social category". I suppose we can spare an extra line to explain the term comes from administrative forms and the refusal to answer certain questions as intended. ''Elyth'': Things are not that simple. As of today, many different people label themselves as n/a for many different reasons. But in the public mind, it is more or less synonymous with the right to wear colorful masks in everyday life. And to understand why, one first needs to know of the story behind this word. (display: "Back to appropriate")
{ (set: $bully to true) (save-game: "Main") }\ You don't even need to look at the newcomer to know he means trouble. What you hear of his walk is enough. Within each of his steps rings sick confidence and unrestrained violence, as a conqueror marching in a defeated place. You don't give him the pleasure of you watching his distasteful approach, only raising your head when he finally stops a few centimeters away from your desk. Shaved head. Muscular build. Army cargo pants and tank top. Brings in a sport bag. Leers at you from head to toe without a single hint of embarrassment. Finally speaks. "Baby, tell your boss someone is here for her." "I'm the boss here." Surprise overruns his face. "//You// are Psy's girl? But you look so //normal//." You just ignore the implicit insult. "I am indeed Hope-Mary Rootless-Johnson. Please take a seat and explain your problem, and I will do everything I can to help you." "You're the one who needs help baby." And he takes a baseball bat out of his bag. Typical. Do you: * [[Ignore his behavior, and start the interview as if everything was normal.->Let's discuss this]] * [[Call for help.->Phone]] * [[Kick his ass hard.->Violence]]
{ (set: $violence to true) }\ You walk to the cupboard, open it, find some bandage and antibacterial gel, and start treating your bloody knuckles. You stupidly used your main hand to strike, again and again, so now you have to rely on the other one to fix it. Thus your movements are imprecise and you're struggling to get the job done. Plus, your last visitor takes his time to go out, cursing a lot in the process. You have to ask him firmly to speed up before he finally stops complaining about his knee, his nose, his ribs and whatever else and finally gets the hell out of here. You waste some more time throwing him the bag he almost forgot, and let him stumble to somewhere else while you return to more important duties. Once you've got your hand fixed, and after drinking some fresh water to cool down, you (if: $phone)[ [[go back to work.->Cops & me]] ](else: )[ [[go back to work.->Bibliography]] ]
{ (set: $phone to true) }\ You slowly move your hand until your phone is in reach, and, in a few quick strokes, send an already written SMS to your ally in the police department. It looks like your uninvited guest didn't catch you. But that doesn't make the situation any better for the next instant. In the best of cases, help will come in about ten minutes. An amount of time you need to earn one way or the other. So you get ready to speak nonetheless. Also, your phone can of course record anything that will be said in this conversation. This could be useful later on. But that's not a simple manipulation, and you're not used to performing it discreetly. * [[Try it regardless.->Phone 2]] * [[Play safe.->Let's discuss this]]
"And how did you get the idea of coming to my office with such equipment?" He shrugs and flexes. "Oh, I just want to help. To help get rid of the garbage spoiling this world. That's it." You give him a doubtful look. "That's not a weapon to "get rid of" people. That's a weapon to make them suffer." He strikes your desk with his bat. There's a crack and the table ends up even less pretty than it was the minute before. "It's a weapon to make the fun last longer." You don't even bat an eyelid in front of his pathetic attempt at making you uncomfortable. * [[This already went on for too long.->Violence]] * [[Just keep him talking.->Keep talking boy]]
You try to launch the app sneakingly. You would have succeeded if one of the developers hadn't had the great idea to include a loud beep at the start of the recording. As soon as he hears it, the man understands that you're on your phone, and stops his intimidation parade and launches his weapon to try to strike your phone. You retract your hand in time to avoid the first hit. [[Then use it to punch him.->Violence]]
"So. Should I guess you're just a sadist taking his pleasure from hurting vulnerable members of minorities?" Your speech amuses him. Before answering, he slowly walks around the table, around you, dangerously playing with his weapon. "Sadist? No, no. I am one of the good guys. I live to destroy all parasites plaguing this country. Those who take, with the state's complicity, money from honest working citizens and use it to enjoy an indolent and depraved life." There's no conviction in his voice as he tells you all these clichés. You're pretty sure he does not believe them. He just wants an excuse. "I'm not your first victim, am I?" "Indeed. You're a big fish. With the boys, we felt the need to train on a bunch of smaller whores before going for you." And, slowly, clearly enjoying himself, (if: $phone)[ [[he narrates all the atrocities he has performed.->Cops & rogue]] ](else:)[ [[he narrates all the atrocities he has performed.->Eyes]] ]
{ (set: $legal_mary to it+1) }\ Someone knocks on the door, putting an end to the man's disgusting ramblings. Immediately, he points his bat in your direction, and, displaying what he must consider his most fearsome face, he puts a finger on his lips, then makes it run along his neck. His little mime over, he opens the door a little bit, just enough to show his face, and starts speaking with the person behind it. "Yes?" "Hello mister. Police. We received a call about an aggression going on here." "You must have got the wrong place." "No, you're where you should be." The man turns back and looks a dagger at you, but you ignore it as you ignored all his other intimidation tactics. "This man is detaining me in my own office against my will under the threat of a weapon." A heavy silence has time to set in after your factual description of the situation before the third member of the conversation speaks again. "Sir, I must ask you to allow us to enter. Now." He stops for a few seconds, decides to first put his weapon back into his bag, and finally opens the door. Two cops are waiting on the other side, confused but unstressed. They enter, and ask for explanations, then, after an initial cacophony caused by the two of you trying to make your point at the same time, they ask for silence, then tell you to express yourselves one by one, "starting with mister". He does so quite badly, getting all muddled between different versions, first pretending he was just passing by, while making it clear he is not one of "these degenerates", then suddenly changing his story, now telling the tale of you being his one-night stand. The bat? It's there because he was "about to go hit some balls" (there are no balls in the bag). The damaged furniture? "Was already like that before I came." When it's finally your turn, you just tell the purest truth. Once both of the speeches are over, the cops ask the man to go out "to avoid any further complication". And he does comply. Slowly. Smiling. Mocking. And the cops don't seem to care. After an eternity, he is nowhere to be seen anymore, and one of the policemen tells you you have to come to the police office to lodge an official complaint. And then they both leave without further ado, washing their hands of what could happen next, the brute probably no more than a few hundred meters away (if he is walking quickly and in a straight line). Luckily, he actually does not come back. Or at least he does not for now. That's not a satisfying conclusion, but for lack of a better, [[you go back to work.->Bibliography]]
{ (set: $eyes to true) (set: $bibliography to it + (dataset: "n/a")) (set: $bibliography to it + (dataset: "devil's eye")) }\ He tells you about all the horrors that he and his friends have done. One by one. With numerous gruesome details. He may be lying. He may be telling the truth. He may mix both. That doesn't matter. What matters is that he is making you //really angry//. "And your boys, where are they today?" He looks surprised, as if he wasn't expecting you to break his monologue at some point. "They should have been there. But they went all chicken at the last minute. Because, somehow, they're still afraid of your mother. As if she was some demonic guardian angel always watching over her little girl." "//Speak of the devil and she doth appear.//" He laughs at your solemn statement. Then his eyes catch yours. And he freezes. There was that one time you had a weird conversation with Ikebana. Alright, all your conversations with Ikebana are weird. But this one you remember clearly. You were talking about the most frightening people you knew of. You ranked her third, and Onawa second. She, for once, almost agreed with you. The order was right she said. But she then told you you forgot someone in your list, someone she herself ranked second. Someone really terrifying when angry. Demonic mothers scarcely birth angels after all. He is not so playful now. Nor so talkative. Nor confident. Perhaps he is starting to remember who he is facing right now. "You. Out. Now." He doesn't comply, yet, but he doesn't dare to start his little dance again. His hands are tensed on the bat, and he now holds it more like a teddy bear than a weapon, as if it was some magical talisman against the monsters of the night. And his eyes are still locked on yours. "That. Fucking. Witch. Gaze. You've got your mother corrupted blood, you abomination." He is uneasy, and you have no intention of helping him feel better. Now it's your turn to speak slowly. "Tell me, how does it feel? To not be in an extremely dominant position of power, to not be invulnerable anymore? To realize you're actually risking something, that you're putting yourself in danger? That your little game may have unforeseen consequences for yourself? "I'm sure that's a feeling you're not used to. From what you told me, you always take great care in choosing the most vulnerable victims, solitary members of a community whose sufferings are more likely to be ignored, or even enjoyed, by the power of law and of the people. You play your sick game safe. "Let me rephrase that. You're a coward. The worst sort, the sort hurting others to hide its fear. And bloody shifty cowards have no place in this room. "You see, for most people, simply passing this door requires a courage you simply can't imagine. The journey ending in this place is long and harsh, a constant fight to overcome the many biases society put into you. Because coming to a guidance office for n/a, a category of people too often labeled with infamy, means accepting you're one of them or at least close to them, and therefore share their stigma. "You're insulting many brave people simply by being here. And that makes me angry. "So I will make this simple enough for your little brain to understand. You can either leave my office right now and never come back. Or I will remind you of what an isolated unarmed cornered woman can do when she's really angry." His feelings are printed on his face. He is remembering. The Scarlet Flowers incident. Who would be mad enough to hit a beefy bodyguard thrice her weight so hard she would break the bones of her own hand? So hard she would also break one of the the man's rib, piercing a lung and sending him straight to the hospital with his life endangered? He knows he is bigger. He knows he is stronger. He doesn't know if he is quicker, more precise or better trained. But he is sure that you are //madder//. He steps back. He tries to make it looks like he is not, but to no avail. He is justly terrified. "You're all fucking mad in this family." A final cry, especially pitiful. You decide to stop caring at this point, rectify your position on your chair and go back to your work. You hear him running for his life as soon as you break eye contact. Problem solved. [[You'got better things to do.->Bibliography]]
The cavalry, a.k.a two local cops, comes in around 10 minutes after they were needed. You explain what happened, show them the traces left by your aggressor, and give them as many details as you can remember. One of the two takes a few notes. The other just keeps making nasty comments constantly, about you, your appearance, your sexuality, your parents, Bull... In the end, his colleague feels obliged to order him to shut up. That's sadly as far as his support goes, as he then tells you that you have to go to the police office to make your official complaint, admitting there's little chance that anything comes out of this. He also advises you, without seeming to realize the irony, to "take care of yourself". As if preventing scumbags from attacking you in your workplace was something you had control over and could easily avoid with a few life rules, like washing your hands before eating your vegetables. And then they leave you alone in your damaged office, not any better off than five minutes ago. Actually, you're even slightly more depressed. To clear up your mind, [[you dig yourself under your work.->Bibliography]]
{ (set: $groupie to true) (save-game: "Main") }\ A new person enters your office, once more unannounced. A young woman wearing a pastel blouse and pastel pants, a white rose on her chest and a brown ceramic bracelet on her wrist. You cannot not recognize the //ikebana// fashion, in its more mainstream, least objectionable, variant. But by itself, this information doesn't help you much in understanding who you're facing. She looks slightly tired, and, at this hour, this could be because she went there directly after completing her day at work. But, in spite of that, she's still radiating with energy, looking all around her with a lot of curiosity and a hint of deception. Once there is not any corner of the room she has left unscanned, she crashes on the visitor chair and jumps straight to the question you could read on her lips all along. "Are you really Psy's daughter?" For the n-th time today, where n is far too big, you confirm you're indeed the daughter of //Onawa Rootless//. "AND of Ikebana?" This one, you're less used to hearing. First because most people don't properly add up all the facts about your complex family, and second because Ikebana is quite a controversial personality, far more than Onawa herself. By the way she dresses, your current visitor mustn't be one of her most fervent opponents, but it's still best to choose your words carefully. Actually, if you could not answer at all, it would be perfect. The exact nature of your relationship with Ikebana is something you never managed to pinpoint, and no response you could give will feel perfectly right. While for Onawa, you have no hesitation, as, even disregarding the fact that she brought you into this world, she moved heaven and earth to stay by your side during your childhood and teens, even against all odds. While Ikebana was... Ikebana is a complex case. Finally, you decide for the answer that, you hope, will close the subject as soon as possible. "Indeed." "And with such a fabulous legacy, you dress like an undertaker?" ... * [[Just ignore the remark.->Just go on]] * [[Take some time to answer it.->Take time to answer]]
"Perhaps you could tell me the reasons of your presence today?" She crosses her legs, now looking quite dismayed. "Oh. //That.//" Contrasting the tit for tat style of speech she displayed until now, she needs several seconds to compose an answer for that question. You manage to count up to three before she gets her second wind. "Actually, I just came here out of raw curiosity. I heard about this office for the first time only recently, while reading some social media article. Your name caught my attention, and I couldn't resist checking for myself that you were indeed who I thought you were." She tilts her head left, then right, examining you with an overdone bewildered expression. "So... Why "Hope, extreme counselor", when you could have been anything else with the gifts nature gave you?" Her shameless, inquisitive and never-stopping attitude is starting to get on your nerves. * [[Remind her you're not there for her amusement.->Just go, please]] * [[Patiently answer her questions.->Why am I doing this?]]
"The way we dress always means something. At many different levels. Due to the way society works at the moment, with jobs and castes requiring a certain dress code, our clothing tells more about how rich we are, about our position in the social ladder, about the social group we are part of, than about who we are as individuals. One of the many causes my mother—" Unintentional singular. You're not sure if your guest took note of it of not. "—fights for is for these choices to become ours. That we may truly decide what we want to wear instead of putting on an informal yet strict uniform. //Her// outrageous clothes are first of all an activist demonstration." "Yeah, yeah, I know all of that. Her funeral face paint made quite a scandal at the time. But doesn't that support the idea that you should wear less //normal// clothes?" You try hard not to sigh. "Things work both ways. You're not breaking any restriction by forcing people to wear pink instead of black, you're just replacing one interdiction with another. My mother loves to put enough make-up on her body to radically change her appearance, she loves to adorns herself with colours so bright that she almost shines in complete darkness. But that's not necessarily a style that //I// appreciate. And, indirectly, I'm fighting for a complementary cause. The right to be part of a community, to feel good in it, without needing to comply to all its unwritten rules." She gets your point. "This is a morals lesson, isn't it? You're telling me I shouldn't judge you on your looks." She cracks a baleful smile. "And, to you, what does //my// choice of clothing reveal in //me//?" You indeed caught a few things from her dress, but you're not sure she will appreciate you telling her. * [[If you do so anyway.->Flower]] * [[If you go back to the conversation you //should// be having.->Just go on]]
{ (set: $bibliography to it + (dataset: "ikebana")) (set: $flower to true) }\ You tell her your mind. "Confusion. That's what I think of when I look at you. You want to prove something to the world, but you don't know what." She is about to retaliate, but you don't give her enough time to fire. "You choose to dress yourself according to the style Ikebana coined, based on the harmony between the different elements you wear upon yourself, including accessories and most especially flowers. I have no doubt you studied the whole history of this fashion, that you know Ikebana designed it to bear her shifting convictions and feelings on her skin at all times, using the decorative art she named herself after as her main inspiration. In a sense, it's her own re-invention of the T-shirt with a catchphrase, except printed characters are replaced by the union of more subtle components." She has crossed her arms before her chest, moody, and as soon as you take a second to breathe, she steps in. "//As you said//, I know all of this. I am not an idiot playing rebel by putting a flower in her hair. I choose a combination that makes sense to convey a message." "Your ensemble is indeed coherent. With itself. But not with you." She tilts her head, her hostility quickly replaced with curiosity. "The way you speak, the way you move your body, the way you act, the way you //are//, they don't match the catchphrase you chose. I don't remember everything Ikebana taught me about ikebana..." You're genuinely happy Ikebana //tried// her best to teach you, but that doesn't change the fact that she must be the worst teacher in the entire universe. At least. "But you wear upon you colors and symbols of respect, devotion, subdued love. A friendly message, but one quite cautious, restrained. A polar opposite to your totally outgoing behavior." She smiles warmly at your analysis. "You got me. You're straight-laced, but you're better than you look at //feeling// people. Indeed, I may be a slightly more stressed person than I try to show, the kind that spent far too much time deciding on an appropriate costume for my first encounter with the daughter of legends, to the point that I forgot that my old bad personality would give me away right from the start." She blinks outrageously and shamelessly. "Next time, I will bring some bright red holly right from the start." [[You've bounced on enough allusions for now.->Just go on]]
{ (set: $bibliography to it + (dataset: "n/a")) }\ "Stop. I need to remind you that this consulting office is for n/a people, or those related to them, that are in need of someone to listen to them. And, from what you told me up to now, you don't seem to be included in the aforementioned category. Either you prove me wrong or you leave." At your words, she locks herself in, suddenly still and silent. (if: $flower)[She stays like that, motionless, never taking the initiative nor looking like she is about to leave. She may simply have run out of arguments and decided to sulk, but something tells you there is more than meets the eye. She's testing you.

However, none of them is on topic, and it's closer to a questioning than a meaningful conversation. You put an end to this breaker wave swiftly and sharply. She then sighs, lengthily, exaggeratedly, theatrically. "You're no fun." You agree silently, with a small movement of your chin. She sighs even more, stands up, complains again, and, at last, goes out. [[You're finally able to resume to your work.->Bibliography]]]
{ (set: $bibliography to it + (dataset: "freedom city")) (set: $why_this to true) }\ You don't need time to think about your answer since you've already pondered the question quite a lot in the past. "I wouldn't say I could have been anything. Sure, theoretically, I could have chosen to raise goats in the countryside, living as a hermit on water and cheese. But when you're Onawa's daughter, and you share her ideals, it's pretty hard to imagine yourself opting for a life where you're not contributing to the cause in some way. "And once I made my mind up about that, it wasn't that easy to find a career fitting my criteria. Especially as I didn't want to do the same thing as my mother, if only because she's already doing a great job at it and doesn't really need much help. "I started by studying. A lot. I wanted to learn as much as possible about all academic subjects I thought were related to my objective. I was also doing some charity work on the side. But none of this felt like enough. I felt useful, but not as much as I could be. I felt like I wasn't properly exploiting my own assets to do good, that I could do better than that." She smiles maliciously at your lack of humility, which is understandable. But you were indeed that convinced of your importance, that prideful, back then. "I was lost when destiny gave me a hand. It all started with me accidentally answering a call from Bull." "Bull? //That// Bull?" She breaks out laughing. "Yes, that one. He wanted to speak with my mother about an affair he was working on. I proposed to help him myself. At the time, I just wanted to see him in the flesh, to check if the legends were true. I learned they were bowdlerized. And that with his underhanded help, I could touch people I could not even approach under normal circumstances." She understands who you're speaking of and produces some undefined whistling sound with her mouth. You can't say if that's a mark of enthusiasm, admiration or mockery. "You //really// are your parents' daughter." You choose to ignore her last remark. "Long story short, to be able to work on such affairs on a regular basis, I first needed to become a public servant. The exact reason behind this obligation is one of the many mysteries of the administration. I then searched for a job meeting that condition and my convictions. And that's how I ended here." The last part of your story just went over her little head, and she whispers out loud her real priorities. "What can you tell me about what is happening up there? I have heard so many stories, and none of them make any sense. But you, you must have witnessed so many strange things. I'm eager to listen to them all. Chiefly the sauciest." [[You should really put the conversation back on tracks.->Just go, please]]
{ (set: $empathy to true) }\ What was her joke already? Some obscure //hanakotoba// reference. If Ikebana was there, she may have given a hint of a start of something resembling a smile when hearing it, but you missed the reference on the fly. And now, you're searching for it. Because it may have been no joke. It takes you some time, but you finally get it. "Relationship problems?" She agrees, now red as a kid surprised with their hand in the cookie jar. You reassure her. "Everything you say is for my ears only. And whatever you may tell me, I'm not here to judge you. I'm here to listen to you, and that's all." She shows some hints of hesitation, then speaks without her usual enthusiasm. "I'm deeply attracted to n/a people. But all my relationships end quickly and badly. How can I explain it?... Let's say that before, it always looks like it will be fabulous, and at dawn, I realize it was just normal." Ah. Fetishist attraction. Nothing special. No need to beat around the bush for so long. "Indeed, people tend to be only people and not embodied fantasies." You readjust your position to be more comfortable for a long discussion. "I have no miraculous solution for that problem, but that's indeed something we can talk about here." The next moment, hell breaks loose. She resumes speaking at an extremely fast pace, telling you one crude story after the other, her bag of anecdotes apparently bottomless. One good hour later, she realizes she really has to go meet some obligation, and runs out with an expedited "thanks and see you next time". You pretty much did nothing but listen to her, but at least it looks like it helped her feel better, which is the only thing that counts. [[As for your day, it is not over.->Bibliography]]
One article among the many published for the 10^^th^^ anniversary of the "Chaos, out!" law. --- //Freedom Price//. That's what its inhabitants now call it. A name of their own, opposing the official and dehumanized "special area" of the administration, the insulting //Insane City// of its most enraged adversaries, and its original and obsolete title, Winterfield. Those four names make for a great summary of the story of this place. Just another town named by unimaginative immigrants at first, next a legal experiment gone horribly wrong^^1^^, then a dangerous political tool, and finally an independent city state. Some would object that it is not that independent, as it survives on importing food and electricity from the country surrounding it, but when a country puts walls and barbwires around a location, when it prevents any people from going in or out and washes its hands of anything that could happen behind the concrete, it cannot seriously pretend it still considers it its own. People who remained inside, either by ideological conviction or by lack of choice^^2^^, quickly felt they needed a name to express that this was a new city that was being born through isolation. A name they could take pride in, reminding the world that they were people in their own right, and not just unofficial prisoners. Hence //Freedom Price//. Freedom's price. The price of freedom. Freedom, even if harshly paid for. A beautiful name. Almost unheard of on this side of wall, even in this era where technology is supposed to connect us all, as it is tacitly banned from most medias, from both the old and the new guard, who prefer to use names //we// coined for //them//. And, of course, a name unrecognized by any government. Because recognizing it means also accepting that Freedom City is now its own country, and should be treated as such, as an equal, not a vassal. 1. On purpose?

Transcript of the last segment of a middle afternoon TV show (original video file is attached, but low quality) --- Host: And now, our trends page. Today's guest is Konohama-//sensei//, world-renowned ikebana specialist, who honors us with her presence. She will tell us all you need to know about this new fashion known as ikebana style. Ms. Konohama, hello. Guest: Hello Marie-Louise. But sadly, I can't tell you anything about this "ikebana style". H: Surely you jest. You are a graduate from the best schools, received many distinctions for your own creations... G: I have some knowledge of the flower arrangement art known as ikebana, yes. But I know nothing of fashion. Actually, I only accepted your nice invitation for the opportunity it gives me to make the difference clear. H: But isn't the ikebana style based on the ikebana you practice? G: They do have some common points of course. They both make use of //hanakotoba//, the Japanese flower language, and they share some other color and material symbolisms. But you shouldn't confuse a bridge with a well on the pretense they are both built of bricks. Likewise, the traditional ikebana is an ancestral minimalist art with complex and stiff rules while this fashion is far more baroque, extensive and chaotic. H: I see. So you're saying this trend is a bad counterfeit of the real ikebana? G: That's totally not what I said! I don't rank art styles, even if they are some I love better of course. If I can't approve its name, one its creator never coined by the way, as Ikebana is her //nom de plume// but she never actually named her clothing style, I still appreciate it for its aesthetic and empathic values. H: Empathic? G: Indeed. If all pieces of art are trying to convey a message, this one is particularly direct in its approach. And that's not without problems as it makes use of a language designed to be equivocal and elliptical. Thus, without context, each outfit it produces can be interpreted in many different ways, often contradictory. It's only when worn by its creator that it acquires its proper sense, the behavior of the human inside completing the message. Hence why empathy is the key to this art. H: Interesting analysis, but Ikebana's infamous associability kind of refutes it. G: Does it? To have difficulties communicating through speech does not mean one doesn't want to communicate with others at all. And to get over this contradiction, one may need to create their own way of communicating. (display: "Back to appropriate")
{ (set: $accountant to true) (save-game: "Main") }\ "Hello Hope. How are you?" You know that voice. You hear it about once a week, as it belongs to one of your most regular visitors. He is tall and skinny, wears the standard shirt, tie, and good shoes of those who work in the business district. Nothing special, as long as you don't look higher than his neck. Past this point begins the wooden mask entirely hiding his face. He owns several different masks, but they all share the same traits, and this one is not different: refined, stylized, relying on a very limited color palette. You know he sculpts and paints them himself, but you don't know how or from what he takes his inspiration. That's not a subject he talks about, nor one he needs to talk about. "Hello John. Everything's fine. And on your side?" "New mission." In other words, new colleagues. "How is it going?" "Not that good. I've been sent by the judge to audit some big company with shadowy accounts. Let me tell you they didn't welcome me with open arms. For them, I'm a spy they're forced to accommodate. They can't kick me out, but they can spit in my coffee." He taps his mask. "Obviously, this has attracted its fair share of nasty comments. But I honestly think they would have found another way to insult me without it." "How much time?" "At least one month. More if I find something fishy, which is the most likely option." You nod. "Anything I can do about that?" "Not really. That's more or less how my job is supposed to work. If it really gets out of hand, there's a whole service dedicated to solve problems of that kind. As you can guess, it's quite common in the business." "OK. Fine then." A heavy silence follows this last sentence. The first time you met John, he was having a ton of problems, and sessions were long and complex. But some months ago, his life took a right turn, and you don't have much to say to each other. Your discussions have evolved into unimportant exchanges of banalities, of little stories with little consequences. * (if: $violence)[ [[Continue to speak as usual.->What are you hiding?]] ](else:)[ [[Continue to speak as usual.->Nothing to say]] ] * [[Tell him you don't think it's necessary for you two to see each other every week.->You don't need me anymore]] * [[Just politely end the conversation there.->Next time]]
{ (set: $bibliography to it + (dataset: "bull")) }\ Your cellphone rings. Not your personal one, but the one you keep for work-related affairs only. The one only one person uses. "Hello Bull. How's business?" "I could tell you to stop calling me like that, as I said to your mother about a thousand times, but this has been too long a week for our comic duo." "You don't call just to say hello." "Jake Jackson, ring a bell?" "Never heard of the guy. He sounds like a Stan Lee character with his double J." "He filed a complaint against you a few hours ago. He says... Let's me read this... That you allured him while he was only minding his own business, that you brought him to your lair, and that you savagely assaulted him once behind closed doors." "Skinhead?" "Yeah." "I wrecked one this morning. He came to my office to remodel my head with a baseball bat and I wasn't so inclined. The rest is bullshit." "I'm a bad influence on you. But yeah, must be the same guy. And with your usual subtlety, I'm about sure you left enough fingerprints or blood on him to prove three times that you did hit him. Outside of the incontestable, it will be your version against his." "As usual." "My little Hope (you hate when he starts speaking to you like that; that he is older than your parents is no excuse), I know that thinking before doing is not something that you do in your family, but there is a moment when one needs to stop acting like a total idiot. If he has the guts to properly sue you, no one can say how it will end. There are judges in this city who will swallow anything as long as they can put you behind bars." (if: $phone)[ "Bull, I tried to play the good girl. In exchange, you sent me two idiots far too late." "Hope, I do what I can too. I'm not exactly patrolling your neighborhood day and night, so I just passed the message to your local police station. Not my fault if they're idiots." "Not mine either." "You won't avoid this conversation by trying to push the guilt on me lady." ] "Fine. Just put the file on the pile, with the others." Most people wouldn't flag Bull as a creative person, but the maelstrom of unexpected swear words now sprouting out of your phone proves he is far from being devoid of imagination. "I don't even know why I still care about you and your damn family." "Dunno too." "On a different note, you're still OK for tomorrow's mission?" "Don't worry, I'm reckless yet organized. I will be at the café as planned." "OK. See you soon, idiot." "See you soon, old man." In spite of your put-on nonchalance, you're not happy with how things are evolving, if only because this problem is going to take time away from more important things. But at the moment, there's nothing you can do to change that fact. [[So you go back to work.->Accountant]]
Scan of the original paper report and of its handwritten annotations, plus retyped copy to make reading and searching for information easier. --- ''Ministry of Justice'' ''Confidential'' Introduction: A brief summary of James Alexander's career inside the police force Pushed by poverty, James Alexander applied for a policeman job soon after he was of age and passed the entrance test with mediocre but sufficient results. To quote his examiner from that time: "Unmotivated, but able enough to do what he will be told". Even though those words show that not much was expected of him, he still succeeded in disappointing us, quickly proving himself to be an immoral, greedy sloth, his only remarkable skills being his incredible ability at dodging work and his expertise at becoming blind and deaf for a reasonable sum. Sadly, nowadays, not a single piece of evidence of his implication in any bribery case still exists, as he was lucky enough to perpetrate his crimes soon before the Raingate scandal was brought to the light. In the great panic that followed this reveal, a massive amount of files were put to the torch by overreacting officials to make sure not the smallest trace of their involvement remained. Alexander's were among them. Then came the great clean-up, with many undesirable officers moved to services with less opportunities to do anything illegal, or at least farther away from public eyes. M. Alexander was thus transferred to a very bureaucratic position, overseeing people under house arrest. It should have been a dead end for his career. If only ''Psy'' had not been one of the criminals under his responsibility. Years after the fact, it may sound crazy to have ever put such a dangerous convict under such an unreliable surveillance. But that was another time, over two decades ago, long before the social and political upheaval in which Psy played a key role. At the time, she was just yet another activist. They quickly became partners. She was giving him money, he was helping her cheat the surveillance system. When things turned more complex, with the access restrictions to the newborn //special area// quickly piling up, he became a key member of her network. Thanks to his situation within the police and his own net of connections among petty criminals and other unscrupulous characters, sometimes colleagues, he could, in exchange for even more money, help her and her friends cross the wall both ways. This "mere smuggling", to reuse the expression of one of his then superiors questioned for this investigation, is what enabled Psy's interference with the proper resolution of the official inquiry regarding the //Unconcerned Murders// case. You may recall it as a long series of violent deaths among marginal people, with pretty much no media coverage until the rising star Psy and some of her famous friends brought it to TV in an explosive manner. After that slip of communication, the police went under the spotlights, and were soon accused of not doing their best to solve the affair quickly because the victims were not exemplary citizens. An uncomfortable position, which turned especially bad when the affair was solved... by Psy and Alexander. Perhaps not only by themselves, but at least without any official help. In this context, with the political tensions on both sides on the wall at their peak, we were forced to sit at the negotiating table with orders from above to do anything to save face. This ended with the skulduggeries of M. Alexander somehow made official. Formally, he was retroactively made head of a small independent unit with special permission to go through the border at will and allowed to temporarily extend this privilege to guest advisors. Thus, his and Psy's implications were now legal. This arrangement should have been shut down as soon as the masses' attention had moved elsewhere, but politics being politics, it still exists today, and M. Alexander is still part of it. The other side even says it evolved into a proper police force, "actually protecting and serving instead of enforcing order by silencing protest" (their leader's words), but, please pardon me for the crude language, I call //bullshit// on this. The favorite word of M. Alexander by the way, one he cannot help but pronounce in front of any microphone crossing his path. (display: "Back to appropriate")
John is no idiot and he knows you well, and as the conversation goes on for some time, he gets that you're trying to hide your hand from him. "Hope... What happened to your hand?" You try to stop him before things get loose. "Nothing. Everything's fine, John." "No, they're not. That's a fresh wound. And..." He looks around, searching for clues, and, as you didn't clean very thoroughly after this morning's incident, quickly finds them: A damaged chair, some recently dried-up blood... Not enough to picture the whole scene, but enough to get some ideas. "Hope, what the hell happened?" * [[Tell him the truth.->You deserve to know]] * [[Cut short the discussion.->You don't need to know]]
With a bit of creativity, one always finds something to discuss about. The session soon descends into a tea party, sadly without the cakes, as each of you tells their own personal insignificant stories. Half an hour later, time enough to justify this was not an useless visit, John wishes you a good day and departs. As for you, you're actually happy, as this discussion was quite pleasant even if it didn't go anywhere. A smile on your lips, [[you return to work.->Bibliography]]
{ (set: $fragile_john to false) (set: $rebel_john to true) }\ You tell him everything about what happened this morning. You don't mention the similar incidents that have happened in the past, but he is not stupid. "That's not the first time something like that happened, is it?" "Indeed." "And don't you fear that, one day, it won't be so easy? That you will have to face someone stronger, or better armed, or accompanied by a gang? That you will be helpless and truly hurt, or worse?" "John. That's a danger existing above all of our heads. Mine, yours, and a lot of other people far more vulnerable. We aren't going to hide under a rock until the end of time, so we have to live with it." He is not satisfied with your answer, but accepts it. "For your judiciary troubles, I may be able to help. That's my domain after all. In part at least." "John, don't burn your wings for me." You suddenly stands up as he remains seated. You're shorter than him, by a fair amount, but in this position you feel like you're towering over him. "I'm serious John. I have things sorted out. Don't be a fool." "Hope, I respect you more than anyone else. But you really have to learn that, sometimes, the best course of action is to let people have their own folly." You're fighting the urge to tear off his mask. You know that if you do so, he will lose all his confidence at that instant, reverting to the state of a terrified baby unable to contradict you. And you also know that if you were to do something like that, you would be as much of an asshole as the guy you punched this morning. So you sit down, and, as if you were a reasonable adult, you ask him to tell you more. And he does. What he is telling you is actually not stupid, and he knows his stuff about how justice works in this city, especially the backstage part. When he leaves you one hour later, you have learned a lot, and are feeling more confident about the development of this affair. [[You open back your computer to note a few things quickly.->Bibliography]]
"Nothing you need to worry about." "Hope..." "John I know how to protect myself. Do not worry about me. Worry about yourself instead." "Sorry, but no." He articulated this last word with a determination he has never accustomed you to. "Hope. You should remember you're no superheroine. You may have an incredible strength of spirit, you mother may be a legend, but you don't need to do everything all by yourself. You're always there to help us when we are in a pinch. Let us help you for once." John, straight on his feet, arms crossed before his chest, looks like he is not going to move until you answer him. This is a bit ridiculous, but you're too stunned to laugh. Instead, you reveal the truth. (display: "You deserve to know")
"John, I don't think we still need to see each other this often." He instantly stiffens up. "You've made peace with yourself, successfully returned to the outside world, secured acceptable employment, solved all of yours big problems. You don't need me anymore. Except in case of an emergency, one routine visit per month should suffice from now on." You of course can't read any emotion on his face, but you know him enough to decipher the reflex movements of his body: He is freaking out. John used to have dangerous panic attacks. Dangerous for himself. They more or less vanished as his situation got better, but his current state makes you fear for a relapse. * [[Immediately attempt to calm him down.->Please calm down]] * [[Give him a little more time.->I knew this day would come]]
"Of course, my door will always remain open for you. It's just that I don't think you still need to come so regularly." Your explanations soon turn cyclic, repeating again and again the same idea with different words, a reassuring chant. John agrees from time to time, but without much motivation and without adding anything new himself. When you stop, he barely concludes. "You're right. As always." He gets to his feet and prepares to leave. "See you next month Hope." Seeing how feeble he is on his legs, you're starting to feel guilty. "See you next month. Don't hesitate to call if you have any problem." He nods and stumbles out. You're about to go after him, but he manages to find back his balance and leaves without more difficulty. He looks so troubled that you debate pursuing him. And since hesitating takes time, once you've made your mind, he is already out of sight. You look at your phone, taking note to call him later to check if he is okay. Just in case. Better safe than sorry. For now, [[you return to your work.->Bibliography]]
{ (set: $fragile_john to false) (set: $john_acceptance to true) }\ "Indeed, I reached the same conclusion by myself." That's not exactly what you expected him to say, but, in spite of his broken voice and the few stress sweats he broke, he doesn't look so bad. Afraid, nervous, yet relieved. He goes on, still quavering. "You know, I think I can never thank you enough. Six months ago, I was in pieces, and now... things are alright. My life's not perfect, but it's a life, not just my body refusing to give up. The time when I was only rising up in the morning because I simply couldn't physiologically get more sleep and couldn't sleep at night because I was too afraid of the next day is over. Nothing short of a miracle for me." He barely raises his hand, then quickly returns it to its original position, in an aborted move you fail to comprehend. "You're doing good work, Hope. Never doubt it. You're no superheroine, you cannot do everything by yourself, you cannot succeed every time, but you're doing good. For a lot of people, you're a ray of hope." He pauses, searches for his words. "I was extremely lucky to ever meet you. And that's why I understand perfectly that I need to stop abusing your time when there is no more need. A time others as desperate as I used to be need." He stands up. "See you... I don't know when. In several months probably. Just to show you I'm alive and healthy." You look at him carefully. Good or bad, he made his decision and you respect it. "See you next time John." And he departs, his walk a little clumsy. You escort him to the door, where he wishes you well again, and leaves to return to his life. You close the door behind him. [[And return to your own.->Bibliography]]

Implied they wouldn't get over it without the help of some responsible adults, an indirect way of saying that they were still kids." "Not at all. I just considered that what they needed first was allies among their relatives." "If you were the one receiving such advice, would you have complied?"

Just how many times in your life did you have to justify the big choices you've made? Just how many people, including yourself, have accused you of being a fraud, a glorified follower of the path your mother made for you? Through sheer repetition, you know exactly what to answer. "I knew when I decided on such a job I wouldn't be able to avoid the constant, never-ending, unbearable, insufferable comparison with my mother, or, more exactly, with an idealized version of her. I knew people would keep searching for any detail, no matter how insignificant, proving, whatever that means, that I'm just copying her. That's no challenge when I pursue similar ideals, when my job is more or less in the same domain, when I look a little like her and share some of her mannerisms. Newsflash: She is my mother. Of course we have things in common! Heck, for instance, we both breathe and eat. Incredible!" As for breathing, yours is currently heavy. "I knew it. But I went this way regardless. Because it was what I wanted to do. I wanted to help a cause that I believe in. Even if I am to be mocked as a poor copy of my mother. Actually, is this really a problem? Perhaps I am indeed but a mere shadow of the awesomeness of my mother. But you have no need to be the very best to do good. The world can't be made up only of exceptional people, it needs its fair share of average ones to turn around. Doing only so-so because you are only so-so is still better than doing nothing out of fear to not be perfect." You're still not done. "I know what you're about to object. Does any of this give me the right to make use of my family name, to exploit the legacy of my parents? The answer is yes. If that helps me in doing a better job, if that helps me in helping other people, yes. Just yes. And I think it does help. If only as a permanent reminder that Psy is another human, one named Onawa, an ordinary and thus flawed human with likewise children, a person they can really relate to instead of some inaccessible supernatural being whose case is so different from them." You. Need. To. Catch. Your. Breath. Once you've cooled down, the now croaky voice rings again. "Are you fine? Did you regain your composure?" You agree with no motivation.

"And John? Same. Don't you think it's time to let him fly by himself?" "John has a delicate personality and a complicated past. Rushing him could have tragic consequences, even now." "Is he fragile, or do //you// suppose he is fragile? There's a world of differences between the two. And I won't even talk about the possibilities that you're preventing him from reaching his full potential by overprotecting him. Do you think [[mom->Mama]] would have been so tame?"
"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" "Obviously yes, but I still need to hear it out loud." "Good. Then here I go. I think that a part of you wants to be like mommy. No, that's not exactly it. It does not want to be her, but it wants to be an over-the-top n/a like she was in her younger days, as unsettling, chaotic, dangerous. Someone void of any limit, with no care for the rules. An unstoppable, incontrollable fire doing whatever it wants." It's your own voice, and it's the hissing pitch of a snake at the time. "But you've got responsibilities now. You cannot just go all wild until the consequences of your actions catch you. There are people depending on you. Needing you as their rock. You're allowed to be crazy, but you have to remain stable. And we've reached the point where things have taken a vicious turn. As you are encouraging people to break free of their own inhibitions, when at the same time you are nothing but a pack of barely restrained urges. How hypocritical is that?" "Shut up." "Or perhaps it's even worse. Perhaps you are not helping them fulfill their own needs, but you're pushing //yours// upon them." "Shut up." "Refusing to speak will not help you. If you felt the need to give a voice to your internal conflicts, it's not without reason." "Shut. Up." You shut your damn mouth tight. Because this conversation cannot go anywhere good. Life is about choices and sacrifices. You cannot be a rock star, an astronaut, and a firefighter all at the same time. When you accepted this job, you knew it meant locking down the most savage part of yourself. That you would need to keep yourself in check. That crossing the line could destroy all or part of what you've done. That you must not break loose even if it means taking upon yourself some humiliation, pain, and frustration.

"To sink so deep into madness I won't ever come out of it?" "This one is not even in your top 5.

"I said it's one of your worst fears, I didn't label it as the most likely to come true. The most enduring however, it certainly is, as it is rooted in the greatest mystery: what you are." You feel dizzy at the last words, spoken softly but echoing again and again in you ears. If there is a question at which you never found a satisfying answer, it's indeed "Who am I?". You never really got the whole "Know thyself" thing. For example, right now, you live about three different lives, one at this job, one at your other job, and the last one in private. And each one displays different and sometimes contradictory aspects of your personality. The discrepancies are so considerable that you often doubt who you are in the end. If such an absolute truth does exist. Silence sets in as you ponder all of this. The simple fact that this conversation was so short is by itself a sign you did change. You are not who you were yesterday, and this will have consequences for tomorrow. Now, change can be a good thing as much as it can be a bad thing, and you're not necessarily in the wrong right now.

"That's a lot of metaphors for little sense. I'm no sick beast." "I wouldn't be so sure. And once again, I don't care much about you, but I do care about the rest of the world. And, whatever you may pretend, you are a person in a position of authority. Because of your family name. Because of your long experience within this community. Because of your very job as a counselor. What you say, what you do, has an influence on those around you. Especially on those who are lost, and who come to this office for that very reason, perfect vessels for your philosophy of aggressive transgression." "How bad can be this be? Teaching people they don't have to passively accept every injustice life throws at them sounds like a good thing." "Within certain limits, maybe. But knowing when to stop is not something you excel at. If you don't believe it, just look at your fingers. You hit like a maniac, without caring even a bit about the consequences of your actions, both literally and figuratively." "You worry too much. Joss, John, everyone, they're far happier now than they used to be, at the dark time when they were afraid." "My job is to worry. You call me for that. And I hope I exaggerate. But, just in case, watch out. There are some lines you should never cross." You don't answer, because you don't need to, but you're troubled nonetheless. The line between what has to be done and what should never be done is blurry, so blurry. You may understand the //concept// of this line, but you may never be sure of where it stands. Part of you is saying you should calm down before it all goes boom. Another part of you is curious. It wants to know what extent an untamed fire can reach once started. And between a safe tepidness and a ferocious blaze, your heart is leaning towards the more dangerous option. And that's probably something you should consider cautiously. You sit down to think about all that. And come to the conclusion you should probably discuss the matter frankly with your regular visitors. They're of course allowed to go wild, but they should make sure it's what //they// want and not some agenda you pushed upon them, even unconsciously. You're here to help, not to indoctrinate.

Unaltered scan of all papers found in the report folder. --- //Cover// ''Psychiatric evaluation of Mary Johnson'' Confidential. Should only be accessed by the requester. Evaluation requested by: Social services. Reason: Application of Ms. Mary Johnson to a public servant position (stricter procedure due to troubled familial background). [...] //Report conclusion// As detailed in this report, Mary Johnson brilliantly succeeded at every single psychological test. She therefore has to be a perfectly sane woman gifted with above average intelligence. I have no medical objection to her getting the post she asked for. //Attached handwritten document// I write here what I cannot write in the official report, as I cannot prove it and some ill-intentioned persons could accuse me of being biased by my personal opinions and sue me for that. Troubles I do not desire, but my conscience compels me to, regardless of danger, write the truth somewhere. What I actually think of this crazy bitch is that she is a manipulative psychotic madwoman following her own agenda. As is her mother. And I am not speaking of the poor Ms. Johnson there. She studied psychiatry. She knows what those evaluations consist of. She knows what she had to do and say to tick all the right boxes and avoid the bad ones. These tests are thus meaningless in her case. They prove nothing. While, on the other hand, we have a lot of evidences she shares her biological mother's madness. Should I remind you that, despite your services' best efforts to provide her with a loving and stable family, she re-established and tightened her links with the devilish Psy through the years? Clearly, this is not the behavior of someone trying to fit properly into society. You are about to welcome as one of your owns a devious spider, and I fear there is no legal way you can avoid that. She is too smart not to get what she wants, as is her mother. But you can still take the appropriate measures to limit her bad influence to the bare minimum. I hope you will do so. (display: "Back to appropriate")
"What you call inconsistent, I call appropriate. Instead of basing my decisions on a set of generic and arbitrary rules, I considered each case independently and tried each time to choose the best outcome for that person. A tailor-made solution for each one instead of a loosely fitting mass-produced fix." "Beautiful words. Admirable philosophy. But should I remind you you're not really the most empathic of people? Please refresh my memories, how many decades did it take you to understand that girl was hitting on you?" "This is not a race you know. As long as you understand right and in time, even if you're late, it's good enough. And actually, I think I'm getting quicker and more precise through accumulated experience." "That's another way of saying you're still wrong most of the time." "You see the half-empty glass, I see the half-full one. As always. But in this case, I'd rather make mistakes and get better at this job than stupidly use some mechanical methodology. There are no hard rules with living beings, only trends and biases." "Did you just confess to sometimes making errors? //You//?" "Not without difficulty, but yes, I did. It's possible this work has managed to make me a little more mature." Silence. You're not supposed to accept your flaws that easily. But as you just said, perhaps you are indeed growing up. Or perhaps you are in a good mood, and that makes you more open to criticism. Because you proved, or at least you think you did, that you were able to read others with a certain degree of efficiency. Something your parents are not really good at. Especially Ikebana of course, but also, sometimes, Onawa herself. And finding something //you//, Hope-Mary Rootless-Johnson, can do that your mother cannot, is a great victory for your pride. Another, less self-centric, reason for your good mood could be that it gives you some extra confidence on the decisions you've made. That you chose your path wisely, not only for your own good but above all for the good of others.

Me — write something? Me, write a book? I’m sorry . . . did you say I’m going to have a column? Suuuure, I am. Sure.
I spent most of my time in the 2000’s working in the Entertainment Industry, but mostly behind the scenes. I’ve been everything from an assistant for a few celebrities to assisting a few producers as well. In 2007, I landed the role as an Executive Assistant to the CEO and VIP Liaison for a corporation here in Los Angeles.
Then, without warning, I got the pink slip. I was laid-off two weeks before Christmas. I wanted to throw up. My world was flipped around and it was not pretty where I had landed… My reality. I had no income and no severance. No. Way.
It’s funny how things happen, isn’t it? Especially the moments that we just don’t expect. Lost and confused as to what I was going to do (or deciding what I “wanted to be when I grew up”), I ended up on St. Kitts, a small island located in the Caribbean. My nephew was there finishing up vet school, so I sublet my apartment in LA and took off, mon. I lived on an air mattress in his living room for the next nine months.
It was there on the island I started to write again. This time, instead of writing for marketing purposes or drafting press releases, I was doing it for me. I started really slow (she said sarcastically) by setting a goal to write a romantic comedy script. Guess what? I did it! It still needs a little work, but I did it. That step lead to classes online with UCLA Extension, which paved the way for a column that I write for the Frederick News-Post entitled “Anne In Progress” and a blog “Life My Way” (you can also link to them at – stop by and say hi!). There’s also the book that’s currently being shopped to publishers. It’s been quite the journey.
Writing Chicklit is a no-brainer to me. When I glide into a bookstore (yes, I glide) the first thing I think about purchasing is the newest Chicklit book that’s hit the stands. Books have always played a big role in “Anne’s Fantasyland”: that’s the world I have loved disappearing into since the Sweet Valley High series was introduced to me in middle school. Stories about love, loss and love again! More please!
While writing my first book, I began a love affair with the whole process itself. I enjoyed the moments when it was all coming together, when words would flow and my fingers would skip across the keyboard for hours. I also learned to cherish the times it just didn’t work one bit and I had to re-work things. This coming May 7th, I get to sit on a panel for a book fair in Burbank, California and talk about the pre-publication journey and the process thus far. I’m excited for the opportunity to share how it’s been a roller coaster ride but, that I’m loving every minute of it.
I survived some days on coffee alone and spent a few sleepless nights hunched over my computer while meeting deadlines. My fingers would be cramped and my feet were curled under me falling asleep. Some days I would forget to get out of my pajamas. I know it sounds odd, but I was in heaven. I was writing about love and I loved what I was writing!
One of my favorite quotes is by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.” Those are the truest words for describing how we should all view life. Take the risk or jump at the chance. Being laid–off forced me to reevaluate what I wanted and needed. It was a personal check-in like no other, because now I’m hooked. I’m a writer!
Take your first step, whatever that means to you. Hit that word goal, query that agent or begin the first page. I feel that everyday is about taking small steps toward our goals, as writers. So, go ahead, take that first step.
We both know you won’t regret it.

Thank you Chris, Lynne, Christine and Melina/Meliisa for your sweet comments…It was fun doing this and it was my first “guest” post! Yay! So nice to get your feedback and “meet” all of you here, too.
Christine – Funny enough, my book is based on my time in St. Kitts 🙂 It’s called (as of now) “Rum Punch Regrets”and is based oh-so-loosely on different events that happened when I was there. You are very intuitive!!
Hi Anne! Thank you for sharing your story. It’s so nice to get to know someone else at LARA. I’m fairly new, but still learning who everyone is. I think you’ll be the seventh member whose name/ face I can identify (I didn’t for mean that to sound creepy if it did… lol).

Anne, what a wonderful story! How lucky you could go down to St. Kitts, too…that alone would make a great story.
Great story, Anne. Though it was a tough journey for you, I’m really glad you discovered this whole new world. Best wishes with the book shopping. I hope it finds a home!
Very cool! Thanks for the update. Now–must get back to writing!Abstract
Spatial distribution of poly(A) RNA, hypophosphorylated Pol IIA, and hyperphosphorylated Pol IIO form of polymerase RNA II was characterized using immunofluorescence, immunogold and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques in relationship to transcriptional activity in the microspore and developing pollen of H. orientalis. During the course of pollen development our results reflected much higher transcriptional activity in the vegetative cell than in the generative cell. The highest levels of transcription in pollen cells were observed in young pollen grains, successively decreasing during pollen maturation, reaching a minimum just before anthesis. Levels of poly(A) RNA were higher in the vegetative cell than in the generative cell during all observed stages of pollen development. Accompanying physiological inhibition of the RNA synthesis in mature pollen cells was a strong accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the cytoplasm, especially in the vegetative cell. Alterations in transcriptional activity of differentiating pollen cells were accompanied by changes in the level and localization pattern of both forms of Pol II. During high transcriptional activity in the pollen nuclei, both forms of RNA Pol II occurred at the periphery of chromatin masses, as well as in the areas between them. A strong decrease in Pol IIO levels was observed in generative and vegetative nuclei as transcriptional activity of pollen cells apparently became inhibited. Finally, just before anthesis, an almost complete lack of the Pol IIO was observed in both pollen nuclei. In contrast, the level of Pol IIA significantly increased during the later stages of pollen development, in spite of apparent transcriptional inhibition in both pollen cells. This rich pool of the hypophosphorylated form of Pol II was located mainly over the central areas of condensed chromatin clumps, which was especially visible in the generative nucleus. Spatial and temporal aspects of RNA synthesis, including poly(A) RNA, as well as organization of transcriptional machinery appear to be closely related in developing pollen cells.ves-Ferreira M, Wellmer F, Banhara A, Kumar V, Riechmann JL, Meyerowitz M (2007) Global expression profiling applied to the analysis of Arabidopsis stamen development.

Impeachment inquiry pits Congress against White House
By Karen DeYoung, Josh Dawsey, Karoun Demirjian and John Hudson
Washington: The House impeachment inquiry broke into a full-throated battle between the executive and legislative branches on Tuesday.
In his letter, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would "not tolerate such tactics".Credit:AP
Congressional Democrats and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traded threats and accusations, while President Donald Trump questioned whether a leader of the probe should be arrested.
Another senior Democrat said Trump should be imprisoned in "solitary confinement."
As the scope of the inquiry broadened, it touched a wide swath of top administration officials. In letters to Vice President Mike Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Senator Robert Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, demanded answers by Friday to questions about what they knew, when they knew it, and their roles in President Trump's actions regarding Ukraine.
But much of the day's turmoil centred on Pompeo, who said in a letter to the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees heading the investigation that five State Department officials called to give depositions over the next two weeks would not appear as scheduled.

Pompeo characterised the effort to depose the officials as "an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly, the distinguished professionals of the Department of State."
Saying that Congress had no authority to compel such testimony, Pompeo wrote that he would "not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State."
By the end of the day, however, at least one of the five, former administration envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, planned to appear anyway before the committees on Thursday. A second official, former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, would appear on October 11, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss lawmakers' deliberations.
Meanwhile, the committees were notified that the State Department's inspector general has requested to speak with them on Wednesday "to discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine," according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

It is unclear exactly what Linick will provide the committees. But the demand for any credible information related to Ukraine and the State Department is at a fever pitch as Democrats seek to build the case for Trump's ouster out of his newly revealed dealings with the government of Ukraine.
The inquiry centres on a whistleblower complaint, made public last week, alleging that Trump manipulated US foreign policy for political gain, withholding aid to Ukraine while pressing its government to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden and his son. That charge appeared to be borne out in a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.
Trump, who had put a hold on nearly $US400 million ($595 million) in US military assistance to aid Ukraine in resisting Russian incursions in its territory, urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr in investigating Biden.
He has charged that the former vice president intervened to squelch a corruption investigation of a Ukrainian company that employed his son, although Ukrainian officials have said Hunter Biden was not implicated in the investigation, which was later abandoned.
Pompeo's letter followed reports that the secretary, who has sought to publicly distance himself from Trump's Ukraine activities, was a participant in the July 25 call by Trump to Zelensky that is at the centre of the impeachment investigation.
The committee chairmen responded to Pompeo with their own broadside, saying any attempt to prevent department officials from speaking to them "is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction," according to a statement issued by Representative Eliot Engel, who heads the foreign affairs panel.
The State Department depositions will take place behind closed doors, and there has been no word on whether a transcript would be released. Volker, who the committee official said "has confirmed he will appear," did not respond to requests for comment.
In a morning Twitter barrage, Trump repeated his insistence, despite information in the White House rough transcript, that almost everything the whistleblower said about it was "wrong," and asked "Why aren't we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all the false information to him?"
Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who broadly paraphrased the call during a hearing last week, had "made up" a version of the exchange, Trump said. He questioned why Schiff wasn't being "brought up on charges."
Later in the day, others entered the fray. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said the impeachment inquiry could expand beyond Ukraine. Impeachment, she said, "is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement."
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel accused House Democrats of attempting "a legislative coup d'etat" to get rid of Trump.

- The Surface Earbuds manual appeared online recently.
- The manual goes through support gestures, Office 365 features, and general management of the headphones.
- The Surface Earbuds will reportedly launch on May 6, 2020.
The Surface Earbuds have yet another leak. Relatively recently, the Surface Earbuds manual appeared online on an FCC listing. The manual goes over the gestures you can use with the headphones, the Office 365 features it supports, and general maintenance and setup of the upcoming headphones. While the Surface Earbuds don't have an official release date, they will reportedly launch on May 6, 2020. Microsoft originally planned to release the Surface Earbuds earlier, but delayed their launch to this spring.
The manual includes several photos of the Surface Earbuds and their case. There's a USB-C charging port on the bottom of the case, as well as a pair button. The large touchpads can be used to perform actions like playing and pausing music, activating a digital assistant, and adjusting the volume of the headphones.
Towards the end of the manual, it lists things you can do with the Surface Earbuds with Office 365 and Cortana:
- Manage your Outlook calendar, email, and to-dos with your voice.
- Dictate in Word and other Microsoft Office apps.
- Advance slides and get live captions or subtitles in PowerPoint.
- Get digital assistance from Cortana—set reminders, get answers to questions, and more.
The information in the manual isn't new or that surprising, but it's interesting to see the manual of a device before the device is released.
The Surface Earbuds have Omnisonic speakers and support unique haptic feedback swipe gestures. They have a dual-mic array for voice controls and making calls. In our time with the Surface Earbuds last October, we found them comfortable to wear and were impressed by the sound.View Budget Item View Budget Item amendments

M1014 is basically the military designation of Benelli M4 shotgun. The limited edition guns will come equipped with a fixed skeletonized stock, pistol grip and a separate cheek rest as shown in the above image. The shotgun also features mil-spec anti-reflective surface treatment on all the external parts.
The legendary reliability of this shotgun is mainly achieved due to several design features of its mechanism. One of them is the Benelli’s A.R.G.O. (Auto Regulating Gas Operation) gas system with dual stainless steel pistons. The rotating bolt is also claimed to be one of the key elements of its reliability.
Dual pistons of the Benelli A.R.G.O. system
Here is a video presentation of the M4 shotgun by Benelli:
The Benelli M1014 Limited Edition will be sold at an MSRP of $2,199. Nothing is known yet concerning in what quantity the guns are made.
Although these are limited edition guns, the price is comparable to conventional M4s. That being said, I think it would be a better investment to get one of Limited Edition models. This kind of firearms are usually valued by collectors and will probably have higher resale value.- General Details

If something is neither fish nor meat, this literally means that it cannot be clearly assigned to a thing. Actually nothing bad. Only: Somehow there is always a negative undertone. What is neither one nor the other is considered inconsistent, vague, and unclear?
The latest hairstyle trend for short hair proves that ambiguity can also have something good. Because it's somehow neither one nor the other - and that's exactly what makes it so incredibly ingenious and stylish.
Said hairstyle trend is the Bixie. The name already gives it away: The hairstyle is a mixture of pixie cut and bob. Means: The hair is cut short, but has longer and airy fringes, especially on the neck and ears. The top hair is also a little longer than with the classic pixie cut and cut in layers. As a result, the hairstyle trend lacks the compact look that is characteristic of the bob.
The great thing about the Bixie is that it flatters a wide variety of hair structures. Thin hair appears fuller due to the layering of the hairstyle trend, voluminous hair is particularly emphasized. In addition, the fringed short hairstyle goes well with different hair colors.
As our colleagues from TheZoeReport write, the Bixie is visually reminiscent of star hairstyles that we know from the 90s and early 00s. The short hair was worn by numerous actresses such as Meg Ryan, Winona Ryder, Ashley Judd, and Drew Barrymore.
It shows: The Bixie is super versatile. After all, thanks to the long steps, it can be worn both straight and curly. And: depending on which bangs are combined to form the Bixie, the hairstyle trend looks either romantic and playful or cool and edgy.
What makes the star hairstyle so perfect for autumn and winter? Since the hair is longer than the Pixie, you don't have to worry about freezing on your head. At the same time, there is no long hair on the neck, which, thanks to the hat and scarf, becomes unsightly and annoying.
Stars like Meg Ryan and Co. already wore the Bixie, a mix of pixie and bob, in the 90s and 00s:Question: How To Get Your Travel Agent License?

Starting next year, Koreans will no longer be forced to go to banks to exchange their Korean won into foreign currencies.
According to the Bank of Korea, under revised legislation on foreign exchange, local residents will be allowed to use private foreign exchange operators. The rule will go into effect starting Jan. 1. Until now, only foreigners could buy or sell off their foreign currencies at private local operators, whereas Koreans could only convert U.S. dollars into Korean won.
The BOK said the change in legislation follows a growing demand from private operators to loosen regulations so that business can be more active.
In the past, those wishing to establish a private foreign exchange business were required to obtain approval from the authorities, though now that requirement has been waived. But unlike banks, their services have been limited. The loosened regulations are expected to help private operators expand their market. In particular, it is expected to attract local customers who may not be able to visit banks during business hours.
Between 2009 and 2012, private foreign exchange operators shrunk, according to the BOK. By 2012, the 1,424 private foreign exchange operators had dwindled to 1,207. However, since 2013 the number of private foreign exchange operators has once again been on the rise, largely thanks to the increase in Chinese tourists.
This year alone, 114 new private operators were established, with the total operators edging up to 1,389.
And because opening a private foreign exchange operation has become easier, the number of retirees running such businesses has increased in recent years.
According to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, as of October more than 5.2 million Chinese tourists visited Korea. That’s a 21.2 percent increase compared to the 4.3 million who visited during the first 10 months of 2013. Out of all the foreign tourists who visit Korea, Chinese visitors make up 40 percent.
Most private foreign exchange operators are concentrated around lodging facilities: 471 currently operate at hotels and other accommodation sites. Those operating in an independent venue account for 420.
Other changes were also written in the revised legislation. Now, daily foreign exchanges of less than $2,000 at private operators don’t need to be reported to financial authorities.
Additionally, the ceiling for overseas wire transfers outside Korea has been raised. Before, an individual wiring more than $1,000 in foreign currency had to report it to the authorities. Now, it is $2,000.

IBM® software you use with LotusScript® provides a number of predefined classes. Product objects (instances of product classes) are like user-defined objects (instances of user-defined classes) but can have their own existence apart from the scripts in which you manipulate them. For example, you can use the product interface rather than a script to create, name, and put text on a command button. You can then attach a script to the command button "click" event. When the user clicks the command button, the appearance of the command button changes, and the "click" event script executes.
You can create and assign variable references to product objects, get and set product object properties, use product object methods, attach scripts to product object events, and delete product objects. For detailed information, see the IBM® software documentation.
Creating objects
The product automatically creates some objects (cells in a spreadsheet for example). You can use the product user interface to create objects, and you can create objects in a script.
To create an object in a script, you must supply whatever arguments the product requires to create an instance of the particular class, and you must assign an object reference to a variable. The syntax is usually:
Dim objRef As prodClass
Set objRef = New [ prodClass ] [( argList )]
The Dim statement declares an object reference variable. The Set...New statement creates a product object and assigns the variable a reference to that object. You can also combine these operations in a single statement:
Dim objRef As New prodClass [( argList ])]
You can use a method to create the object. For example, in Notes® Release 4, you use the NotesDatabase Create method to create a new .NSF file.
You can also use a container method to create objects in scripts. A container method applies to the object that contains the object you are creating. For example, Freelance Graphics® for Windows™ provides container methods for creating objects.
Referring to objects
To refer in a script to an object that already exists, you can usually use the name that the product or user gave to the object. You can (and in some cases you must) assign your own object reference.
One way to assign your own object reference to a variable is to declare an object variable, such as:
Dim objRef As prodClass
and bind it to the product object. For example:
Set objRef = Bind [ prodClass ] [( objName ])]
The product can supply a function or method that you can use to set an object reference.
The following Initialize sub works with three Notes® objects: a database, a view, and a document. The sub uses a Dim...New statement to create a new NotesDatabase object to work with ORGSTRUC.NSF on the HR_ADMIN server, and it uses methods in Set statements to set variable references to a view and a document. GetView is a NotesDatabase class method, and GetFirstDocument is a NotesView class method.
Sub Initialize Dim db As New NotesDatabase("HR_ADMIN", "ORGSTRUC.NSF") Dim view As NotesView, doc As NotesDocument Set view = db.GetView("Main View") Set doc = view.GetFirstDocument End Sub
Bracket notation
In some cases, you can use names in brackets rather than object reference variables to identify IBM® software objects.
For example, the product might allow you to use:
[A1].Value = 247000
instead of:
Dim myCell As Cell Set myCell = Bind Cell("A1") myCell.Value = 247000
Properties, methods, and events
Each product class defines a set of properties, methods, and events. As with user-defined classes, you use dot notation to specify properties and methods.
Properties are object attributes. Like variables, properties have values. You can get and set a property value. However, some properties you can only get, and some you can only set.
Methods are object operations. You call methods to perform actions on classes.
Events are object-related actions to which you can attach scripts to perform activities in an application. When the event occurs, the script attached to the event executes. For example, you can set the value of the Title property in the Click event script:
db.Title = "HQEVB Group Discussion"
IBM® products normally handle the process of attaching scripts you write to the events you specify. You can also use IBMScript On Event statements to attach subs to object events.
For example, a db object is an instance of the Notes/Domino NotesDatabase class. It has a number of properties, including FileName, FilePath, and Title.
The value of the Title property is a string specifying the title of the database. In a script, you can get and set the value of Title. You can only get the values of FileName and FilePath, which specify the location the database in the file system.
Deleting objects
You can sometimes use the Delete statement to delete a product object or the object reference variable. The object reference variables that you explicitly declare and bind to product objects have a scope. When all object references (there may be more than one) to an object created in a script are out of scope, the object itself may be deleted. Some products supply methods to remove actual objects. For example, in Notes®, you use the NotesDatabase class Remove method to delete an .NSF file.
Collection classes
Some IBM® products provide collection classes, also known as container classes. A collection object (an instance of a collection class) contains a collection of objects.
For example, in Freelance Graphics® an Application object contains an instance of the Documents collection class. Each Document object contains an instance of the Pages collection class and each page object contains an instance of the ObjectCollection class. The ObjectCollection object can include text boxes, charts, tables, and other objects belonging to classes derived from the DrawObject class.
You can use ForAll loops or indexing to access individual members of a collection class. The following script uses three nested ForAll loops to iterate through the collections. Within individual TextBlock objects, the script uses indexing to set list entries levels 2 through 5 in each TextBox object to italic.
Dim level As Integer ForAll doc In CurrentApplication.Documents ForAll page In Document.Pages ForAll obj In Page.Objects ' If the object is a TextBlock, set the font ' to Garamond, and set list entries at levels ' 2 through 5 to Italic. If obj.IsText Then ' IsText is a DrawObject property. obj.Font.FontName = "Garamond" For level% = 2 to 5 obj.TextProperties(level%).Font.Italic = TRUE Next level% End If End ForAll End ForAll End ForAllWelcome to Gastro90210

After a short stay in Cayo Hueso and a journey as a journalist, scriptwriter and collaborator that kept him immersed in two of the most relevant political and social processes of his time: the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War, the North American writer navigates towards Cuban waters and find your best accommodation in Havana, in the Ambos Mundos Hotel, located in the Historic Quarter of the city.

Shortly after his arrival in the least of the Antilles, he goes to life in one of the best rental properties in Cuba together with Gellhorn: Finca Vigía, a 61,000 m² rural house located on the outskirts of the Cuban capital. The couple established their winter residence there and the famous writer filled it with cats. There were dozens of them in their lands and he enjoyed his company very much. In Finca Vigía, Hemingway wrote part of what was the first famous novel: For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). The work sold half a million copies in a few months and was the definitive step for the establishment of his reputation as a writer, thanks to a nomination he received for the Pulitzer Prize.
After a short stay in China he returned to Cuba, accompanied by Martha, who had been sent there to fulfill a journalistic mission. The island was on the verge of war with the United States and the writer convinced the Cuban government to use his ship Pilar to ambush the German submarines that remained on the coasts of the country.

Now it is time for them to strengthen cooperation in addressing global risks and challenges, and shoulder their responsibility for the pursuit of people's wellbeing and progress of mankind.
It is the message sent by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and World Political Parties Summit, which was held Tuesday.
Grave challenges brought by changes unseen in a century and the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the importance of jointly responding to the challenges by world political parties. Global challenges could only be met through global cooperation.
Themed "For the People's Wellbeing: the Responsibility of Political Parties," the summit is a solid platform to strengthen exchanges and mutual learning of experience in governance between the CPC and world political parties.
It is also a chance to enhance the philosophy and capability of seeking happiness for the people, advance world peace and development, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for humanity.
The CPC puts people's lives and health first. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty and has achieved building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.
Many have spoken highly of China's achievements and are eager to know the formula behind the country's accomplishment.
As the world's biggest ruling political party, the CPC has always carried out exchanges with and learned from political parties in other countries on an equal footing with an open mind. Through various dialogues, forums and symposiums, the CPC has enhanced exchanges and shared experience in governance with political parties of Russia, Arab countries, Latin American countries, African countries and Asian countries.
China does not export the Chinese model and will not ask other countries to copy its practices. The CPC is willing to share its development experience with all parties, learn from each other, and advance hand in hand.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging and the world is still in the shadow of a weak economic recovery. Isolationism and populism are on the rise in some countries. Exchanges and cooperation between the CPC and political parties around the world will no doubt contribute wisdom, build consensus, and pool strength to solve the common problems facing humanity.
The CPC has remained committed to peaceful development and worked tirelessly to uphold world peace and stability. It has also remained committed to win-win cooperation and worked for the mutual development of all countries.
The future of every nation is closely linked. The CPC will actively promote the improvement of global governance to make new contributions to humanity's joint response to common challenges.Planes of Symmetry can be used to section a symmetrical casting model, so that only a portion of the model needs to be meshed and simulated. Why do this? The reason is so that a simulation can be run with fewer nodes and thus in a shorter time, but still get the same resolution in terms of node size.
For example, if a casting is symmetrical in halves, it is possible to cut the model in half with a plane of symmetry. Running a simulation with 500,000 nodes on one half of the model would produce the same results as running a simulation of the full model with 1,000,000 nodes. The amount of time to run the smaller simulation would be significantly shorter.
As an example, consider the following model of an idler casting. This model is exactly symmetrical down the middle:
In this case, we could place a plane of symmetry along the X-axis of the part. This model was conveniently created with the center of the casting at the origin point of space (where X and Y are 0) so it is easy to set up a plane of symmetry here.
To create the plane of symmetry, select Model…Options… and click on the Planes of Symmetry tab. You will see the following window appear:
In this case, we want a lower-Y Plane of Symmetry at the position Y=0.000. Therefore, click on the small square to the left of Lower Y to place a check mark there. The window will then appear as follows:
Now click the button labeled Apply. This places the Plane of Symmetry at Y=0. If you wanted to place the plane at a different location, just enter a different number in the field under Position. Also, it is possible to rotate an X or Y Plane of Symmetry to make, for example, a wedge shape from a round casting.
The Plane of Symmetry will appear on the model as follows:
The Plane of Symmetry is a rectangular block that covers half the model. This indicates that when the model is meshed, only one-half will actually appear in the mesh. This can be verified by meshing the model and viewing the result:
Here the meshing operation meshes only one-half the casting. The other half of the casting appears in outline (because this was an imported STL shape), but only the meshed half will actually be run in the simulation. After simulation, the data can be mirrored and displayed on the full casting model.In a society where cultural politics are determined by the tight corset of “traditional morality”, even the dealing out of blows strictly follows the gender divide.
In a society where cultural politics are determined by the tight corset of “traditional morality”, even the dealing out of blows strictly follows the gender divide.
Violence and Gender Stereotypes
An English information campaign called «Family Without Fear» emphasizes that domestic violence has nothing to do with gender or sexual orientation. The same is also true of our innate biological characteristics. Nobody is born to be a victim: the infamous victimity forms gradually, forcing out and replacing productive defense mechanisms. And all the more naive it is to assume that having relationships with people of our own sex can protect us from facing the partner’s aggression. However, this does not prevent stereotypes from further existing in our consciousness.
When popular LGBT websites touch upon the topic of domestic violence, they often follow the pattern used for covering violence in heterosexual families. LGBT families’ experience may be represented as a syncretic part of the general mass of domestic violence cases. Ph.D. Richard Niolon who does research on domestic abuse in LGBT couples says that even statistics on instances of abuse in LGBT families were not systematically collected until 1987. Characteristically, articles on domestic violence among LGBT people mostly target men. They use they same patriarchal scenario treating male aggression as expected behavior.
For one instance of violence against men there are more than twelve instances of violence against women, which is often used as an argument for ignoring the topic of violence against men. Erasing domestic violence outside the patriarchal model does great harm to the gay community’s awareness of violence in same-sex families. Denying the idea that men can be victims and women aggressors leads to denying the very possibility of violence in LGBT families.
The Cycle of Violence
Photo by John Gilchrist
English-language resources on domestic violence use a broader phrase: domestic violence and abuse. Abuse is a term that allows to reflect the nature of domestic violence more precisely. It emphasizes the fact that the main goal of violence is power and control over the victim. When the association of violence in general and physical violence gets broken, it’s easier to see how traumatic and dangerous the experience of other forms of mistreatment is.
Although family abuse can take truly horrifying forms, abusers should not be ascribed infernal monstrosity. An abusive partner is not a coldblooded misanthrope. The victim-abuser relationship is rather a form of parasitism where one partner uses the other’s (donor’s) resources to fully function. A symbolic depiction of family violence is not the giant ape King Kong with a frail blond in his arms, but rather a vampire from a gothic novel.
«The goal of abuse is to drain the victim of their energy surreptitiously and lovingly, thus nourishing one’s own sense of self-worth. This is why abuse rarely starts with beating.»
To understand how deep the reasons for silence around domestic abuse are and how this problem is refracted in LGBT families, we need to understand the mechanism of abuse. As we have already mentioned, the goal of abuse is control, i.e. replacing the Subject—Subject communicative scheme with a Subject— Manipulatable Object relationship. Domestic abuse is a cyclical action, a sort of rollercoaster. From a situation of comfort, the victim slowly moves into tension and its peak, direct violence (beating, sexual violence, threats, insults, etc.) and then rolls back into the comfort zone where the abuser demonstrates remorse. Eventually the cycle accelerates and going from the comfort stage to the aggression stage takes less time.
Alongside the internal tension, the victim and the abuser also get a certain payoff from society. It is external tension, the environment’s reaction that is indirectly also part of the mechanism of abuse. In this context, domestic abuse is abuse within the couple. This means that people in the partners’ environment know them as a couple rather than only individually: the community has expectations of them, ideas about them as a couple, and there is, after all, the couple’s reputation. All that is an important part of our social capital. Our family’s “success” is an important feature our personality is judged by.
The Victim’s Shame and Guilt
Society’s expectations and roles ascribed to family members are largely the basis of victim blaming. Victim blaming may take different forms of excusing the aggressor. For instance, if a partner who faces psychological pressure or intimidation within the family seeks help, people they talk to may try to provide a “right interpretation” of the abuser’s actions, find a logical explanation for the abusive behavior in the victim’s actions. Friends seem to act in complicity with the abuser, denying the victim rationality and reason. Such reactions are also often rooted in gender stereotypes when people refer to certain traits allegedly having to do with one’s gender.
We are often convinced that we can resist domestic violence, sometimes even while we are being abused. The illusion of control over the situation is strengthened manifold by the stereotype about the gender role division in the victim-abuser couple, which bears a particular danger to same-sex partners. Often instances of violence in homosexual couples are replaced with a scenario of “men’s showdown” or BDSM pornographic vignettes. Besides, the deeply ingrained societal stereotype about family violence as a feature of patriarchy creates an additional psychological barrier for gay men seeking help. In theory there are therapists, shelters, organizations for supporting victims of family abuse.
The couple’s reputation has a big influence on how intensive victim blaming is. Princess Diana appeared in global press as a cheater and a bulimic on an all too regular basis but when the couple is socially deprived, for instance if it’s a family of alcoholics, the victim blaming is far stronger. With LGBT couples, the situation is considerably acuter if same-sex relationships are already stigmatized in the given society. Then the couple has a certain “social karma” to begin with, it is deprived in society’s eyes. The fact of family abuse acts to reinforce the stereotype and the victim has another barrier to speak out about the problem and ask for help. According to Richard Niolon, homophobia within the community is in direct correlation with domestic abuse in LGBT couples: if your community refuses to accept your family, it cannot recognize the abuse either.
Abuse in the Closet
What further distinguishes the perception of violence in homosexual couples for homophobic societies is the large percentage of closeted partnerships. Researchers of domestic violence in LGBT families emphasize the importance of being out for preventing abuse. R. Berger, author of the article Men Together on problems in homosexual relationships, says that living in the closet and having to make sure constantly that one’s relationship stays secret is a major stress factor for gay men and lesbians. Closeted couples often choose euphemisms to conceal the partnership's true nature and prefer to call each other friends or flatmates, which harms trust within the couple. Being in the closet also minimizes support from parents or other family members, which may be available to an abuse victim in a heterosexual couple.
Fears of being accused or devalued, exacerbated by the partner’s necessity to stay in the closet, always play into the abuser’s hands, driving the victim into the trap of guilt and shame that guarantee silence and isolation. Isolation makes it harder to stay objective about one’s situation, which, in turn, makes it easier for the abuser to use manipulation. In this sense, the victim actually helps the abuser by concealing the problem. A sign of concealing, which is also a form of psychological defense, is choosing synonyms for abuse. Substituting the image of violence with that of a conflict or sexual play is a typical abuser’s trick and the victim’s mental trap. It is far easier to tell even one’s closest friends about an “argument” than simply acknowledging one’s weakness and become a target for others’ open fire of stereotypes.
To guarantee silence, the abuser represses the victim’s usual defense mechanisms and substitutes them with new victim behavior. To do that, they may induce mistrust to other people in the victim or raise their own significance in the partner’s eyes by constantly devaluing their opinion and that of the people important to them.
«In this case, a closeted queer partner is certainly a silenced one.»
Being in the closet also opens up a lot of opportunities to further manipulate the victim, blackmail, isolate, or threaten them. The threat of outing, i.e. being forced to come out under the pressure of guilt towards one’s partner as well as requiring the partner to stay closeted as a means of ensuring their isolation are among the means used by abusers in homosexual couples that resonate with the partner’s internal unease about their sexual orientation if that issue is a point of complexes and fears for them.

It comes the week before parliamentary discussion of legislation to help insulate the nation's homes begins.
Friends of the Earth is warning the Government's current proposal will do little to keep vulnerable tenants warm without a tough new law to stop landlords letting the coldest properties until they're improved.
Properties rented from a landlord or letting agency are most likely to be the worst insulated and a recent Friends of the Earth survey found half of these tenants were uncomfortably cold in their homes during the big freeze.
Natasha Khan, of Bat for Lashes, said: "We suffered the worst mould you could imagine in my student house.
"Over our two-year let it got to the point where you'd have to dodge at least 20 slugs living off the moisture in the carpet - then inhale black mould spores if the steam from the shower got too much.
"The cold, draughts and dampness were pretty extreme!
"Everyone should get behind Friends of the Earth's campaign to protect tenants in cold houses - it's time to heat our homes, not the planet."
Friends of the Earth's Warm Homes Campaigner Dave Timms said: "No-one should have to put up with renting a cold, damp home that makes them ill and costs a fortune to heat - £1 in every £4 we spend heating our homes is wasted because of shoddy insulation.
"Stopping British houses leaking heat is one of the cheapest and quickest ways to fight dangerous climate change.
"We need a new law making it illegal to let the coldest, health-hazard properties until they're improved to a minimum energy efficiency standard - and greater support for landlords.
"Tell your MP what it's really like living in a cold home at to join the fight for warmer homes and a safer climate."

It feels like a good fit considering Funcom developed Conan Exiles, another multiplayer survival game set in a massive desert environment.
Dune is back on our radar in a big way, thanks to, y'know, Dune. The movie. We haven't heard any real details about the upcoming Dune game since Funcom first announced it, so we decided to speculate about some features we'd like to see, from sandworms to stillsuits to the all-important spice.
Here's what we're hoping to see in Funcom's Dune survival game. Note: There are some spoilers for Dune below if you haven't seen the film or read the books.
More than just a desert
I don't want to ruffle any feathers right off the bat, but deserts… are kinda boring. Not immediately boring! The desert in the Dune movie looked beautiful. But that's for a two-hour film. When playing a game for dozens or hundreds of hours it's hard to imagine being captivated by walking down a sand dune and cresting another sand dune and seeing... yet another goddamn sand dune. A few games, like Max Max, have done a nice job by differentiating areas of the desert so each looks and feels a bit different, but in the end you're still mostly dealing with sand, sand, and more sand.
I haven't read too far beyond the original Dune novel but I know that in the distant future of Arrakis there are some terraforming efforts made and parts of the desert planet become more green than brown. Having some additional biomes in the Dune game beyond just deserts and caves, some zones with highly varied plant and wildlife as well as the familiar arid and desolate areas, could certainly help the world feel more visually interesting. It would also give players a chance to wear something besides just a moisture-recycling stillsuit 24/7. I think setting the game at that point in the Dune timeline could give it a bit more variety. —Chris Livingston, Features Producer
Actual drug trips
Dune is a richly-realized science fiction universe, depicted across 27 published and upcoming novels (not including short stories and other works). It is also a book that was written in San Francisco in the early '60s, as hippies, counterculture, music, recreational drugs, and The Summer of Love (in '67) were intersecting. That atmosphere undeniably guided Herbert's book, a story with a galaxy-shaping, mind-altering substance at its center.
With that in mind, it would be awfully disappointing if Spice were just another ordinary videogame resource! I don't want to equip my Spice Implement and hold F to Gather Spice. I don't want to purchase a season pass that adds 200 Spice to my account. I want this magic mineral to be folded into the story and experience of playing the game itself—if this is an RPG of some kind, using Spice shouldn't be like eating a baked potato in Minecraft. It should have some richer meaning and implementation. —Evan Lahti, Global Editor-in-Chief
Some really intricate knife combat
Considering it's a futuristic sci-fi world, it's a little weird to see people running around with knives and swords. But the knife-heavy combat is because of personal defense shields (they looked very silly in the original Dune movie) that stop anything moving fast from penetrating them. Bullets aren't gonna do much because they're simply moving too rapidly and I'm guessing something like a laser blaster wouldn't be effective either. So, warriors carry around big knives because you can slow them down enough to be able to stab someone even if they've got their shield turned on.
I'm hoping combat in the Dune game can reflect some of that knife-mastery required to be both quick and slow enough to fight effectively. Hack and slash at someone with a shield it's just not gonna do any damage. A more intricate version of knife combat, with things like parries and counters and the all important slow blade might give the combat a nice learning curve and a bit of nuance. —Chris
Ornithopter flight
Maybe it's my old flight sim fandom speaking, or my more recent experience as a cyber-delivery driver in Cloudpunk. Either way, what I'd really like is to get behind the controls of an Atreides ornithopter. I want to transport spice harvesters and patrol for wormsign, rescue workers from sandworm peril, fight the invading Harkonnen and Sardaukar, and maybe most importantly, just cruise the endless, arid wastes. Is Arrakis a boring place? Maybe—it's a big-ass desert, after all—but it doesn't have to be: The Fremen have lived there for thousands of years, and that opens the door to all kinds of potential mystery to explore. A ruin here, an ancient stash there—there's plenty of fictional fodder to make it work, especially in a videogame adaptation. —Andy Chalk, US News Lead
A building system (or a nomad system)
Look, I know one entire thing about Dune: it involves sand. I do know multiplayer survival games though, and I will always, always show up for a building system. Give me a little crafting bench and a bunch of snapping build pieces and I will live there for weeks. If you all get into Dune Multiplayer someday and start sending me screenshots of sandcastles or sand shacks or whatever kind of structures Dune people live in, I am guaranteed to be there. — Lauren Morton, Associate Editor
I think I may be feeling the opposite, because time and again in games with buildable bases I've proven completely incapable of constructing a home I really want to live in. I think I'd prefer to be nomadic in the Dune game, if possible, with nothing but a tent or portable habitat I can plunk down, sleep or craft in, then fold up and take with me. Especially in multiplayer games like Rust where players claim a spot, start building an ugly-ass boxy base, then abandon it, the landscape winds up littered with unsightly crapshacks. Maybe it's time for a multiplayer survival game to ditch building and stick with portable habs that don't clutter up the scenery. —Chris
Tameable worms
I know two things about Dune. Like Lauren, I am aware that it involves sand. I also know, however, that there are worms in that sand. Large worms. Well, I think you should be able to ride the worms. Let's call them… duneworms, maybe. Or sandtubes. —Tyler Wilde, Executive Editor
I'm pretty sure worm-riding will be a part of the game (you can do it in No Man's Sky as of this Halloween) and if it's not, man, people gonna be mad. And hopefully it'll be some high-level, extremely difficult activity or people are gonna be steering worms all over the map and eating all the fresh spawns. —Chris
Let me be the worm
Humans are boring and very bad at surviving in the harsh desert. Sandworms are very exciting and good at surviving in the harsh desert. So why would I want to be anything other than a worm? Let me speed across the dunes gobbling up spice and spaceships, and maybe a player or two. I would not be very happy if Tyler tried to ride me though. Ban riding worms. It's rude. —Fraser Brown, Online Editor
A pee button
Denis Villeneuve's Dune spends a few minutes teaching us about stillsuits, the high-tech desertwear of Arrakis that collects nearly all your body's moisture and converts it back into drinkable water. Sweat becomes sustenance. But there's one bit the movie leaves out: so does pee. If Dune is a survival game, that means a major mechanic will be managing your thirst in the desert, and that means there should be a button to pee on command before you drink up. He who controls his urine controls the universe.— Wes Fenlon, Senior Editor
Stillsuits recycle your poop, too. On the one hand I'm not sure Funcom wants to remind you that you're drinking recycled pee and poop. On the other, it's Funcom, which has dong-size sliders in Conan Exiles. So who knows? They might be quite happy reminding you each time you drink from your suit you're consuming the last desert dump you took. — ChrisWhat is Mezzanine Flooring Made of?
Perhaps you’re considering relocation, or maybe you hadn’t thought about how you can make use of your high ceilings before. Mezzanine floors from Central Storage Systems Ltd could be the simple solution to your storage problem or a case of an innovative design improvement.
A mezzanine floor is an intermediate floor that can be installed in high-ceilinged spaces where the semi-permanent structure can be placed halfway up a wall at least twice as high as a floor with minimum height. The minimum requirement is a roof height of 4.500m in order to achieve suitable headroom on both levels.
A retail mezzanine flooring can provide the perfect warehouse storage solutions or provide more shop space. Instead of office relocation for expanding companies, an office mezzanine floor can double your current office space, meaning you avoid the hassle of moving altogether. Alternatively, specifically designed storage mezzanine flooring means you can instead use a whole floor for storage, or use a combination of purposes.
Steel Structure
Each design of mezzanine flooring is a self-supporting steel structure using robust columns. There is flexibility in terms of the position and frequency of these depending on the specific site conditions and customer requirements and budget. Not only are these structures sturdy and safe, but they are also lightweight, making them easier to install, taking hardly any time to put up. You can tailor your floors to your specific load requirements, so you can rest assured of its safety and stability. The loading requirements of the Building Regulations and BRE Digest 437 mean loadings start from 2.5kn/m2 (250kg/m2) for light offices with no partitions but can increase to heavier loadings for specialist operations. As a guide, a popular design loading would be approximately 5kn/m2 (500kg/m2). As part of our structural implications, we also consider the amount of allowable deflection (bounce) within the design.
Smart Design
We aim to incorporate our mezzanine floor designs in a way that is stylish as well as practical. We offer smart design solutions to suit your space, including our expert knowledge of mezzanine manufacturing. This may be advice about fire safety precautions, accessibility, appearance, and use of heating or ventilation systems. Another element of design that is important, is the decking, which is usually a 38mm high-density particle board – an exceptionally versatile and durable surface. In addition, there are other decking options available, such as plywood and a range of steel surfaces. The structures can be placed during the initial construction work of the building, as well as added to an existing building, and building work is fully risk assessed when planning a mezzanine installation.
Company Values
A mezzanine floor may also make a positive statement about your company, being a smart and innovative solution to issues of space and storage. It also makes large office spaces feel warmer, creating a closer team through the illusion of smaller space created by these floor partitions.
At Central Storage Systems, we can create the perfect bespoke mezzanine for your business, whether for a retail, office, or warehouse environment. If you would like to find out more about our mezzanine flooring, please contact us through our contact page or call us on 01299 251374. Our staff will be happy to answer any of your queries.Made for the Dark is the new collection from John Llewellyn Probert and is published by Black Shuck Books. There are eighteen stories within the book, all of which act as a marvellous showcase for one of the most distinctive voices in horror today.
Previous collections from John (The Catacombs of Fear, The Faculty of Terror) were presented as portmanteaus – with the stories linked by a bridging device and that concept has been taken a step further with this collection, containing as it does an introduction to each story from the author a la Twilight Zone. It’s a clever technique, pulled off admirably – aided greatly by the front cover picture of the great man himself seated behind a desk, waiting to show you his special somethings…
I’m still waiting to hear from the OED for official recognition but many moons ago I coined the term “proberty” (as defined here) and it’s a word I’m more than happy to apply to this collection which I would be so bold as to describe as quintessential. It’s a difficult art, combining horror and humour and can, in the hands of a less skilled practitioner go horribly wrong but that’s certainly not the case with John’s writing. Much of what he describes is truly awful and I’m sure I’m not alone in imagining – whenever something gruesome and outlandish happens to a character – the author waiting for a reaction, a slight arch to one of his eyebrows and a tilt to his head, “are you really going to laugh at that..?”
Actually, I might be alone in that.
The humour, of course, helps to leaven the impact of the horror but it’s still extremely effective and some of the stories in this collection are worthy of Barker at his best. (By which I mean Clive and Ronnie).
If Made for the Dark is the quintessential JLP collection then I would suggest The Anatomy Lesson is the quintessential story, containing as it does just about everything you might wish to find in a proberty tale, Grand Guignol horror, an element of performance and… doctors. John is of course a doctor himself so it’s no surprise to see that particular profession cropping up in many of the stories in the book, including pulpy crime story The Girl with no Face, Victorian apocalypse Out of Fashion and The Secondary Host – possibly my favourite story in the book. Telling the story in first person necessitates a change from John’s familiar narrative voice and I think that – and the lack of the trademark comedy flourishes - make this an extremely effective chiller with a marvellous premise and mythology to back it up.
The Girl in the Glass also has a doctor as its protagonist but is also a cleverly constructed ghost story (using a very effective image as a reveal) and ghosts also crop up in Six of the Best – a glorious attack on TV ghost-hunter programmes with a nasty twist to it, not to say some very mucky bits.
There’s a touch of cynicism in that tale, a feature of some of the other stories; The Life Inspector and How the Other Half Dies gently rip apart their protagonists’ characters but the harshest treatment is given to charities in It Begins at Home – in which art imitates life – but not in a good way. (Interestingly, the story preceding this, the WW2 set The Death House with its heady mix of Nazis and Lovecraftian horror could be a case of life imitating art). A similar theme to that of It Begins at Home is to be found in The Lucky Ones, a title dripping in irony if ever there was one.
Humour is one of John’s trademarks for sure, but – as he displayed emphatically in his novella Differently There – he’s equally as capable of melancholy and pathos. This is admirably demonstrated in A Life on the Stage – a theatre-set swansong to bring the house down and The Man Who Loved Grief – a fairytale-esque (albeit a rather grim one) meditation on love and – well, grief.
There’s plenty more to enjoy besides these, tales of reincarnation, ancient rituals and the perils of reviewing online. There’s even – much to my delight - a weird western, Blood and Dust complete with an invisible monster a la Forbidden Planet (the film – not the shop) which is the final story in the book. With its fish out of water protagonist English professor John Summerskill, it’s closer in tone to The Sherriff of Fractured Jaw than Unforgiven but I enjoyed it immensely and it’s a fine end to a very impressive collection.
I enjoyed every moment I spent between the covers of Made for the Dark. For those already familiar with John’s writing it will be like settling down for a natter with an old friend (preferably in front of a roaring fire with a snifter of brandy) whilst for those yet to encounter his work it’s the perfect introduction.
Very proberty indeed.AboutBitvavo

-.Yesterday was our big mid-week date night. Tonight? Leave to Beaver night. What that means is staying home, not doing much. We had dinner as a family (except for DS1 who was not home from work yet). The other two boys had the day off. My DW worked a full day. Me, I was crazy busy at work. I got quite a bit accomplished. I have one more crazy day planned, then Friday will hopefully fill in the blanks from the week. Thankfully most of the customers have been on their best behavior this week.
DS2 went to the eye doctor for his annual before school check up. This is the fateful check up last year that revealed that he had two detached retinas and needed immediate surgery on both eyes. This year, no problems. Simple eye exam, update the proscription and have a nice day. His car goes in the shop tomorrow for a safety check before he leaves for college next weekend. He is pretty excited about his eyes and that college is “nearly single digit days away”. But, who’s counting.
My DW did go to yoga tonight. She has been coughing quite a bit tonight. I hope she does not get worse.
Tonight’s picture comes from our visit to Anna Farms near Charlotteville, VA back in April. This porch was a perfect place to start or end the day. Enjoy!

Situated in Kent, these cliffs mark the narrowest part of the English Channel, with little over 20 miles separating the town from Calais. It is overlooked by Dover Castle, which was founded in the 11th century and has been described throughout history as the “Key to England”.
Dover Cruise Terminal can accommodate up to three cruise ships at any one time and its proximity to France makes it a great option for itineraries to Belgium, the Netherlands, the Norwegian fjords, and the Baltic nations.
Cruises from Dover are an ideal option for anyone situated in south-east England, with easy access from Canterbury, Brighton, and Eastbourne. The nearby Dover Priory Station is situated less than a mile from the cruise terminal and provides quick and easy rail access from London.Error

That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the accessing of Pension Protection Fund benefits by people under the age of 50 who are suffering from a terminal illness; and for connected purposes.
For nearly all of us, contributing to a pension will be the most significant financial decision we ever make. Throughout our working life until the day we die, we will either be building or receiving a pension. Contributing to a scheme provides us with security for the future. It enables us to provide essential items such as food, warmth and housing, as well as allowing us fully to participate in society, economically and socially.
It is therefore distressing that, earlier this decade, thousands of people saw their savings vanish after their pension schemes went bust and were unable to meet their commitments. To avoid a repetition of that, the Government in April 2005 established the Pension Protection Fund under the Pensions Act 2004. Funded by an annual levy on defined-benefit and hybrid pension schemes, the PPF provides compensation to those whose pension schemes have become insolvent.
The fund has proved to be an invaluable safety net to thousands of workers who would otherwise have lost substantial pension savings. However, as a compensation scheme, the PPF has its own set of rules, which are set out in part 2 and schedule 7 to the Pensions Act and in the numerous statutory instruments made under it. Legislation specifies the level of compensation to be provided, and that is not necessarily the same as the person would have received had the pension scheme not wound up. In short, the PPF does not mirror the rules of individual pension schemes, and it is for that reason that I am proposing the Bill.
Significantly, the fund contrasts with final salary pension schemes and does not allow early payment of pension savings, for whatever reason, to anyone under the age of 50. For a specific set of people under 50 years of age—those diagnosed with a terminal illness—those rules are simply unreasonable. It is my belief that legislation should be amended so as to lift the current bar on payments to those aged under 50, if they are terminally ill.
As the Incomes Data Services pensions service explains, many pension schemes will allow unreduced early payment of a pension on ill health grounds. It states:
“In a final salary scheme, members who retire early often find that their pension is reduced to take account of the fact that it will be paid for longer. But if early retirement is due to ill health or incapacity an immediate pension is usually payable and this is unlikely to be reduced for early payment.”
A parliamentary written answer confirmed PPF rules regarding ill health pensions. It stated:
“compensation to scheme members who have been awarded an ill health pension is calculated in the same way as compensation to any other scheme member of the same age.
There are no provisions to enable scheme members to claim ill health pensions from the Pension Protection Fund once the PPF has assumed responsibility for a scheme.
However, any scheme member may take early payment of their compensation at a capped level of 90 per cent. from age 50, subject to actuarial reduction.”—[Official Report, 21 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 1679W.]
As well as provoking inevitable feelings of grief, anger and loss, having a terminal illness can be expensive, often in ways that may not have been expected. That includes the cost of prescriptions, a special diet, child care or travel to hospital. In addition, money may be needed to make adjustments to an individual’s home or to pay for making out or amending a will.
It might easily be the case that people in their 30s and 40s could have made anything between 15 and 30 years of payments into a scheme but do not qualify to receive benefits under the PPF rules, even though their original scheme would have paid out. For anyone aged under 50 and terminally ill, savings taken on by the PPF simply disappear. Only when an individual dies will payment be made to their spouse or civil partner. That situation is set to get worse in the next few years. In a fact sheet on early payment of compensation, the PPF confirms that before April 2010 the earliest age at which payment can be made will rise from 50 to 55, to comply with the Finance Act 2004.
The PPF covers 10 former pension schemes, but many more schemes are undergoing assessment. It is estimated that by the end of 2007-08, the PPF is likely to be responsible for an additional 65 schemes. Some 100,000 employees are members of schemes currently being assessed to see if they qualify to be rescued. Among them are 38,000 former Turner and Newall employees, whose scheme failed after the engineering company went into administration in 2007.
The Turner and Newall case provides a good example of why change to existing legislation is so necessary. That company, once the world’s largest manufacturer of asbestos, ran factories in Rochdale, Washington, Widnes and Trafford Park, where many employees worked with asbestos every day. Working with asbestos can lead to asbestosis, lung cancer or mesothelioma. Employees were never told of the dangers to their health, and hundreds have been badly affected by working with asbestos products. Sadly, it is not difficult to imagine that some might well develop a terminal illness before they reach the age of 50. If that is the case and if the PPF covers Turner and Newall’s pension scheme, terminally ill employees under 50 would not be entitled to a penny of compensation. When Lord Whitty recently raised this issue in the other place—I refer Members to column 121 of the record of the House of Lords debates of 6 June 2007—the Government argued that existing legislation ensures the PPF is uncomplicated and provides greater certainty about both payment levels and the affordability of the fund.
The financial assistance scheme makes payments to individuals diagnosed as terminally ill on provision of evidence that they are unlikely to live longer than six months. The six-months criterion is very harsh and it is extremely difficult for doctors to give any indication of precisely how long a patient might live. That period should therefore be extended to 12 months.
It might be useful to look at the cost incurred by the FAS in paying compensation to terminally ill individuals. When I contacted the FAS recently, I was told that that information was not recorded. Similarly, the Office for National Statistics advised me that pension schemes rarely document payments to terminally ill members, as that occurs so rarely. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the cost of paying out to terminally ill claimants is somewhat modest, if it is not currently recorded for the FAS. Basic logic supports that assumption when one considers that pensions for the terminally ill are paid for a shorter period due to their reduced life expectancy. The FAS might also provide a useful model with regard to administration and process.
In respect of eligibility, a definition of terminal illness could be based on that used by other appropriate organisations. The Association of British Insurers uses the following definition in their best practice guide to critical illness:
“Advanced or rapidly progressing incurable illness where, in the opinion of an attending Consultant and our Chief Medical Officer, the life expectancy is no greater than 12 months.”
Appeals against decisions could be referred to the PPF ombudsman, as is currently the practice for eligibility appeals. Of course, the precise definition of eligibility can be discussed and drawn up with the PPF board. The important point is that ill health benefits are allowed to be paid, which can only be enabled once existing legislation is amended.
The experience of the FAS and the lack of data held regarding terminal illness and pension schemes suggest that the PPF will not be inundated with requests for early payment based on ill health. That, together with the relative ease of determining an individual’s state of health via medical certification, suggests that the task of assessing and processing the extra applications would not be excessively burdensome.
The proposed change is relatively modest. The Pensions Act 2004 should be amended, and individuals who are certified as terminally ill and aged under 50 should be allowed to access their savings as they would have done had their scheme not gone bust. In order not to provide too broad a provision, it could be restricted by reference to the discretion of the PPF board. This modest amendment would be of enormous significance to individuals in their last precious days. I ask the Government to consider extending the safety net to those who would draw immense comfort from it.
I commend the Bill to the House.
Question put and agreed to.
Bill ordered to be brought in by Mr. Mark Hendrick, Mrs. Janet Dean, Barbara Keeley, Mr. Doug Henderson, Mr. Elliot Morley, Jim Dowd, Lynda Waltho, Mr. John Heppell, Tom Levitt, Mr. Ian Cawsey, Mr. Neil Gerrard and John Mann.
Access to Pension Protection Fund Benefits
Mr. Mark Hendrick accordingly presented a Bill to make provision for the accessing of Pension Protection Fund benefits by people under the age of 50 who are suffering from a terminal illness; and for connected purposes: And the same was read the First time; and ordered to be read a Second time on Friday 19 October, and to be printed [Bill 162].
On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. This morning I secured a debate in Westminster Hall on defence exports, and many of my hon. Friends joined me in attending it in order to try to hold the Government to account on an important decision that has been taken and which concerns the Ministry of Defence. The Government sent along, however, a Minister from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, who did not appear to know anything about the subject. Can you advise me, Madam Deputy Speaker, how Members are to hold this Government to account on such an important issue when they send along a Minister from a different Department?
Order. It is, of course, entirely up to the Government to decide which Minister attends any debate in this House. At the end of day, any Minister is still a Minister within the Government and has responsibility.Photos

Known for its imaginative and innovative approach to business, The Walt Disney Company has had to be just that to manage through this plot twist of a year.
In a fiscal year third quarter Disney Earnings Call and Earnings Report on August 4, it was shown just how hard Disney was hit, current updates on operations, and what’s to come in the future.
Bob Chapek on The Walt Disney Company
Bob Chapek, who became the Disney CEO earlier this year, opened the call with acknowledging that this is still a very challenging time, not only in regards to the pandemic, but the issues surrounding racism and social injustice. Disney is working through establishing better means of diversity and inclusion so that they may strive towards greater representation.
In regards to the pandemic, it has had a huge impact on third quarter results, but Chapek still has a very positive outlook on where the company is going from here.
“Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress.”
Disney+
Chapek went into a lengthy update on Disney+ and how well it’s done to deliver a wide range of content to subscribers. Most notably is that the Disney+ original series, The Mandalorian, received 15 Primetime Emmy Nominations and that Black is King debuted critically acclaimed.
With over 60.5 million, Disney+ will continue to play a huge part in the future of the Walt Disney Company both domestically and internationally. Disney’s focus on direct to consumer content will be a top priority in these uncertain times, such as those offering under the Star brand in 2021. Disney has already amassed over 100 million subscribers across all of its streaming platforms.
“The incredible success we’ve achieved to date has made us even more confident in our direct to consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach,” Chapek said.
This comes with one of the biggest news of the call, with Chapek announcing that the live-action Mulan will be released on September 4 to Disney+. This new way for streaming of the film will be offered over a premiere access for $29.99, but it’s likely that this will be the only film to be released in this manner.
Other mentioned future releases for Disney+ were The One and Only Ivan in August, season two of The Mandalorian in October, and Loki, WandaVision, and Winter Soldier later this year.
Walt Disney World
As touched on by Chapek, since the last earnings call, Disney theme parks around the world have been reopening. Starting with Shanghai Disneyland in May and then Hong Kong Disneyland in June, it’s been a process to reopen with health and safety guidelines. Shanghai Disneyland has consistently been operating in the net positive contribution area, but unfortunately, Hong Kong Disneyland was ordered by the government to close again on July 15.
Most recently with the phased reopening of all four Walt Disney World theme parks, there have been some losses when it comes to attendance and cancellations of Disney vacation reservations. Though the demand is still higher than the capacity will allow at the Walt Disney World parks, there are frequently more cancellations as Guests deal with the ever-changing aspects of the pandemic.
It is important to note that even though there is a lower attendance rate, Walt Disney World is still net positive in their revenue which means they believe they are in a good place for when consumer confidence returns.
“Each day we are at a percentage of the park that we can fill while maintaining social distancing,” said Chapek.
Disneyland
Listeners to the Disney Earnings Call kept their ears sharp for any updates or indications on a timeline for the reopening of the Disneyland Parks in Anaheim, California. With its closure nearing 150 days, unfortunately Disney continued to stayed quiet with no information about the re-opening of the original Disneyland Park and its counterpart Disney California Adventure. The only mention of Disneyland or the Disney Cruise Line was that of its contribution to losses as both remain non-operational.
Disney Losses
With such a wide-reached company, there are many different moving parts to Disney and currently, many non-moving parts as well. As a result of such, Disney lost billions of dollars due to the pandemic and furloughed over 100,000 employees. Third quarter financial results largely reflect the closures of domestic parks and resorts, cruise line, and Disneyland Paris. The operating loss for the company comes in at around $2 billion, but are looking forward to a rebound in the next part of the fiscal calendar with ESPN and sports such as the NBA, which is currently playing the season at Walt Disney World, and the MLB playoffs.
Though not a loss, Disney is investing more operating funds into entertainment production. The cost of going into production between now and 2021 has increased based on ramping up productions, distancing involved, site prep, stage prep, testing, etc. Not only does it cost more in funds, but it also costs more in time as the production time could also be extended with these new health and safety measures.$4.25

Diane Telgen enjoyed reading so much as a child that she would read anything and everything, even the encyclopedia! That’s probably why she grew up and started writing reference books about history and literature. Now she writes both fiction and nonfiction for young readers. She earned her MFA in Writing for Children and Young Adults from Vermont College of Fine Arts.
Diane is a member of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators.
The Long Bio
My life as a writer began with my life as a reader. It began at age three, when my reading specialist mom taught me to how to make words out of letters. It occupied a little girl full of questions, and from then on I devoured books. I turned to the family set of World Book encyclopedias when nothing else was available, but preferred fairy tales, fantasies, and myths. My dad, a chemical analyst, shared his fascination with science and especially space: the Apollo landings, Star Trek, and, when I was old enough, writers from the Golden Age of science fiction.
A chance moment in my beloved elementary school library set my future course: I found a cool-looking Andre Norton novel with ringed planets and spaceships on the cover. On the title page, the librarian had penciled in the author’s birth name: Norton, Alice Mary. Wait. You mean GIRLS can write about SPACESHIPS?!?! After this revelation I started listing “writer” instead of “nurse” or “doctor” in the space for “future plans” in my school scrapbook.
I dabbled in writing during my school years, being too busy with music and academics and reading for my own stories. I kept a diary—what teen girl didn’t back then?—and it was full of VERY DEEP THOUGHTS indeed. After majoring in English and Spanish at the University of Michigan I found a job at Gale Research in Detroit. I was hired onto the Contemporary Authors staff and spent my workdays reading and writing about authors, from best-sellers to academics. As a bonus, I sometimes received correspondence from favorite authors, including Lloyd Alexander and Arthur C. Clarke.
I turned freelance when my husband accepted a job transfer and we moved with our young son to London, England. After four years in the UK, we returned to Michigan and I branched out from writing short biographical profiles into writing longer histories. These included two historical reference books, Defining Moments: Brown v. Board of Education and Defining Moments: The Gilded Age.
I write because I am hopelessly, endlessly, forever fascinated with story. I can’t get enough stories, whether through novels or nonfiction or TV or film or magazine articles, and firmly believe that story is one of the things that defines us as human. Whether nonfiction or fiction, whether for kids or adults, my own writing gives me more ways to explore story and share my enthusiasm for stories with the world.

- I love crafting: knit, crochet, quilting—playing with color, no drawing talent needed.
- Despite being an absolute klutz growing up, I took up tae kwon do in my thirties, became a black belt, won a national championship, and became a 4th-degree master.
- I love felines, and because my husband stops me from becoming a
crazy cat ladyferocious feline fanatic, I volunteer at animal shelters instead.
- There is no #4. If you’re a rabid Monty Python fan like me, you’ll understand.
- I’ve played in community bands and flute orchestras and own a piccolo, C flute, alto flute and bass flute.
- My husband and I love to travel. We’ve been as far north as Finnish Lapland, and as far south as Antarctica—but I’ll always consider Michigan home. Although I can’t deny the winters in my current Tennessee town are very nice!art director

Quenottes (Pearlies) is the story of a mouse, but –beware– it’s not any mouse. It’s THE little mouse from our childhood, known as the tooth fairy in some countries. The one who probably brought you your first coins in exchange for a tooth hidden under your pillow.
Like the tooth fairy, the little mouse is a benevolent and generous character… Or is it? What if it was in fact a monomaniac psychopath, obsessing about its collection of dental trophies? In its mind, a lost tooth is unacceptable, it must be replaced. A father and his son will bear the consequences of this obsession...

President Dr Julius Maada Bio was in Moyamba Town, Southern Province of Sierra Leone yesterday Monday, on what State House describe as a “Thank You Tour” where he said that his government remains committed to the fight against corruption in the country.
Welcoming the president, Paramount Chief Foday Momoh Gulama of Kaiyamba Chiefdom said that he has seen great progress since the New Direction Government was elected in 2018.
He commended the President, especially for providing free quality education, and for reviving the government technical institute in the district after years of neglect.
/>
Chairman of Moyamba District Council, Joseph Mbogba, said he is excited to receive the President; and that he too is pleased with the government’s efforts at developing the country’s human capital, especially the approval of 339 schools and 314 teachers in the district.
He assured president Bio of his district’s continuing support for the government’s development agenda.
Speaking to the people of Moyamba, president Bio said that although his government inherited a challenging system, he has made a lot of progress as evident in the ongoing developments across the country.
He said that through quality leadership, the image of the country is beginning to change at the international level.
/>The president reiterated his government’s commitment to the fight against corruption, which he said has been a serious impediment in the development of the country.
He noted that for far too long, corruption had been responsible for the suffering of the people, adding that his government remains committed to changing the narrative.
He said that because of a determined leadership, the New Direction Government has been able to clamp down on corrupt practices, as well as recovered a lot of monies stolen by corrupt individuals.
Those recovered funds he said, will be used to provide quality healthcare service for the people of Sierra Leone.
President Bio thanked the people of Moyamba District for their continued support, especially for overwhelmingly voting for him at last year’s presidential election.
He said that his government is working hard to bring development to every part of the country, and assured the people of Moyamba of his commitment to improving their lives.
The nature of corruption in the nation is institutionally fundamental, and can only be minimised if it is taken from the root. The question that should be asked is “what causes corruption?”
I personally believe that the best decision that President Bio made after the Free quality education was by choosing Commissioner Francis Ben Kaifala as the Anti corruption Czar after forrmer Commissioner Ady Macaulay was fired. Can you believe or remotely imagine that this corrupted APC commissioner who is now defending their former corrupt APC party members who are facing judgment by the COI should have prosecuted these unpatriotic citizens?
Thanks to the Almighty for the wisdom that he gave to our president; and let’s continue to pray that he continues to succeed in the fight against corruption and not be distracted by negative propaganda , Fake News or any false allegations.What Is the Natural Diabetes Remedy That May Reverse Your Diabetic Issues?

For years, the Chinese have used mulberry to treat diabetic issues as well as has actually appreciated excellent success in reversing the illness.

Model: 3618-SJ
Year: December 1971
System: 625 Line

Brochure Photo
Actual TV
This 1971 Beovision is in immaculate show room condition and equally clean inside. The TV is a 3200 series chassis, the model being a 3618-SJ.
Research revealed this set replaced the 3000, its visually similar and has a near-identical chassis to the 3000. Apparently the reason for the model change was the use of an A66 120X, this being 1″ larger and the faceplate a slightly different shape allowing the screen to be pushed through the cabinet front rather than being mounted behind a mask. Other than that, the set appears to have remained pretty much the same as the 3000, with a large loudspeaker unit beneath the screen and a secret panel to the left of the screen behind which the convergence controls are hidden.
Some photos of the cabinet and internals
CRT Any Good?
Since getting the Beovision 3200, I’ve been curious as to the state/condition of the Philips A66-120X within. After being engrossed in a number of other TV set repairs and the Fergy project, today I finally got around to testing it.
For a change rather then using what everyone seems to use myself included, namely the B&K 467, I thought I would give the Leader LCT-910A an outing. I’m delighted, the tube tests 90% emission on all guns and the tracking is near perfect, a very good tube indeed.
Another interesting find was a little parcel stuffed under the wiring harness top right. When opened it contained a rectangular push button with part of it broken stalk protruding. A little investigation revealed it came from a switch mounted on and above the line cage. Pushing the broken end into the switch shoved its remains out the back of the switch body. But what was it for? Reading the service data shows its the colour killer switch. There’s most other manufacturers giving instructions like ground the base of VTxx to chassis via a 56K resistor to override the CK and B&O go and give you a proper switch, how swish. Going to have to find something suitable to replace it with.
Interesting set. These give a very good picture indeed and in my opinion better than later models with an inline CRT. Beware of the transistorized frame time base as any fault can be a nightmare to sort out. It is partly DC coupled and any off value resistor or leaky cap can blow transistors like fuses. Take time to do cold checks and resist the temptation to give it a whirl if just replacing blown transistors. Good luck.
In fact I think this is an earlier model with a PL508 and not the solid state frame stage.
Yes it is the early version with the PL508 field output. A very complex set with the dual line output stage and the thing that gives me the heebie jeebies, the EHT generator stage which delivers near instantaneous 7mA at 25kV.
Hi Chris,
B&O always used a Philips CRT and from what I can remember might also have been selected from the production line. Appears you have an original in very good order and emission might improve once the set is up and running. This set has a lot of nice features not found in most UK models. The broken switch as you found is to disable the colour decoder during black and white broadcasts and if I remember correctly also disables the 4.433MHz sub carrier trap in the luminance amplifier allowing full 5.25MHz video bandwidth.
You are right to be wary of the regulated EHT supply on this and also later 3400 series. When working around high voltage area be careful of X-Rays generated by PD500 and GY501. I am not sure about 7mA at 25kV being available since both valves are rated at maximum of 1.6mA and 1.7mA respectively. Maybe the extra capacitance afforded by the shielded EHT cable can achieve that figure…. either way it will make your hair stand on end! One thing we *always* checked when these sets came in for service is beam current limiter operation as it is very easy to permanently buckle the shadow-mask through overheating at high brightness. You do sometimes get temporary purity errors which will clear when brightness control is turned down.
Looking forward to your repair write up.
Rich
Worked on lots of these sets and owned one also. Fabulous pictures, its like a trip in time for me. Many thanks.

People often make the decision to refurbish because of cracked plaster or worn areas due to use, old electric systems, lack of insulation or sound proofing. Updating from an outdated look to a new modern look, replacing inefficient windows or heating and cooling systems are a few more reasons.
Whatever your needs, our architects, designers and decorators will help you find the design style and look you want, while incorporating the necessary requirements to make that possible.
Depending on your designing needs, London Elite Trades can refurbish your home or business to update your look, completely remodel an entire area or whole home, or build what you need from the ground up and finish to completion. Before they can start, however, they need to know what you want.
What are your needs for the refurbishment?London Elite Trades will come and visit your home or business, walking through the areas with you and discuss the various ideas and issues that may arise during construction.
They will also discuss with you what would be required for completion and getting the overall feel for what you want. Once you draw up plans with our designers and architects, the process of building can begin.
The next thing on the list is compliance with the development and building codes. You will also have to consider fire safety. London Elite Trades will work with you and the city to make sure all codes are covered in your refurbishment.
Since teamwork and a close relationship between London Elite Trades and the client are essential, direct contact between the two is an important step in obtaining information on the desires of the client and the planning of the project by the contractors.
London Elite Trades offers full construction service from start to finish, working directly with you throughout all stages of planning and construct. Division of duties is essential in making sure the desired area is being completed by the proper agents.
The use of our own specialized contractors is part of what we do to give you the quality work you want and the detail we require.
We require all of our employees to be certified, licensed and professionally adept in their area of expertise so you can rest assured your project will be completed on time and within the budget allowed, yet still receiving the quality of work expected.
When it is the roof that needs insulated, we will install high quality insulation in your attic, having discussed with the client the types and requirements needed, whether it is loose fill, blanket or foam to name a few.
Often, in pre-fabricated elements like doors and walls, there is not any sound-proofing. We will remove the walls and add the proofing discussed, then refinish the wall back to new. Types of sound-proofing are fiberglass insulation blankets, vinyl rubber, and sound panels.
Other issues might be cracked or falling plaster from old walls, deterioration from use and outdated technical installments.
We will assess the situations, check for any required codes, talk with you so you understand the changes, then bring in the proper professionals to complete the project. We can do repair work, or we can install new products and replace the entire area that is needing repaired.
Any remodeling, redecorating or refurbishing needs you have, we give you our word we can take care of it for you. We pride ourselves in working closely with the home owners, architects, building authorities and insurance companies to ensure every step of the way is done right, by making sure forms are filed, codes are met, and safety procedures have been followed every step of the way.
We make sure to leave you with a peace of mind that not only is your project done, it’s done right from start to finish. That is what we all here at London Elite Trades strive to do for you.Source: NEWS TRACK India
Hindu Baccalaureate Service (Dikshant Utsav) held for the first time in Western USA at prestigious University of Nevada-Reno (UNR) in May last, will be a regular annual feature.

News Excerpt
The Internet and Mobile Association of India has proposed an internet ombudsman model to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
Pre-Connect
• An ombudsman is an official, usually appointed by the government, who investigates complaints against businesses, financial institutions, or government departments or other public entities, and attempts to resolve the conflicts or concerns raised, either by mediation or by making recommendations.
• Depending on the jurisdiction, an ombudsman's decision may or may not be legally binding.
• The Supreme Court has declared access to internet a fundamental right under Article 19. A government cannot deprive the citizens of fundamental rights except under certain conditions explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.
• The Supreme Court ruling is also in sync with the United Nations recommendation that every country should make access to Internet a fundamental right.
• A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Puttaswamy v. Union of India has declared that the right to privacy is a fundamental right protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
• However, the Supreme Court clarified that the fundamental right to privacy is not absolute and will always be subject to reasonable restrictions.
Impact of Internet on society
• The Internet have brought their own revolution in human daily life (science, education, information, entertainment etc) eliminating the distances and offering immediate and easily access to information and communication.
• With the continuous development of new technologies, the Internet users are able to communicate anywhere in the world to shop online, use it as an educational tool, work remotely and carry out financial transactions with various services offered by banks.
• The infinite possibilities that are offered by the Internet can often lead users to abuse it, or to use it for malicious purposes against other users, organizations and public services.
• With the rapid spread and growth of the Internet, they have appeared some social phenomena such as cyber-bullying, internet pornography, grooming through social networks, cyber-suicide, Internet addiction and social isolation, racism on the web.
• Moreover, there is always the risk of any sort of fraud exploitation by the so-called experts of technology systems who use Internet as a mean to carry out illegal acts.
• In the interplay between government, companies and citizens for big data, information asymmetry has become so skewed that it has eroded the very spirit of democracy by limiting the unbiased communication of ideas.
• Governments and private companies are using the Internet as ‘a means of control and surveillance, extending from cases of fraud detection, storage and exchange of criminal and financial records to those of political surveillance and control’.
• Citizens who receive a flood of unfiltered information, information with colour but no patterns, information with images that can never add up to the real picture, re-circulate the same back into the infantile world for greater chaos.
Need for ombudsman
• On the privacy front, even after the Supreme Court of India had declared privacy as a fundamental right, the government insisted on affidavit in the top court that informational privacy or data privacy cannot be a fundamental right.
• The Aadhar Act diluted the notion of ‘privacy’ and the standard of proportionality test set up by the Supreme Court.
• The clear impression is that the government is more interested in ‘control’ than ‘protection’ of data.
• A national policy on data privacy of individuals is still a non-starter. People continue to suffer because of the regular incidents of data theft.
• India’s cyber security watchdog, CERT-In, reported huge data theft of Facebook and Twitter users by malicious third-party apps.
• Reportedly, more than 1.3 million credit and debit card details from Indian banks and the data of 6.8 million users from an Indian health-care website were stolen in the same year.
• Private data analytics companies have emerged to exploit the electoral process with the sole objective of customising political messaging. While the customisation of political messaging is not per se illegal, it certainly is unlawful to indulge in unauthorised data mining and collection by the industry.
• According to a report by Omidyar Network India and Monitor Deloitte, many private enterprises routinely share the personal data of individuals with third parties including political organisations.
• The fact that there are dedicated IT cells which carry out a digital form of warfare with propaganda and fake news being two powerful weapons is making things more complicated.
• The present legal framework leaves these menaces outside the ambit of election laws as they were framed in a time and space that was primitive when compared to contemporary technological advancements.
• For citizens, digital media are carriers of images and sounds, rather than words and thoughts, and the system where images run faster than thoughts is suitable for the spread of fake news.
• The fake WhatsApp forwards that triggered the primitive “Us v/s Them” group mentality and is manifested in Delhi riots reports, and the forwards on the novel coronavirus which declare COVID-19 a bacteria and the World Health Organization stating that vegetarians cannot be infected with COVID-19, are all reminders of the potency of data, true or false, in a democracy.
• The Personal Data Protection Bill is more about control and surveillance than about promoting privacy and protection of data.
• Section 35, which provides the government with unfettered access to personal data, negates the three tests of legality, necessity and proportionality given by the Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India.
• The Bill also allows State and private parties to process personal data without obtaining consent and such broad exemptions would not only open the floodgates for misuse but also reduce India’s prospects of entering into bilateral arrangements for law enforcement access.
• So, there is a need of a gatekeeper to balance appetites for technology, security and privacy. So long as the gate keeper is for regulation, not surveillance, and so long as it is completely and genuinely independent.
• Only an Internet ombudsman with experts on cyber and Internet laws, IT, data management, data science, data security, public administration and national security, and consciously involving eminent sections of civil society, can be an effective antidote to unregulated technological disruptions.
Conclusion
The Internet benefits are numerous and contribute to the progress and prosperity of humans in all areas. However, Internet is provided in abundance and is easily accessible and the illogical use of the Internet makes it be quite dangerous, especially for young users. It is important to understand how government, political parties and citizens are responding to this new triangular interplay between data protection, privacy and a flow of information.Here it starts:You must be registered for see links

The app allows those interested in Heritage auctions to view auction lots, see high resolution images of the items, bid, and follow auction, “in real-time,” according to Heritage. As a customer of Heritage, I downloaded the app hoping it would be something special.
This review is for the Heritage Mobile Catalog for the iPad only. Heritage has a separate app that works for the iPhone and iPad that is a wrapper around their mobile website. Do not confuse the two. The Heritage Mobile Catalog app is an application and different from the website. The Heritage app provides nothing more than what you can experience if you opened Safari on your iDevice and went to HA.com. For Android users, you are not missing anything by not having the Heritage App. I deleted the Heritage app from my iPhone and iPad.
The Heritage Mobile Catalog app is works in portrait and landscape mode on the iPad, but I found that using it in landscape mode looks better. When you open the app, you are presented with a number of virtual “catalogs” of Heritage’s various auctions. Even though this blog is interested in numismatics, I like to look at some of Heritage’s other auctions—which is why I now own some older political memorabilia. For this review, I selected the catalog for the August 3 Currency Signature Auction in Philadelphia.
The first issue that users will experience is this is not a “real-time” application. Before being able to browse an auction, you have to download the catalog. This can take some time depending on your connection. Even a more recent test using my home WiFi connection at full strength and no other activity I lost track of the time it was taking to download a catalog that was reported to be over 164 megabytes. All I remember was that during the wait I was able to make a bio-break and pour a beverage. If I was not trying to refresh my review, I would have given up and opened Safari to go to their website.
You can avoid the dialog box if you press the “Update Bids” button. This will do the same as the dialog box, but you have to remember to press it first before pressing the “View” button to see the catalog. In either case, this is not a straight forward interface for the ordinary user. In fact, as a note to the project manager at Heritage, this type of interface reminds me of the book The Inmates Are Running the Asylum. The first half of this book makes it worth reading.
List View really lets you get down to the business of browsing and bidding on the auction. While Gallery View is nice, you will probably use List View more. Both views allows you to sort the list by several criteria and the Refine button will let you search for specific items and let you narrow the display by relevant terms. While the images here are screen shots from a currency auction, the Refine Search adapts to the type of auction you are viewing.
Where the annoyance returns is the “My Heritage” button that does not offer a service but connects you to the Heritage website and uses the output from the website as the display. In order for an iOS application to open a web page, it has to bring up a separate window that overlays over the app. There’s a “clunky” feeling to this type of interface that I find annoying.
When you tap on an auction to bid on it, users of the eBay for iPad app will find familiar. There is nothing wrong with this interface because I think the Heritage version is a cleaner and a little more intuitive than the way eBay crammed everything into their version.
While I can speculate on why the Heritage Mobile Catalog app does this type of pre-loading, the bottom line is that it takes too long and does not update prices in “real-time” as their announcement claims. While other apps find ways to integrate their backend processing directly into the app, the Heritage Mobile Catalog has a “bolted-on” feeling. With the exception of the Gallery View, why should someone use this app over opening the browser and directly accessing the auction on the website?
I wanted to love this app but the interface annoyances has me using the website more than this app. It is like a mint state coin that is not well struck which is why I am grading this app MS60. Whomever is responsible for this app at Heritage should look at similar apps (eBay) and consider attending the next Apple World Wide Developers Conference to attend the course on what makes a good iOS interface.

K the way up we stayed with Steinbeck in Salinas, near Monterey. I’d last seen Steinbeck in Idyllwild, right before I landed in hospital with my freak heart problem. He’d been forced off trail at Cabazon by some problems at home, but was determined to try again next year. Given the snow conditions on trail this year, it was probably for the best.
Tidbit got a phone call in the middle of the night at Steinbeck’s place with some bad news. Her grandma, who’d been severely unwell for the past weeks, had just passed away. She would need to fly back to Texas for the funeral. Tidbit was very close with her grandma, and had been understandably anxious about her deteriorating health since I met her in Wrightwood.
The next morning we drove to San Francisco and dropped off Grit in Berkeley, where she was staying with the family of another hiker. We’d arranged to stay in the city at the home of Claudine, the wife of hiker All-In. I’d met All-In before Deep Creek and he’d asked me to join his crew that was braving the Sierra, but the reports I was reading of treacherous river crossings, knee-deep postholing and high avalanche risk were making me lean towards flipping.
I dropped Tidbit at the airport a couple of days later, while Claudine headed out to Bishop to meet All-In. I had their beautiful house near Golden Gate Park all to myself, but a persistent stomach illness (I think I may have had giardia) kept me from making the most of my time in the city. Tidbit returned from Texas a few days later, and we drove up to the redwoods in Humboldt and Del Norte counties for a few days. These trees are among the oldest living things on the planet, and they are spectacularly beautiful.
I enjoyed being in the comforts of civilisation for two weeks, but spent most of the time anxious about being off the trail. I was continually aware that I wasn’t doing what I came to America to do – fulfil my dream of the past four years. So I was relieved when we finally decided to commit to the flip, and began the long and complicated journey to the northern California town of Chester. As we’d hoped, a lot of snow had melted during our time off. The trail north of Chester appeared to offer the longest stretch of relatively snow-free hiking available.
Because of the difficulty of booking one-way car rentals for long journeys we had to drive all the way down to Sacramento to return our car, then immediately pick up a second rental car and drive it back north to Redding, then get on a bus back south to Red Bluff and east to Chester. It took the better part of two days. Finally at 4:30PM on Monday, a bus dropped us off at the trail outside of Chester. We made it nearly 10 miles before sundown, and spent our first night camped by the raging Feather River. Northern California’s notorious mosquitoes descended on us immediately, so we scoffed our dinner and retreated to the tent.
In the morning we entered Lassen Volcanic National Park, and soon reached a boiling sulphurous lake with bubbling mud pits that looked like something from Mars. Not long after, we hit the only stretch of snow between Chester and Burney. I’d been feeling guilty about skipping the Sierra and breaking up the continuity of the hike, but the snow was a convincing reminder of why I’d made that decision.
The snow only lasted for six miles, but it was tough, slow going as we trekked up and down snow drifts and repeatedly lost the trail. We used a fallen log to make a slightly dangerous crossing of a raging river – something I’d be doing several times a day if I were in the Sierra. Two hikers drowned in 2017 – another high snow year – doing just that.
We crossed another stream earlier than we were supposed to, and found ourselves bush bashing along the bank to try and rejoin the trail. At 6PM, only 13 miles after we left camp that morning, we came across the only flat piece of dry ground we’d seen for miles and decided to call it a day. In the tent that night, I calculated how many miles I would have to hike per day to finish by my target of mid-September. The number shocked me: 21 miles a day, not including any days off. I’d killed a lot of time in the desert and since while I waited out the snow to melt, but I’ve run out of days that I can afford to waste. From hereon in, I’m going to have to step it up.
Determined to make up for lost time, I got up early the next morning and we headed back into the snow. Four more hours of frustratingly slow hiking later, we cleared the snow and began the long descent towards the tiny town of Old Station. We passed through a long stretch of burnt forest, which exposed us to the blazing sun. Despite the distant sea of green, this felt more like the desert than the real desert had ever been.
I reached the spur trail to Old Station in the early evening, and Tidbit arrived shortly after. She was in bad shape. Her feet were acting up, and she was in a lot of pain. She hobbled with me to the gas station – the only store in town – and we bought a frozen pizza. The manager, an unflinchingly friendly guy in a ten-gallon hat, kindly cooked it for us.
Tidbit was in no shape to continue the next morning, so she hitched a ride about 30 miles up the trail to my next stop at the Burney Mountain Guest Ranch. I left at 7:30, and stopped by the Subway Cave on my way out of town. The cave is a quarter-mile-long lava tube with openings at both ends. It was creepy exploring it alone, but well worth the hour-long detour.
By 8:30 I was climbing up towards Hat Creek Rim, which I would follow for the entire day. At top, I got my first view of the magnificent Mount Shasta. This stretch of trail is the only significant waterless section north of the desert, and is almost completely exposed. The afternoon was hot, but the trail was mostly flat so I didn’t have to work up too much of a sweat. I took long breaks at the road 22 water cache and under a large tree to cool down and wait out the heat.
Mosquitoes began to emerge at dusk, and I started jogging down the trail to escape them. Unfortunately the trail in this section is full of jagged volcanic rock, so I could only go so fast without risking my ankles. I made it to a tent site at dusk and hurriedly set up my tent. I’d made it 25.3 miles – my longest day on trail so far.
I started early the next morning, and it made it the seven miles to Burney Mountain Guest Ranch by 9:30. Tidbit was there, and her feet were feeling better. I showered, did laundry, and bought more supplies from the ranch’s small hiker store. The ranch is a religious resort of sorts, complete with a replica Noah’s Ark and an enormous wooden cross looking out over a valley to an identical twin cross. Only in America.
The hiker store sold spray-on permethrin, an insect repellent used to treat clothing. Fearful of more ‘skeeters, we sprayed our entire load of laundry and left it to dry on a washing line. I lazed around the campground for longer than I’d planned as we waited for electronics to charge and clothes to dry. Finally at 4:30 we got back on the trail, and headed towards Burney Falls state park.
We reached the turnoff to the falls just before sunset, and were glad we did. The falls were spectacular in their enormity, and the viewing point offered the best possible view of the awesomely powerful spectacle. A couple of car-camper visitors peppered us with questions about the trail on the way in. Some hikers have made an art form out of using these conversations to milk curious civilised folk for their snacks and beers, a practice known as yogi-ing (after Yogi the bear). We got nothing, so I clearly need to get better at it. I think the secret is having no shame.
We camped at the park, which turned out to be a bad decision. We’d already paid our $5 each before we realised that the hiker sites were half a mile from the ranger station, at the very back of the park. As the only campers who don’t have vehicles, this seemed absurdly unfair. We had to trudge past every cabin and RV site in the entire park on the way to our patch of dirt, next to an old cemetery and miles away from the toilets.
You might think this would be nothing to hikers used to walking 20+ miles a day, but the hiker brain doesn’t work that way. After a long day on the trail, the last thing you want to do is walk more miles that don’t even count towards your total. Most of us will happily wait by the side of a road for an hour if it means some driver will save us from walking half an hour to wherever we’re going. In summary, sort your shit out California state park service.
Tidbit and I hiked 70 miles over the next three days, mostly through dense forests of ponderosa pines and incense cedars. It seemed we were always on a long climb or descent to and from tree-covered ridges, and water was everywhere. For the most part, we only had to carry a litre of water at a time. It was just as well, because I’d been lugging a heavy bear can and an ice axe since Chester.
I was carrying the axe in case we came across steep snow, but never needed to use it. I gave it a whirl on a short slope, using it as brake while I glissaded to the bottom. It’s so much fun, and in the heat I didn’t even mind getting a wet butt.
If you seek the Pine Throne, you win or you die.
We woke up yesterday 12 miles from Dunsmuir, and began the descent into town early. I was going to mail the ice axe ahead from town, and had the axe stowed in the outer mesh pocket of my pack. As I tried to push through some overgrown vegetation, a branch snagged on the axe and catapulted it behind me. Tidbit Matrix’d herself out of the way in the nick of time, and it flew by her head and into some bushes. Oops. I retrieved the axe, and she went through the overgrown vegetation first this time.
We made it into town without the ice axe embedded in anybody’s skull, and I mailed it forward along with my bear can and some other snow gear I no longer needed. Tidbit’s feet are becoming painful again and are covered in blisters, which she thinks are caused by her new shoes. She’s skipping ahead to Etna, and is going to try and find some different shoes in the meantime.
I’m waiting for a package with some more gear which is supposed to arrive today, then I’m continuing into the Trinity Alps and the last section of California.
I lay under these things at the prettiest lunch spot I’ve stopped at so far, next to a waterfall near Dunsmuir.
I’ve been reflecting a lot on my decision to flip past the snow over the last 170 miles, but the more time I spend out here the more comfortable I am with it. More and more hikers who tried to brave the Sierra are bailing out, and those staying in them are contending with deep snow and terrifying river crossings. I wish them all the best, but I’m not here to be miserable or put myself in more danger than necessary. I’m here to enjoy myself, and I don’t want my Sierra experience to be a death march. I’ll return sometime in August, when the snow and the runoff should be much lower. Until then, my goal is the same: Keep on Truckin’.
Fabulous photos, Enjoy your great adventure and stay safe. good decision to flip past the snow.🍎 We Definitely Want WATCH • 15 HOURs to Go • Friday On-Line WATCH Pre-Orders • STEP-BY-STEP Guide 🍎

According to Vogue, the accompanying exhibition will feature over 100 haute couture and ready-to-wear pieces, which will highlight the differences between handcrafted clothing and machine-made fashion.
“Traditionally, the distinction between the haute couture and prêt-à-porter was based on the handmade and the machine-made,” Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton told Vogue. “But recently this distinction has become increasingly blurred as both disciplines have embraced the practices and techniques of the other.”
The gala—set to take place May 2—will be hosted by co-chairs Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, Jonathan Ive, and Anna Wintour. It was also announced that Apple will sponsor the event and exhibition, which is expected be much less controversial than this year’s theme, “China: Through the Looking Glass.”
But one question remains: Will this tech-focused event continue to ban selfies? We’ll see if Wintour has a change of heart.

Effective against Red and Gray Squirrels
The Squirrel Buster technology is truly squirrel proof. Thousands of delighted bird lovers have confirmed it!
How it works

Seed Stays Fresh
Patented Seed Ventilation System circulates air through the seed keeping it dry
Dismantles For Easy Cleaning
Squirrel Buster Finch has been designed to dismantle easily, without any tools, so that cleaning your feeder is effortless. It is important for wild bird safety to always provide a clean feeder.

Nevertheless, you might well think that you can efficiently manifest the following action in your journey to a brand-new service in a day, in which situation you may establish that as your goal (e.g. to finish a organisation plan, obtain a finance you need, or discover a person to collaborate with).
So if something isn’t happening for you now, it does not indicate it never ever will. Maintain believing and keep servicing your goal.When selecting a thing to manifest, ask yourself the adhering to questions:

->Hazardous people.
When you are working on manifesting your dream you need to ensure nobody is holding you back. People that do not believe in you, always criticize you and/or complain concerning every little thing are obstructs that will certainly maintain you from doing your finest.

You can spend the rest of your day virtually living as you usually would; there isn’t any particular activity you need to take in order to make manifestation possible (your purposes are what will identify your success).

The day was a very difficult one. Those of you who are 'Facebook friends' may have seen my update saying that it 'was the worst day I'd ever had as a dog owner.' It truly was. With those events and the loss of Bubba and the six others this year, my spirit and the 'fragile circle' that I live in truly feels breached and broken. I cannot remember ever being at a lower point. This circle that Carl and I have chosen to live in, and my broken heart will hopefully be made whole by your friendship, family, and the good memories and times of the past year. At least as the last day of 2011 dawns, and a new year is on the horizon, that's my hope.White Jasper Dice Set. Semi Precious Gemstone 7 Piece TTRPG Dice

Ben Maddison brought up implementation differences at the ietf108 session. You're right that it's probably obvious to anyone on the SIDROPS WG that native BGPsec evaluation should take precedence, but developers or other people reading the specs may make different decisions because they're going to approach the document from a different point of view. It would be clearer to make this explicit, e.g. to add a single sentence in the Deployment Considerations section to say: "If the received validation state of a route differs from a BGPsec validation state locally computed according to [RFC8205], then the locally computed BGPsec validation state MUST be used and the received validation state MUST be ignored". On a separate thing, getting back to ebgp stuff, the Deployment Considerations section says: > Furthermore, one can envision that the operator of a BGPsec router > decides to defer local BGPsec validation when a validation state > value is learned via iBGP or a trusted eBGP peer. This needs to be reworded because there is no concept of "trusted eBGP" in rfc4360. Maybe reword as "... when a validation state value is learned via BGP", and just revert to the default behaviour from 4360? also nit: > Implementations MUST drop (without processing) the BGPsec path > validation state extended community if received over a peering > session where either the usage is not enabled or it is not part of a > BGPsec UPDATE. s/peering session/BGP session/ Nick

Your eyes may have caught the attention of the latest model from your favourite car manufacturer but is a brand new car the right choice for you? They may have all the trappings of comfort and convenience. However, it comes at a price that not many can afford. Fortunately, vehicle ownership doesn’t necessarily have to be a luxury reserved only for the affluent. This is where purchasing a used car comes into play. In this article, we’ll discuss some of the advantages of buying a second-hand vehicle over committing a sizable amount of financial resources on a pristine car.
- It will save you money
One of the benefits of buying used is that prices are considerably lower. This means that you will be able to pay off the car much quicker than you otherwise would have and save yourself a considerable amount of money in the process. And if you put in a little bit of time on research and try to negotiate for a better deal, you may even drive down the asking price even more and spend much less as a result. Best of all, you may be able to meet the expense of owning a vehicle that you may have wanted in the past but couldn’t spare the price of when it was new.
- Lower rates for insurance
Having vehicle insurance is essential. After all, if the car incurs any damage due to an accident, you’ll want to have the financial support to cover its repairs. While getting coverage for a new car can be pricey, insurance rates for second-hand automobiles are generally lower because of depreciation. So apart from saving on the actual cost of the vehicle, you also won’t have to spend a small fortune on securing insurance.

You’ll have more options
Unless you have limitless financial resources to work with, you’ll likely be restricted in your choices of a car. However, by opting for a used vehicle, you’ll have a broader range of options, similar to games at Netbet slots. In addition, due to their lower cost for ownership, you’ll be able to find more than a few potentially viable cars that may fit both your needs and your budget. And it is for this reason that many choose to opt for second-hand cars.
- Easier customizability
For many people, a car is an extension of themselves. Whether it’s a unique paint style or the addition of other equipment, personalisation is a big part of car ownership. However, many often have doubts about customising a new model because it would effectively void any existing warranties. This is a non-issue when it comes to a used automobile. You’ll be able to modify it to your heart’s content and turn it into a vehicle unique only to you.
Bottom line
Given the opportunity, many of us would undoubtedly go for a new car instead of an older model. However, there are times when the budget won’t extend to the former. In this case, it’s never a bad idea to go for a used car. When you get right down to it, not only will you be able to save more money, but you’ll save even more money on ownership and have a lot more options available to you. Giaquinto

Nine members of the Syrian government’s security and intelligence forces were accused of crimes of state terrorism in the 95-page complaint that was filed on Wednesday in Madrid.
The case is the first in a Western court brought against members of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s government, with the nine accused understood to include senior officials.
The full names of the nine officials and the name of the victim and his sister have not been made public.
The sister, who is only identified in the complaint as Mrs AH, claims she is a victim of Syrian state terrorism because her brother was arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared, tortured and executed in 2013.
Under Spanish law, Spanish prosecutors can investigate the complaint because Mrs AH is a Spanish national, a precedent that has previously been used to investigate crimes committed by state actors in Latin America during the Cold War.
Her lawyers, Guernica 37, said in a statement: “The evidence submitted clearly demonstrates that the Syrian State led by President Bashar al-Assad committed the Crime of Terrorism against its civil population using its security forces and intelligence apparatus.”
It added: “Thousands of detainees have been executed or have died as a result of torture, mass starvation and illness.”
The case was brought to light after a defector known by the codename Caesar, who had worked as a forensic officer, escaped from Syria in September 2013 with more than 50,000 photos documenting the deaths of more than 6,000 people.
Mrs AH and her family were able to identify her brother based on images of victims posted on online by the Syrian Association for Missing and Conscience Detainees.
Almudena Bernabeu, the lawyer representing Mrs AH, said: “This complaint materialises the efforts of extraordinary professionals from Syria and other parts of the world, who have tirelessly fought for justice during the last five years.
“The Caesar photographs demonstrate the degree of perversion of a state when it decides to attack its people through its institutions. Our desire is that this first step would allow for criminal justice efforts in other jurisdictions, and consequently, bring hope to the thousands of Syrian civilians that continue suffering the consequences of this barbarity.”
The Syrian government has faced international condemnation over its conduct during the country’s more than five-year civil war, in which it is accused of killing the great majority of the hundreds of thousands of people who have died.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented the deaths of 14,638 detainees, including 111 children from the start of the uprising until December 2016. This did not include more than 5,500 people who had gone missing or been abducted by state forces. Some 1,500 people were disappeared by the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) and rebel factions in Syria.
Overall civilian deaths until December 13 documented by SOHR were 90,506, including 15,948 children and 10,540 women.
More than 102,000 government troops and militia members have died and more than 53,000 rebel fighters have been killed, according to the Observatory. In addition, more than 54,000 foreign anti-government and ISIS fighters have been killed in Syria.
In October then-UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said that Assad’s government was responsible for 300,000 deaths.
Efforts to prosecute Syrian leaders have been obstructed by the presence and vetoing powers of Russia, Assad’s main ally, on the UN Security Council, which normally refers potential war crimes and crimes against humanity cases to the International Criminal Court for investigation.
This article was originally published by Middle East Eye and is reprinted here with permission.A few years ago, my mother had a heart attack that required several long, frightening days in the hospital. When the initial crisis passed, she returned home under strict doctor’s orders about the types of food she should have in her diet (and the types she shouldn’t).
As a family, we figured we could easily find and provide what she needed. After all, most of us were trained medical professionals.
Boy, were we wrong.
We found our time and energy stretched thin as we tried to manage her new medications, fatigue and the emotional strain of this sudden health crisis on the entire family. As a result, we had to make difficult judgment calls between food that was quick and easy to prepare, and food that was nutritious but required more time and effort.
READ: Colorado Sun opinion columnists.
This scenario happens across Colorado every day. Some of the facts may be different; perhaps it is someone with kidney disease or cancer, but the challenges are similar. All too often, when very ill people are told what to eat by their doctor, they are left to figure out what that means all by themselves. And this is, of course, at a time in their lives when they usually have the least mental and physical energy, and financial means, to put towards grocery shopping, meal planning and food preparation.
For people living with chronic and severe illnesses, proper nutrition can be the difference between life and death. That is not to downplay the critical importance of prescription medication, but medicine can do only so much when people have to rely on unhealthy food to satisfy their hunger.
That’s why the rallying cry of my nonprofit organization, Project Angel Heart, is “food is medicine.” Regardless of a person’s background or circumstances, we believe everyone should have access to the nutrition they need – especially when they are sick.
In our kitchen in North Denver, we create meals from scratch, tailored to our clients’ illnesses. Each week, hundreds of volunteers help us package and deliver these meals to our clients’ homes while our team of nutritionists provides education, counseling and other support to improve clients’ health and wellbeing. Most importantly, our entire program is provided at no cost to our clients.
We go to these lengths because we know this approach works. Through our own research, we know that the medically tailored meals we provide reduce health-care costs and re-hospitalization.
Many reputable studies and a wide breadth of medical research have also demonstrated that providing proper nutrition to people who are seriously ill keeps them out of the hospital, reduces their out-of-pocket medical expenses, and promotes overall well-being.
The biggest challenge we face is funding this vital program. We rely heavily on the generosity of Coloradans to donate their time and resources to our work. In our state, there are very limited circumstances in which a person can access medically tailored nutrition through their health-care provider or insurance plan. That’s not true in other parts of the country.
Recognizing the important role nutrition plays in reducing health-care costs, many states include home-delivered meals as a benefit for chronically ill individuals in their state-run insurance plans – a move supported by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services.
TODAY’S UNDERWRITER
Gov. Jared Polis has ambitiously made reducing health-care costs a top priority for his administration. In my opinion, providing chronically ill people the nutrition they need to manage their illness at home is a key step to realizing this goal.
When a proven, cost-effective intervention like this exists, we must remove all barriers to access for individuals and families in need. Colorado should follow other states and make medically tailored meals a more accessible part of healthcare.
Including meals in private insurance plans and state-regulated and state-funded insurance programs could go a long way towards alleviating food insecurity and providing access to food as medicine for tens of thousands of Coloradans.

Appliance Repair EncinoThe American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists recently stated that studies found the COVID vaccine does not impair fertility.
However, many women are still reluctant to get the shot for that reason.
Lauren Pastrana spoke to a Miami-based OBGYN about how the misinformation surrounding the vaccine could cost people their lives.
GUEST: Dr. Jennifer Schell, OBGYNDr. Richard Leakey, former head of the Kenya Wildlife Service, flew to Harare, Zimbabwe, to address the Species Survival Network's reception for delegates and observers. The reception was held on 12 June at the 1997 CITES conference. Although many reporters attended the reception, the Zimbabwe government-controlled press never made a single mention of Dr. Leakey's visit, presumably because he did not sing "the Zimbabwe Song" of making wild animals "pay their way." Extracts from Dr. Leakey's speech follow. At one point Leakey described himself as a "bunny hugger" and pulled out a white stuffed rabbit to a roar of applause from the guests!
I confess that I find the very concept of conservation to be ambiguous at best and in the era of political correctness, one hears all kinds of interpretations of what a "good" conservation program should be about. Does it follow that good conservation practice will prevent species extinctions? Probably not. I don't know what is right or good, but I do think that as we approach the end of this century we must be increasingly mindful of the consequences that result from extinctions.
Species survival is obviously the focus for many of us gathered here this evening and I hope that it is also an important concern for some of the other participants in the CITES meeting who are not here this evening.
Most of you know as well as I do that biologists and conservationists are operating from a position of ignorance: we don't actually know how many species there really are on the planet, let alone on the African or any other continent. The rate of extinctions is also unknown. Scientists suggest that there are somewhere between 10 and 100 million species on the planet. Human activities are causing between 10,000 and 40,000 species to become extinct each year. Since life first appeared, apparently more than 99% of species have become extinct. Our role in this extraordinary saga has been minuscule and so far it is not statistically significant. Most of these losses are well before we came on the scene and we probably would not have appeared at all if extinctions had not opened up some ecological opportunities for our ancestors.
It is the acceleration of species loss through human activities today that is significant and unless the present trend is reversed, the planet could lose approximately 55% of today's species over the next 50 to 100 years. Such rapid catastrophic losses to biodiversity have happened before, and these catastrophes have always had far reaching consequences for the surviving species.
Given the inevitability of extinctions, and bearing in mind that most of these losses will come about as a consequence of activities beyond the control of individual nations or their conventions, should we really be concerned about the loss of a few species that results from international trade? Will the world be any worse off if there are no longer pangolins, brown hyenas or pandas?
The Europeans don't seem to have suffered from the loss of the woolly rhinoceros and how many Americans even remember the giant sloth that slipped into extinction some ten thousand years ago?
Will Africans miss the elephant or the rhino if these too disappear? Is the elephant any more important than an orchid that grows near tropical wetlands? What about the extinction of hundreds and thousands of species that we humans have not yet even discovered? Does it matter if they become extinct before we even know that they exist?
I think it does, and I am sure many of you do too, but there are a good number of people on our planet for whom the idea of conservation is quite irrelevant and our rhetoric is entirely empty of practical meaning to their lives. This is perhaps the greatest challenge.
The increasingly popular and politically correct slogans such as community wildlife, "parks beyond parks", sustainable utilization and "If it pays it stays" are just as irrelevant to these same people, the masses. The vast majority of our species now live where all but they and a few human-dependent species remain. The rest have gone and gone for ever.
The threat to habitat and to communities of wild species is actually from a relatively small proportion of the total human population, be it considered globally or at the local level. Notwithstanding this, the consumptive trends are encouraging this small element to decimate natural habitats to produce the needs, or perceived needs, of the growing markets.
Conservation is a responsibility of leaders. Those of us who can afford to make policy, do so, on behalf of these who cannot. We do this in all realms of human affairs: public health, education taxation and so forth. Many actions of responsible government are not necessarily popular with the people but through civic education and other means, people do learn to accept regulation of their lives and activities in some form.
Popularity is not the aim in much of public policy - the public good is - although I have to admit that this is easier to talk about than to achieve.
Nonetheless, I personally believe that in the area of species protection, we should concern ourselves with what is right as opposed to what may be easier, or popular in the short term. We need, as leaders, to lead and to be accountable for our leadership.
It is bogus to believe that you can "buy" support over the long term.
Revenue sharing, decision sharing and similar well intended tactics will not be sustainable in those parts of the world where the general standard of living is declining and where there is a frightening increment to the cost of meeting basic human needs. The numbers of people on the planet are increasing, their needs are increasing, their expectations are increasing. The resource that we are concerned with, wildlife or nature, has finite limits. The estate available to wild species is in fact constantly decreasing under pressure from the other human activities and these are unstoppable.
CITES is an extremely important international organ and I do not have any regard for those who are claiming that it is or has been a protectionist club of western interests.
The original idea was to establish an international regulatory organ that would make certain that international trade did not threaten the survival of species. This is quite different from an organization that seeks to ensure that concerns for species survival should not endanger international trade! I fear that over the past decade there has been an attempt by some to change the mission of the organization.
This must be resisted and we should not be afraid to express ourselves on the importance of species survival. I do not feel guilty or uncomfortable when I am accused of being "on the side of wildlife." I care and so do millions of other people in every part of the world. We must be heard, we must stand tall and remember that a species lost is lost for all time. In the past few years I have changed the focus of my own activities and I am, as some of you perhaps have heard, now active in Kenya in the pro-democracy movement.
Kenyans, like other people in other countries, want to be fairly governed: they want accountability, justice and opportunity to better their own lives. The opponents of the movement for greater democracy, usually powerful incumbent government leaders who have no popular mandate, claim that democracy is a "western" or foreign concept.
They are wrong: fairness and justice, along with the rights of a people to question and change their leaders, were the norm in pre-colonial African nation states. These are foundations of democracy and they are universal.
I raise this because I am well aware that there are some vocal critics of CITES and other conservation groups who claim that attempting to protect and ensure survival of species is somehow neo-colonialist, foreign or worse still, western.
The term "bunny huggers" has been used to describe some of us who are concerned about the fate of wild species. To belittle our noble cause is the practice of the shallow, the insecure and the incompetents, be it in the realm of wildlife or liberty and justice. May I remind these same critics that before western or specifically Caucasian penetration of Africa or the Americas, conservation was widely practiced; species were not endangered and there was a tolerable balance between human populations and their environs. It went wrong when "western influences" reached these continents.
Preserving pasture, forests and species was very much a part of the culture and practice of many traditional societies. It is certainly not "Western" or "European" to appreciate nature; it is a human value that is expressed world wide.
This human value is of course conditioned by circumstances and a poor and hungry person with no prospects for a better life will see a patch of beautiful wilderness very differently from a well fed, affluent person who has the use of a four wheel drive vehicle to escape the rigors and routines of an affluent life.
In large measure attitudes will go along with real life issues and this must not be forgotten when we consider the claims and counter-claims by those who are charged with looking after wildlife, and who insist that they know what the stake-holders want. I am not sure that these so-called stake holders are in fact known or recognized - and I am certain they are seldom consulted.
I also believe that it is important to examine the quite ridiculous notion that is increasingly put about that everything is best seen as part of a complex economic equation. We are encouraged to believe that unless something can be given a dollar value, it is of little relevance to the modern age and the march towards Utopia.
I disagree and I am reminded of a recent editorial comment in the New Scientist where the observation was made that nature, like liberty, has no price tag. In the context of a CITES meeting, I think it would be right to remind the delegates that species which are the stuff of nature are priceless, as are human dignity and freedom. Government and inter government policies and actions should be based firmly on this premise, which is not negotiable.
It is in this regard that I would like to pay particular tribute to the Non Governmental Organization (NGO) movement. At a conference of this kind, t>
I would be surprised if a number of NGOs did not in fact have a far better grasp of what the "people" want than many of the well-paid, allowance-living, government representatives who are here for this CITES meeting.
I was at a CITES meeting some years ago on the government or official side and believe me, the discussions would have been a great deal better if the NGOs could have participated rather than simply being kept at the back of the room or outside altogether. One of the reasons that I accepted the invitation to speak here tonight was so that I could pay tribute to the NGOs and their role in bringing pressure on policy makers. Pressure must be maintained.
Before concluding these brief remarks, let me succumb to a temptation that I should probably resist: I want to talk about elephants and the issue of a split-listing or down listing. I am well aware that we are guests in Zimbabwe and that my remarks may not please some. Anyway I did not leave my mother's womb to please people.
I am entirely opposed to any resumption of any international trade in ivory now or at any time that can be presently predicted. The principle of an ivory trade I accept: the practice of the trade under present circumstances in both producer and consumer countries is untenable.
It is difficult to admit, especially if you are a government employee or political representative, that your own government has no prospect of being able to successfully supervise or police the trade in ivory. In spite of denials, we all know that this is the truth. I know of no country, where the integrity of the public service and the transparency of governance would give the necessary guarantees that illegal trading would not flourish if legal trade were resumed at this time.
We have all read and heard of the problems, not only here in Africa but also in the Far East. Japanese traders have openly admitted that it is not difficult to manipulate the system, even in Japan, and there are no guarantees that all imported ivory will be from legal stocks.
The critics of the Appendix I listing have any number of arguments and I do not wish to go over them all tonight.
There are, however, some things that I must say. The level of poaching did decline following the ban: it may not have stopped, but it was certainly a massive improvement. Illegal trade did continue, but the volume was substantially down and I believe most of the illegal movements were from those countries that now want to lift the ban.
The downlisting proponents claim that Africa's elephant population was not in fact as precarious as had been thought; if this is true and it may well be, let's be glad that the error was on the right side of the account! As Prince Bernhard once said at one occasion like this; where there is doubt, let wildlife be the beneficiary.
One final point to be made before I conclude these brief musings on our elephants is that the money to be made from trading ivory may be substantial for individuals, but it's a pittance for governments. Governments are supposedly there to serve the people and I believe that, if these governments want to serve their people well, they will stand firm and ensure that the ivory trade remains banned indefinitely.
[Section omitted]
To conclude, I support the concept of an international regulatory body such as CITES. It must do what no other organ of inter-government standing can do: provide legislative protection for endangered species. It must disregard the whines of endangered species traders and short-sighted conservationists.
The SSN and others, including our particular hosts this
evening, should press on with their good work. You cannot win all the battles
and you will not always be popular, but a good number of species, mammal,
insect, reptile, bird and fish, along with plants depend upon your efforts
and, on their behalf, I both commend you all and thank you. It is certainly
not "Western" or "european" to appreciate

This also the admissions officers who see them are seeking a person who has something to state will be helpful in selecting who they will admit into their software. You certainly are going to want to continue in your mind some of the basic mistakes which admissions officers make by personal statements, as you go through the procedure.
Without having preparing a framework for your private assertion, the mistake which you would like in order to avoid is producing an essay. You will want to construct a four or three paragraph statement, however you don’t want to overdo it. This doesn’t imply you will need touse four paragraphs because there is no right or wrong in regards to thisparticular.
You only have to be careful not to overwhelm your audience with too many generalities and many personal anecdotes. You don’t want to overpower them with an excessive amount of info if the information isn’t valuable. Nobody likes to see a record that has material that does not make sense.
The mistake which you would like in order to prevent is placing advice. It isn’t difficult to toss in something brief about your own life as well as your adventures. However this can divert from the significance of the announcement that you’re trying to assemble.
As an alternative, you should write some matters that are very important for you personally. In the event you possess had a tragic experience or have had a more tricky youth, then you want to be confident that these matters are included on your statement. These would be experiences and the moments that make you unique and impactful.
It’s a good concept to add some thing positive about yourself, if you have tried to ensure it is hard as you possibly can. This can give some comfort they may see some thing great to read. You really ought to take to, although this is not always possible.
In the end, the most ideal way to approach is always to begin slowdown. Don’t worry about how many paragraphs it needs to be what sort of story it takes to contain. Just get going with your statement till you are delighted by it and do not stop and edit.
One of the frequently made mistakes that admissions officers make with this course of action is currently thinking you need in order to complete a record immediately. Yesit is appealing to rush through this process however, you need to invest in own time. Your app may probably have passed around and it is not worth the risk to rush .
Another mistake you might desire to avoid is the fact that of requesting. You need to know what is valuable for your requirements, although They’ll inform you what’s essential . Why it is you are qualified for the application that you are applying to the aim of one’s invoice is really to express.
That which you want to accomplish is begin by composing opinions and some ideas on your own. This can help you produce a framework for your announcement. From that point, you want to add on your values and choices that are related with your institution.
Finally, when you’re reading over your personal declaration, pay attention. You do not want to shine over whatever. Your statement is intended to become a snapshot of that you are along with your thinking.
Bear in mind, the target of creating a personalized statement is always to help it become memorable and impactful. You might want to avoid making blunders that will drive your admission off course. In addition, you might desire to compose a summary of the others of one’s application therefore that the admissions officer knows what to start looking for when assessing your file.

/>Police in Lusaka, Zambia are holding a sergeant (pictured above) for allegedly shooting dead his wife following a heated quarrel which arose after he accused her of sleeping with a senior Zambia Army Commander.
The sergeant who has been identified as Justine Nkole,41, of house number LCA132S Army Applo camp in Lusaka west shot his wife Lines Tembo,39, in the chest and on the left lower ribs on Thursday, September 8th.
According to Police Spokesperson Rae Hamoonga, the murder case was reported at Bob Brooms police post by Sergeant Justine Nkole of house N0. LCA 132S Army Apollo camp in Lusaka West today around 10:50hrs.
It was reported that Sergeant Patrick Chewe aged 41 years shot his wife Lines Tembo aged 39 years in the chest and on the left lower ribs using an AK 47 rifle and two rounds were fired,'' Hamoonga disclosed.
The accused has been arrested and a fire arm was recovered whilst the body of the deceased has been taken to the University Teaching Hospital Mortuary," says Hamoonga.Economist Vesna Butigan waived the right to severance when she retired from the public enterprise Eronet Croatian Telecommunication in 2015. In exchange, management hired her daughter Mirjana, a professor of Croatian and English and literature. Thus, according to the management, they rejuvenated staff and saved money, without changing the number of employees.
Butigan is one of at least four employees who left Eronet in 2014 and 2015 to make room for their children, an investigation by the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIN) in Sarajevo found. During that time no one was hired in this public enterprise through a job ad.
The government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) allowed this. Over the past seven years, it formally tried bringing employment practices at public corporations into line. But, the FBiH Chief Auditors found they left room for irregular hiring and corruption.
Apart from staffers’ children, party officials also found senior places in state-owned enterprises.
“Public enterprises actually are the biggest arena for political parties to staff with their members and in that way they maintain their grassroots,” said Ivana Korajlić, acting director of Transparency International in BiH.
Hereditary Jobs
In 2007, Mirjana Butigan graduated from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Mostar. She worked as a lecturer and translator, as well as an office worker in a private firm. Meanwhile, she applied for government jobs but was unable to land one.
She tried to find work in HT Eronet as well, until her mother Vesna made room for her. Vesna Butigan retired early without severance, under the condition that her daughter got a job. “Under such circumstances, a person, how can I put it, makes do with what they have,” she said. “You know what the situation is like.”
Mirjana Butigan nowadays works in Eronet’s client support department. She told CIN that her job description includes translation and communication with clients in English.
HT Eronet hired at least three other employees through their parents in 2014 and 2015. Ivanka Kožul, a cook by profession, made room for her son Dario, an IT engineer, while lawyer Anka Grizelj secured a spot for her daughter Olivija Grizelj-Perić.
Grizelj-Perić was advisor to the FBiH Trade Minister Milorad Bahilj, then a director in the PC Roads of the Federation of BiH, until she arrived in Eronet.
The agreement with management was that children got a permanent position after their parents left the company and waived their right to severance. The FBiH Ministry of Traffic and Communication approved this.
None of these employees wanted to speak to CIN.
Eronet officials, starting with former director Stipe Prlić, see such hiring as a smart move. It saved money and brought in highly educated, young workers. Prlić acknowledged that this meant that other citizens were denied an opportunity to work in Eronet, but he said that every decision has advantages and disadvantages.
“No matter how it’s done, somebody would always be shortchanged,” said Prlić. “And I think in this way, it’s some sort of satisfaction – people have worked for 30 something years and their children got a start.”
There is enormous interest in jobs with Eronet — currently, its database contains 22,000 job applications.
BH Telecom also has not frowned at hiring the children of staffers. Recent Director General Mirsad Zaimović said that family members of deceased staffers got hired without a job ad.
“We wanted to be socially sensitive in this matter,” he explained.
Registry for Selection of Director
The public enterprises had no obligation to advertise job vacancies until November 2018 when a new Labor Law in the FBiH mandated that.
For years, the FBiH government failed to set up transparent hiring in public enterprises, according to Audit Office for the Institutions of the Federation BiH.
No government representative wanted to speak about this with CIN.
In a performance audit titled “Hiring Transparency in the FBiH Public Enterprises” that includes the two telecom operators, auditors concluded that all those interested did not have equal opportunities to get a job in public enterprises – and that managements had discretion to decide how to conduct recruiting procedures.
In past years, new employees arrived in BH Telecom also through an application registry. Even though during his term at the enterprise’s helm more than 20 people were hired in this way, Zaimović could not explain how the registry works.
“I might make a mistake when it comes to how the system is functioning,” said Zaimović, “So I would prefer not to take risks.”
From the register of applications, Mirza Drpljanin and Adis Halilović were hired as BH Telecom’s managers.
Their predecessors told CIN that they had to leave jobs for political reasons, after different parties came to power.
“It is perfectly normal that some other party comes in and nominates its own,” said Munir Ramić, former director of BH Telecom in Brčko.
He was succeeded by Drpljanin, who was the head of the Brčko District government’s Utility Department on a ticket of Alliance for Better Future (SBB).
Halilović was a long-time member of the Party of Democratic Action’s Main Board (SDA) and a former councilman in the Bosnia Podrinje Assembly. Soon after joining BH Telecom, this professor of defense and security studies was appointed head of the Goražde Division.
During the past administration cycle, BH Telecom’s management was made up of SBB and SDA members. The management appoints heads of divisions proposed by the director general. Despite that, former Director General Zaimović said that hiring is not connected to the politics.
“I certainly conducted far and wide consultations related to appointments of people that would head specific divisions,” he told CIN, but did not explain with whom he consulted, considering that Halilović and Drpljanin had not previously worked in Telecom.
The pair did not want to discuss how they landed jobs with BH Telecom.
HT Eronet’s officials said that they hire off their database of applications. HT Eronet’s Ivica Rotim, head of the Department for Managing Human Resources, said that all those interested in a job could have left their personal information via the company’s internet page. Rotim explained that they could not talk to all the candidates.
It was selling like hot cakes, he said, but he could not explain how they picked candidates from the database of applications.
Activists from Transparency International in BiH did not see this as an appropriate way to hire. They advocated amendments to the Labor Law that would mandate publishing of job ads. It took nearly two years, from the government’s draft to passage in the Parliament.
Korajlić said that public enterprises refused to advertise jobs for years so that they could continue with such practices as party and family hiring.
“They say: ‘Here we had some applications and we did it based on those,” Korajlić said. “And among those very applications were someone’s daughter or a son.”
Hiring Procedure Stalls, But Recruiting Continues
In 2011, the FBiH government passed a resolution that public companies must include in their charters the obligation to hire exclusively through job vacancies. However, seven years later when auditors asked about this, neither the ministry officials obliged to implement the new rules, nor public companies’ officials themselves knew about the resolution.
The government imposed a hiring moratorium, a halt to hiring anyone without government approval.
The Cabinet or the FBiH Ministry of Traffic and Communication’s approval was only pro-forma – they did not oversee who and how anyone was hired. Ministry officials say they that were not their responsibility and approval was only in order to keep track of the number of new hires. There also was no guarantee that their decisions would be implemented, because the moratorium was not binding.
“It simply means that whether we approve or not, they will do what they want,” said Ernest Đonko, aide for electronic communication and post offices to the FBiH Minister. “For them this is a cover that someone had approved it, so that the management could cover their work.”
He added that public companies found a basis in the law to not advertise jobs. “No matter how we thought of it as non-transparent, unrealistic, dishonest to others,” said Đonko. “That’s simply how it is.”
The government maintained the moratorium with occasional resolutions in which it spelled out how enterprises “must immediately abandon all vacancy procedures for hiring employees.” This did not limit other ways of hiring.
According to a CIN investigation, those other ways of hiring dominated recruiting in BH Telecom and HT Eronet.
Over four and a half years, BH Telecom hired 70 of 336 new staffers through job vacancies.
“I don’t agree with a conclusion that we have advertised very few jobs,“ said Zaimović.
HT Eronet refused to show CIN records about employees, job vacancies or the company’s charter, citing privacy concerns. But auditors have established that 100 persons were hired over the course of three years, all without job advertisements.
Eronet’s former director general Prlić told CIN why:
“We would place a job vacancy and for seven jobs 1,200-1,300 people applied. And this was simply impossible,” said Prlić. “Those procedures lasted so long, and always those who have not been hired thought that they were shortchanged. And then, since the law allowed for it, we went ahead with it.”Many businesses pour money into advertising for the simple reason that it works. What isn’t always so clear, however, is exactly how long it will take to work.
To use a topical analogy, advertising is, in a sense, like taking a COVID-19 vaccination. Much like your body can take some time to build up immunity to COVID-19 following vaccination, your company’s website might not start garnering a noticeable increase in conversions or sales until weeks after you started advertising.
However, this analogy falters in one important respect: there isn’t as much of a science to when advertising starts working. A raft of variables would come into play, such as what you are advertising and where.
What do you intend to advertise?
You might have previously approached marketing executives who tell you that results from advertising won’t start materialising for weeks or even months. However, while it’s true that you should give the advertising a certain amount of time to work, the required ramp-up time could be shorter than you expect.
If you will be marketing a high-end service costing tens of thousands of pounds, your advertising will struggle to spur many purchases in the near future. This is because the service on offer would hardly constitute an impulse buy; many people would have to think long and hard about paying the asking price.
However, if you run a restaurant and will be promoting an exciting new addition to the menu, your advertising is likely to work more quickly – as choosing to eat out is very much a spur-of-the-moment thing.
Disentangling the advertising from other factors
Even if you do see an uptick in revenue, though, how are you supposed to reliably discern that your advertising was responsible for it? The task would be easier were you to sell through an online store, which would allow you to see the initial – if any – fruits of your advertising labours in just a few days.
If you don’t yet offer any of your products or services through an online store, we can establish an ecommerce site for you, providing you with its “skeleton” in the form of essential webpages.
If you don’t see results quickly, will they appear at all?
Most online advertising campaigns will reap some kind of return within a week. Nonetheless, once you have launched a campaign, it would be a good rule of thumb to wait two weeks. If the campaign still doesn’t seem to bear fruit, consider spending a little more on it.
Once you start seeing a meaningful effect and appear to have struck upon a winning formula, stick with it until it stops working. When that does happen, the advertising platform’s algorithm could be at fault, or your target audience could simply be suffering ad fatigue, where they tire of seeing the same ad repeatedly.
On the whole, though, it’s unlikely that you would have to face a multiple-month wait just for results from online advertising. We can implement PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising to help you get results sooner.Young Coconut Agar-agar

She gets it.
A New Zealand writer perfectly captures the fear and frustration bike riders feel, where we’re blamed and threatened just for being on the road.
Or maybe on the planet.
Discrimination based on stereotypes and assumptions is unacceptable, whether it’s racism, sexism or speciesism. Hatred of bike riders is another -ism, and there’s no justification for it. It’s bullying. It incites drivers to harm or intimidate people on bikes. Whether it’s a shock jock on talk back or The Daily Blog, hating on bike riders is dangerous and can endanger peoples’ lives.
When you ride a bike, it’s like you have a target painted on your back. Every day, when I get on my bike, for fun, fitness and transport, I become a target for people who suddenly irrationally hate me– because maybe they saw someone on a bike who ran a red light once, or something. But I don’t suddenly turn into a bad person on my bike – to the contrary, I’m very happy!- I’m just someone trying to do my bit for the planet, who wants to get home alive…
It’s not rational to hate cyclists even though it seems to be a national sport, whether you’re a driver or not. So give us a break. Car drivers don’t actually own the road. People on bikes aren’t some foreign species undeserving of the right to life. We’re mums and dads, brothers, sisters, uncles and aunties. We’re loved, and we love life. But every time you hate on us, condemn us for riding, you risk us staying alive.

A New York state legislator calls for requiring helmets, operator’s licenses and registration plates for every bike and scooter rider in the state, regardless of age — because he nearly killed a bike rider “who came out of nowhere” while he was driving.

And maybe he’d be better off paying more attention to the road, because no one ever comes out of nowhere.

Comesa Trade Agreement
At the end of 2016, the implementation of the TFTA was preceded by unresolved issues, including customs offers, rules of origin, trade agents and dispute resolution. The U.S. government says the recent drop in copper prices serves as a timely warning to Zambia to diversify its economy. U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Eric Shultz said a serious effort was needed to reallocate the economy to agriculture, tourism and electricity generation. When he spoke at the eighth U.S.-U.S. Advisory Trade Meeting, Ambassador Shultz also called for the… Comesa has a free trade area with 19 member states and launched a customs union in 2009. A customs union that could be defined as a merger of two or more customs territories into a single customs territory, in which tariffs and other trade measures will be largely removed from all trade between the merged territories. For their part, the territories apply the same obligations and measures in their dealings with third parties. To prepare a customs union, Egypt adopted, at the eleventh session of the Council of Ministers in Cairo, a roadmap out of programmes and activities that were needed before the Union was set up. The launch is expected to be achieved by 2008.
In October 2008, the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community agreed to negotiate a tripartite free trade agreement between regional economic communities. After lengthy negotiations, the tripartite free trade agreement was officially launched in June 2015. Although 17 of the 26 Member States have signed the tripartite free trade agreement, it has not yet entered into force due to pending ratifications. In addition, the remaining technical work on customs liberalization, rules of origin and remedial measures is also delaying the process. However, interim agreements have been reached for the implementation of the tripartite free trade agreement, which would make it Africa`s largest free trade agreement. It was also estimated that the tripartite free trade agreement could boost intra-regional trade by up to one-third. [2] It is therefore important that the remaining Member States join the Free Trade Agreement and do not jeopardise the implementation of the tripartite free trade agreement. In 2008, comesA approved an expanded free trade area comprising members of two other African trading blocs, the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

The name CNC Marine was derived from our goal to maximise the use of CNC technology in the design and construction of our boats.
In general engineering terms, CNC stands for Computer Numeric Control. This technology is widely used in a diverse range of industries. Simply put, computer code is used to control machines such as lathes, milling machines and cutters. The use of computer code to control machines minimizes the impact of human error, hence increasing accuracy and efficiency. For complex tasks it can also dramatically reduce labor costs.
Using this technology in boat building improves accuracy, reduces labor costs and minimizes material wastage. The result is that we can offer our kits at a competitive price without compromising quality.
WHAT WE DO?
We offer industry leading
boat designs & kits

Essentially guaranteing a final product that will rival if not exceed any recreational or comercial vessel out there, based on performance, handling and safety.
Peter also offers commercial marine design and Naval Architecture services through our sister company, Direct Marine Solutions (). The same care and expertise is applied to each design whether it be for CNC marine and recreational market, or through Direct Marine Solutions for the commercial sector.

We’ll work with you at the start of your adventure to disscuss the pro’s and cons of different boats. What are you looking to use it for, what is your budget, where are you going to build it.

Manuele Pepe Solo Con TeLawmakers alter bill that would benefit venture capitalists
Madison— The Legislature's budget committee voted unanimously Wednesday to rule out a loophole that could have allowed private investors to walk away with $1.40 in tax credits for every $1 they invested in certain Wisconsin companies.
Lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee voted to make clear that private investors should not be able to profit from millions of dollars in income tax breaks generated by a taxpayer investment in the state's venture capital program. A new analysis by the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office had found that there was a risk that venture capitalists could have racked up tax credits that substantially exceeded the amount of money that they kicked into the program.
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that $6.3 million in tax credits could have flowed to private partners in the venture capital program. Those tax breaks, however, would have been generated by a $25 million investment of taxpayer money in the program, not by the venture capitalists' own investment.
The budget committee Wednesday amended a venture capital bill, SB 404, to make clear that only private investments in the venture capital program could generate those tax credits.
GOP lawmakers Wednesday stressed that they had never intended, either with the current bill or the original passage of the venture capital program in 2013, to create this loophole.
"That was an error in drafting. That was never the intent," Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), the lead sponsor of the bill and the co-chairwoman of the budget panel.
Rep. Dean Knudson (R-Hudson) was among those critical of the loophole, saying the public needs to be vigilant about state investments aimed at creating jobs.
"We need to be watching what goes on with these programs to make sure that what was intended is what actually happens," Knudson said.
The venture capital program aims to boost the state's economy by combining money from taxpayers and wealthy investors and funneling that cash into a fund of funds, which then makes investments in individual venture capital funds. Those venture capital funds will in turn invest the money in emerging Wisconsin companies that show promise of great future growth.
The proposal approved by the budget panel Wednesday dealt with the venture capital program and a separate state income tax credit of 25% for investments in qualifying early stage companies in Wisconsin.
In other work, the budget panel unanimously approved plans to address some of the $57.8 million in excess spending racked up last year by eight programs, including a massive back-office computer project and state institutions for the mentally ill and disabled.
The fiscal bureau released figures on the overcharges, which are similar to those faced by the state in past years and which don't represent a shortfall in the state's overall budget. Not including these latest overcharges, the state's main account is expected to finish its two-year budget with about $135 million in cash in the summer of 2017.
Also Wednesday, the budget committee unanimously approved $15.6 million to upgrade the computer systems and other facilities at the Mendota Mental Health Institute in Madison and Winnebago Mental Health Institute near Oshkosh.
The committee also approved a series of wide-ranging bills that would:
■Make changes to Family Care, the state's long-term care program for the elderly and disabled outside of nursing homes. The proposal, SB687, would allow the regional care management organizations that run Family Care to operate outside of their current geographic areas and to compete with one another in these areas if that is approved by state officials.
■Provide $250,000 in the 2016-'17 academic year to state schools for high school robotics teams. The bill is SB583.
■Foster nonprofit partnership groups around key industry clusters in Wisconsin. This bill, SB526, would cost the state roughly $1 million over the next two years.
■Cut by $7 million a year, or roughly 7%, a program that helps utility customers save on their energy bills. The bill is AB804.
The Focus on Energy program is funded by utility customers and provides incentives for businesses and consumers to save on their energy bills through discounts on energy-saving lights and appliances. Since Walker took office in 2011, he and the GOP-controlled Legislature have taken previous steps to limit Focus on Energy funding.
Auditors have given the program good marks, saying it saves customers $3 for every $1 they spend.
The legislation also reduces state regulation of sulfur dioxide pollution from utility plants and other large sources.

Join The DiscussionAmerican journalist Danny Fenster has been freed from prison in Myanmar, according to a Myanmar military official and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who had been on a private humanitarian visit to the country.
Fenster’s release comes just days after the former managing editor of Frontier Myanmar — an independent news outlet that covered current affairs, business and politics — was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a military court in Myanmar.
Myanmar’s military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told CNN Business that the journalist “has been released and deported. We will release details why he was released later.”
According to a statement released by Richardson on Monday, Fenster will be making his way back to the United States “through Qatar, over the next day and a half.”
A former US ambassador to the United Nations, Richardson said he had conducted face-to-face negotiations with Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of Myanmar’s military junta.
Fenster’s family said they were “overjoyed” at his release.
“We cannot wait to hold him in our arms,’ they said in a statement. ” We are tremendously grateful to all the people who have helped secure his release, especially Ambassador Richardson, as well as our friends and the public who have expressed their support and stood by our sides as we endured these long and difficult months.”
Fenster, a 37-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, was arrested at Yangon International Airport on May 24 while he was trying to leave the country to visit his family in the United States. He had been denied bail and was held in Insein Prison in Yangon. On Friday, he was found guilty of three charges brought against him by the Myanmar military, which seized control of the country in a coup on February 1.
Those charges included visa breaches, unlawful association with an illegal group and incitement under section 505a of Myanmar’s Penal Code, which makes it a crime to publish or circulate comments that “cause fear” or spread “false news.”
Sonny Swe, Publisher, CEO and co-founder of Frontier Myanmar, Fenster’s former employer in Myanmar, told CNN Business on the phone that Fenster was already on a plane having left Insein prison earlier in the day.
“I’m very, very pleased to hear about the news. Not only our happiness, I’ve been there before, I know how Danny and the family will be feeling right now,” Swe said. “From this point onwards, it’s all positive. He deserves to be reunited with his family.”
Fenster was one of about 126 journalists or media workers detained since the coup, according to the UN. About 47 remain behind bars.

Lind stressed that to be found guilty, Manning would have to be shown beyond reasonable doubt to have knowingly dealt with an enemy of the US. The crime could not be inadvertently or accidentally committed, she said.
Her ruling opens the door to the appearance of "John Doe" as a prosecution witness. He is an unnamed member of the team that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in Pakistan in 2011, and is presumed to be an existing or former member of the US Navy Seals.
The court has heard that the witness found three items of digital media at Bin Laden's compound which he removed. Later analysis revealed that the items contained WikiLeaks material that had been requested directly by the al-Qaida leader for his perusal, the prosecution will seek to prove.
The conditions under which that witness will give evidence have yet to be finalised by the judge. The defense department and the CIA have demanded absolute anonymity for the individual, to the extent that he will appear in disguise in a closed session of the court at a secret location and with no media or public present.
But Manning's defence lawyers are protesting about the restrictions on cross-examination and discovery, arguing that they cannot properly represent their client if they are withheld access to the witness.
The question of how to handle classified information during the trial continues to exercise Lind and both sets of lawyers. Paradoxically, though most of the classified material that will be referred to in testimony is now in the public domain courtesy of WikiLeaks, it is still considered a US state secret and any mention of it has to be redacted or discussed in closed court.
Early next month the judge has ordered a two-day "dry run" of a sample witness who will testify and submit to cross-examination in a private session. The purpose of the experiment will be to see whether there are alternatives to holding all sensitive testimony behind closed doors, the judge said.
The issue of courtroom security also came up when Lind issued a stern warning to the media and the public benches at the start of the hearing. She made clear her displeasure at the recent unauthorised recording of Manning's personal statement to the court that was published on the internet.
The recording was a violation of court martial rules, Lind said. "I have not ordered people in the media operation center to be screened for recording devices, and I hope I will not haveBefore you go for a Mandarin Translation, you need to get in touch with a reliable agency.

Casino Days Review
Casino Days is one of the most trustworthy gambling websites in India. Casino Days offers super-fast and secure payments, a dedicated support team that’s ready to help 24x7, and a fairly decent range of online casino games.
You can play virtual or live casino games on Casino Days without any worry since the website offers a super-secure interface and is completely legal in India.
We wanted to dive deep and provide you with an extensive and detailed review, so as to help you make an informed decision. Here is our honest and unbiased opinion on Casino Days.
What We Like About Casino Days ✔️
👍🏼 A great assortment of online casino games.
Casino Days boasts over 2000 casino games, both virtual and live. You can find some of the best online slots and live card games on this website. We love the variety that Casino Days offers when it comes to online casino games.
👍🏼 A wide selection of payment methods.
It is not easy for Indian players to deposit or withdraw money from most online casinos but Casino Days makes it as seamless and smooth a process as possible.
There is a huge selection of payment options available (including UPI and Paytm) and all of them are payment methods that Indians widely use.
👍🏼 Super-fast payouts.
Casino Days advertises super-fast payouts, boasting lightning-fast withdrawals. And it is true. You won’t have to wait weeks to get paid when you play on Casino Days. Withdrawals are processed in a matter of days.
👍🏼 A knowledgeable and dedicated customer support team.
The Casino Days Customer Support is always available and ready to assist. They are super helpful and easy to contact, available via both chat and email.
👍🏼 A user-friendly website that’s easy to navigate.
Casino Days is designed for a clutter-free experience, with a simple, minimalist design and easy navigation.
There is no chance that a new user will get overwhelmed so Casino Days makes for a great starter casino for new players.
👍🏼 A fairly decent welcome bonus.
Casino Days gives its fresh customers a generous welcome bonus of 100% (up to 20,000 INR). In other words, you can play with double the money when you add funds to your Casino Days account for the first time, as long as the amount is 20,000 INR or less.
What We Don’t Like About Casino Days ✖️
👎🏼 No "free-to-play" casino games offered.
Unlike most online casinos nowadays, Casino Days does not provide users with “free-to-play” games.
This is a significant negative as new casino players who may sometimes want to try playing a game without wagering any real money, just to get the hang of things, will not be able to do so on Casino Days.
👎🏼 Games are not sorted on the basis of their type.
This makes it slightly difficult to find casino games. The casino games on Casino Days are sorted into categories such as “newest” or “most popular” but this does not tell us what type of games that list has.
Users who know what they want to play can search for specific games in the search bar.
👎🏼 No-frills design, bordering on a bit too simplistic.
Some casino players prefer flashy-looking websites that reverberate the vibe of real “brick and mortar” casinos. To such users, Casino Days would hardly seem interesting and they might find the website’s design way too minimalistic and boring.
👎🏼 No loyalty program for customers.
Casino Days does not have a loyalty program or something akin to a club membership for its regular customers.
Sure, they treat all their users like VIPs, but the thrill of getting extra special rewards because you’re a part of a loyalty program is absent.
Casino Days India - Our Verdict
As you can see from our review above, the pros far outweigh the cons for Casino Days.
Casino Days is a secure and trustworthy online casino that offers a wide range of games, both virtual and live.
The sign-up process couldn’t be any simpler and the website is fairly easy to navigate as well. Casino Days supports an impressive variety of deposit and withdrawal options to make payments as fast and seamless as possible for the average Indian player.
The Casino Days welcome bonus is quite good as per industry standards. They offer customers a 100% deposit bonus when funds are added for the very first time.
Casino Days also gives regular cashback to existing customers. Players can additionally earn big wins through weekly tournaments that Casino Days hosts.
Overall, Casino Days is a modern, minimalistic, well-equipped casino that all kinds of casino players can enjoy, no matter their experience and expertise in the area.
We recommend our readers give Casino Days a try for a fun-filled experience.

The list of candidates that will appear on the May 8 primary ballot for governor is officially set. But that list does come with a surprise.
Another Democrat is out of the gubernatorial race.
Jon Heavey, a doctor from Cleveland, did not collect enough valid signatures to get on the ballot, though he had filed a financial statement giving himself a campaign loan of $1.5 million. Heavey says he’s confident his campaign did collect enough signatures and he plans to work with state official to still get on the ballot.
That means people voting on the Democratic ballot have six candidates to choose from; Rich Cordray, Larry Ealy, Dennis Kucinich, Bill O’Neill, Paul Ray, and Joe Schiavoni.
The Republican ticket remains unchanged after all the signatures were counted – Mike DeWine will square off against Mary Taylor.
And Constance Gadell-Newton is the sole Green Party candidate.Easy Drone is a cool new Kickstarter project with two interesting innovations: a "FlyBot" module that contains all the electronics (APM and FPV gear) and can be moved to other frames, and a simple and robust frame design:
Here's more from the Kickstarter listing:.
Easy as...
- camera power
KEY FEATURES
1. Unique lightweight frame - It's self-supporting™ carbon frame is a proprietary design never before utilized on quadcopters. It makes transportation and assembly a breeze while providing incredible strength.
2. One compact command unit - Easy Drone's command unit (Fly Bot) has all the features you need built in and no wires! It's a true plug-and-fly solution.
3. Use one Fly Bot with multiple frames - Pre-programmed, tuned settings for any combination of motors and blades. Just wirelessly load new settings and it will be optimized for your new build.
Example: I like to use larger props and slower motors for the gimbal and faster ones for FPV flying.
4. Auto tuning for any configuration - with a flip of a switch you can make the Easy Drone determine it's own best settings, no manual tuning necessary.
5. Six flying modes - EasyDrone can be flown in any one of the six flying modes with a flip of the switch.
6. Telemetry module built in - Connect to your computer or tablet to wirelessly change settings or set path points.
7. Video stream is not an option - it comes standard - Feel free to turn it off, but it is built in to every FlyBot so you can plug in any camera feed and see the live stream on the ground.
8. Camera battery never runs out - Power the camera in flight while transmitting video from it. Uses the main battery for power.
9. Important flight data on your video screen - See altitude, speed, battery status and dozens of other data points superimposed on your preview video.
The Easy Drone story
I made my first robot when I was 10 by combining parts from several RC toys my parents bought me. Since then I have been fascinated with remotely controlled machines where flying RC robots make the ultimate feat.
Idea development
It has been six months from the first napkin sketch to first functional prototype. Another few months of testing and tuning followed.
I have tried many existing aerial videography solutions, but couldn't find one that was modular, easily customizable and had necessary features built in to it. Easy Dronewas developed to offer a modular solution for professional videographers and a fresh approach to drone design.
How is it better?
What you need from your aircraft for filming aerial video:
- ease of transportation and deployment
- flexibility in terms of lift power (different cameras) and maneuverability
- certain features (like wireless video) built-in, not added-on
- and you certainly DON'T want to deal with wires
Easy Drone is a modular multirotor drone that pushes the envelope when it comes to customization for different flying needs because one control unit can be used with any frame (combination of motors and props).
This allows you to go from a fast flyer to a slower, heavy lift by just plugging the control unit (Fly Bot) onto a different frame.
What has been done so far:
- Created 9 iterations of working prototypes
- Speed controllers/Motors/Battery combination performance testing
- Selected flight controller system
- Video link selection and testing
- On-Screen-Display module selection and testing
- Radio telemetry module
- Tune hardware and software
- Program radio controller
- Finalize production design
- Develop assembly capability
What we are planning to do (pending successful campaign)
- Expand our current shop o handle demand
- Secure alternative sources and vendors
- Order parts and components
- Marketing materials (instructions, packaging, etc.)
- Produce training videos and post on our website
Production timeline for 2014
The Goal :: Why KickStarter?
Our goal is to make the Easy Drone a standard piece of equipment for photographers and videographers who like to shoot aerial videos. To make this a reality we need your support to set up mass production and get Easy Drones into the hands of you early adopters. We are confident that your experience will be our best recommendation.
Technical specs
There are two different frames that we offer at this time - L and XL. See their specs below. We will be coming out with many more different frames because with the Easy Drone there is an infinite number of combinations.
- Assembled weight (without camera) - 2.5lb (L) or 3lb (XL)
- Maneuverable camera weight - 1lb (L) or 1.5lb (XL)
- Autopilot - APM 2.6
- External GPS + Compass
- Telemetry freq. - 433 MHz
- Video link freq. - 5.8 GHz
- Radio freq. - 2.4 GHz
- On-Screen-Display: MinimOSD Rev. 1.1
- Battery monitor/power regulator
- Power - 3S LiPo 11.1V battery
- Remote - 12V LiFe battery
Flight times:
- All features on (camera power, gimbal power, video link on) - approx. 12 minutes
- Gimbal on - approx. 14 minutes
- No additional equipment - approx. 16 minutes
Flying time greatly depends on the battery, the amount of wind, style of flying and load so it's hard to say precisely what you'll get out of it. The above are some averages we have encountered so far. We are actively looking for the optimal battery/motor/prop combination to extend flying time.

Shyam, thanks for the compliment - I'm glad you like my project.
About the price though, it's true that between KickStarter fees and Amazon payment costs you kind of need to add extra 8-10% when forming the price. However if you added up the cost of all the parts that go into the Easy Drone you would find that it actually costs as much as the sum of components.
Here is just a few key parts - APM 2.6 + GPS/Compass module + 5.8GHz Video link + Telemetry Module + OSD board + Remote + Motors and Batteries + Custom parts, frame and hardware...
Very nice, although the price could be reduced on Kickstarter. They factor in the price for their invention on all pledge request costs.
One advantage of the APM is that it is a 5 volt system that works with CHDK without modification.
Hey, Illia - good question.
When I started working on the easy drone Pixhawk was still in beta. However, I am going to revisit the design if the campaign is successful. It would be great to ship the Easy Drone out with the latest and best autopilot from 3DR.
Cheers,
I wonder why he implements APM 2.6 instead of Pixhawk? The price difference is not that high, but the performance varies significantly.
Thanks Gary, I'm glad you like it!
Very nice design a study in KISS and looks really sturdy.
Nice project from this part of the globe :)Jammu: The women wing of Jammu and Kashmir National Conference staged a protest rally here on Monday against the rising prices of essential items and deterioration of law and order situation in the Union Territory.
Vice president of women wing and former MLA Bimla Luthra led the protest rally from the National Conference headquarters to Mandir chowk in Residency Road area of the city.
The participants were carrying placards against price rise and also raised anti-BJP slogans throughout their journey before dispersing off peacefully.
“The rising prices is the major concern of the people, particularly women folk who are finding it very difficult to run their kitchens. The backbone of the common man has virtually been broken by the failure of the government to contain the rising prices of daily use items, including vegetables and pulses,” Luthra told reporters. Referring to the killing of a policeman by terrorists in Srinagar on Sunday evening, the NC leader said the law and order situation in the Union Territory has deteriorated.
She also castigated the BJP for the growing unemployment in Jammu and Kashmir and said all the promises made to the people have proved “hoax”.
“The BJP led government has miserably failed to mitigate the problems of the people and maintain law and order in Jammu and Kashmir,” Luthra said.

Thanks for the post-conference info. re: the Google for Education conference. What’s your best advice for finding out about events like this before they happen? Google certainly doesn’t send out invitations to its end-users…
Your notes (#1 & #2) were identical to mine! I wasn’t able to watch live, but I’m now catching up on all the recorded sessions.Living in the shadow of the majestic Rocky Mountains is just one of the many perks of residing in Aspen. But for one couple, it was a surrounding grove of the area’s namesake trees and a site along Roaring Fork River that served as the main attraction. Because the existing house was bigger than current zoning restrictions allow on the same property, renovation was more attractive than demolition and new construction. But its rustic log cabin-like interior and warren of disconnected spaces begged for a transformation.
To begin, the owners hired husband-and-wife architects John Rowland and Sarah Broughton, who coincidentally had been friends with the previous owners and often discussed renovation possibilities. Recently returned from a tour of Switzerland, where they were inspired by the VitraHaus building designed by renowned architects Herzog & de Meuron, the duo resolved to streamline the structure’s traditional gables for a cleaner look on the exterior, while opening the interior with interconnected spaces and substantially more glass.
“We said let’s just strip this down and celebrate the honesty and purity of the iconic gable form,” Rowland recalls. “It was like taking out a scalpel to cut out things unnecessary and then adding in a few items.” On the ground floor, the existing timber columns felt the knife, while each gable end was stretched and filled with glass to take advantage of views in multiple directions.
At the entry, a previously enclosed stairway was replaced by an open wood-and-steel double-height version that gives way to the living room and kitchen separated by a double-sided granite fireplace. “It’s the most thought-out room in the house,” the husband says about the kitchen—a sleek new black-and-silver culinary center where the owners love to cook and entertain.
Particularly striking is the home’s reclaimed wood. Previously used for fencing along Montana highways, it now clads the entire exterior before continuing inside. “We were after a specific color range,” explains builder Briston Peterson about the wood’s perfect silver-gray tone. “And one of the beauties of the material is that because of a rainscreen barrier behind the wall, it requires absolutely no maintenance.”
The wood works in tandem with crisp white walls interspersed with pops of color coming not only from the homeowners’ extensive art collection, but also from choices such as a bold red living room rug selected by the architects, who also served as designers on the project. Overall, the duo opted for a mix of modern Italian and handmade furnishings such as the leather Berman Rosetti chairs in the living room and the dining room’s custom walnut table. “We wanted to express a contrasting depth of color and texture,” says Broughton.
Upstairs, the existing master bathroom made way for a fourth bedroom, and the architects created yet another gabled volume to accommodate a new master bath and walk-in closet. At the owners’ request the bathing area is situated in the trees, and their luxurious suite includes an oval Japanese soaking tub. “I love looking out through the big glass window at the aspens and all the motion that happens when the wind blows,” the husband says.
With so many spaces open to the outdoors, when it came to landscaping, the intent was to direct views to the grove and riverside meadow by enhancing what was already there. “It’s a large lot, but part of what we needed to do was include careful placement of new trees to help screen out views of the neighboring homes,” explains landscape architect Sheri Sanzone, who worked alongside associate Christine Shine to introduce a series of plants including silvery lupine, goldenrod and double pink peonies that bloom throughout the year.
Despite a program that originally emphasized just a little bit of fine-tuning, the overall effect was one of transformation. “We look at the before-and-after photos sometimes and we don’t even know how it got from beginning to end,” the husband says. “It was a blast of a project to execute, but it’s even better to live in.”Eurovision 2019: First meeting between EBU and Israeli broadcaster IPBC
Representatives from the EBU reference group for Eurovision have been in Israel earlier this week to discuss the organization of Eurovision Song Contest 2019 with representatives from the Israeli TV channel KAN (IPBC)
The first meeting between European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and Israeli Public Broadcating Corporation (IPBC) took place in Israel earlier this week.
– Like every year, at this early stage after the previous Song Contest, the preliminary scope and the next steps are discussed and mutually clarified. EBU is pleased to announce an open and positive dialogue with KAN, and looks forward to meeting the team at the EBU offices in Geneva next month, says EBU to German eurovision.de.
Security issues with Israel hosting Eurovision
The German site eurovision.de has earlier asked Executive Supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest, Jon Ola Sand, whether there had been a debate in EBU on Israel as host country of Eurovision Song Contest 2019 because of the war-like clashes on the Israeli border with the Palestinian Gaza Strip.
Jon Ola Sand answered:
– Each year, the competent authorities sign an agreement with the EBU to ensure that a number of important expectations are met, including the safety of all who attend the Eurovision Song Contest. For 20 years, the Eurovision Song Contest has taken place in 17 different countries, including Israel, with some of them facing specific challenges.
There has been stories out that EBU is considering to exclude Israel as host country because of the militant clashes. There was no direct answer in the response from EBU about the issue:
– The EBU will be discussing with KAN next month. Decisions about the host city, venue and dates for Eurovision Song Contest 2019 will be made in due course.
EBU concerned
The Israeli newspaper Maariv has reported that EBU has stated that they are concerned that countries will withdraw from next years contest if Jerusalem is selected as the host city of Eurovision 2019, citing a meeting between the IPBC and EBU.
EBU is also concerned over the politicization of Eurovision Song Contest 2019 according to Israeli Haaretz. The ministers Miri Regev and Ayoub Kara has been making remarks about hosting and producing the contest in Jerusalem. A source in KAN told Haaretz that EBU "did not care" for the remarks made by the ministers.
EBU encouraged fans not to book flights yet, until the dates and location of the contest are officially announced.brinker gift card check balance

Maya Umemoto Gorman [Instagram, Website]
In a sea of bold colors and dynamic poses, Maya captures the most stunning and visually enchanting portraits. When I first discovered her work, I couldn’t stop thinking “NO ONE poses people the way this girl does.” Using her knowledge of the body as an experienced dancer, she choreographs her models in such beautifully unique ways from backwards crab-walks to a face full of screaming intensity. You will be left in awe of the energy and personality she is able to bring out through her images.
A superb example of her movement forward poses, Maya captured this image while working on a project exploring the relationships between sisters. Shooting in her own living room (can you believe that!) Maya shot this with her Mamiya RZ67. The color choices of the green background contrasts perfectly with the classic styling of the white tanktop and faded jeans. I love the built up energy I can feel in their poses, linked together arm in arm while leaning forward with intention, as if they are a spring loaded with intention about to bounce into a dance move.
Ashlee Tough [Instagram, YouTube]
Come with me and fall down a technicolor rabbit hole in Ashlee Tough’s work. Equal parts madness of the Willy Wonka tunnel scene and the high glamour of Marilyn Monroe, Ashlee’s photos are like none other I’ve seen. Ashlee is a one-two punch, not only photographing but also styling all her own photoshoots. Often collaborating with her friend and makeup artist Amelia Hart on her stylized projects, I can hardly think of a better artistic pairing (Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat anyone?). The delicious excessiveness of her images is often a portrayal of her own self, wearing her personality on her photographic sleeve.
Shockingly electric, the image above had me swooning the minute I laid eyes on it. Ashlee frequently creates projects inspired by specific outfits and this one was no different. Dressed in an art piece of special sentimentality, Ashlee captured her model with her Mamiya RB67 and Kodak Portra 800 film. Hoping to capture a mix of pink marshmallow fairy, 90’s nostalgia, and a sprinkle of kawaii vibes, I just cannot look away from this image. I love the beautifully bold paring of vibrant pink and yellow along with the added textures of the iridescent flourishes with the sequins and rhinestone makeup. Pure perfection from start to finish.
Amanda Breese [Instagram]
Changing it up from the first three portrait photographers on this list, Amanda primarily photographs candid life moments and explorations, self described as a “hodge podge fromage.” And that is what makes her photos so damn impressive. They’re not posed or planned out; they are moments shot on the fly and still composed and framed perfectly. Whether it’s a dog hanging out a window or someone in the middle of grinding down a car part. Shooting primarily on a Hasselblad 500cm, Amanda frequently captures classic, vintage cars that she happens across on her photowalks. Drawn to them as a means of taking a step back in time, it is especially appropriate that she photographs these iconic automobiles on a period accurate camera.
The image above is one of her most stunning images in my humble opinion and I knew immediately upon laying eyes on it that it was the one I needed to feature. Shot with her right hand camera the Hasselblad loaded with Kodak Portra 400, Amanda captured this impromptu photo while out on a grocery run with her partner. Can you imagine! Like, no way could I create such a masterpiece while on a run to get eggs and milk. Making this photo even more meaningful, this photo was from the very first roll she ever developed at home. I’ve done home development before and I never got results like this on the first try. Amanda is one of those rare talents, the types that almost seem born with this innate ability. Looking at this photo, you could tell me it’s a still shot from a dramatic scene in a gangster movie and I would 100% believe you. She has completely nailed the position of the car with the wonderful leading lines of the overpasses and the mysterious headlines and the reflection on the pavement that make you wonder, “where are they going?”
Isabelle Baldwin [Instagram, YouTube]
Based out of Austin, Isabelle documents her journeys throughout the small towns and landscapes in the state of Texas and the greater Southwest area. With wide horizons as far as the eye can see and quaint little forgotten buildings, her love and passion for her area pours out of her images. In stark contrast to the harshly hot climate Texas is known for, Belle’s images are a melting pot of delicate colors and smooth lighting. The soft side of Texas she captures is one that I myself, a true midwestern girl, could really long to visit. I know it’s become ‘de rigueuer’ to hate on the popularity of Kodak Portra 400, but her photos will make you remember why the film stock is so beloved in the first place. She makes the film stock sing in every frame whether she’s shooting a classic Coca Cola sign or a dusty desert view.
Taken at El Cosmico in Marfa, Texas, Isabelle captured this photo while visiting the West Texas art hub in October 2020. During her visit the campground was quiet and peaceful, feeling like they had the whole place to themselves. Waking up to this view every morning, this image is a great reminder for her of this wonderful moment of peace within a year of turmoil and unpredictability. And that is absolutely what stands out for me too when looking at this photo. I love how calm and still it is with the glow of the morning sun shining through the window. A perfect moment in time for us all to enjoy.

Love the colors.Renting out space in your salon or barbershop isn’t something you should do lightly, but it can be an easy way to get a secure income and make sure you aren’t leaving dollars on the table with an empty chair. Letting an experienced and qualified stylist rent your space can be a great way for new salons to attract more clients and can even help the other stylists in your salon.
Salon leasing is a win-win scenario if you have a good rental agreement and know what to look for in potential stylists.
Before you can rent your booth to stylists, you need to know what to include in your rental and what you control when you’re working with them. There are a lot of details that can go into your booth commercial lease template, or you can choose to go with a slimmer less restrictive agreement.
There are some basic things that pretty much every stylist is going to need in a rental agreement, so don’t be surprised if you don’t get a lot of offers if you’re missing any of these things.
All three of these things can be customized to some extent, but you’ll need to include these items to have a functional booth rental contract. You’ll also need to decide whether you’re paying taxes for the whole salon or if the stylist will be responsible for real estate taxes on the rented booth. The last basic thing you’ll need to think about is product sales. If you’re already selling products as a salon, then you might not want a stylist using your space to also offer their own product lines.
Like any lease agreement, it’s important to have all the details about how the space can be used worked out before you sign. For instance, you don’t want a stylist renting a booth to offer cuts and color at prices that undercut your rates and the rates of your other stylists. You can require set prices, or allow the stylist to set their own, but you may want to include their rates in the contract and negotiate any changes. You can ask for stylists to collect their own payments or you can collect client payments yourself. If you collect payments for them, you’ll need to make sure you’re keeping track of their earnings and paying out the full amount. Some salons and barber shops will also offer receptionist services to independent stylists renting space in the salon. It’s up to you whether you want to include receptionist services or software, but it is one way to make your booth more attractive.
Renting out a booth is very different from hiring a stylist as an employee, and there are some serious pros and cons you should consider before you decide if booth rental is right for you.
One of the biggest advantages of booth renting as a salon owner is that booth renting guarantees that you’ll have a certain amount of income every month. However, chances are you won’t be making as much money from a successful stylist renting space as you would if they were an employee because most stylists won’t rent unless it offers a financial advantage over traditional employment. So, while you’re taking on less financial risk by renting, you’re also lowering your profit margins on a successful and talented stylist.
Renting a booth comes with the advantage of being able to keep more of your earnings. Most salon employees only make about 50% of what they charge per service, while you’ll be able to keep 100% of your earnings after paying rent. That can be a huge advantage, but it also comes with greater responsibility. You’ll need to work to build your business and maintain your station appropriately and will still be responsible for following salon rules and business hours like a regular employee.
Step 1: Prepare the Booth
The first thing you need to do is make sure everything in the booth is in good working condition. You’ll need to thoroughly clean all of your equipment, check its effectiveness, and take pictures to show potential tenants.
Step 2: List the Booth
The next step is listing the booth on any local job boards, salon leasing and stylist websites, or social media sites in your area.
Step 3: Interview and Vet Potential Tenants
Once you have people applying for the rental space, it’s still important to make sure you’re checking a few more boxes. Potential tenants should fill out a standard job application so you can see their work history. A good work history is a great way to make sure the stylist can afford your space. You’ll also want to conduct a background check to make sure they don’t have any criminal convictions that could make it more difficult for them to build their client list. Lastly, you’ll want to make sure the stylist is licensed in your state. You can be held partially liable for an unlicensed stylist working in your salon, so you need to know not only that they are licensed, but that the license is current and valid in your state.
Step 4: Signing and Move-In
Once you have a tenant selected, it’s time to go over all the paperwork and sign the agreement. The stylist will likely want to negotiate parts of the agreement, so it’s a good idea to have some idea of what you’re willing to negotiate and what you won’t change for a good stylist. You’ll also want to clean the booth one more time before moving the stylist in, that way they’ll be able to get to work as soon as possible and start making back some of the money they’ve paid for the booth rental.
Step 1: Personal Information
Both the lessor and the lessee will need to fill in their personal information, including their full legal names, their current addresses, and the date of the agreement.
Step 2: Salon Premises and Service, and Retail Agreements
Next, the new landlord will need to define the space of the rental, including the address of the salon, any identifying information about the booth, the amount of space included, and any accessories, furniture, or additional tools included in the rental. Sink, laundry, and chair arrangements are all included in this section.
Step 3: Terms of Agreement and Rental Date
This section will cover whether the stylist will be able to access salon software and other services, whether the stylist will be able to set their own prices or needs to follow the pricing schedule set by the salon, and what kinds of services the stylist is allowed to offer. The next area will cover the effective date of the rental, or when the stylist is allowed to move in their stuff and start booking clients into the new space.
Step 4: Rent, Fees, Hours, and Security Deposit
This information is usually spread over several sections, one each for the exact amount of rent and the day it’s due each month, one for the hours of the salon and any other business limitations, and one for the security deposit. Usually, the security deposit goes toward covering damage above and beyond usual wear and tear to the booth, furniture, tools and accessories, and surrounding area within the salon. If there are any additional fees for water or electrical use or the use of other equipment in the salon, those fees will also be covered in the fees section.
Step 5: Personalization and Maintenance
Personalization is often limited in booth rental, but it’s important to allow at least a little personalization and room for your stylists to store tools and products in and around their booth. This section will cover what is and is not allowed. Maintenance covers the cleaning and any additional maintenance required by the salon. It does not need to cover everything the stylist intends to do, only the bare minimum required by the owner.
Step 6: Insurance and Liability Information
The final section details the kind of insurance the stylist is required to carry, as well as what insurance they currently have. Usually, the amount of insurance is dictated by the salon, but the stylist is free to choose their own provider. Several additional agreements and liability clauses also must be included in the agreement, and which are not open for negotiation or modification by the salon owner or stylist. These clauses all come at the end, but it’s important to read them all to understand both parties’ responsibilities.
Step 7: Other Terms and Signatures
Once the rest of the contract is negotiated and finalized, it’s time to sign the agreement. Both the lessor and lessee need to sign and date. This document isn’t required to be notarized, but it will need to be kept filed and available as proof that the stylist is an independent contractor, not an employee. At a minimum, both signatory parties should have a copy.Since I starting posting on Instagram and TikTok about skincare, I’ve noticed that videos about retinol always get the most comments. People seem to have a hell of a lot of questions about topical vitamin A skincare products. So I’ve tried to answer all the retinol FAQs for you below, including the difference between retinol and retinoids.
What is retinol?
Retinol is a topical form of vitamin A — this means it is a type of vitamin A formulated to be applied to the skin, rather than ingested. There are many names for topical vitamin A — retinol, granactive retinoid, retin-A, retinol ester. Not only do they vary in efficacy and strength, but some are only available with a prescription from a GP or dermatologist. More on this below.
What does retinol do?
Retinol speeds up the rate of skin cell turnover. This is something that continually slows down after the age of 25, contributing to the appearance of ageing and dull skin. By speeding up the skin cell turnover, the skin will function much like it did when you were younger and so the appearance of ageing will be reduced.
As a result of this process, scars will be reduced as the skin turns over and creates fresh skin cells and hyperpigmentation will also be reduced as the melanocytes causing the discolouration will shed faster and new cells, with the normal pigmentation of your skin, will take their place.
READ ME: Is bakuchiol better than retinol?
What does retinol do for acne?
Spots and acne are all caused by build-ups in hair follicles or pores that lead to inflammation. By speeding up the skin cell turnover with retinol, you force the skin through this process at a faster rate, therefore speeding up the healing of spots and decreasing the number of breakouts as blockages become less likely or resolve much faster.

SHOP RETINOL
Does retinol work?
Absolutely — there is extensive research into different types of retinol, and it is commonly prescribed by dermatologists for acne or scars and pigmentation, and recommended by aestheticians and skincare specialists for anti-ageing endeavours.
Prescription-strength retinol, such as tretinoin or differin gel, will be more effective but will also come with more side effects (explained below).
How to use retinol
Retinol is a fantastic skincare ingredient, but it can dry out the skin and cause a lot of sensitivity, so it must be used in a very specific way (unless otherwise specified by a dermatologist).
When you begin using retinol you should start with a low percentage (as little as 0.01 if you can find it, but 0.1 will be fine too). Always use it in the evening, applied to dry skin, and avoid using other actives in the same routine (e.g. vitamin C and AHAs).
At first, use it once or twice a week because your skin will need to adjust. After a few weeks, if you’re not experiencing sensitive or flaky skin, then you can increase the frequency and go to three nights a week. A few weeks later go to four nights a week, and so on and so forth. You can continue this process until your skin is able to tolerate it every night — however, if you want to use AHAs (such as glycolic acid), it’s good practice to use retinol and AHA on alternate nights. You will see benefits from retinol by using it every other day — daily use is not necessary.
When you have reached the frequency you would like, and are experiencing no issues with sensitivity, you can increase the percentage of retinol in your product, e.g. 0.1% to 0.2%. When you increase the potency of retinol you need to begin the process all over again and go back to only using it one or two nights a week.
If you don’t follow this process you can experience a lot of sensitivity, irritation and even inflammation. You risk damaging your skin barrier which will allow bacteria to breed on your skin and cause breakouts. Sometimes you will even find your skin scabs over — this is often referred to as ‘retinol burn’.
If you find yourself unable to increase the amount you’re using it, because sensitivity continues, then you can apply moisturiser and then a retinol after your skin has completely absorbed the product. After your retinol, apply moisturiser again. By sandwiching the retinol with moisture, you’re protecting your skin from drying out and becoming irritated — and you will still see the same benefits from retinol.

Are retinoids and retinol the same?
Technically, retinoid is an umbrella term for all types of topical vitamin A, but when people use the word ‘retinoid’ they are most likely referring to retinoic acid (also called retin-A). This is the most potent form of vitamin A that has a powerful effect on the skin, but also will have the biggest risk of causing sensitivity and irritation.
After retinoic acid is retinaldehyde, then retinol, and finally retinol esters (aka retinyl esters) — each one is less potent than the last, with less intense side effects. These three tend to be available over the counter.
While retinoic acid is a very pure form of vitamin A, the others have to convert into retinoic acid on the skin, going up the chain illustrated below — so retinol esters have to convert up the chain three times to become retinoic acid to be effective on the skin.
What is granactive retinoid?
This is where things get confusing. Granactive retinoid is an ester, but it is not a retinol ester. Unlike the others, it doesn’t have to convert into retinoic acid; therefore, it is a retinoic acid ester. This means it is very effective however, unusually, the side effects are much less.
Granactive retinoid is a very new ingredient, and it does not have the same amount of research into it as the others, but it is readily available in skincare and many users report benefits to their skin with far fewer side effects.
If you want to get nerdy about it, granactive retinoid is actually made from an ingredient called hydroxypinacolone retinoate (HPR). It is a soluble version of HPR, which sort of means watered down. So, a 2% granactive retinoid actually contains 0.2% of HPR.
If you’d like to try a granactive retinoid product you can look for granactive retinoid or hydroxypinacolone retinoate in the ingredients of a product.

Is retinol safe?
Retinol is not safe to use while pregnant. For everyone else, retinol is safe but if you have a skin condition (e.g. psoriasis, eczema, rosacea) then you should consult a specialist.
As long as you follow the instructions above or those of your dermatologist, it is a safe ingredient. When a product says it can be used morning and evening, or every day, this should be disregarded. Remember that brands benefit from you using products more than you need to — the quicker you run out, the sooner you’ll have to buy more.
How to treat retinol burn
The most important thing to do when you have retinol burn is to stop using retinol and any other active ingredients (vitamin C, AHAs, BHAs, enzymes) until your skin is healed. The second most important thing to do is wear a high SPF and reapply frequently throughout the day to prevent the retinol burn causing long term damage, such as hyperpigmentation.
At first, I would strip your skincare back to the bare essentials: face wash, moisturiser and SPF. After a few days, you can start to add in hydrating or nourishing serums.
When to start using retinol
This is highly debated in the skincare world. When I was in my mid-20s, before I studied skincare, I was told by several aestheticians not to use it until I was in my 30s. But with a frown line already forming this was bad advice. As a rule of thumb, start using retinol when you start seeing signs of ageing or from the age of 25 if you want to be one step ahead.
If you intend to use retinol to treat blackheads, spots or acne then you can use it at absolutely any age!
How long does retinol take to work?
This will vary from person to person and product to product. It can be anything from three to six months depending on the strength and formulation. However you may start to notice changes in as little as four weeks — if you have acne-prone skin you may find things get worse before they get better as the retinol forces spots developing under the skin to the surface — this is known as purging.
Can retinol cause dry eyes?
People are often wary to apply retinol around the eyes, and with good reason. The skin around the eyes is thinner and therefore at a higher risk of irritation than the rest of your face — however, this also means ageing often appears first around the eyes so they definitely need treating.
I don’t usually recommend eye creams, but retinol eye creams tend to be formulated with a lower percentage to suit thin skin around the eye. If you don’t want to buy an extra product, I would recommend lightly applying moisturiser around your eyes before retinol to try to prevent dryness and irritation.
SHOP RETINOL EYE PRODUCTS
What not to use with retinol
Yet again, this is highly debated! If you’re fairly new to skincare I would recommend using dedicated chemical exfoliating products, such as glycolic or lactic acid toners, just once or twice a week.
If you’ve been at the skincare game for a while and your skin is more accustomed to active ingredients, you will be able to work up to using retinol and AHAs on alternate nights.
If you’re skincare veteran, you can try using them on the same night but go slow and be wary that this will heighten the risk of irritation.
Anyone using retinol should always, no matter what, be using a high SPF (30-50) frequently throughout the day to protect your skin.
It’s always best to used vitamin C, which is also drying, in the morning as it helps protect your skin throughout the day and retinol is best used in the evening.
Retinol myths
As our skin ages, it gets thinner, but with long-term use of retinol skin will actually thicken — anyone who tells you retinol ‘thins the skin’ is misinformed.
People often believe that retinol increases photosensitivity — which means it makes your skin is more sensitive to sunlight. Again, this is untrue. However, because you’ve sped up cell turnover you have a lot of baby skin cells that do require protection so you must always use a good SPF as the last step in your morning routine.

What is the highest amount of retinol in a product-available) and how can you tell the amount in a product how is it shown)
Author
I think the SkinCeuticals 1% is one of the strongest over-the-counter retinol products. However, there are different types of retinol that are available at different strengths — some OTC and some prescription. Unless a brand labels the percentage, it can be very difficult to tell — even when they do, the formulation will impact how effective it is. As a rule, try and follow the percentage. Sorry if this is more confusing, it is a complicated question!Why Human Challenge Trials Will Be Necessary to Get a Coronavirus Vaccine
." because it was extremely difficult, bordering on impossible, to trial an Ebola vaccine. The problem? Ebola is so deadly that people take precautionary measures long before a vaccine can be tested.
Vaccines are intended to prevent disease in healthy people, so they’re tested for efficacy in healthy populations. But to test a vaccine, you need a population of still-healthy people who might get sick. An Ebola vaccine was eventually approved only because in 2014, in the midst of an Ebola outbreak, trials were started in Guinea. Even in these cases, however, there wasn’t enough time nor a large enough population to run a randomized, clinical trial—so an adaptive, ring vaccination trial was designed. The vaccine proved successful, at least under some statistical assumptions, and the vaccine was approved, but because the trial was not a pure randomized trial, the results remain controversial.
When a COVID-19 vaccine is available, it will be necessary to find a large population of people who are still at high risk of contracting COVID-19. This may be difficult. In developing countries, which may not be able to contain the virus, herd immunity may have developed. In richer countries, social distancing, testing and other measures may have made the probability of infection relatively low. China, for example, has tested a vaccine in primates. But China no longer has enough COVID-19 cases to test a vaccine in China. An Oxford group has started clinical trials in humans but if their vaccine isn’t very effective, they may need much larger samples to detect an effect. A natural group to consider for a vaccine trial would be health care.
There is a second, related problem. Historically, most vaccine candidates fail. Thus, in a year or two, we want many vaccine candidates, not just one. But even if we are fortunate and have, say, seven vaccine candidates available, it probably won’t be possible to run efficacy trials on all seven candidates. The efficacy trial bottleneck may reduce us to three or fewer candidates, but then we are gambling because none of the trials may prove successful.
The efficacy-trial bottleneck motivates the use of challenge trials. In a challenge trial, healthy individuals are split into two groups, one half vaccinated, the other not, and then both groups are infected or “challenged” with the virus. No waiting for natural infections here. (Some healthy people also need to be infected prior to the trial to determine the appropriate dose of virus to match or not exceed the natural infection.) have been used many times in the past, including with Edward Jenner’s first cowpox vaccine for smallpox in 1796, but many people consider them a last-resort because of the ethical issues inherent in exposing healthy people to disease.
The risks to the challenged, however, can be minimized along several dimensions. First, COVID-19 mortality rates are much lower for healthy individuals under the age of forty, so volunteers would be carefully selected and closely monitored. For those individuals who contracted COVID-19, treatment could begin even before symptoms fully manifest by using an endpoint of viral load (particles). Volunteers could also be drawn from health care workers whose probability of contracting the disease at some point is already relatively high, thus minimizing the opportunity cost of the risk. We can also hope that by the time a candidate vaccine is ready for trial, there will be effective drugs and treatment regimes, again reducing the risk to the volunteers. It’s also important to remember that an ordinary vaccine trial is not without risk—a vaccine could backfire and make the disease worse—so exposing fifty or so volunteers to the virus in a challenge trial must be balanced against exposing thousands to a potentially dangerous vaccine in an ordinary clinical trial..

Land’escapes is a private organization, working to protect and conserve land in south-central Ontario and provide a place for people to connect with nature through low-impact recreation.
The Park
The Park is over 26,000 acres on the Canadian shield amongst the lakes and forests of south-central Ontario.
Opening for the first time in the Summer of 2021, we are accepting applications for Founding Memberships. Help us explore and establish The Park.
Stewardship Program
The stewardship program is available to commercial partners and individual outdoor enthusiasts.

Conservation
The land that we have acquired was previously used for industrial timber harvests. We are committed to restoring the property and allowing the ecological systems found within it to rebound and thrive.
Canada has set targets to protect 30% of land and water by the year 2030. We are actively trying to help Canada work towards the 30 by 2030 goal. In partnership with the Nature Conservancy of Canada, we aim to put 100% of our land holdings under mechanisms that would ensure they are protected forever.
We are working directly with NCC to establish a conservation management plan that would inform our activities on the property.
Connection
We want to ensure that people have access to these lands in order to develop meaningful connections with nature. The evidence showing that time spent outdoors contributes to happiness and wellbeing is overwhelming. Therefore, we believe that connection to nature also helps establish long term respect and a drive to protect the environments we feel connected to.
Enhancing geographic connections is also a priority for Land’escapes. By connecting protected areas and waterways, wildlife corridors are formed and habitats expand and improve. Our properties are part of the Algonquin to Adirondack corridor as well as the Kawartha Natural Heritage System.
Community
We aim to cultivate a community of stewards and partners to realize our vision. Therefore, we are seeking partnerships with indigenous communities that can inform our conservation management plan and advise on ideal scenarios for access.
If you are interested in what we are doing or would like to work with us, we are eager to hear from you!

Long before today there have been aboriginal peoples who have been the stewards of this place. In particular, we acknowledge that the land on which we operate is the traditional territory of the Wendat, Anishnaabeg, Mississauga and Algonquin Peoples and is covered by the Williams Treaty, Treaty 27 of 1819 and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishnaabeg People.

Blackjack Buddies mixes the best parts of the classic card game with a crossword game board. It is a completely new way to play the game of blackjack, head-to-head against your friends in iMessage.
iMessage as a gaming platform provides an amazing opportunity for all developers to reach a massive existing audience and provide players with games that have social interaction at the very core of their design. Playing with friends or family has never been easier and more accessible to such a big player base. Blackjack Buddies is based on a classic card game familiar all around the world, so everyone has knowledge of the basic ruleset of combining cards to make a 21, but the crosswords twist extends the depth of gameplay to make it a game that takes time and practice to master. Each player has a 5-card hand and the ability to swap cards each turn, in search of the perfect blackjack. Players need to plan carefully to hit combos vertically and horizontally to score more points. Building a 21 with more cards or with all the same suit will earn players extra points.
The introduction of games as part of messaging applications will greatly advance the “messaging games” genre, where games need to be designed from the ground up to suit this style of play. “We designed Blackjack Buddies from the very start with asynchronous gameplay in mind. Fundamental to the success of this genre is making each turn a mini-game in itself. Giving players a set of fun choices and the ability to impact the other player.” said Antti Hattara, Game Designer of Blackjack Buddies.
Blackjack Buddies will be available globally as a free download in the App Store and App Store for iMessage on December 22, 2016. The game is compatible for devices on iOS10.0 or above."LeadHERship was the fit I needed because continuing the way I was going was not healthy.

1) It has actually been a lengthy time due to the fact that I saw you (at the hotel).
I saw you at some (distant) allude in the past.
2) It has actually been a long time due to the fact that I used to visit friend (at the hotel).
In the previous I visted you on a consistent basis, maybe when a week. At some (distant) point in the past, I broke with the habit.
3) It has been a long time since I have visited girlfriend (at the hotel).
I visisted you at part (distant) suggest in the past. Ns probably have actually visted you an ext than once, yet that doesn"t average it to be a habit.
So, yes, 2) and also 3) might have a comparable meaning, however 2) really draws attention to the fact that the visiting was happening ~ above a regular, habitual basis, and it is the habit that stopped a long time ago.
Just for illustration, let"s look at a various example.
Suppose I offered to live in city A, however I have actually now relocated to one more place. When I stayed in city A, i visted a particular restaurant once. Also, i was a continuous at a bar (I was there almost every day). There was a cinema too. Ns went there a couple of times, however I"m no great fan the the cinema.
Now, after part years, I can say:
It"s been a lengthy time since I visted the restaurant. It to be a really an exckatifund.orgent experience though, maybe I have to go earlier there some day.
It"s to be a lengthy time because I provided to regular that bar. Nowadays I just drink alone, in ~ home...

People living in Selangor are the kind of people who would want a peace and harmony environment to start building their lives. They would want to avoid traffic, noise, and cities full of toxic pollutions. Not saying that living in Kuala Lumpur serves no benefits, but sometimes people rather not take the risk. A strategic place would be a place with obvious advantages and considerable problems. That is why most people around Malaysia would likely choose to stay in Selangor, even when they are working in Kuala Lumpur. Apart from the toxic pollutions and heavy traffics, Kuala Lumpur is also known for its expensive cost of living.
One of the things is retail stores. Usually, you can find retail stores just 10 minutes of walking or driving from your house. If you are staying in an apartment, you can get this by going down to the lobby. Some of the retail stores’ examples are convenience stores, grocery supermarkets, food, and beverage store, and clothing stores. How these stores make the housing area strategic is you can just move around only in your housing area to buy the essentials without having to go out to the mall. For instance, people in Setiawangsa are provided with a lot of malls and known grocery supermarkets like Rosyam Mart, but because of their heavy traffics, unfinished constructions, and center of attention in Setiawangsa. People tend to get frustrated for finding just one parking space, and when they could not find it, they have to go through it all over again. They usually end up not buying anything, and go to another place. Compared to Shah Alam, where people love to come for affordable food, and less traffics. If you are looking for one, they have a house for sale in Shah Alam. Not to forget, knowing how dangerous it is to be somewhere with strangers and not knowing their travel history in this global pandemic lockdowns. The government specifically asks us to stay home. Thus, these stores help us in providing and keeping us safe at home.
Education facilities like college, schools, and nursery give more reputation to the housing area. People with families are looking for a short-distance school so their kids can walk back and forth to school. Not only that, but the Selangor environment is also known for its safe and friendly environment compared to Kuala Lumpur’s. Therefore, parents would not have to worry about their children’s safety while they are somewhere else working. Kajang has some good schools and a safe environment neighborhood for people. Their friendly neighbors also are very considerate and trustful. Therefore, I do not think anyone would regret if they ever choose to build their life in Kajang.
Last but not least is the facilities. Facilities are like transportations, the gym, playground, swimming pool, recreational park, parking spaces, and driveways. Most housing areas are provided with all of these. But not everywhere these facilities are maintained. Some are destructed by the people themselves. Some are given with limited parking spaces. Thus, all the cars had to double-park each other and sometimes create more traffics. I know Mutiara Damansara house for rent, their facilities are clean, well-treated, and safe.

Sack corrupt state officers or resign, civil society tells Uhuru
The civil society led by the KHRC has challenged President Uhuru to sack state and public officers adversely mentioned in corruption scandals or resign from office.
The commission argued that the president was in full knowledge that most of those implicated in corruption scandals that have rocked the country are senior officials within his government.
The KHRC said a significant number of these officials, were in the executive and by this virtue, the president had the powers to relieve them off their duties without reference to any authority.
Hypocritical
“It is extremely hypocritical for the president to blame other organs of the State of promoting corruption while he has failed to take decisive action against publicly known senior state officers whom he hired and has the power to fire,” the letter signed by KHRC, Transparency International, Inter-Religious Council of Kenya and several other civil society groups read in part.
The groups said they were deeply alarmed by the worrying escalation of mega corruption scandals currently rocking the country with no action being taken on the known perpetrators.
They termed the recent declaration by Uhuru during the recent anti-corruption summit that his office had done all it could to fight the vice and that the failure to stem graft was due to inaction by independent offices was indeed an admission of failure on the part of the presidency.

It’s up to you![googlefont=Acme][googlefont=Sedgwick Ave Display][googlefont=Philosopher]The nine men who were charged with drug trafficking following the narco-plane landing on January 29 are now out on bail. A bail hearing took place virtually on Friday before Justice Antoinette Moore. With the Crown Counsel Romy Wade not objecting to the bail application by attorneys Dickie Bradley and Leeroy Banner the men were each granted a twenty-thousand-dollar bail. Conditions of the bail forced the men to surrender their travel documents, and restricts them from leaving the country without the court’s permission. The men are also expected to check in at the respective police stations each week until the matter has been concluded. The men, namely, Tyrell Talbert, Byron Claire, Steve Rowland, Garrett Banner, Fitzgerald Claire, Marlon Reyes, Edward Reneau and Dwight McFadzean were charged jointly for possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply. They were also charged for breaching curfew. The men had pleaded not guilty at their arraignment on February 1 in the Orange Walk Magistrate’s Court. They had appeared before Senior Magistrate Merlene Moody, and are to reappear in court on April 6. As for the 26 bales of cocaine found in the January 29 operations, those went up in smoke on Friday. The drugs were transported from Belize City to the designated site for destruction, and were thrown into a bonfire. Prior to being destroyed each packet of drugs was tested using drops of the Scott’s Reagent Modified. The drops would then cause the drug to turn blue if the product was genuinely cocaine. Overseeing the entire destruction was the Commander of Operations Assistant Commissioner of Police Marco Vidal. Vidal, in speaking with the media, explained that there was an urgency to destroy the drugs.
Marco Vidal, Assistant Commissioner of Police: “Whenever the drugs are found you have Scenes of Crime go on the scene and they gather the evidence. In addition to that the drugs are photographed and everything and that is taken before the court and then you guys are here to witness that it is the drugs that are being destroyed and the evidence that the Scenes of Crime take goes before the court to convict these people. As you’re aware where the drugs were found is very close to the border where we have this major problem with drugs and further to that the earlier we can get the drugs, the order for the drugs to be destroyed it is destroyed.. Everything is being followed by a process like for example we went to the court this morning, get the order and immediately we launched the rem oval from the place where it was custodied and then brought here and we destroy it.”
As we have noted, among those arrested in this case, are two Police officers. Vidal told the media that the top brass of the Police are aware that there are some criminal elements within the force, and that they will remain quick to take action against anyone found breaking the laws.
Marco Vidal, Assistant Commissioner of Police: “That’s why the Commissioner had said that it is deplorable, it saddens the department but we know that this exists. This exists in all security agencies so our job is to gather the intelligence and get them in the act because anything other than that they will say it is just speculation. You have genuine police officers then you have those who are engaged in these kinds of activities so for the police to go after these persons it’s applauded because we need to go after these persons. As I mentioned earlier there are others we just need to be exposed and then captured.”
Also witnessing Friday’s drug destruction were a Senior Magistrate, a Justice of the Peace, and members of the media. By one o’clock in the afternoon all 26 bales had been destroyed.Tripadvisor,
best known for online travel reviews, has struggled to get the most out of its hundreds of millions of users.
That may soon change. The company launched a new travel subscription service, Tripadvisor Plus, which offers discounted hotel rates and other perks. It could rekindle interest in what has also been online travel.
Reserve assets
(ticker: BKNG) and
Expedia Group
(EXPE).
Tripadvisor (TRIP) shares, now around $ 36, look cheap, having dropped from a high of $ 65 in March and trading at half their level five years ago.
“The core business is north of where the stock is, and Tripadvisor Plus offers an option on the upside,” said Naved Khan, analyst at Truist Securities. Khan is pricing the stock at a buy with a target price of $ 65. He rates the main activity at $ 50 per share and says Tripadvisor Plus is worth $ 15 per share.
Tripadvisor has reduced its reliance on hotel search revenue, where the Google unit of
Alphabet
(GOOGL) dominates and focuses on its “experiments” activity. This leverages its online travel reviews and generates commission revenue when consumers use the Tripadvisor site to book vacation activities such as museum tours, boat tours, and helicopter tours.
“This is a fragmented market that calls for a strong aggregator,” says Richard Clarke, an analyst at Bernstein who has an outperformance rating and a target price of $ 58 for the stock. He notes that about 75% of vacation activities are still booked in person or over the phone.
Tripadvisor Plus, on the other hand, could offer a big advantage. Wall Street gives it little credit amid uncertainty over hotel membership. The $ 99 per year subscription service offers members discounts on hotel rooms, experiences, and other perks. It aims to provide members with hotel and other savings averaging $ 350 per stay.
Tripadvisor has high hopes for the service. CEO Stephen Kaufer spoke on the May first quarter earnings conference call of the potential to attract “tens of millions of subscribers and a multi-billion dollar recurring revenue stream.”
Even a fraction of that would be significant, given that Tripadvisor generated $ 1.6 billion in pre-pandemic revenue in 2019. Analysts predict revenue of around $ 900 million this year and $ 1.3 billion. in 2022.
Truist’s Khan conservatively assumes that Tripadvisor can reach 3.3 million subscribers in five years. A bullish sign is that a small European online travel site,
eDreams Odigeo
(EDR Spain), has attracted one million subscribers to its subscription service.
The challenge is to convince the big hotel chains. Hotels have sought to maintain rate parity nationwide, meaning that the rates displayed on Booking and Expedia, the two major online booking sites, and the hotel’s website should be the same or similar.
Tripadvisor’s argument is that hotels can save the estimated 15-20% commission they pay to Booking and Expedia and deliver those savings directly to Tripadvisor Plus subscribers. Discounted rates would only be available to Tripadvisor Plus members. Hotels would get more detailed information about customers to remarket to them information they don’t get from sites like Expedia.
Three smaller chains, Barcelo, Millennium and Pestana from Portugal, with a total of nearly 500 properties, have agreed to offer rooms on the service. “These are small steps, but it shows that decent hotel groups are ready to play ball,” says Clarke of Bernstein. “It’s not Marriott or Hyatt, but it’s going in the right direction.”
Large chain rooms are available on the service, but they are likely from wholesalers. On Tripadvisor Plus, Barron found deals from mostly independent hotel companies for hotel stays in New York and San Francisco this summer.

Ashim Mehra, manager of the Baron Atlas fund, is optimistic about Tripadvisor Plus. He is also encouraged by the presence on the board of directors of Greg O’Hara, founder of Certares Management, whom he considers to be one of the most savvy investors in the travel industry. Certares investments include
Hertz Global Holdings
(HTZZ), as well as Tripadvisor.
Mehra notes that Tripadvisor generated more than $ 400 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, in 2019. According to him, $ 600 million in Ebitda is possible by 2022 or 2023, on the base of more than $ 200 million annualized cost. savings since the pandemic. It could be worth at least $ 6 billion in value at a multiple of 10, or about $ 45 per share, he says.
If Tripadvisor can attract 10 million subscribers to its subscription service, that would generate around $ 1 billion in revenue and $ 500 million in free cash flow, Mehra said. This could be worth $ 10 billion, for a total of around $ 16 billion, which could put the Tripadvisor stock above $ 100.
“The risk / reward ratio with Tripadvisor is compelling,” he says. Indeed, investors can book one of the best travel turnaround stories.

Although we consider GitLab to be our preferred git hosting service (where private repos were already free), we do make use of GitHub when collaborating with clients on their code hosted there. As our clients typically use private repos, we likewise maintain a paid account so we can fork their code into a private repo. GitHub just recently announced that their free plan now supports private repos. So if you have a paid GitHub account mainly for that capability, should you downgrade? What will you be giving up?
According to GitHub’s pricing page, if you downgrade from Team (what GitHub calls their lowest paid tier) to free, this is what you’ll give up:
- required reviewers
- code owners
- 3000 down to 2000 actions minutes/month
- 2 GB down to 0.5 GB package storage
As the meaning of those are not necessarily obvious, I’ll elaborate on what they mean. But first, a big benefit you usually get with a paid plan is technical support provided by employees, yet the Team plan doesn’t explicitly say that. The free plan says you get “community support.” I’m assuming the paid plan includes company provided support.
required reviewers
On their pricing page under “Protected branches” they explain:
Enforce restrictions on how code branches are merged, including requiring reviews by selected collaborators, or allowing only specific contributors to work on a particular branch.
code owners
Their explanation of code owners:
Automatically request reviews – or require approval – by selected contributors when changes are made to sections of code that they own.
actions minutes/month
The “actions minutes/month” thing apparently applies to automation jobs, including continuous integration (CI):
Get execution minutes for hosted runners to automate your software development workflows. Write tasks and combine them to build, test, and deploy any code project on GitHub. Minutes are free for public repositories.
package storage
The storage, which seemed on the low side, applies only to built packages, not the repo:
Host your own software packages or use them as dependencies in other projects. Both private and public hosting available. Packages are free for public repositories.
other differences
Additionally the detailed plan comparison chart says that draft pull requests, multiple pull request assignees, scheduled reminders (periodic reminders that there are open pull requests), and automatic code review assignment are all available only for public repos under the free plan, and are included in the paid plan.
price reductions
Before you consider downgrading to save some money, also be aware that GitHub has dropped the price of their Team plan by a bit. It used to be $5/user, with a minimum of 5 users. Now:
The GitHub Team plan will now cost only $4 per seat with no minimum seat requirement.
downgrade?
For us, none of the features we’d lose by switching to the free plan would be missed. However, we’ve opted to stick with the paid service because:
- if you’re using GitHub as part of your business, then it is worth paying for support;
- if GitHub failed to protect the privacy of your client’s code, you probably have a stronger legal footing if you are on a paid plan.

Nigeria is set to witness another triumph of modernization ten days from now. The world is changing and any nation that wishes to be on the global map of relevance economically must be flexible enough to adjust to the change. That is why one needs to laud the initiative of the Central Bank of Nigeria as it prepares to be one of the foremost countries in the world to have its digital currency.
And according to the apex bank, the e-naira which is set to be launched in less than two weeks will become a legal tender that will be equal in value as the naira. This means it must be accepted as a form of payment by every citizen of the country. But beyond this declaration, some people have questioned the benefit of the e-naira and that is why this article will highlight some of those benefits to expect when the currency becomes operative in few days;
Image credit: premiumtimesng.com
First of all, having an e-naira wallet will save everyone the risk of losing money to armed robbers in the course of doing transactions, and since it is going to be our fiat currency just like naira, there will be no need for anyone to carry huge cash around for transactions. And just like naira, the liability of e-naira will be the so responsibility of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
Not that only, unlike the other cryptocurrencies that are not regulated, this e-naira will be regulated by the government through the central bank, and the fear of fluctuations in its value will be abated.
Image credit: punchng.com
Further from that, it will also save the government from spending fortunes in printing currencies every year, it is a known fact that a huge amount is spent annually to print naira notes, but with the advent of this digital currency, that will be reduced to the bare minimum and the money being used in printing naira notes can be diverted to other developmental projects.
In addition to that, e-naira will also preserve the value of our currency that is presently on a free fall. The gap between naira and dollar will be bridged especially between the official and the parallel rates since one will be able to carry out transactions with e-naira instead of using dollars.
Image credit vanguardngr.com
Furthermore, other African countries will soon start adopting the use of digital currency which means there will be ease of doing business with those other nations since one will be able to exchange e-naira for their respective digital money. Again the trouble of having to convert cash will be eliminated.
Although there may be some glitches at the initial stage, with time, it will become part of our daily routines. It is just like introducing a new denomination of money which can be confusing at the beginning.
Image credit: dailytrust.com
Moreover, the average old market men and women may not fit into this new development since they may not have the needed knowledge to operate the digital wallet and my extension the browsing phone to do it, but the majority of the general public would not have any difficulties in using the app. And as for those old folks, one can always go around with little cash because of them.
Kudos to the governor of the CBN for being very proactive in this economic development.
Content created and supplied by: OlatunbosunHuman Lanterns is probably widely talked about as a cult martial arts film with some dabbling on the macabre. The opening credits show a warehouse with plenty of human remains atop a bloody grinder. In fact, it has all the ingredients of a torture porn flick, except that, horrors of horrors, this DVD edition comes censored! So gone are the scenes where the victim's skin are peeled off their bodies to make the titular lanterns, though there was a fleeting boob shot from afar that the censors seemed to have missed.
Anyway, the story is nothing remarkable, with two town braggers, Master Lung (Tony Liu Yong) and Master Tan (Chen Kuan Tai) at loggerheads and always scheming to be one up against the other. Tan shows off his latest human-sized lantern which gets the admiration of the simple townsfolk, and Lung decides to go one up on his rival. His search for a master lantern maker leads him to one time love rival Chun Fang (Lo Lieh), who agrees to make him the most stunning lanterns ever seen, with a condition that he never visits his workplace. Best of all, they celebrate their strange union by visiting the whorehouse. Hmm.
Also, a mysterious masked creature looking like an overgrown hairy ape with highly skilled kungfu start to terrorize the town, kidnapping young nubile females such as the #1 courtesan and the sister of Master Tan, and given the nature of the disappearance, the animosity between the two men deepen to a deadly duel. However, it doesn't take you a second to figure out just who the man is behind the creature, and there's some needless tension built up around this mystery which seemed a little waste of time. The "police" too turn out to be rather foolhardy and inept, with the sergeant always listening to the two rich men, allowing his investigations to be poisoned by ill opinions from each of them on the other. Talk about siding with those who are rich or in power.
While it can't be comparable to stuff we see today, for it's time I think the fight scenes were still interesting enough to engage audiences, given its myriad of weapons from swords to fans (and the creature's gloved claws), and stunts. In fact, the stunts and sets were really impressive for its climatic battle, and I thought there was no stinginess in creating multi-layered sets for the actors to ply their martial arts abilities. What seemed to be interesting here though, is not the choreographed martial arts display, but rather the portrayal of the women's role in cultures back then. They are treated like playthings, with zero say in the ways of the world, reduced to gossipy aunties, and helpless damsels in distress. In fact, Lung's wife had to even tolerate, and even approve of her husband's infidelity.
That said, Human Lanterns could have been a more entertaining watch, if not for the censoring of those crucial moments, making it like eating Char Kway Teow without the See Hum!
The Code 3 DVD from Celestial Pictures is presented in letterboxed format. Visual transfer is decent but not fantastic, and audio is available only in mono Mandarin with subtitles in traditional Chinese, English, Bahasa Malaysia and Bahasa Indonesia. Scene selection is available over 12 chapters.
The Special Features are woefully few, which includes the remastered trailer for Human Lanterns (0:57), Temple of the Red Lotus (0:54), The Last Tempest (1:11), Last Woman of Shang (1:09) and Big Brother Cheng (1:12). Movie Information contains a Photo Gallery made up of 14 stills, an Original Poster still, Production Notes which is actually a one paragraph synopsis in English and Mandarin available on the back cover DVD sleeve, and text Biographies of actors Liu Yung, Chen Kuan Tai, Lo Lieh and director Sun Chung.Radio City Rockettes make emotional return to the stage

General objective of the project: to discover our common memory (to discover in two senses: to capture but also to reveal)
Through places of memory gradually acquire the concept of common memory, to apprehend and get involved in the challenges of building a European identity.
What are the places of memory?
It is a collective memory, from the most concrete object to the most abstract idea. As Pierre Nora points out, a place of memory is “a significant material or ideal unit that has been made, by the will of men or work of time, representative symbol of any community “.The identity dimension is therefore essential, but the French historian adds that these places are not “what we remember, but where the memory works, not the tradition itself, but its laboratory.” What matters is more what one makes of the place of memory than the place of memory itself. Concretely Pierre Nora adds: »Places of memory are first and foremost remains. The extreme form where a commemorative consciousness subsists in a history who calls because its ignored. (…) Museums, archives, cemeteries and collections, festivals, anniversaries, treaties, trials, monuments, shrines, associations, these are the gathered witnesses of another age, illusions of eternity. (…)” He also says “a place of memory in every sense of the word goes from the most material and concrete object, possibly geographically located, to the most abstract and intellectually constructed object”. It can be a monument, an important person, a museum, an archive, as well as a symbol, a motto, an event or an institution.
Therefore it will be important to ask questions about memory construction at a European level, and to understand that memory also has a history and do it in the current context of overinvestment, at least at the level of discourse, from national memories to the identity folds. So we want to be artisans of the construction of a European consciousness, a necessary step to build a European identity.Xpeng Unveils Performance BEV Powertrain
Chinese automaker Xpeng has released specifications for its high performance BEV powertrain claiming 420bhp.
Its P7’s E-motor, transmission and control system are integrated into a three-in-one electric drive system to reduce size and weight. Along with the horsepower, the powerplant claims and industry heading power density of 1.96kW/kg with low volume of 18.6-litres, while NEDC efficiency can reach 85.5%.
The Xpeng P7 4-wheel-drive high-performance version has overall power of 316kW and a torque of 486ft-lbs enough to claim a 0-62mph sprint time of 4.3 seconds. Its equipped with the German Infineon 950 IGBT module, able to deliver current output of 580A to the motor for continuous 40s. It uses real-time temperature assessment to effectively manage the core junction temperature of the IPU, coupled with China’s first external water cooling system.
“Using in-house R&D to optimize product efficiency and customer experience has always been the core of our philosophy. We are very proud that the P7’s design benefited from this approach, setting new performance benchmarks,” said Jack Xu, vice-president of Xpeng Motors.

, edited by Ellen Oh
published by Crown Books for Young Readers, January 2017
suggested age range: 8 – 12 years
*This post contains affiliate links.

FLYING LESSONS is a great example of:
- Short stories for middle grade readers
- Diversity
- A short story in verse
- First person narration (Almost all of them are)
- Middle grade stories that deal with race, class, sexual orientation, and disability.
Important Topics and Themes:
Various because it’s an anthology. Stories touch on identity, perseverance, prejudice, friendship, family influence, and individuality vs. conformity, just to name a few.
Eva Langston and Meagan Boyd. See our bios at the end of this post!
What did we think of FLYING LESSONS?
Meagan: I’m not normally the biggest fan of short story collections, but I really enjoyed Flying Lessons. I’m glad Ellen Oh and We Need Diverse Books put this together. It was a great way to get exposed to a bunch of authors all at once and I found myself taking note as I read of authors whose longer books I’d like to read.
Eva: Definitely! I thought some of the stories, though self-contained, could have been the first chapters of novels … novels I’d like to read! I’m not sure I’ve ever read a middle grade short story collection before, so this book was unique in that way, not to mention the diversity of characters, settings, and situations. It makes me wonder why there aren’t more short story collections for this age group. Middle grade readers are notorious for their short attention spans, so it seems like a great idea.
Meagan: If I were still teaching 4th grade, I’d absolutely use Flying Lessons in my classroom. For one thing, it’s great for kids to see stories with different kinds of protagonists representing the wide array of kids’ backgrounds and experiences. For another thing, middle grade short stories aren’t super common, and it’d be helpful to have short read-alouds that could be finished in one or two sittings. Perfect for before a vacation or some other time when it’s not practical to start reading aloud a new novel.
Also, for both students and writers, short stories can work as a quick snapshot to help you focus on a particular skill or topic without needing to tackle a whole novel. “How does an author establish a memorable and believable character in just a few pages?” is a great question to investigate whether you’re a kid learning about characterization and making inferences, or an adult writer who’s looking to improve your own craft. Gift this book to teachers you know!
Eva: Let’s talk about the particular stories. One that stood out to me was “Seventy-Six Dollars and Forty-Nine Cents: A Story-in-Verse” by Kwame Alexander (2015 Newberry Medal winner for The Crossover). Books in verse seem to be very “in” right now, especially in YA, but I’ve avoided them because I thought it would be annoying. On the contrary, I really enjoyed Alexander’s story and wasn’t annoyed at all by the format. If anything, it made it a fun, quick, and interesting to read.
It seems like this story could be a good way to introduce kids to verse. It shows that poetic language doesn’t have to rhyme; poetry is also about rhythm, word choice, and imagery:
The most beautiful girl
in school
walks up to me
fast and furious
like a wave rushing
to the shore.
I feel like
I’m about to drown,
but I don’t care,
because like my dad says
about my mom,
“She’s a stone cold fox!”
I imagine that, like me, kids might be more willing to try a short story in verse before jumping into an entire novel written that way.
Meagan: How about “Sol Painting, Inc.” by Meg Medina (known for her banned book Yaqui Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass)? I loved the journey the protagonist went on. She began very confident in a simplistic way then got exposed to a complex world that included some class- and race-prejudice. She sees how her older brother and her father deal with things. At first she looks down on her brother and dad’s responses, but through the story she comes to understand why they act the way they do. By the end she seems to neither adopt their approaches completely, nor look down on them for their choices. She will have to face injustice in her own way and also be compassionate towards those who choose to face it in a different way. I think this is an appropriately nuanced problem for middle grade students to grapple with, both theoretically in the story as well as in real-life application.
Eva: My favorite story was “The Difficult Path” by Grace Lin (author of Newberry Honor book Where the Mountain Meets the Moon). All the other stories were set in the U.S. in contemporary times, but from this story’s first line, the reader is transported to a totally different time and place:
“When I was sold to the Li family, my mother let Mrs. Li take me only after she’d promised that I would be taught to read.”
I was immediately drawn into the world, and this was one of the stories I wished was the first chapter of a novel. I also would have liked if at least one of the other stories in the collection was historical fiction and/or set somewhere other than the U.S., like this one.
Meagan: I have a tie for my favorite between Meg Medina’s story, which I described above, and “The Beans and Rice Chronicles of Isaiah Dunn” by Kelly J. Baptist. I thought this one was a great little primer on showing-not-telling. The author sets up a sympathetic character in a very difficult family situation with perfectly chosen details that give the readers everything they need to know, without resorting to telling or labels. We’re never told “my mom is depressed” or “we got evicted” or “now we’re homeless.” The reader experiences everything right along with Isaiah and his sister and can easily get the scariness of the situation without needing to be told the names for the problems. Yet despite some pretty dark circumstances, there is also hope in the story.
I liked this story so well I went immediately to the Internet to find out what else the author had written, only to discover that she doesn’t yet have a published novel! This story is her debut publication! Kelly J. Baptist…I’m waiting for your novel to come out! You are writing one, right???
Eva: I hope so! I just want to mention one last story (the last one in Flying Lessons): “Sometimes a Dream Needs a Push” by Walter Dean Myers (author of the award-winning novel Monster plus many others). I think what comes to many people’s minds with the “we need diverse books” campaign is race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation — which are all types of diversity found in this collection. What isn’t so often considered are kids with disabilities. I was glad to see this story — about a boy who plays wheelchair basketball — included in the collection.
This book reminded us of…
Meagan: I don’t know. I don’t think I’ve ever read an anthology of middle grade short stories.
Eva: I don’t know that I’ve read an anthology before, but I definitely used to read short stories for middle grade readers. When I was a kid I subscribed to the American Girl magazine. In each issue there was a short story, and I remember one in particular about a girl who finds out that her grandmother had her feet bound when she was a little girl in China. I think that was how I first learned about foot-binding, and obviously the story was so powerful that I still remember it quite clearly now, twenty-five years after reading it! So short stories can definitely have just as much power as novels for the middle grade age group.
FINAL TAKE-AWAYS:
Eva: A quick, interesting collection of short stories for middle grade readers. Not only is there diversity in the subject matter, there is diversity in the way the stories are told. One is told in verse, one is told in second person, some are in past tense while others are in present, etc.
Meagan: A reminder that a short story anthology with a variety of authors can be a great way of discovering authors you might like to read more of. As a reader, it’s a way to sample more broadly and try out the styles and stories of a lot of writers in a short time.
Eva LangstonA compelling new voice on urban affairs has emerged in Canada’s West and mayors everywhere would do well to support his message. It’s the voice of Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, and he wants cities’ needs high on the political agenda — especially if there’s a federal election in the spring.
With municipalities responsible for services as wide-ranging as policing, fire protection, clean water, sewer systems and navigable streets, there is no more vital level of government. “Cities in this country provide services that people use every hour of every day,” Nenshi told the Star’s editorial board Thursday.
More than 80 per cent of Canadians now live in cities. Despite all that, Canada’s urban areas are struggling to cope with crumbling infrastructure, ever-increasing demands for their services, and insufficient revenues that are based mainly on property tax.
That needs to change. The first step is a “broad national conversation” on the importance of cities and their need for better funding, says Nenshi. There is no shortage of ideas. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has long called for the annual transfer to local communities of one percentage point of the GST. Other possible revenue generators include a municipal excise tax on gasoline, and giving cities a share of income tax collected by upper levels of government.
“I’m not interested in a revenue grab. But we need a rebalancing,” Nenshi said. He’s right. That’s why municipal needs deserve a place on the federal election agenda.
As a young, articulate urban leader — savvy with social media — Nenshi is ideally placed to lead the charge on making cities matter. Born in Toronto to South Asian immigrants, he’s a Harvard graduate and the first Muslim mayor of a major Canadian city. Beyond that, Prime Minister Stephen Harper is one of Nenshi’s Calgary constituents. If his voice isn’t heard in Ottawa, it’s hard to imagine that any other mayor’s would be.
Toronto’s Mayor Rob Ford — and municipal leaders across the country — should march in step with Nenshi to demand reliable, long-term funding for cities. Only through such pressure can Canada’s national parties be moved to deliver what’s necessary.
Worth repeating
“I was born here in Toronto, just barely. My mother was pregnant when they immigrated and.”

Parents and caregivers: I have grown sons, and I’m going to do that annoying thing where an older woman shares an anecdote. I’ve noticed that when young mothers ask for advice they don’t seek me out. I get it. I’m pushy and opinionated. All good. I’ve watched enough episodes of ‘Jane the Virgin’ to understand generational dynamics of motherhood.
Here’s my story: when we bought our first home, and the house we still live in today, my older boy was 3 and the baby 3 months. We had been renting a house in Ballard (a neighborhood in Seattle) and I was in young mom heaven. We gave up a lot for me to be a stay at home mom, and it wasn’t easy. Those financial sacrifices affect us to this day. We’ve never been ‘caught up’ or had any savings (that’s not the only reason, but one of them). Understand, when I had my sons I didn’t have maternity leave for the first one. (But that’s another story for another day. We have never loved children or parents in this country.)
Having a small child in Seattle is a joy–the Woodland Park Zoo was a frequent place for us, and I would take my son to Greenlake for the five-mile walk, and I was in much better shape than I am now. Our landlord was selling the house, and though we made a huge financial blunder by not buying it, we decided we were be better if we bought a house in the suburbs for the same cost. Off we went. I went from mommy playgroups, trips to the zoo, a dear friend up the street with a daughter and son the same ages of my boys, (we’re still friends), and lots of fun things to do to a Wasteland of Mommydom. My parents don’t live nearby, and my in-laws lived about an hour away for a time, but had other things to do. I had no close family or friends. I saw some neighbors walking their kids to the bus stop, and they had children about the same age as my sons. I asked the mom if there were any mommy-baby playgroups available and she said yes. I then asked if I could join. She said no, there wasn’t any room. (I want to name drop at this point because the dad of this family is a famous sportscaster for a local, “regal” news station.)
Think about that for a minute: no room in a mom group.
Okay.
Most families in our nation either are single parent households or two parents who work.
If you want to find the number of working parents just go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was from 2019, and I am not sure of what the current situation is. The unemployment numbers have exploded, and any financial gains made from Obama’s tenure as President have been destroyed in 3.5 years of our current corrupt “president.”
“The labor force participation rate–the percent of the population working or looking for work–for all women with children under age 18 was 72.3 percent in 2019, up from 71.5 percent in the prior year. Married mothers remained less likely to participate in the labor force, at 69.9 percent, than mothers with other marital statuses, at 77.6 percent. (Other marital status includes persons who are never married; widowed; divorced; separated; and married, spouse absent; as well as persons in same-sex marriages.) The unemployment rate for married mothers was also considerably lower than for mothers with other marital statuses–2.3 percent, compared with 5.9 percent. (See table 5.) “
Both parents employed: over 60%
Now, I don’t belong to a church, and since my neighbors were less than helpful when it came to sharing and supporting me, some of the reasons I became a teacher was because 1. we needed one of us to have a stable income 2. I would use the summer breaks to spend time with my sons. There are other reasons, too, but yes, between my husband and I, and then preschool and school we patched together supervision and care for our children. And I will stand here today and say if we were in the situation many families are facing now I would be turning myself inside out. My parents were still working with the boys were little, and my in-laws had other things going on. Unlike Jane the Virgin, I don’t have the option of three generations under one roof caring and juggling for one another.
I told my husband about my ideas for this post: that parents should start banding together, form guilds, form unions, reach out to their own churches and demand support (I mean, the Catholic Church just received 1.4B, and is BILLION, dollars), that parents should go on strike until there are better solutions for child care and schools opening (or not) during COVID19, and he said, “Honey, that’s socialism–” Oh. Oh yeah. That’s why I wanted Bernie, or Warren. Oh yeah.
And yes, we’ll vote for Biden. But inauguration day is a long way off.
BUT: these things aren’t going to change. Parents: you have the economic power to insist that schools cannot be your daycare. I am urging you to use your voice, contact your neighbors, your friends, your families, and form a coalition. You are the workforce of this nation. You deserve to have safe, affordable or free childcare for your children. This “it takes a village” is just words on the wind. Contact your senators and representatives, even if you live in the reddest of red states. Especially then. Because this can’t stand. I can still recall the pain of my episiotomy stitches when I had to go back to work after have a 12.1lb baby after one month. ONE MONTH.
It is easy for me to say these words, easy like it was for Hillary to say the ‘village’ thing. I’ve spent money on other people’s children, not because I’m a savior or out of the goodness of my heart. I do it because I know what it’s like not to have anyone help. In the moment. In the urgent, needful moment. And yes, occasionally, sometimes I write these posts and I cry while writing. This is one of those times. We’re the richest nation of the world because the rich got the way from all the free labor. We know this. Parents: the wealthy are building their wealth out of your children, out of you. When will it stop? They won’t. Hold your employers accountable. Hold your politicians accountable. Hold your churches and places of worship accountable. You’ve built their wealth. Now it’s time for them to do the same.

There are plenty of businesses that take care of pest control. Some specialise in commercially produced pest management whilst others are focused on homeowners’ insect concerns. The firms range from smaller corporations with constrained workers to greater businesses that manage from bed bugs to termites. Pest management are designed for virtually any pest, with respect to the desires of the purchaser, area, and merchandise.
If you loved this article and you would like to acquire extra data about pest inspection Melbourne kindly go to the internet site.
Locate a pest control provider which uses only low-noxious goods and DIY methods for the reduction of pest infestations. Many chemicals that exist have the possibility to harmhouse animals and folks, or even the atmosphere if made use of improperly. For these reasons, pest management providers normally strongly encourage customers to use only organic, beneficial to our environment, and nontoxic solutions and DIY means of pest management. It’s also suggested the whole vicinity is treated.
People must look into making use of pesticide sprays to reduce insects from their households and from their back yards if a pest challenge is apparently much more wide-ranging than one or two houses. Some inorganic pesticides, for example fumigants, may very well be productive for wiping out particular pests but have the possibility to carry out damage to around crops or earth due to their hazardous attributes. Other pesticide sprays, particularly those constructed to eradicate mice or wild birds, is probably not as powerful to protect against mice and wild birds but could be beneficial to get rid of unwanted pests that contain definitely applied up residence in your house or property. Moreover, a homeowner need to ensure the inorganic pesticides in use to take out insects aren’t going to be discovered once the pest control provider makes the property.
Chemical inorganic pesticides may be used to remove unwanted pests like ants,spiders and ticks, as well as ticks. These pesticide sprays is usually great at getting rid of undesired creatures and creatures within a offered vicinity, but their use should be tied to not more than some time. On the other hand, chemical type pesticides may well cause a threat to anybody who makes exposure to the left over insecticide, if excessive use is performed. Additionally, it’s important for people to notice that pesticides usually contain harmful toxins that can be dangerous to animals and youngsters. Proper working with and storing of those bug sprays are strongly suggested.
The most used method of pest control is the use of biological pesticides. Biocides are considered sometimes earth-dependent or vegetation-primarily based. These inorganic pesticides, which appear in each solution and natural powder types, are put on to wipe out pest infestations on the outside of the home and also on the inside. Plant pathogens may well present a danger tofolks and pets, along with other dogs when they are consumed. Therefore, homeowners implement biocides which might be harmless for your setting yet still be sufficiently strong enough to have an impact on pests on the inside of a composition.
Intensive landscaping or garden methods can sometimes be a set off for insect potential predators. Gardeners may draw in some types of insects simply by departing selected meals and merchandise undisturbed. They may not be mindful of them if you can find any organic enemies inside the vicinity. To avoid this, some people opt for certain pest control goods. A large number of items happen to be created specifically to stop certain kinds of insects.
Other ways of bug handle involve making use of bait or traps. In the matter of lure, the two main alternatives: baits are sold with a nearby pest control company or kept around inside the yard. In the event of traps, a homeowner could create his very own. However, producing traps calls for some DIY procedures, like taking away drop foliage and arms and legs to allow for good location from the snare.
In spite of which technique of insect administration is picked, you will discover ways that could be consumed to preventing unwanted pets. A property owner may use organic and natural approaches, including normal repellents, to maintain unwanted animals absent. With a pest control firm may also prove advantageous, because they can give tips on ways of controlling mice and insects.

RRVL revised the timeline for the ‘long stop date’ (Term of the Day, explained below) to September 30 2021 from March 31 2021. The deal which seemed to sail through after the CCI and SEBI’s approval, was awaiting the NCLT’s approval before getting to the final steps. But Amazon’s plea to seek enforcement of the Singapore arbitrator’s decision saw the Delhi High Court block the acquisition.
Separately, Reliance Industries said it secured the approval of its shareholders and creditors to hive off its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business into a separate unit. Saudi Aramco is reportedly in discussions with Reliance to buy a 20% stake in the O2C business.

Recently I have been feeling stuck in a rut and I needed to find a way out, thats when I stumbled upon the 100 days of code challenge.
For me I find the challenge to be extremely interesting and its incredible to see how much people have improved just from programming for 100 days! After seeing all the posts I decided I might as well give it a try. So today begins day 1 of my 100 day journey!
Since it's day 1 I decided to start with something I know very little about but enough to where I won't have to mindlessly follow tutorials. That's why I decided to start creating a django project. My hopes for this project are that it will eventually become a great news site for viewing local and national politicians.
Today I accomplished initializing the project (holy crap django has a lot of files) and I began working on the home screen for the site! I'm excited to see where this takes me.

Minn-Erva met her demise toward the end of the 2019 film, thus allowing Chan to take on the mantle of Sersi in Eternals, a hero who is almost the complete opposite of Minn-Erva.
“To be honest, I was as surprised as anyone else. I was not expected to be back,” the 38-year-old told ScreenRant about returning to the MCU. “I obviously jumped at the chance…And you know what? This time I don’t have to be painted blue, so I didn’t have to do the 2:30am or 3am call times to be four hours sprayed with body paint. So, that was good.”
Eternals, directed by Chloé Zhao and also starring Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden and Kit Harrington, arrives in theaters on November 5.

But things change, and one can look at a moment 20 years ago that was something of a tipping point.
Legally Blonde came out.
And the story of a blonde, pink-wearing, fashion-loving young woman who conquers law school through charm, gumption and smarts — without sacrificing her feminine qualities — resonated with a lot of women. Many were drawn to law school because of Reese Witherspoon’s classic role as Elle Woods.
From the Hollywood Reporter: “This film has inspired an entire generation of women to go for their dreams, especially women who wanted to be lawyers. Reese Witherspoon told the Wall Street Journal in 2017 that, ‘At least once a week I have a woman come up to me and say, ‘I went to law school because of Legally Blonde’...It’s incredible. You can be unapologetically feminine but also smart and driven.’”
Indeed, a 58-page thesis was written on the subject called, “The Impact of Legally Blonde on Women Entering the Legal Profession."
From the abstract: “Legally Blonde defines feminism by presenting women as both intelligent and typically feminine — challenging the typical gender role of women in society with her expression of capability and seriousness.”
Yes, a thesis...
In the movie, when we first meet Elle, she’s a lively, bubbly student at a Southern California college — called CULA — who loves to dress in pink and carry her pet Chihuahua Bruiser everywhere. She’s majoring in fashion design and, of course, belongs to a sorority. She appears to have a golden life — until she’s dumped by her snobbish boyfriend Warner Huntington III right before he heads off to Harvard Law School. He didn’t think she had the proper heft to be the wife of a future power broker.
View this post on Instagram
Elle figures she’ll follow him to Harvard to win him back. It doesn’t come easily. She studies furiously to get a near perfect LSAT score — a 179 out of 180. And her video admissions essay? She hires a Coppola to direct it. Lounging in a pool, wearing a bikini, she cites her qualifications. Harvard accepts her because Harvard is always seeking to diversify, the admissions board notes.
Warner is shocked when he later sees Elle in the hallway of the iconic school. “You got into Harvard Law?”
She replied famously: “What? Like, it’s hard?”
Yes, it helps the movie is witty, chock-full of memorable one-liners and positively rocked by Witherspoon. And it’s also helped that the novel which the movie is based was written by Amanda Brown, who used her experiences at Stanford Law School as inspiration. The two screenwriters were also women.
Acing Harvard is not Elle’s initial goal. She only wants to win back Warner. And, in that effort, she finds more people underestimating and discouraging her. Yet she repeatedly strides forward fearlessly. Later, she realizes that Warner is hardly the man for her, but that a law career is something that’s definitely worth pursuing. And while every legal movie has a classic courtroom scene, the one in Legally Blonde is a beauty — literally.
Elle helps free a fellow sorority sister accused of killing her husband. She’s able to nullify a witness’s testimony via her knowledge of hair care. The witness — who is the real killer — said she didn’t hear a gunshot because she was in the shower. Elle jumps on that, noting how the witness just had a perm and one does not shower for 24 hours “at the risk of deactivating the immonium thygocolate.”
Beat that Perry Mason...
Her character has had lasting impact, no question. On Twitter, many remarked how the movie affected their lives. “Ever since I was a little girl Elle has ALWAYS inspired me to be better than everyone expects me to be.”
And another: “20 years ago, my 9yo self watched #Legally Blonde and now I’m a lawyer who wears lots of pink. Thank you Elle.”
She’s one of growing number of female attorneys. There are now more women in law school today than men. They represent 54% of students. In 1971, less than 10% of students were female.
Yep, girls rule.

Abstract
Structural covariance networks are able to identify functionally organized brain regions by gray matter volume covariance across a population. We examined the transcriptomic signature of such anatomical networks in the healthy brain using postmortem microarray data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. A previous study revealed that a posterior cingulate network and anterior cingulate network showed decreased gray matter in brains of Parkinson’s disease patients. Therefore, we examined these two anatomical networks to understand the underlying molecular processes that may be involved in Parkinson’s disease. Whole brain transcriptomics from the healthy brain revealed upregulation of genes associated with serotonin, GPCR, GABA, glutamate, and RAS-signaling pathways. Our results also suggest involvement of the cholinergic circuit, in which genes NPPA, SOSTDC1, and TYRP1 may play a functional role. Finally, both networks were enriched for genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders that overlap with Parkinson’s disease symptoms. The identified genes and pathways contribute to healthy functions of the posterior and anterior cingulate networks and disruptions to these functions may in turn contribute to the pathological and clinical events observed in Parkinson’s disease.

Expert staff, service, events, galleries, demos & more!Stores & Partner LocationsIn a BBC breakfast interview this morning, Susan Jebb, a senior adviser in the government’s battle against obesity, warned people away from sources of sugar, such as cakes and biscuits.
In a discussion which stemmed from the issue of consuming less sugary drinks, Dr Jebb also voiced her support for the idea of taxing sugar.
Today has been dubbed ‘Sugar Thursday’ – the day when the Public Health England’s sugar reduction strategy is to be released.
Dr Jebb told the BBC: “There isn’t just going to be one solution to this, we are going to have to have a raft of different polices, which target not only sugary drinks, but also the other big sources of sugar in the diet, things like confectionery and indeed cakes and biscuits as well.
“I think we are seeing industries coming forward with ways that will help us reduce our sugar intake - and that’s to be welcomed - but I think as individuals we’ve also got to get out of the habit of seeing things like chocolate, biscuits, cakes and confectionery as routine everyday occurrences and to get back to seeing them as an occasional treat.”
Mediterranean diet
Dr Jebb advised people to change from processed foods to what she referred to as a ‘Mediterranean diet’ which is richer in fruit, vegetables and high-fibre wholegrain carbohydrates.
Dr Sally Norton, NHS weight loss surgeon, has also responded to the proposed plans for sugar reduction.
She said: “We have all been waiting for the realisation of a tax on sugary drinks, as recommended by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AOMRC) over a year ago and also by the Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, back in March.”
“But would a tax on sugary drinks work in reality? It is always difficult to know, as trying to change behaviour by increasing taxes can have unanticipated effects that must be carefully evaluated.”
Dr Norton also called for a cut in the portion sizes of sugary snacks.
She said: “Let’s tackle those crazy-sized servings, as well as provide clear health warnings about the sugar content in foods, as obesity is right up there with tobacco as a health issue - so why shouldn’t high-sugar foods carry the same level of health warnings to consumers?”
Scientific guidance on carbohydrates in the diet, including sugar, is expected to be issued by the government’s advisory committee on nutrition today.Dec 03, 2017 · These are the best ETFs to buy to take full advantage of China.

I heard an owl in Seattle
What we love barely exists
I was with the dog when the owl whooo’d, once twice three times and more. The air was cool and wet, the giant trees kept the street in darkness. The day was not over yet it was ending. We stopped. The dog pricked her ears and looked toward the sound. I told her the sound was from an “owl.” “Owl” I said and pointed. She looked at me and looked where I pointed and looked at me again. And then the owl called and she stared as though she could see what I could not make out in the cacophony of evergreens.
What this all means: is nothing.
Oak was king of all trees, wren king of all birds and soul of oak
Yet St. Stephen’s Day is upon us and it is time to hunt the wren

D’imigh an dreoilín anonn thar muir,…AND YES

But why kill him. Did the wren betray St. Stephen, as he hid in a bush? Or the Irish when they came to plunder the Viking2 camp? Breadcrumbs on a drum head, the rocks crushing the creature.
Or was it the majesty of the creature’s song–of many creature songs–that rendered it king of the birds, king of the past year, to be undone by Samhain?
They butchered the bird–I butcher belief. It is all in good fun. Or rather to keep myself warm in the winter of this, our new year. Year of the scorched mattress, of the unraked earth, of the oh so surprised by the newest storm. Year of the “ongoing revelations” and the “unprecedented.” Good luck in your surprise.
What can you do? We on earth/play at being people
I have more questions. Who was the king, if king he was, before being stoned and tied to a stick? What was his name? Wren, winter wren, dreoilín, dryw, roitelet, laouenan?
As the scientists say (and I was one before and am now again) once the winter wren was a single species, Troglodytes hiemalis, and ranged in its day from Japan to the west coast of North America. Now…
hiemalis3 Winter wren
pacificus4 Pacific wren
troglodytes5 Eurasian wren
Were the woods and fields, the sedges and trees, occupied by Eurasian wrens when the wren boys sang and hunted and tied them to a stick? Were they T. troglodytes, once T. hiemalis, or T. troglodytes and never T. hiemalis. Were they wren? Were they winter? Were they something or something else.
If I speak of Nature, it’s not because I know what Nature is…[it is]

Presumably the bird does not know it–but I will not draw a conclusion on that. The knowledge of the bird is unknowable to me. No anthropomorphic tricks, no objective tools will allow me to fully peer inside its store of understanding.
And so I am impoverished.
But at least I know of my ignorance.
Once a man said animals are “poor in world.”6 But he was wrong. He mistook language, or what might be language, for something else. He mistook the limit of world as the limit of his own skull.
He was poor in world because. His world did not include the idea that animals (others) were world. That feathers themselves make world. That nest is an exquisite creation and a bower a sculpture.
Sometimes I encounter a Bewick’s wren (I will call him/her/they “wren” now) in my neighborhood, in my yard.
“In my” X = a term of human property. A term bounded by fencing and roads. A wrenless term I imagine.
But I could be wrong. Perhaps that wren knows the limits of my world.
4. St. Stephen’s Day…
I heard the wren on St. Stephen’s Day, or thereabouts, somewhere above my head. That buzzing call.
An external observer may be able to see that there are other things which the system cannot see
Again, I am writing about the wren. (I’ve done it so many years I’ve lost count). At the same time I am trying to unbind myself. From my own skull, from my own narrow hole. But language and thought constrain me
no one will hear our true voices,…/we will not recognize one another
This is what I wish I could say:
or this:
Because the winter wrens, the Bewick’s wrens are speaking. Shh. Listen.
he investigates the pig-sty; then explores the garden fence, and finally mounts to the roof and pours forth one of the sweetest songs that ever was heard.
I’ll stop talking, I’ll stop asking question. Go outside you lazy creature of the earth and listen. Go find the wren–the wren is everywhere. Go find a wren to give your year something other than “our great military delivered justice” or “profanity sparks furor” or “woman in vegetative state, apparently assaulted, gives birth to baby boy.”
Go outside
Find that one bird and her buzzy call. Only that one bird and his deeply complicated song.
Go out, breathing exhaust if you must, wet to the bone and shivering, or hot as all get out if your St. Stephen’s Day is the end of your summer. Go out there you lazy piece of shit and listen. For the love of god/s/esses/all that is holy. Whether it is sound you hear, or sound you feel, or the sight of the wide open beak to the sky, tail up, find your wren and perceive him/her/they. There is nothing else I can tell you. Because you must. Because we all must. Because the wren hunt is here. Because it is the first step to a sort of salvation.

[1]
Pity the wren on top of the hill,
with rain on its belly, the storm and the frost
going into the fields, its legs cut,
and broken without bands on it and it wet from the dew.
The wren went away across the sea,
ran away from us from the snare in the stone,
and how many people watching for it from Monday to Saturday,
with neither a patch nor a home, but the shade of the bush.

Jamie painted a geometry-themed abstract that we are calling, “Disobey”. I really think he is on to something with the use of shadows:
The quote on your lower left reads, “Sometimes the appropriate response to reality is to go insane.” by Phillip K. Dick
I find Jamie’s painting intriguing, and I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I also like his use of a quotation in the artwork.
Erik made a blended color, fire-breathing dragon. Mom says it reminds her of me! But I think she is kidding.
Is it a love dragon? Is s/he breathing hearts of fire or hearts on fire? There is a softness to the dragon’s face that I like. This is another painting I’m enjoying looking at and thinking about.
Finally, Mom (the tattoo enthusiast) painted a tribal rose on a white background.
Mom says she wants to sharpen the lines a bit now that the painting has dried and add a little more white and highlight in spots, especially amongst the leaves.
All in all, the family had a wonderful time, and agreed that this was the best idea Mom had come up with for a long time. Everybody is looking forward to the next painting session, and hope that Dad can make it.
You may be wondering what I did during the painting time. I mostly lay under the table and occasionally on the chair to avoid getting paint on my white fur. I already have a black spot – don’t need another! Woof! (tail wags) I enjoyed being with my family and having a good time.
Let me ask you: If I gave you some paint and a blank canvas – what would you paint?

The tunnel is part of one of the most important transport lines in the country
Last Thursday, Minister of Transport Georgi Todorov announced the beginning of construction on the longest two-pipe railway tunnel on the Balkan peninsula and in Bulgaria. The tunnel will be 6.8 kilometres long, costing around 300 million euros, and is part of the broader modernisation of the line from the capital of Sofia to the Black Sea, European Corridor No. 8.
The modernisation of the Trakia railway line connecting Sofia with Burgas has been underway for the past 15 years and is set to be completed in 2030. This is one of the most important transport lines in the country as it runs from East to West and is part of the TEN-T EU transport network.
It connects Sofia with Istanbul and the port city of Burgas on the Black Sea, with the transportation lane starting as far away as Hamburg and Bremen. This makes it one of the most important routes between Central Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean.
The 20 kilometre stretch between Elin Pelin and Vakarel is one of the most difficult parts of the whole track and the tunnel will end up soaking a large part of the investment. At the same time, the new track will be able to support speeds of up to 160 kilometres per hour for passenger transport and 120 for freight, greatly reducing travel time and allowing for more traffic on the line.
Minister Georgi Todorov was quoted in a press release, saying: "The technical and operational challenges for the builder are extremely great, as this lot is the most difficult of the whole section.”
The funds have been secured through the EU Operational Programme “Transport and transportNottingham, Maryland (21236) OAKHURST Quarterly (2nd Quarter) Market Report - 2007 By Mike Klijanowicz, Associate Broker @ Cummings & Co.

The Steerman's Quarters Menu. The Empress Lilly Riverboat was named after Walt Disney's wife, Lillian Disney, and was an authentic re-creation of a 220ft 19th century paddle wheeler decorated in Louis XV style.It was open on Lake Buena Vista at Walt Disney World from 1977 to 1995. It consisted of several dining room options and The Empress Room was the higher end, dressy dinner room. The Steerman's Quarter was one of the other dining rooms offering steak, venison, buffalo, lamb and duck. The Empress Room menu measures 16 1/2" x 10" and is covered with an ornate gold embossed foil. There are 14 pages listing menu items in French with English subtitles. The Captain's Wine List measures 10 1/2" x 7 1/4 ". The Steerman's Menu measures 15 1/2" x 8 5/8". These would be a wonderful addition to your Walt Disney World collection of memorabilia.
My father worked as a typesetter for WDW in the 70's and he was involved in producing these menus.

Fresh out of high school in 2007, I moved into Lakes of the Clouds Hut with no expertise in any of those fields, unless you call washing dishes and eating cold mashed potatoes from the walk-in at a fraying hamlet called The Granite Café a job. What I did have was a pair of hiking boots, a bag of Halloween costumes and the stubborn hope that I would be hired for my love of the White Mountains and taste for theatrics, having enjoyed many a BFD (the breakfast skits) during previous hut visits.
Either my “Aw, Shucks” candor was more affecting than I realized or the applicant before me had come into the AMC’s Joy Street office with human flesh on their chin. I got the job. Before I knew it, I was skipping my prom to go toss sacks of flour into a rat-proof closet and learn the art of “proofing” yeast, 5050 feet above sea level, rime ice still frosting the boulders.
There were hiccups. My first attempt at cooking a breakfast for 93 people was a near disaster. Having never used a griddle before, I attempted to cook a batch of pancakes on the griddle cover, with the burners on high heat. Had a fellow croo member not noticed the smell of burning wood, recovering from the experience might have required psychotherapy. Another evening, I announced to a full dining room of guests that I would be serving a traditional British pudding dessert called “Spotted Dick”. The announcement was received with stunned faces and muffled laughter from a table of large French Canadian men. Clearly, I had not taken into account that some of our horrified patrons had not ventured outside the United States, let alone New England. I stayed in the kitchen for the rest of the evening, brewing coffee and avoiding eye contact with the crowd.
But things got better. Despite never quite mastering traditional yeast breads, I taught myself how to bake Irish Soda Bread for the ages, stuffing the beast with almonds, walnuts, whole-wheat flour and other ingredients not normally employed during the Michael Collins years. I developed a passion for soup cooking, turning out endless concoctions of savory meet stewed in wine for hours with stocks, vegetables and enough spices to make a Spaniard swoon. Eventually, I grew to view “cook days” not as challenges on par with a military patrol but an opportunity to slay my audience not with undercooked chicken (which, thank god, never happened) but elation: of how French onion soup, steaming lasagna rustico, and deathly sweet peanut butter squares could taste so good, let alone exist in this blessed patch of wilderness.
I have thought of this endlessly throughout the past weeks. As the leaves brown and winter’s breath creeps into the long, dark nights, I am preparing for a departure from the huts. Not just a seasonal one, a final exit as well. The last five summers – and this current fall – have been kinder to me than I thought possible for people my age, in our troubled economy. But with a college degree under my belt and a burgeoning interest in editorial media, urban dwellings and a Danish electronica artist named Trentemøller, I know I have reached the end of my lease in this indescribable place.
The temptation to prolong my stay is strong, as there is much that I will miss: the bristling anticipation of a hungry dinner crowd. The warmth of a bunk after a long day of work. An endless supply of Goldfish. That first cup of coffee in the small hours, when the birds have just stirred to life outside. But more than anything, I will always cherish the huts’ enduring backbone of good labor and good humor at all times. Where cooking, cleaning and assisting others is not outsourced but embraced with unabashed pride. Where one will not only learn from a mistake, but can learn to laugh about it as well.
The spirit of the huts is something I do not expect to encounter again, wherever my work and travels take me. Hopefully, I’m wrong, for in this age, that spirit and its tenants seem more important than ever. When the present is at conflict with the future, a home-cooked meal and a friendly face leap beyond their origins, into the realm of idols, where a whisper of assurance can still be found. Often, a pot of chicken is just that: a pot of chicken. But sometimes, it’s all we have left.
With love and gratitude,
Miles Howard

In the midst of a contentious presidential primary season, a delegation of more than 100 Nashville emerging healthcare leaders visited our nation’s capital to get an inside look at the state of healthcare policy.
On March 14 and 15, the Nashville Health Care Council’s Leadership Health Care (LHC) initiative made its 14th annual trip to Washington, D.C., to hear from top officials about the latest healthcare developments “inside the Beltway” and around the country that will impact Nashville’s $73 billion healthcare industry. The delegation featured discussions with members of Congress, administration officials and national thought leaders about key healthcare policy issues, federal healthcare spending priorities and healthcare reform implementation.
On the first day of sessions, Darin Gordon, director of TennCare, discussed Medicaid policy issues with Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, and a panel of healthcare technology experts discussed the state of interoperability. During the keynote dinner hosted by the Nashville Health Care Council, Kristen Soltis Anderson, Republican pollster and author of “The Selfie Vote: Where Millennials are Leading America,” gave delegates an expert perspective on the 2016 presidential election.
“The 2016 delegation provided our city’s emerging healthcare leaders with new insight into what’s happening – and what’s next – in healthcare policy,” said Hayley Hovious, Council president. “This year, the upcoming presidential election and its possible implications for national healthcare policy made for an enlightening and impactful experience.”
The annual delegation to Washington is a signature LHC program. This year’s agenda also included:
- U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN)
- U.S. Representative Jim Cooper (D-TN)
- U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-TN)
- U.S. Representative John Yarmuth (D-KY)
- Jitin Asnaani, Executive Director, CommonWell Health Alliance
- Jeff Cohen, Executive Vice President, Public Affairs, Federation of American Hospitals
- Richard G. Cowart, Esq., Chair, Health Law and Public Policy Department, Baker Donelson
- Will Howorth, Director of Development and Special Assets, HCA
- Kerry McDermott, Vice President, Public Policy and Communications, Center for Medical Interoperability
- Janet Marchibroda, Director of Health Innovation, Bipartisan Policy Center
- Meena Seshamani, MD, PhD, Director, Office of Health Reform, Department of Health and Human Services
- Jake Sherman, Congressional Reporter, Politico
- Kate Spaziani, Vice President, Grants and Federal Relations, New York – Presbyterian Hospital
- Cathy Taylor, DrPH, Dean, Gordon E. Inman College of Health Sciences and Nursing
- Vindell Washington, MD, Principal Deputy National Coordinator, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
Seshamani headlined the delegation’s second day of sessions, updating delegates on the state of implementation for various healthcare healthcare leaders with speakers and networking opportunities that are unparalleled in quality.”
Participants in this year’s delegation represented diverse sectors of Nashville’s healthcare industry, including hospital management, health insurance and healthcare.
An initiative of the Nashville Health Care Council to nurture the talents of future leaders, LHC provides members with unique educational programs and networking opportunities. With membership of more than 900 up-and-coming healthcare industry leaders from 350 companies, LHC is the foremost organization for emerging industry leaders in the field.HIKING. Sweden’s Nest 2 hiked along sections of the Bohusleden trail again on 22 May. This time it was a somewhat tougher challenge than before. Alexander Almroth recounts the trip.
During the planning of this hike, I noticed this would be a much tougher stretch than those we completed earlier in the year.
As such, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to test my comrades’ abilities when faced not only with the physical challenges of walking more than 18 miles in considerably hilly terrain, but also their mental strength.
On the first day, we were told that neither nicotine nor food would be allowed until we reached the campsite and completed some simple tasks.
The first thing we came to shortly after starting the hike was a very steep path up to a small mountain. However, this was only the beginning, as the next 12 miles consisted almost exclusively of uphill slopes followed by swamps.
Despite the hard trials the day brought, we were all still in good spirits, and group cohesion did not seem to be affected by either the lack of food or nicotine (for those who usually needed it).
An extra bag was also brought and passed between us during the walk. The bag wasn’t just carried to make life harder for everyone – it also contained the tarpaulins we needed for building our camp later on.
When we reached the spot where we had chosen to spend the night, everyone quickly threw off the bags they had been carrying for over ten hours. We had a short rest and then set up our temporary windshield as quickly as possible and lit a fire to warm our wet feet.
When these two tasks had been completed, Nest Chief Sigvardsson gave the green light for both food and snus. Like the good leader he is, he had also brought various types of snacks, which he offered to his men. There was much happiness all around when everyone finally got to enjoy their well-deserved dinner.
Many hours were spent in front of the campfire, with the comrades discussing the day and singing different types of fighting songs together.
Exhausted as expected, everyone then got a good night’s sleep to the sound of heavy rain showers against the tarpaulin – which at least protected us from the rain to some extent.
At 4 a.m., we woke up and discovered that a lot of water had leaked into our shelter. Several people’s shoes and packs were soaked, and there was nothing to be done except make a fire in an attempt to produce some kind of heat.
Breakfast was consumed quickly by the fire, before it was time to conclude the weekend by walking the last eight remaining miles.
As with the previous 12 miles, this last stretch also largely consisted of swamps; however, the only option was to march on, and that’s exactly what was done.
For my part, this was one of the hikes I will likely remember for the rest of my life – both because of the challenge and the good camaraderie. I want to thank my comrades who went on this journey with me; you fought through it well!And you thought there were a lot of movies coming out this year? Get ready to never leave your…Read more

DISCUSSIONOver.
Guido has this morning 'outed' himself for the first time and confirmed the identity which anyone with a remote knowledge of how to use Google could have done for themselves months ago.
In the spirit of reaching out to those who seem to have developed an unhealthy obsession with me I say this. I refuse to get dragged in to a war with you. You can keep sending over the missiles but I'm not firing back.
To XXXXX - XXXXX.
XXXXX.
I have said all I have to say on this now. I won't entering any dialogue about it. Either this is accepted at face value or it isn't. XXXXX might put it. Iain has spoken. End communication!
127 comments:
Name calling has always been the last resort for those who have lost the argument. As the left are short of legs to stand on they always resort to this most purile form of attack!
You tell 'em, Iain!
Maybe there's a grain of truth about Christians in wheelchairs.
Blog wars are fun. They should continue.
Handbags at dawn! Can I come and watch?
Who exactly is Tim Ireland?
What's a blog?
I have no idea of what this is about and don't really care. However I do think it is disingenuous to pretend that saying 'isn't Tim Ireland one too?' is not reflecting a view.
If you had posed the question 'Is Tim Ireland one?' this would be different. Although as with anything in life, 'If you can't take it, don't dish it out'.
Reference the point about Guido - I enjoy his blog and read it a lot.
But we are entitled to 'judge a man by the company he keeps'. Trying to censor that debate will end up in the situation that Tony Blair is currently in, trying to manage the flow of information from leaks.
I have to admit that it has been a bit of a blogging bitchfest the past couple weeks.
Not very pretty at all.
Iain, cheer up. I don't follow all these other blogs much, but I do read yours often. Keep up the good work. Tell it how it is. Bear in mind though that there will be lots more of this if you become an MP. I'm tempted to add "Don't let the buggers get you down" but that phrase got rather tarnished by Michael Mates :)
A voice of reason at last, well done Iain
Well said!
Bravo!
Well said.
I heartily agree. Its unedifying and childish.
Disagreement is fine, debate is good, trading insults is childish and ad hominem attacks such as those we've witnessed really makes us all look bad.
gweirdo loves you iain
Rise above them
Well said, Iain. The concerted attempt to 'get' Guido over the weekend was a new low. In my opinion, he had no option but to take legal action given the nasty nature of the accusations.
There are so many good stories out there to talk about - stop talking about each other like a bunch of village gossips.
Why not encouraging the flaming? These cries of pain are evidence of the importance of blogs. They are symptoms of insecurity. Go with the flow and flame.
The tone and relevance of this debate is the same as that which repulses decent students from student union politics.
"You're a Trotskyist reactionary anarchist with pseudo-zionist tendencies"
"How dare you call me reactionary?"
Lads, it doesn't matter.
Hmmm - I'm in a similar position to you right now Iain.
On one blog I'm being 'hailed' as a leading light in some sort of gay conspiracy within the Liberal Democrats (conspiracy to do what? stage clandestine musicals?) - and the person / people from that blog are leaving comments over the blogosphere drawing the craziest conclusions - and have been for months. But, like you, I won't be firing missiles back.
Ho hum. Was it Robin Oakley who said that politics was a free hedge trimming service? Stick your head above the parapet and someone'll come along in no time at all to cut it off...
Iain ! Leave 'im ! He's not worth it !
Well said. I have found the recent flame wars quite irritating. What attracted me to reading political blogs in the first place was the way that people seemed inclined to give credit where credit was due. I fully expect a certain amount of bias but the last two weeks have verged on onanistic hysteria.
Iain,
You are doing the right thing closing the war of words from your side.
Maybe your attackers will find something worthwhile to spend their time on, like trying to find out why children's hospices in England only receive 5% of their funding from the government.
Over the last few weeks a huge amount of damage has been done to the British blogosphere.
Manic contends that it is you who has been doing the most damage... and for some months now. As you well know.
Please stop playing the victim.
It isn`t so much a war as a straggle of vandals.You must live in a nice area if you avoid this.
They have nothng else to say as they are not capable of entering a debate , for the most part , so they shout the only slogan they can remember.
This Tim person has not said one single interesting thing in the whole tedious "War" ,that I have read ,and his blog is incomprehensible trivia /drivel.
It must be annoying but I can`t see that there is any profound principle involved. They have nothing to say and arrive only to make little blog friends and enemies.This is ,to them , a chat room without the sex.
I hope it will still be allowable to disagree on occassion without being tarred with the same brush
An interesting turn of events:
You can't stop people feeling rather spiteful towards those who take pleasure in seeing individuals they know take a fall.
Take this cash for peerages affair, or Gordon Brown's favourite charity, for instance; if charges are brought or the charity shut down, yourself and Guido Fawkes will be delighted; it will be cause to celebrate. That reality is a bitter pill to swallow for Labour people who are close to those involved.
People view themselves as innocent benevolent agents whilst others as guilty malevolent types, deserving of attacks, which is why it will always get nasty on political blogs in the end.
I expect more 'to the death' incidents like this as we become more like America.
I agree Iain. We can discuss views, and politics, or we can attack each other. The former is fun for those interested in politics, the latter is just dull, pointless and gives people ulcers.
Were British, we are supposed to be above that sort of thing ;)
Mind you I have had an internet stalker (who even turned up at my house) for 7 years now! I stll get the occasional abusive email!
Well I get your drift - and even have some sympathy - but frankly I find it all rather amusing. An entertaining reflection of human nature, pure and simple. But I think we can sort the wheat from the chaff without yet another appeal to 'community', whatever that over-used piece of trendy meaningless verbiage is supposed to mean in this particular context.
Every blog has its bete noire: the Anti-Blog at which it snipes, from time to time. Harry's Place loathes the SWP blog Lenin's Tomb, and vice verse.
However - and this is the key point - I think bloggers should apply the principle of charity to their relationships with other bloggers. Whatever I might think of the political positions of other blogs, at least the bloggers involved have gone to the trouble of putting their views out there, debating them, providing a forum in which they can be challenged, and so on.
In other words, more should unite bloggers than divide them.
A little courtesy, on a personal rather than political level, would be appreciated.
Some of these little blogging wars say more about the people perpetrating them than anything else. Tim Ireland in particular has behaved like a child. It doesn't only seem to affect the left either,some Conservatives and UKIPers have been equally pathetic.
Having said that,these wars can be entertaining and they are probably useful in that they prevent the blogging community taking itself too seriously.
"We're now in a situation where people who I have always regarded as sensible people, even friends, have decided that certain bloggers on the Right are their mortal enemies who must be destroyed."
Sorry, Iain, but this was always the case. You can be friendly with the Left if you like, and it can make life pleasanter; but always sup with a long spoon. When push comes to shove, left-wing political belief is always based on intolerance and malice. Too many people on the Right have either forgotten, or never realised, that.
To paraphrase the maestro Arsene Wenger,
"we play our game- and we let other teams play theirs- what other teams do is not a matter for us- what matters is our focus on our game".
Sadly, I missed all these blog wars.
Where, when, who, many dead?
I agree with some of what Alex Swanson said.
This type of thing will continue simple because right leaning blogs such as yours have become so successful they are seen as a threat.
The latest ratcheting up of these petty and vindictive attacks was simple because of your investigation into the Smith Institute.
Expect things to get worse nearer the next GE.
Rise above it and ignore them, but more importantly just keeping blogging away in your own style and don't change a thing!
Iain,
I've been following the blog wars quite closely and as with most things that run and run, there's a fair amount to be said for both sides.
Tim has a few very good points but has over egged the omlette and, if I can mix metaphors, is in danger of becoming a one-trick pony.
Having said that, your piece smacks of over-simplification: The Smith Institute but not Policy Exchange for example, or asking for an apology/explanation but not mentioning that transparency and accountability in blogging was at the heart of the matter to start with etc etc. You can only really do this because most of your readers are either time poor or willfully ignorant of the majoirty of what constitutes British political blogging.
I know you can't be expected to answer for Guido, but neither you nor he has ever actually engaged with the issues at hand, and that is a serious criticism, although I must say its nothing less than i expect from someone who has political aspirations.
The whole thing, whilst vaguely entertaining, has left everyone involved looking just that bit more stupid and a hell of a lot more self-obsessed.
Hear, hear - completely in support of you Iain - or Grandmother Goose as I affectionately call you on my blog.
Let's stop fighting each other and get back to what really matters - thinking up new insults for Hazel Blears.
RS
You see Alex, your sweeping comments about 'the Left' are equally callow and wrong. Stupid though socialism may be (and I feel the same way about it as I do about conservatism), many of its adherents are perfectly affable people.
I would like to use this space to add that Tim Ireland has also used his unique style against me simply for writing a post supporting you and Guido. I have decided that I do not want him commenting on my site, he gives me the shivers. Neither will I reply to his emails demanding an explanation, so it's pointless him sending any more. And for the record Tim, I am most certainly not your "darling".
I almost expect someone, The Simpsons like, to shriek "Will someone PLEASE think of the children!!?".
Calling this a blog war seems a bit melodramatic to me, this is a storm in a tea cup and will look as such when the gloves come off (and they will) in the run up to the next General Election.
In that heated context I really can't see this fragile 'gentlemen's' agreement lasting...
Well said Iain. With so much of real consequence happening in the world this blog vs blog stuff is parochial , adolescent nonsense and more importantly a distraction from the activities of those who are actually in power. You would think that the Connaught meeting between Gordon and Rupe would be of more concern to anyone with a concern for our democracy.
Well said Iain.
Your post at least explains what was going on yesterday at Guido's. (If I'm reading between the lines correctly).
I must say all the "Iain Dale's a Liar" stuff has left me scratching my head the past week - and you've explained it rather well. I did waste 10 minutes of my life trying to follow the other blog's gripe only to find it was trivial in the extreme.
It all smacks of an Alistair Campbell - style bully/bluster/change the subject "blackmail" campaign
I just wish I knew how to do that sort of thing with a banner AND make it appear on my posts.
It was entertaining at first but then it became increasingly dull and childish. The fact that you were called "Liar, liar pants on fire" on Bloggerheads just goes to show how far things had descended. I'm glad you've made this post insofar as it might help bring the whole thing to an end.
ALEX said-but always sup with a long spoon. When push comes to shove, left-wing political belief is always based on intolerance and malice. Too many people on the Right have either forgotten, or never realised, that. ..
I do feel you have a point here Alex and those who are atracted to left wingery are often personally odious as well .There is no point pretending that your caste of mind has nothing to do with it. This is not a football team. Iain seems to want to keep a wide spectrum on side and with laudabe motives no doubt.I have often wondered if it would be possible in the end .
As CS Lewis said there are an infinite number of answers until your know which is right .Then there is one
Get over it guys. There is too much discussion of the blogosphere in the British blogosphere. There are many other things to write about. Navel-gazing is sooooo dull.
Hrm, methinks there is a great deal of jealousy involved in this whole spat. And with Guido's success it was inevitable that it was going to happen.
The fact that some in the MSM are trying to fan the flames says more about their agenda than anything else.
anon 2:40pm Tom Watson of betrayal and failed regicide fame pontificating? The nerve of that man !How did Tone describe him : "disloyal, discourteous and wrong" wasn't it? Tom should return to purdah and reconcile himself to political obscurity . He's rightly held in very low-esteem by the right and the left and any declamation of his carries zero credibility.
The left side of the British blogosphere is boring and irrelevant, so who cares what they think?
It's the same old politics of envy -- Dale, Staines and Montgomerie get noticed, lefty bloggers don't.
Get over it, comrades.
Gordon's lucky to have friends like Tom Watson and the other obsessive fella isn't he? *cough*
Interestingly, whilst this has been going on, the Blogpower War ceased some time back.
obsessive schoolschildren
Traditional spelling preferred....
When are you going to out yourself as Nick Robinson, Iain ?.
Well said I"
George Orwell.
I thank you, my blood pressure thanks you, and my sanity thanks you.
I do enjoy coming to your blog, and usually do so several times a day. But over the last fortnight, as the Tim And Guido Show spilled over to this blog, it has become increasingly uncomfortable. Tedious, annoying, and more than a little creepy. I can see why you said you felt like you had a stalker. Such obsession is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.
Let's hope the truce will hold and the previous enjoyment of being here will resume.
I am as confused by this as I am when I have been listening to the 7pm news and find myself listening to 2 mins of the Archers.
Various comments are made on this blog which refer to other blogs.
They refer to people like Tim Ireland and Tom Watson. When you follow the links they go to places called Pickled Politics or Guido 2.0.
Or you see a reference here to Manic and follow a link to a site called Bloggerheads [or it might be vice versa].
Who are all these people ? How are they related to each other ? To be honest, I care about this as much as I do the Archers, but if you are going to mention these things, you have a duty to explain yourselves.
In the same way that 'acronyms' have to be spelled out on Radio 4.
Iain
I do hope this ends this nonsence. It is beyond tiresome - it is reminiscent of how Hitler would send his brownshirts to shout down the opposition. Whowever these people are they appear to be intolerant, embittered bigots.
I had no idea who Tim Ireland was so ggoled him and find this so apt description on his website.
"He was born in Australia, spent much of his youth enjoying the status of a 'gifted' student, and then went on to struggle through his formative years at a school full of children far more gifted than himself. This led to a bitterness that pollutes the core of his being to this very day."
That bitterness seeps through in every post he makes
leon - a very interesting link there, my son, very interesting - I think it may be only a matter of time before Yasmin Alibhai Brown decides that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em...
I think Iain should have one of those little counters added to the blog to show the number of days since YAB dissed him on the box, to see how long she can hold out before joining the blogosphere..
I'm sure 'New Statesman Towers' may have some spare office space that she could utilise..
Iain,
Of course you're upsetting the likes of Watson and Ireland - well done. Most people who are attracted to your site, and Guido's are perfectly capable of sifting through the information and deciding what's true and what is wishful thinking. That's why you and Guido have the most impressive web stats. So Watson and Ireland don't like it - tough. If they want to get all bitchy, ignore them and more particularly don't give them the oxygen of publicity. It only diverts more people to their pathetic efforts and enables them to claim they are more popular than they actually are.
As Ireland has failed to grasp, there are no "rules" in the bloggosphere - which is why it's actually quite interesting. So don't sink to their level.
The Guido thing is painfully simple - either he can produce the Guardian retraction which he has been waving around all weekend like an invisible scimitar - or he cannot.
GF has made a 2nd career out of smearing - it is pathetic to spit the dummy when he gets a bit of needle in return.
As for this post, well it seems slightly ridiculous to say you won't hit back and then immediately hit back almost in the next paragraph. Iain has attempted to climb the moral high ground and promptly tumbled off.
Girls, girls, no more scratching and pulling hair, please.
Why would you say 'isn't Tim Ireland one too'? about a word you dont know the meaning of?
Your defense / explanation doesnt really make any sense.
Girls...Girls...GIRLS!!!!!!!!
Let's leave the bitchfights for Big brother shall we?
"Iain has spoken. End communication!"
A bit hard on yourself there Iain. Your communication skills are not THAT bad.
If the blogosphere wants to rise above a glorified gossip shop then it needs to set itself higher standards. We all know that the current lible laws are unrealistic and unenforceable but that is not an argument for doing nothing.
In the meantime you/Guido/whoever will continue to libel those you disagree with and they will libel you back. My approach is squabbling children (mainly my own) is to assume that they are all guilty!
If you want to assume the moral high ground Mr Dale try and put forward some constructive proposals that your rivals may accept.
Come on! If you want this - actually normal behaviour in the salons, newsgroups and chatrooms - to stop then organise your side to stop! Given the vulnerability of PE the rants about The Sith are misguided.
The attack, attack, attack and tease, tease, tease is very often coming from Fawkes and Dale, albeit in different forms. And if Yasmin is meaning that some blogging is contributing to a decline in media standards in general then she may well be right. A newspaper can quote blogger A or blogger B and run a story their legals would not otherwise allow them to run.
More glass houses and stone throwing I'm afraid. I'm new to this game and have founf myself falling into a few of the traps set by right wing bloggers and even relaying their stories. But all in all these things come and go and if there is hostility now then there will proabbly be peace in a few days time.
Tom Watson meanwhile is a politician through and through and quite able in the nuancing of truths until they are scarcely true. But at least on the ridiculous "coup" he had something to lose and promptly lost whereas the careerists tossers in his wake hardly had their size 12s on the ladder.
Alex Swanson said:
"When push comes to shove, left-wing political belief is always based on intolerance and malice. Too many people on the Right have either forgotten, or never realised, that."
The comments here insulting Tim Ireland make a mockery of this statement. Your own sentiments here are disingenuous to say the least Iain, but I'm prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt and remove the liar button from my own blog. Others will come to very different conclusions.
An Open page to Iain Dale
Seems to include everybody including Suz Blog
Allow me to be the voice of reason. You're all wrong and only I'm right.
Problem solved.
I want an apology from Watson for lying that he only visited Brown in Scotland for baby talk.
"Why would you say 'isn't Tim Ireland one too'? about a word you dont know the meaning of?"
I didn't hear the piece, but it is certainly possible for an interviewer to take a word in context and question whether it applied equally to a second person without actually knowing what the word meant. Often context will show, if not the meaning at least why that description is used, and if the same reasoning applies to the other party then it is perfectly apt to ask if the description does too.
On that note it would also back up Iain's asserion that he was only asking, not actually stating his own opinion.
My only question is why have you left the comments section open on a post in which you state repeatedly that you will not be entering into further dialogue?
Surely that would make you seem a little disingenuous in what your original post stated, wouldn't you agree? (Note the operative word: seem).
Perhaps you would like to revise the appearance you have created for yourself by issuing a further statement calling for everyone (icluding those who have posted here, both in agreement with your statement and otherwise) to cease discussing this? In which case, I would advise disabling all comments on that final final post.
I've never read Tim Ireland's blog before. It is my personal and sincere belief that he is an obsessive who has found the perfect outlet for his frustrated ambitions in posting silly e-mails in the middle of the night;
for someone in marketing he doesn't know much about user interface design.
Indeed, fancy not knowing what the word 'nihilistic' meant. Did you have a state education ?
The irony, that so many rightwingers have used the comments section of this post to continue to spout their bilious attacks is not, it appears, lost on them.
A bit of self-awareness wouldn't go amiss methinks.
The same principle is contained in the famous words of Voltaire: ‘I detest what you say; I will defend to the death your right to say it.’
One day someone will reference this claim to Voltaire until then we must ascribe it to a biographer c.1900 who probably had a Boris Johnson facility with quotations
Another Brownite cabal's plot ends in ignominious diaster and humiliation.
dynamite [2.58 pm] You say, "Stupid though socialism may be ... many of its adherents are perfectly affable people."
True, but they often have a blind spot. They think that any reasonable person can only agree with them; ergo that anyone who disagrees with them must be actuated by malice.
Bullies like to claim that some superior calling justifies their persecution. Most witch-hunts begin with sanctimonious self-approbation . Tom and those he manipulates on behalf of Gordon have shown their tendency to resort to authoritarian pack-instinct brutality and victimization. You've handled yourself with dignity Iain.
Iain duck the netcops have caught up with you ,where ever you go they are there ,you will blog the way we say , singing to mr Blair's band I presume ,and yes I have being looking at the different blogs ,and I did see BNP ,guess what guy's I dont give a toss , I like Guido's and Ian's blog and as long as they carry on I will read them.
Iain, we're with you all the way - your traffic will reflect this fact! As a new blogger, I suppose I've got all this to look forward to?
Is Time Ireland a Fib Dum by any chance?
Iain, I commend your interview style: asking leading questions using words you don't understand. Well done.
In the spirit of reaching out to those who seem to have developed an unhealthy obsession with me...
You've got to admire the shear audacity of that.
How nice a rating's war ,lobster seems to like his stats ,Iain the hustings seems to have started ,oh joy , enjoy your blogging but not your tie's , do you want to call me nothing ,everybody else does.
The basic problem is that some people are having to taste their own medicine. Having had years of a left wing agenda with the BBC taking the lead, they do not like the right fighting back. They do not like it on the back foot as you experienced with Polly Toynbe.
Iain dont let them get you down just keep to the facts and the truth.
As to flame wars - well, one time I got Matt Gwier to shut up........
I remember when Tailwind broke. The good old MSM got all upset because their trousers were down and the blinds were up... and along came the complaints of the "right-wing conspiracy on the Internet".
Piece of advice to those muttering about conservative think tanks et al. If you have got a legitimate complaint, make it to the Charity Commission. Do something. Sitting around muttering about how your big mate will make them all pay is lame. Guido has got his spade out and done something. Iain has started the beginings of something. What have you done apart from whine?
Tim Ireland/ Manic/ Guido 2.0 is quite simply a loon. He has no insight into this condition of his, and so there is no point in challenging him. Best to turn the other cheek, or it will wind him up even further. I think Ellee summed it up nicely: "he gives me the shivers". Well done, Ellee!! Keep up the good work, Iain.
Must say that I was getting really fed up with the nasty, spiteful, uncalled for and highly offensive postings here, some of which were ratcheted out at 3 minute intervals by the same contributor. What the point of that was is anyone's guess, but I sincerely hope it has now ended.
Anyway Iain, you were perfectly correct and courageous to tackle this as you did.
Tim is I suspect slighly bitter that he Iain and Guido came to blogging later than him and overtook him so massively in popularity.
Tim Ireland's blog big problem is a complete lack generosity of spirit or sense of humour. That and an inability to learn basic blogging lessons such as keep your post's short. So while he may in the short term have a spike in traffic it won't last.
His tenacity which is his main tactic for getting attention just makes him look weird. Tim in a very real sense needs to get some perspective and I suspect a life.
Timmy Ireland always used to be sooooooo boring and po faced. At least all this blogwars stuff has made him a bit more interesting. Lets be thankful for small mercies.
Personally speaking, I knew Guido's identity from his Wikipedia entry months ago because I have worked on the Wikipedia myself over the years (it's not as much fun as it used to be).
Although I don't particularly like his background or his blog, the fact is that dance music has been one of my passions over the years and I am grateful for the fact that I have, by and large, been able to live a free life in a liberal democracy like this one.
I have really enjoyed the last few months. Dammit, I just bought five seasons of 24 partly because of your say-so. I am old enough and wise enough to make up my own mind and no trivial argument in the blogosphere is going to make any difference.
Just had a look at what Mr Ireland has to say.
Sounds like he's blogging from a bar stool in a smoky old working men's club - presumably because the other regulars have taken to avoiding him.
Blogging should be about ideas and commentary - if you haven't got anything useful to say, certainly don't have a blog.
Are bloggers allowed to criticise Gordon Brown or hasve the self-appointed moral guardians (tom, tim et al) decided, along with Rupert, that he's inviolable?
Bloody hell, Iain, you do pose some difficult issues for your loyal readers. Nevertheless, I've taken you at your word and posed the question to the regulars at the Globe Inn down the road. What I said was, " That Iain Dale says, the reaction of my accusers will go a long way to demonstrating whether the British blogosphere moves beyond its tendency to self-obsess or not. Anyone got summat to say about that?"
They were all very polite, but I got the feeling they might have had other things to think about.
Rob said...
"Hmmm - I'm in a similar position to you right now Iain".
That's Rob Fenwick the "love me I'm a god and can do no wrong. My partner plays an Oboe", LibDem kid.
The obnoxious twit. How dare he compare himself with Iain Dale. He's not in the same league. Not fit to lick his boots.
I can't hear myself think in the Corner Shop today, my customers are going mental!
Walk quietly and carry a big stick!
Surely the point is that no-one is forced to read any blog, no-one has to pay a licence fee to bloggers, and no-one has to purchase a daily view of a blog - so if anyone doesn't like what Iain says, or the way that he says it, s/he can just go away.
Iain, ignore the loon and the semi-literate MP, I find your site interesting and informative, and I'm grateful for the information I get from you, Guido, and all the lively, amusing and informative posters.
Can we get back to poking Prescott with a stick now? :¬)
Iain,
In the past few days you have shown an amazing amount of restraint, particularly in response to a certain Antipodean nutter.
This guy needs professional help. He obviously has certain talents (like putting Boris Johnson's web site together) but his recent behaviour against yourself and Guido would worry anyone.
Best ignore him...he's not worth it.
I have been warned to stay clear of this untidy business but I run over quickly and give you a big hug 'cause I know you're a good boy - or at least you were when I knew ye.....xxx
henderson 10.48pm
Gordo is inviolable?
That's not what I've heard.
"I think Ellee summed it up nicely: "he gives me the shivers""
Must admit that when I discovered that he had picked my comment on Guido's site today as the "One" I found it a bit creepy. I hope that he and his friends get a life shortly.
That is the problem with discussion that take place outside of the pub -- not only do people utter fighting words from a safe distance, they also get petty and mean because they all too often forget that this collection of letters on the screen is actually another living, breathing human being.
Classic case of netrage, I'm afraid, or, to update the term, 'blograge'.
Und willst du nicht mein Bruder sein, dann schreib ich dir die Ehre klein...
You seem to be defining blog war as people having a go at you. I think perhaps you need to get out more. I was blissfully unaware of this spat before I read this post and I shall be making no efforts to find out more now.
I'm a lifelong Labour voter (until Iraq, that is). I consider Iain's and Guido's blogs to be an essential part of the democratic process, and applaud both of them in their efforts to uncover what the Labour Party is trying so hard to cover up. Quite *what* part democracy plays in our country any more is hard to say, but it's not a given any more, and this bunch would gladly take it away at the drop of a hat, so authoritarian and so paranoid have they got.
Keep up the good work, Iain & Guido.
I read some of the bloggerheads site and rather wish I hadn't as I now feel unclean. It isn't a very good site considering its creator is supposed to be a technowhiz. I guess the diatribe against Dale and Guido is motivated by jealousy due to the fact that these "amateurs" have probably the most successful blogs in the country, if not the planet.
May I just say that I come to this with no particular loyalty to any of the blogs involved, and I have to say Iain that your defence of yourself is a little disingenuous.
Tim Ireland/Manic's original criticism was of Guido's comments policy. Guido has not responded to that. His double standards when faced with some revelations about his own past - comparable to his own variety of political gossip - is telling.
Your own involvement, calling/impliedly calling Tim Ireland a "nihilist" then calling someone a liar when they pointed to this, has not been dealt with. Your semi-apology is a bit pathetic I'm afraid.
The rather unpleasant name calling I've seen in these comments are more personal and nasty than any I have seen on any "left wing" sites on this issue, so whoever it was who said that "the left" is characterised by malice and intolerance is really living in a glass house.
Take a good look at yourselves people before casting stones.
As Private Eye and Michael Crick have both raised questions about the Smith Institute will they be subjected to similar unpleasantness on behalf of Gordon's thugs in the blogosphere?
To "the great terror" - if you think any of this is about "Gordon's thugs" then you really haven't been reading the blogs that you are criticising.
The issue raised by some bloggers about the piece on the Smith Insitute was not whether or not it was breaking the rules on charities - it may well be doing so - but that Iain Dale is himself a trustee of a very similar think tank, but failed to declare that. That absence of any such declaration casts doubt on his bona fides in that case.
Look, erm, can't...can't, well, I mean, can't we all, all of us.. can't we all, j-j-just, get along???
I have gone through the posts on this thread today and deleted several anonymous posts which were offensive - not to me but to others. I'm going to be much tougher on this in future. Too many people think they can post anynoymous rubbish on here and get away with it. No longer.
Well said, Iain. Further squabbles only undermine the respectable image bloggers are trying to cultivate, and give further ammunition to the "old" media and their anti-blogging agenda.
Katherine you're a little wide-eyed, aren't you aware of Tom Watson's relationship with Tim Ireland?
"you really haven't been reading the blogs that you are criticising."
No one does, that why the authors of these blogs have re-located here Katherine, like pilot fish.
The lack of loyalty of these nu-lab types is incredible, they're cheerfully blithe to attacks on Tony these days, but discover a rancid self-righteousness when anyone dares question the cult of personality of Gordon. I almost feel sympathy for TB, really. What posessed these blogging nitwits to make a 'moral' stand on behalf of Gordon's squalid Smith Institute? I think Gordon has all the help he needs with Rupert on board.
I've had an Iain fueding with me on my blog. I am ignoring him and his 17-year-old fans. I'm talking about radio presnter, Iain Lee. not Iain Dale, of course.
Blog wars are good for readership. Just like on "Big Brother," controvesy is good for ratings. People grow bored with "love fests."
Iain - Never explain, never apologise. It doesn't do any good at all.
Someone anonymous said:....
That misrepresents the situation completely. Tim Ireland has been around the British political scene for years. He knows how it works. It's newcomers like Iain Dale and Paul Staines who are the clueless "Septembrists" here.
"blog purge", my point was that the criticism from "the great terror" accusing other bloggers of being Gordon Brown's thugs was coming from a point of ignorance, since they clearly hadn't read the blogs in question.
Since you have now confirmed that point, perhaps "the great terror" could perhaps conclude, in a spirit of openness and honesty, that he has no idea whether or not those bloggers are Gordon's thugs and that therefore his comment has no merit.
And the poster calling themselves "ingenuos innocence" - why don't you tell me about Tom Watson's connection to Tim Ireland instead of implying something. Honestly, just come out with it. I've been reading all this stuff from a point of view of having no point of view. I am merely voicing an opinion from the outside. If you have something to add to the debate, then do so with cold hard facts and I'll be grateful.
Katherine: Tim Ireland helped Tom Watson get blogging in the first place (both, if I remember correctly, in selling the idea of blogging and also sorting out the technical side of things).
[Apologies for lowering the tone of the comments by being polite and factual. I'm sure others can resume the insults and innuendo momentarily.]
Okay, Mark P - now you've told me the link between Tom Watson and Tim Ireland (and thank you for that) - now would you care to tell me how it fits into this whole debacle? What are you suggesting is the result of this link?
Katherine - I have no inside information as to what other people are wanting to imply, sorry!Search Issue Tracker

I'm Jon Corpora, Managing Editor of magic.tcgplayer.com, and these are the best-selling cards of the past week. Let's get into it.
Before Iconic Masters, Thought Scour hadn't been printed since 2014, and since it's a key part of a couple Modern decks, demand for it is high. Now that there's a reprint, players can finally get their hands on this delve-enabling, graveyard-filling card.
Lightning Strike's been near the top of our best-sellers since Ixalan came out. The fact that it was in an Invitational-winning Temur Energy deck puts it over the top this week.
Like an extreme version of Thought Scour, Mishra's Bauble was in short supply and high demand. Thanks to its appearance in Iconic Masters, now everyone can afford to play a 56-card deck.
I don't know how big the margins are on uncommons, but if you can pick them up for close to nothing, they are remarkably easy to move. Kitesail Freebooter has been a reliable seller for months.
Same with Unclaimed Territory. I will say that it helps that these cards are great in Modern too.
You can definitely lump in Merfolk Branchwalker in with these. It's a good, tribal card, but its role in the new blue-green Merfolk Modern deck put it over the top.
I'll come clean—I have no clue why Faerie Miscreant, of all things, is selling well. My guess is that players are banking on Rivals of Ixalan supporting either Faeries or Rogues, or people just really like the mono-blue Pauper deck. I have no clue. I'm open to ideas.
Kumena's Speaker, like Merfolk Branchwalker, also plays a huge part in making the blue-green Merfolk deck competitive in Modern.
#####CARDID= 38635#####
Speaking of competitive in Modern, you can't shake a stick in that format without hitting an Opt these days.
However, the best-selling cards are pre-sales of the Unstable basics. I expect these cards to be on top of things for a long, long time, so get used to it.

Emotional intelligence refers to one’s ability to determinedlychoose their thoughts, actions, and feelings to achieve optimaloutcomes in their relationship with others. It has become a populartopic due to its capacity to evaluate potentially effective leadersand to develop useful leadership skills. Since it is an umbrella ideain both academic and organizational environment, it is highly studiedin the psychological literature. It has stirred interest among manymanagers and researchers and has become one of the most evidentconcepts in the study of individual differences. It has a remarkableeffect on different results. These results include academic, career,life, psychological well-being, and health. Indeed, emotions form aninseparable and integral fragment of an organizational life. Thosewho are adept emotionally, who consciously and artfully choose andmanage their actions, feelings, and thoughts well, and who study anddeal with other people’s feelings effectively are an advantage inan organization. When an individual uses their emotions effectively,their problem-solving skills, thinking, creativity, efficiency, andreasoning will improve. Emotional intelligence forms the anchorage onwhich emotional competencies are built. These skills lead toperformance, thus, form an integral part of effective leadership.This paper critically evaluates the viewpoint that emotionalintelligence competencies need to be developed to improve effectiveleadership.
Emotional Intelligence Competencies Improve Leadership Skills
Given that organizational environment keeps changing, leadershippositions need more than just technical know-how or taskcompetencies. Undeniably, emotional skills are necessary foreffective leadership [ CITATION Tea14 l 1033 ]. Therefore, effectiveleaders must have emotional intelligence capabilities to allow themto react to different incidents successfully. These skills becomeessential as individuals rise within organizational hierarchies.Effective leaders have one thing in common: All of them havedeveloped emotional intelligence competencies[ CITATION Otu16 l 1033 ].That implies that these skills are necessary to lead effectively.Leaders with the ability to recognize emotions accurately have higherratings on transformational governance behavior. Besides, they havegreater interpersonal sensitivity than those who depend on contingentreward behavior. There is a positive relationship between emotionalintelligence competencies and transformational leadership conducts [ CITATION Gol12 l 1033 ].This kind of leadership is most effective since a leader is firmlyengaged with their followers beyond predictable transactionalexchanges. Furthermore, it is predictive of both organizational andindividual results [ CITATION Fer14 l 1033 ].
For leaders to have this kind of leadership, it is imperative forthem to have confidence in their ability to handle their emotions aswell as others’ emotions [ CITATION Cas12 l 1033 ]. Emotionalintelligence competencies enable one to deal with stressfulcircumstances, prevent them from losing control, and give them theability to maintain a cool composure while relating with other peopleeven when faced with intense emotional experiences [ CITATION Gol12 l 1033 ].They also make an individual more confident in their capability toinfluence and control life events and intellectually motivate others.Leaders with high emotional intelligence competencies find managingothers less challenging[ CITATION Bat13 l 1033 ].
Since organizational rules keep changing rapidly, new standards areused to evaluate people’s performance. Evaluation not only is thelevel of expertise one has acquired or by how smart or brilliant theyare but also by how well one can handle their feelings, thoughts, oremotions [ CITATION Nel12 l 1033 ]. This new index does not focus ontechnical know-how, intellectual or academic capabilities butrather, it focuses on personal traits such as persuasiveness,trustworthiness, initiative, empathy, influence, and adaptability [ CITATION Udo12 l 1033 ].
To accomplish the results, which most training programs bring, forinstance, personal development and improved job performance, one mustpossess emotional intelligence competencies. These skills are usefulto achieve long-lasting results [ CITATION Udo12 l 1033 ]. They canbe developed through improving emotional intelligence. Moreover, theyfocus on the behaviors that enhance performance and are measuredusing the Emotional Competence Inventory (ECI). This model involvesviewing emotional intelligence as a massive array of competencies anddispositions, which range from personal qualities to learnedabilities. Despite the fact that emotional intelligence skills aredeeply embedded in emotional intelligence, they are a higherproficiency that leads to improved performance. In summary, everyonehas the emotional intelligence potential however, they need todevelop emotional intelligence competencies to be great leaders.Emotional intelligence forms the core of these skills, which,consequently, establish the antecedents of improved performance. Thatmeans that a high level of emotional intelligence alone is notsufficient to acquire excellent leadership skills[ CITATION Vai14 l 1033 ].
Those with elevated levels of emotional intelligence possess theability to learn and develop some competencies. Emotionalintelligence is somehow inherent, while emotional intelligence skillsare developed through learning and development. Leadership entailsinfluencing people and offering the necessary direction and guidance[ CITATION Cas12 l 1033 ]. Effective leaders are considered to bedisciplined and adept in handling workload, dealing with stressfulconditions, communicating organizational goals, and polishing otherpeople’s performance [ CITATION Nad12 l 1033 ]. Emotionalintelligence competencies enable leaders to address their subjectsempathically, build high quality relations with them, and strengthentheir trust in and identification with the leader. These skillsinclude self-motivation, self-management, self-awareness,relationship management, and social awareness [ CITATION Rob13 l 1033 ].
Self-motivation refers to the passion, which someone has to dosomething for motives that go beyond status or money. Leaders withself-motivation work consistently to achieve their goals. It improvesleadership skills since it makes a manager know their stand, behopeful, and re-examine. It involves having an intense passion forthe job, or position one has first, and then other things follow. Todevelop this competency, one must appreciate commitment, initiative,optimism, and achievement. Commitment means having the will to makesacrifices to achieve organizational objectives. It helps a leader toput up with traumatic working conditions and challenges and remaincommitted to their course. The initiative requires being ready topursue set aspirations persistently, grasp opportunities available,bend the rules and regulations if need be to achieve a particulargoal, and influence and marshal other people to perform. Leaders whohave initiative are less likely to be hopeless and give up. Optimismimplies being able to interpret setbacks. Having it gives managersthe ability to perceive setbacks as a chance to re-strategize.Adopting an optimistic mindset takes practice though, it is worthit. Confident leaders always learn something good amidst a failure orchallenge. Achievement involves being result oriented, settingchallenging objectives, and taking calculated risks (Vaida, 2014).
Self-management, also known as self-regulation, refers to one’sability to redirect or manage disruptive moods or impulses andstressful feeling. Leaders who regulate themselves hardly attackothers verbally, make emotional or rushed decisions, compromise orstereotype their values. They can stay in control [ CITATION Fon16 l 1033 ].To develop this competency, they must have innovation,trustworthiness, adaptability, emotional self-control, andconscientiousness. Innovation implies being highly open to new ideas.Trustworthiness means admitting own mistakes, being highlyprincipled, confronting unethical behaviors in other people, behavingin a moral manner, and building trust with genuineness. Adaptabilityentails being flexible in reacting to change. Emotional self-controlimplies being able to manage one’s impulsive feelings anddistressing emotions effectively and stay composed and positiveamidst stressful circumstances. Conscientiousness involves beingscrupulous, self-disciplined, careful, and punctual (Batool, 2013).Indeed, great leaders can manage themselves effectively since theyknow their values, hold themselves accountable, and practice beingtranquil.
Self-awareness refers to an individual’s ability to recognize andunderstand their emotions, needs, strengths, weaknesses, drives, andmoods and their impact on others. Having self-awareness in aleadership position means having humility and a clear picture ofone’s strengths and weaknesses [ CITATION CRE14 l 1033 ]. Thatforms the foundation on which the other competencies of emotionalintelligence are built. It serves as the basis for the emotional andpsychological advancement required to improve leadership skills. Itimplies knowing oneself [ CITATION Dil12 l 1033 ]. It is importantto have self-confidence, self-assessment, and emotional awareness todevelop self-awareness. That can be done through writing thoughts ina journal. Self-confidence is about self-assurance, being decisive,ability to make decisions amidst pressures and uncertainties, andability to make right judgments. Self-assessment is about the abilityto deeply understand one’s personal sources, limits, andcapabilities. Emotional awareness is about the impact of leaders’emotions on their performance as well as their ability to use theirvalues to make decisions. Indeed, the superior performance of greatleaders is based on these competencies (Otuedon, 2016).
Relationship management refers to one’s ability to effectivelymanage relations using the awareness of their emotions as well asthose of other people. Managing relationships will allow leaders toview the importance of relating with people from diverse backgrounds.This competency enables leaders to solve conflicts efficiently,communicate well with others, and inspire the loyalty of theirsubjects. Researchers have found out that trust can result incooperative behaviors among people. Conversely, those who frequentlyexperience anger have higher chances of experiencing difficulties inrelating well with other people and prompting their trust. Developingthis competency involves conflict management, communication, the actof influence, inspirational leadership, building bonds, cooperation,teamwork, and driving change. Conflict management entails the abilityto handle difficult situations and people with tact [ CITATION Dil12 l 1033 ].Communication involves being able to listen well to other people,accommodate information sharing, and strive for a commonunderstanding with other people [ CITATION Has12 l 1033 ]. Influenceinvolves handling other people’s emotions. Inspirational leadershipimplies being able to influence other people to follow or pursue aparticular course. Building bonds mean being able to seek mutuallybeneficial relationships, maintain personal friendships, andcultivate natural links. Cooperation involves the ability to workwell with other people to accomplish an agreed or common objective.Teamwork implies being capable of working efficiently in teams.Leading change means being capable of recognizing the necessity ofchange, challenge the status quo, and eliminate barriers. Those withthe ability to drive change are considered to be agents of change [ CITATION Bru12 l 1033 ].
Social awareness, also known as empathy, refers to the capability ofan individual to view other people’s emotions accurately andcomprehend what is impacting them. This competency is very vital toleading an organization effectively since it makes leaders payattention to body language, respond positively to feelings, and putthemselves in other people’s positions. It is also the ability toappreciate other people’s emotional makeup and is the basis ofbuilding all the other social competencies. It implicates beingcapable of sensing what others feel without them mentioning. Thiscompetency is helpful to improve leadership skills because itinvolves understanding other people, developing others, serviceorientation, political awareness, and leverage on diversity. When oneunderstands others, they can sense their feelings and perspectives [ CITATION Bru12 l 1033 ].When one has service orientation, they understand the needs of otherpeople and match them to the services offered. Developing othersimply providing a useful response, acknowledging and rewarding theachievements of other people, identifying other people’s need toimprove, giving apt coaching, and mentoring others [ CITATION Che12 l 1033 ].Those who possess strengths in diversity relate well with people fromvarying and diverse backgrounds and respect them, mind groupdifferences, see the importance of diversity, and understand theapproach to life based on context. Political awareness involvesrecognizing the primary power relationships in one’s environmentand understanding the forces, which shape actions (Robbins &Judge, 2013).
Conclusion
Emotional intelligence forms the building block for the developmentof emotional competencies. Therefore, it is right to conclude thatemotional skills are a result of emotional intelligence. Due to therapid pace at which the world of work changes, there is the need foremotional intelligence competencies. These abilities are vital toachieving success. The effectiveness of an individual’s leadershipskills can be assessed by evaluating the emotional intelligencecompetencies the person has developed. These skills expand a leader’spotential for personal impact, and their effects are contagious,resulting in inspiration and energy.

If you're hoping to develop your small business online marketing strategy, you've gone to the perfect spot. Today, LinkedIn is perhaps the most well-known social media platform for organizations and experts hoping to improve their networks. LinkedIn is estimated to have more than 660 million users around the world.
In case you're not utilizing this incredible platform for your small business in 2021, you're passing up a significant chance to grow your business as a small business owner. The following are 6 of the best LinkedIn advertising methods that you can carry out to assist with scaling your organization's online presence and creating your lead gen form.
Build Your Professional and Personal Brand
Setting up a professional brand is fundamental to relationship building on LinkedIn. Building relationships with your target audience and customers is critical because individuals are likely to purchase from those they know, like, and trust. This is harder to accomplish in the present digital world, where we need to depend on our digital brands to get our target audiences to the "know, like, and trust" stage.
As a social media platform for business experts, different types of LinkedIn Ads are most viably utilized by entrepreneurs who make both a LinkedIn individual profile and an organizational page. Both of these resources will showcase you and your business in a professional light when you have a conversion tracking system in place for you or your business in LinkedIn - and frequently Google ads - search results.
To make an incredible professional brand, make sure that your own LinkedIn profile is professional and complete.
Your profile visitors should have the option to learn rapidly regarding who you mean to serve, what you offer, and why they should pay attention to you. Your credibility can be additionally enhanced by the Recommendations and Skill Endorsements part of your profile - you should intend to have somewhere around five LinkedIn recommendations from individuals who can attest to your abilities.
And while your profile will do the majority of the work on LinkedIn (because individuals associate with individuals, not logos), you additionally need to make a LinkedIn organizational page for your business. This is crucial regardless of whether you're a solopreneur, advisor, or freelancer. Again, your organizational page should be complete, addressing you and your business in the manner that you need your target customers to see you.
A finished LinkedIn organizational page with an appropriate logo solves two problems at once:
- It gives extra opportunities for your business to be found in the search results for the services you offer, and
- It guarantees that your organization looks genuine on both your own and your employees’ profiles.
Track Down Highly Targeted Customers And Connections
The targeting on LinkedIn is unrivaled in the domain of digital ad campaigns. Small companies can focus on the specific industry, company size, and job title [of the people] that they know that would commonly purchase their item or service. For instance, if you are selling customer support software to small ventures in the United States, you can set your marketing efforts to just be appearing to organizations [that have] under 100 employees, situated in America – and inside that grouping, just to leaders at those organizations with a customer-support title.
Continuously Analyze Your Competition
This is a vital stage in practically any sort of business activity!
All things considered, if you want your small business to be competitive against other leading names in your industry, you'll need to know what they're up to and why they’re so successful.
We recommend identifying 5-10 small, medium, and large scale contenders. Then, at that point, set aside the time to look at their LinkedIn pages. Zero in on: the kinds of content that they are posting, the points that are vital to them as well as who their audiences are.
You would rather not just duplicate what your rivals are doing on LinkedIn – however, it is a decent practice to identify the techniques that they are using to acquire inspiration for your own ad copy.
Establish Your Expertise On Your Topic
This tactic is tied in with encouraging the feeling of "know, like, and trust" among your target customers and networking towards brand awareness. To win trust, you have to show that you know what you're saying - at the end of the day, you want to establish your expertise on your topic. You can do this by sharing content and assets that your ideal customers will find of significant worth.
When you curate content, make sure that the articles you share look professional, and tackle an issue or challenge your ideal customers are facing. Further, give your viewpoint or perspective on the material. Your ideal customers can find this content somewhere else - what will make it special is your viewpoint on it.
If you have the right skills and assets, you should likewise make and share your own unique sponsored content. You can post it is as announcements or long-form articles through LinkedIn Publisher. The content you make should be 100% customer-centered and important to your target customers.
You do this by identifying their concerns and difficulties and afterward making content that offers answers for those difficulties. If you know where they're coming from, and what their motivations are, and you communicate in their language, you'll have the option to connect with them genuinely and develop trust.
You might be hesitant to give your ideal customers a complete step-by-step guide for tackling their difficulties for free. However, assuming you want to establish yourself as an expert, and develop trust, you should share your knowledge. Remember that you're taking care of just miniature issues in your content - your ideal audience will still have challenges that they'll pay you to address. Sharing your absolute best tips and strategies will situate you as a specialist, and create more interest in what you offer.
Certain individuals will consistently be happy to pay for the services of a specialist because they don’t have the time or the desire to do it alone. By parting with your best data, you position yourself as a trusted expert in your field. When they conclude that they need a service or an item like yours, they'll consider you.
Stay On Your Customers' Radars
Your organization should produce leads on LinkedIn. You should know what sort of individuals make high-quality customers. You should do a search on LinkedIn for individuals who fit the criteria for your business, and afterward, introduce your brand to them. Then you should keep in contact with individuals who have communicated interest utilizing LinkedIn. You should also do daily business updates and weekly LinkedIn blog entries to keep your name in front of your network. You should additionally send monthly emails that share data about the sorts of issues you can solve for your clients and share the outcomes you have accomplished with other clients. You should also make offers, for example, inviting individuals to an online course or offering a whitepaper. The outcome is a basic, cheap, efficient process of doing lead generation, with everything being accomplished through LinkedIn.
Update Your Images and Banner Regularly
Think about your LinkedIn page's profile picture and banner as the face of your business. Think about this: it's the main thing that individuals will take a look at when they open up your organization's page. According to LinkedIn, small business owner pages that have amazing profile banners and pictures have 6 times more organic visits than those without and you can leverage this strategy to make sure that your visitors go to your various landing pages to get sales.
Before you do something else, ensure that all of your organization's LinkedIn pictures are updated. Your initial impression will be a lasting one!
Final Thoughts:

This 1973 Chevrolet Suburban Cheyenne Super Estate was sold new by Les Shellabarger Chevrolet in Grand Junction, Colorado, and was the subject of a refurbishment carried out in Kansas under previous ownership in 2006. Work included a repaint in Spanish Gold and reupholstery of the interior in brown, while later modifications included installing a 4″ suspension lift and 17″ Mickey Thompson aluminum wheels. Power is provided by a rebuilt 350ci V8 mated to a three-speed automatic transmission with a dual-range transfer case, and factory equipment includes air conditioning, wood grain exterior trim, an electric tailgate window, and a 30-gallon fuel tank. The truck was recently acquired by the selling dealer following time in a private Canadian collection, and maintenance performed in preparation of the sale included an air conditioning recharge. This Suburban is now offered with a window sticker, Service Parts Identification and warranty cards, and a Wyoming title.
The body was reportedly removed from the frame prior to being media blasted and painted in Spanish Gold with woodgrain trim during an early-2000s refurbishment. Features include a chrome front grille and bumpers, a split tailgate with an electric window, a side-exit exhaust, and Cheyenne Super fender badging.
The 17″ Mickey Thompson Classic III polished aluminum wheels are mounted with 35×12.5″ Nitto Mud Grappler Extreme Terrain tires all around. The suspension is raised approximately 4″ according to the selling dealer.
The refurbished cabin features bench seating trimmed in brown cloth and vinyl, along with body-color metal surfaces and matching carpets. Amenities include front and rear air conditioning, power steering, third-row seating, and a push-button radio.
The two-spoke steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 46k miles, and true mileage is unknown.

Or as Gary Linekar might say, brick by brick. Destroying what's there and then building back better ie. raiding the piggy-bank of their own populations to strengthen their monolopy on global assets and wealth.Symonds and her toyboy look like they have some explaining to do as it appears one of their chief cronies has spilled the beans on the credibility of their shabby claims to be guardian angels of the NHS. Meanwhile, it appears that the poliical elite have now discovered that the virus emerged from a laboratory in China. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion

***... but woke is an inversion which actually means asleep ...***
In much the same way as "saving the NHS" really means the government securing copyright to the brand-name itself, while 'outsourcing' as many services as possible and merging medical practices into larger units ready for takeover and privatisation by US hedge-funds and private 'health' extortionists.
Slice by slice, just as Hancock, other government ministers and their so-called "expert" advisers and apparatchiks always intended.
Likewise the latest absurd drivel from Boris about being (self appointed) sheriff of the China Sea. To impose what amounts to a "rules based" US imperial dictatorship -- which despite Boris trying to fool the public by merging the two, is *not* at all the same as "international law".
If international law truly meant so much to Symond's toyboy he would be demanding that the US remove its illegal military bases in Syria, and that his own regime stop playing a very active role in Saudi aggression against Yemen.
'Inversions' are indeed abounding.

Yes exactly but woke is an inversion which actually means asleep. If you can manipulate people into identifying with ever narrower labels and groups by getting them to be "offended" and disconnecting them from who they reallly are you can play them off against each other. People go on about it's the right, it's the left. Economic theory is played off against economic theory, political party is played off against political party. But if you look up from the gameshow, the same few hands are pulling all the strings. So whether you are left, right, male, female, black, white, Christian, Muslim, Conservative, Labour, it doesn't matter, to the agenda. And for those who are unaware of how this global cult works gotcha, they move to the next stage on the road.

It isn’t just the uk currency that will be debased. The US dollar, and the Euro will all go the same way as they are all desperately printing money to keep themselves afloat.
China is de-dollarising. Every time they receive dollars they exchange them for physical assets of commodities like copper, or iron ore or gold and silver. Or they buy up western assets like real estate. Shopping malls, banks or harbours. The US has off-shored its manufacturing base to China as has Europe. As the western currencies weaken, the vast number of goods we take for granted, including essentials will get ever more expensive.

I see woke as a marketing device. No customer can be offended and no company can look bad. They can erode wages, destroy job stability, avoid taxation and refuse to pay out on insurance, but we have to see them as nice people. It's a soft drink teaching the world to sing and don't ask questions about tooth decay or obesity thing. Universities are not places of indoctrination or education, so much as they are businesses with customers to placate. They have consumers from all walks of life and from all over the world. They do not want to offend potential investors.
Years ago, when I was a student, I did temp work in a big book warehouse. The pay was atrocious, the hours appalling, but during the induction day the floor managers talked up the idea community and the importance of a friendly atmosphere. I lasted a week before one of the supervisors took me aside for scowling too much or something or other. Luckily, I wasn't reliant on the wages to live on. There were lots of other temp workers who were. That is what I think is really happening in the world today. Lots and lots of desperate people being expected to smile at their financial entrapment and lack of power. All of it drenched in the PR language of tolerance.

About Jonty Bravery: having spent half my childhood in a country with minimal drug abuse, and visited schizophrenic family friends in psychiatric wards, I feel obliged to point out that many people do become seriously unhinged - and in some cases sent to mental institutions permanently - without having any history of consuming psychotropics up to that point. The notion that people who are mentally ill must have become so by doing something that (to use a phrase I've seen Mr H use before) 'threw off their reason' is a quaint and curious one, especially considering all that's in the medical literature.
A child psychiatrist once told me that considering all that can go wrong, it's a wonder that anyone turns out right. For me, I just count my blessings that I've had the good fortune never to have been sectioned before, instead of thinking that most people who've been committed must have have brought it upon themselves in some way.

The word on the street is that prices are rising, so it must be true. And we have reached the point when bleeding heart liberals are saying travelers from India should not be allowed in. I am sure Boris will oblige with his trading fixations. With the weather improving and the population (hopefully) rattling their cages, it looks like we are entering a silly season which should tax the authorities' ability to give with one hand and take away with the other. The show must go on just in case folk will think we are back to normal.

In my view Woke is nothing more than the oldest trick in the book. Namely “divide and rule.” Or Divide and conquer. Roman Emperors would have understood it much better than our gormless politicians. Or perhaps they know exactly what they are doing? A society divided by race, gender, sexual orientation. Where as soon as one group is elevated to victim status, a new group is introduced to push them down again. Look how the feminist movement is now attacked by transgenderism.
Meanwhile our corporate/communist elites are rigging the market system for their own benefit, and becoming richer and richer. What is funny is the left cheer the wealth divide on because all the elites have to do is drape themselves in the flag of do gooding wokeism Machiavelli would approve.

We now know just why the BBC have been headlining with covid ‘deaths’ in India. Scary stories about deaths totals that are in fact still less than ONE TENTH of the ‘deaths’ per million in the UK.
Now we have it confirmed by Boris. As soon as any new variant, and there are literally thousands of them knocking around at any time, shows virulence, we will be threatened to be placed back under the governmental thumb once again. Once we get into the late 2021 flu season we will all be firmly back under the thumb.
No longer can people be trusted to know what’s best for themselves or their families.
We have to be told what to do by the Science, bent and stretched by politicians to suit their longer term aims.
It’s disgusting. No, not the control of people’s lives and futures by nincompoops like Boris and Hancock.
What disgusts me is the pathetic and apathetic population that most people have let themselves become.

Posted by: Jonathan Palmer | 15 May 2021 at 08:03 AM
So Mr Johnson is now hinting he might not end lockdown properly after all on account of the "new Indian Variant", and of course SAGE are "looking on the bright side" again predicting 1000 deaths a day of it if we don't lockdown again.
So let's see where this mentality goes.
This week it's the Indian Variant, and then another few weeks or months will go by and it will be the French/Spanish/Russian/Turkish/German etc. etc. variant, and then it will be variant of the Indian variant and so it goes on *forever*...
So therefore with this mentality lockdown goes on forever.
So now it is time to ask the question once again (which unfortunately nobody with access to government or the predominant media ever does).
i.e. no doubt this new Indian variant is like "Covid-19-Classic/Original" only dangerous to the old and/or vulnerable.
So the I would suggest £1trillion pound question (because that's probably what lockdown is costing us in debt every couple of years, now we're on our way to a second year in lockdown) is, as it was from the beginning:
as this virus is only deadly to the old and vulnerable (like nearly every other respiratory virus throughout recorded history) why are we not merely protecting the old and vulnerable and letting life carry on as normal for everybody else?
Because not only is lockdown proven seriously damaging to everybody's future, apart from arguably the *unproven* small minority that have been allegedly saved by it, it is also as stated above an act of *extreme economic irresponsibility*, an act of national economic and industrial self-sabotage, that if there were any courts and judges worth the name any more, should have our current leaders dismissed as *unfit for office* and acting outside of any democratic mandate, as these unprecedented mass imprisonment measures and acting recklessly to destroy the economy were *never* in any manifesto.
The perhaps single ray of hope is that Mr Johnson has agreed to an inquiry into the lockdown and covid response, next Spring.
That may prove to be a catastrophic blunder for him, and if he hopes to come out of that in one piece, he had best be advised to put this unfortunate catastrophe *totally* behind him, make a clean break from these lockdown measures, or he is going to lead both himself and the rest of the population into a quagmire, that is eventually going to drag him down into the swamp too.

Personally, I think the threat is coming from the corporate US economic Right rather than the Left. We're being turned into IT dependent peasants. "Woke" is just an expression of being part of the North American Empire. It is trying to pass the buck for its social tensions by exporting the historical, social and philosophical reasoning as "universal" values. It's the US version of gladiatorial combat. Primitive, ugly, violent and repellent to any decent mind, but also an expression cultural dominance. The drug legalisation lobby is part of the same sickness. Everywhere is nowhere. Everywhere is Colorado.

Johnson's handlers had to come up with something to stop the holiday season from taking off. So, here comes an Indian variant to spoil the party based on scenes of burning bodies and river burials which are normal events. Thus, our fake patriotic PM answers to globalist fear-mongering and has fooled the electorate into believing he is something of a saviour. Perhaps he is just as much a prisoner as most folk in the UK want to be. It is a pity that Hitchens will not concentrate on these suspicious events instead of distracting us with his drug and transport fixes.

The government's appalling propaganda machine keeps rolling along. Now they are claiming that the NHS track'n'trace app has "saved thousands of lives". There is no evidence nor proof of this claim. None. Their "evidence' is the results of the SAGE models, with which professor Neil Ferguson has been heavily involved. For anybody that still hasn't done so, I suggest you use your search engine of choice to find out Professor Ferguson's appalling record of modelling viruses and predicting their effect. The man should be in a padded cell wearing a strait jacket.

These daft scooters should appeal to our childish politicians and would make a great getaway option for them in the event they are ever confronted by angry members of the public ala Starmer. However, they are just part of the build back better strategy, another empty slogan which amounts to nothing of any substance yet everythjng to do with centralisation of control.
They are busy scaring people off trains and wasting billions on vanity projects while local services still don't run properly. Jobs for the boys indeed. Whether it's goverrnment contracts, bankers, the NHS management gravy train, metro majors, fat cat bosses and foreign football owners, this self-serving elite have somehow decided that their spectacular failures have given them a divine right to be filthy rich. Meanwhile, front line workers who keep this economy afloat get nothing but a kick in the teeth.
t's time to get back to basics but these fools are too busy telling you they can save the world. And so....here comes the Indian variant - a computer generated image of a virus which has never been isolated and is diagnosed with a test not designed for the purpose it's beng used for. The tiresome script is playing out again and the incrementalised zombies will be glued to their TV sets once more. They are even using the same areas for the "surge" like Bolton, one of their favourites. But make no mistake, when the call comes in from on high to start ramping up the amplification levels and the fear, the compliant herd will be trotting back to lockdown and bleating at you to do the same. My message is simple, resist it while you can because as long as you believe the scam this is going nowhere.

In my modest opinion e-scooters pose a great risk to the public. These vehicles are found everywhere nowadays; they are deadly silent so you never know when they are approaching you. The riders of these machines never warn pedestrians of their presence -- I have never seen it at least -- and they do not wear a high visibility jacket or a helmet. There does not seem to be any official control over the use of these dangerous “toys” either so, inevitably, accidents are waiting to happen -- for some reason the English expression “lock the stable door after the horse has bolted” comes to mind… . In regard to ilegal drug use and its impact on users' minds, I insist: Peter Hitchens is utterly correct. Anybody whose profession involves working with habitual users of illicit narcotics is aware of the damage these substances cause on people and the wider community, including many long suffering families, that subsequently have to bear the dire consequences. Marihuana is terrible. There is nothing so called “recreational” about this stinking rubbish which main power is to cause psychotic episodes -- amongst other terrible effects -- on some persons who then go on to commit horrendous atrocities so: who is not interested in looking into this problem and why?, who does not want to see their behaviour criminalized?, who is going to make lots of money at the expense of everybody else's safety and security, do they care? Those are the crucial questions and Mr. Hitchens is right in raising the public's awareness on the matter of drug use -- legal and illegal -- and its relationship to levels of criminality. That said, I agree with Mr. Hitchens on the impact Brexit is still having on some British voters. It should not be like that though. After all Brexit, we are told, has already happened. Why are some traditional Labour voters still voting Conservative so merrily then? The British central government one can argue has potentially done away with the livelihoods of many people whose jobs have disappeared as a direct result of Mr. Johnson's policies for the COVID-19 pandemic, not to speak of the imposition of all sorts of social prohibitions for political reasons rather than supposedly scientific advice. Besides, anyone who has been reading Peter Hitchens's blog for the past year will know that the National Health Service was struggling well before this pandemic so, again, why vote Tory if you are working class, losing your job and being told when to hug your granny? As for the train operating companies they are the law unto themselves and the only cracks they worry about are in their pockets, customer satisfaction what's that? -- oh, and good luck if you ever decide to claim compensation for any delays/cancellations. Great radio journalism, thank you.

This government has taken our freedoms when it suited them.
It suited them, for us, the public, to help save the NHS from a swamping. That’s the very same NHS that this government, and most before it, have systematically decimated to the point where it could not deal with a flu like virus which, just like flu is mostly only dangerous to the very infirm and the very old.
They did it at the behest of a few carefully chosen, unelected Scientists.
They will indeed remove them again and again if it suits them, now that a precedent has been established.That day might be a lot sooner than you think!
A few pertinent quotes from important people in history.
They at least understood the basic principles of liberty.

I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."
--Voltaire
They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
--Benjamin Franklin
I prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery."
--Jean-Jacques Rousseau
Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."

“Is that what it is going to take to wake people up?”
No, people will only wake up when the financial system collapses. Most people have no understanding of the effect of unlimited money printing. The high inflation of the late 1970s had to to be squashed by massive interest rate rises. We are living in la la land where politicians and journalists tell the public its ok.
Inflation is rising much faster than the official figures will have you believe, but they can’t raise interest rates to kill inflation because we are now saturated in debt. Govt debt, mortgage debt, car loan debt, credit card debt, student loan debt, and corporate debt. So instead all they can do is print more money to give to people to hide what is happening.
If they try to raise interest rates to any normal average of say 3- 5% they will collapse the stock market and wipe out many businesses. So they just carry on creating more money hoping something will turn up. Eventually they will create hyper inflation, and debase our currencies even more, Wait until the Chinese will no longer accept our money, viewing it as worthless.

Here's the Mail today:
"Boris admits he is 'anxious' about Indian variant and is 'ruling nothing out' to tackle its spread amid fears England's June 21 'freedom' day could be delayed - as Covid cases DOUBLE in a week in four hotspots"
Do I blame Boris Johnson for this? No.
Because it's clear he's totally out of control, arguably not properly sane, as he thinks locking everyone up and masking them is an "OK" thing to do when there's a cold virus around.
The public as usual *has no voice* - they had one briefly last Thursday but utterly wasted that golden opportunity to tell Boris et al "where to go."
As our so called "political representatives" won't protect the public's rights/freedom any more, the only remaining hope is the journalists.
But no - that headline says they are more or less conspiring with Mr Johnson to keep everybody locked up, when they should be screaming at him "Enough is enough! You simply can't do this in a democracy!"
I almost hope Mr Johnson does backtrack and start saying stuff like, "we must face the fact that normal life is over, we face the prospect of spending the next so many years in lockdown without any known end..."
Is that what it is going to take to wake people up? Including the media, because *they are going to stay locked up too*, a fact they don't seem to realise.

When I left the video game industry at the end of 2019, my friends and colleagues would keep asking "What's next?" Well, this is what's next. It's more of a journey than a destination, and I'd love to share the ride with you!
So welcome to my new website on which I post about the things I'm enjoying now (food and drink), and occasionally write about the interesting adventures along the way.
If you don't know me, I've lived my life on the west coast of the United States, but I've travelled a fair amount and have dined and had drink in 34 different countries. Now able to pick anywhere to live, I've chosen Savannah. It's time for this wannabe southern gentleman to make good on that dream.
Food and drink has a special ability to bring people together. I have found this in my own life, as I've gotten to know people from around the world over drinks and the dinner table. Take these pages and decide where you want to meet fascinating people and enjoy food and drink worthy of starting a conversation.
Want me to try a restaurant or bar? Want me to to go back and try a different dish at a place where I've already eaten?
Let me know here. In the meantime, I'll be working on What's Next!
--MikeIt’s been a while since I have written anything but it’s been a very busy year (2019) for me. I wanted to share this project which I have photographed for Round Table Pizza last year as an South Carolina Architectural Photographer it was an honor to do.
As for this project, this location was in Sacramento is one of the first remodels for the whole chain. They are venturing into a new, modern, and redesigning their restaurants to improve their look. I would admit it wasn’t as what I was expecting because the renderings they have sent me looked really cool but it has more to do with what the city/landlord could let them do with the location. So they had to leave some things as they were and completely redesign the interior, but for South Carolina Architectural Photographer it was still interesting to photograph it. There where challenges such as dark spaces, bright light from all the windows and the time frame of when it could be photographed (with limited window of opportunity since they had to get the store ready for opening). Anyways, it’s never an easy with this kind of projects but it was surely fun for me to step up to the challenge and create something great.

The Venice Velour harness’ appealing charm is seen throughout the colourful vibrant pattern representing a nautical sea squall with shades of blue and accents of warm rouge tones for a ‘sunset at sea’ ambience. The softness appearance of this design is composed of velour that was often associated with nobility and is considered as an extravagant, royal garment. In the Mamluk era, Cairo was the world’s largest producer of velvet, which much of it was exported to Venice known as the “City of Water” in connection with the latin word ‘venetus’ meaning the colour of the blue sea. The design captures the essence of the water in its aqua coloured turquoise ribbing and subtle, shallow tones of light marine embroidery as seen in the unique eye colourization of the blue point Siamese cat. Imagens para seus Projetos Criativos

de 4,636The reliable supply of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) and its decay product, technetium-99m (Tc-99m), is a vital component of modern medical diagnostic practices. Disruptions in the supply chain of these radioisotopes – which cannot be effectively stored – can suspend important medical testing services. Unfortunately, supply reliability has declined over the past decade, due to unexpected or extended shutdowns at the few ageing, Mo-99 producing, research reactors and processing facilities. These shutdowns have created global supply shortages.
This study offers a unique analysis of the economic structure and present state of the Mo-99/Tc-99m supply chain. It finds that the shortages are a symptom of a longer-term problem linked to insufficient capital investment, which has been brought about by an economic structure that does not provide sufficient remuneration for producing Mo-99 or support for developing additional production and processing infrastructure. To assist governments and other decision makers in their efforts to ensure long-term, reliable supply of these important medical isotopes, the study presents options for creating a sustainable economic structure. The study will also enhance understanding amongst stakeholders of the costs of supplying Mo-99 and ultimately contribute to a better functioning market.Property Attributes

Welcome to your Daily News Digest. Here’s what’s happening today:
Sergio Higuita solos to his first WorldTour win on stage 18 of the Vuelta a España, Edoardo Affini wins the stage 6 time trial at the Tour of Britain as Mathieu van der Poel reclaims the race lead, Dimension Data extends Ben King and others. Those stories and more in today’s Daily News Digest.
Story of the Day: Higuita solos to his first WorldTour win on stage 18 of the Vuelta a España
Sergio Higuita soloed to an impressive first WorldTour victory on Thursday’s stage 18 of the Vuelta a España. The 22-year-old Colombian, who joined EF Education First in May, attacked out of the main breakaway on the descent off the day’s penultimate climb, and held on all the way to the line to take the win.
Overall race leader Primoz Roglic (Jumbo-Visma) led a select GC group across the line 15 seconds later to nab second ahead of Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) and add to his lead.
Valverde reclaimed second overall after his teammate Nairo Quintana finished just over one minute down on the red jersey group.
The 177.5-kilometer stage from Colmenar Viejo to Becerril de la Sierra featured four category-one climbs. Wout Poels (Ineos) soloed off the front on the first ascent, and Higuita and several others ultimately linked up with the Dutchman to form the day’s main breakaway.
The escapees had an advantage of around five minutes at the midway point of the stage, heading into the penultimate climb, which would see action in both the break and the GC group.
Up front, Louis Meintjes (Dimension Data), Jonas Koch (CCC), and mountains classification leader Geoffrey Bouchard (Ag2r La Mondiale) where among a handful of riders trying their luck with attacks, but nothing stuck on the steep gradients. A few minutes behind, Astana hit the front of the GC group with an injection of pace that shed several domestiques from rival teams, setting up Miguel Ángel López to fire off the front with around four kilometers left to climb.
The Colombian quickly caught up to several stragglers from the breakaway going over the top. At the head of the race, Higuita shot off the front on the descent, and quickly powered to a healthy gap with only the last category-one climb and the subsequent descent left to tackle.
López was caught by the red jersey group shortly before the start of the final ascent, and before long it was Higuita alone out front with the overall contenders comprising the next group on the road. As the final climb began, López attacked again, and then again. Although he did not hold a gap for long, the pressure proved too high for Quintana and for Tadej Pogacar (UAE-Team Emirates), both of whom were distanced, leaving only López, Roglic, Valverde, and Bora-Hansgrohe’s Rafal Majka in the main GC group.
Despite the firepower in the group behind, Higuita did not flag on the final climb, and arrived at the summit with a gap of around 40 seconds. Even with the strong descending skills of those in pursuit, that was plenty of time for Higuita to hold on through the downhill run to the line, where he took his first ever WorldTour victory in his first ever Grand Tour. Fifteen seconds later, Roglic pipped Valverde for runner-up honors and a few bonus seconds.
Quintana and Pogacar finished together just over a minute behind the red jersey, allowing Valverde to take over second from the former and López to take over fourth from the latter with just one high-mountain stage remaining in this year’s race.

Affini wins Tour of Britain stage 6 time trial, van der Poel reclaims the GC lead
Edoardo Affini (Mitchelton-Scott) delivered an impressive performance on stage 6 of the Tour of Britain to win the 14.4-kilometer individual time trial by seven seconds.
The promising young Italian completed the course in Pershore in 16:39 early on in the afternoon and then spent nearly two hours in the hot seat before his victory was sealed. Sebastian Langeveld (EF Education First) took second in the TT with Dylan van Baarle (Ineos) in third.
Mathieu van der Poel (Corendon-Circus) set the sixth fastest time on the day, good enough to retake the overall race lead from Matteo Trentin (Mitchelton-Scott). He has a six-second advantage over Trentin as the race heads into its final two stages.
King, Gibbons, Gasparotto among six riders renewing with Dimension Data/NTT
Ben King, Ryan Gibbons, and Enrico Gasparotto will ride on with Dimension Data, to be known as NTT next year, after extending their contracts with the squad. The team announced renewals for six riders on Wendesday.
King, 30, enjoyed the biggest season of his career with Dimension Data last year, winning two stages at the Vuelta a España. The American joined the team in 2017.
Gibbons is a versatile talent who turned pro with the team in 2017. He counts a Tour de Langkawi overall title on his palmares, but also has a strong sprint, and the team is hoping the South African can continue to develop into a contender for the fast finishes.
Gasparotto has continued to contest the Ardennes Classics even in the later years of his career. The 37-year-old Italian is a two-time Amstel Gold Race winner.
Jay Thomson, Nicholas Dlamini, and Amanuel Ghebreighzabhier also renewed with what will be the NTT team in 2020.

Planning for safer streets in New Orleans
New Orleans is hoping to make its streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians with a “rapid buildout” of new infrastructure.
Amid a general – and worrying – trend of rising cyclist deaths in the United States, the issue garnered more public attention in New Orleans last year when a driver hit eight people in a bike lane, killing two cyclists. Now, the city is planning “75 miles of lanes around the crash-heavy downtown core” for the next two years, according to Grist.org.
The full story is an interesting read.
Coming up at the Vuelta
Stage 19 at the Vuelta a España will be a treat for the history buffs, taking the peloton from Ávila, whose famed town walls have survived from the Middle Ages to today, to Toledo, where medieval and Renaissance buildings await around practically every corner.
A mostly flat profile should favor the sprinters, although an uphill final kilometer could make things interesting.

Located just 7km from Brisbane’s CBD, Toowong Mazda are currently undergoing refurbishments throughout their showroom and office spaces! In September 2019, Moreton Hire provided a temporary structure solution to ensure Mazda Toowong could continue trading and eliminate any sales barriers over the 10 week period.
A 10x20m Uniflex Arcum was installed and ensured Mazda’s clients weren’t put out by the renovations. The temporary showroom and office space was built with cassette flooring and a mix of glass and solid walls. To finish off the full fit-out, internal aircon towers were installed to heat and cool the temporary showroom when necessary. The result? A temporary structure built to the highest engineering standards that has offered an unique solution to our client.

- ⇣ CMRO2 & ⇣ ICP.
- ⇡ cortical stimulation of Edinger-Westphal nucleus → miosis.
- CVS - ⇣ SNS & ⇡ PNS tone. Bradycardia, venodilation, histamine release (causes ⇣ MAP). Orthostatic hypotension due to depression of SNS responses. Direct depressant effect on SA node, slowing conduction (⇡ VF risk).
- Administration with N2O results in CVS depression.

With speakers from Jacques Pepin, Tom Colicchio, Lori Silverbush, Bryant Terry, and so many others, there was something for everyone at the Eating Through Time Festival on October 17, whether one’s interests were in history, public health, or culture.
The wide range of topics speaks to the various ways we perceive food. Our first main stage speaker, food justice activist and cookbook author, Bryant Terry, succinctly expressed these perceptions: “Start with the visceral, move to the cerebral, end with the political.”
Politics was a theme for many of our panelists. University of Maryland Law Professor Frank Pasquale emphasized the need for transparency in food regulation appointments. At the local level, Ellie Wilson, a nutritionist and policy maker for New York state, and the New York Academy of Medicine’s own Kimberly Libman focused upon the need to support more than food on plates: wellness programs and support for produce farmers are also a part of just and healthy food systems. This holistic view of changing food policy was encapsulated nicely in our screening of Lori Silverbush’s A Place at the Table. Looking at food insecurity in the U.S., producers Silverbush and Tom Colicchio underscored the need for both federal and local efforts in solving hunger.

Are there other ways of tackling nutrition and health disparities in the U.S.? On our all-woman “Starting Up Health” panel, moderator Nina Meijers spoke with three start-ups on how technology can empower consumer decisions. The “Eating the Future” panel also asked similar questions regarding how new technologies, such as insect proteins and 3-D printing, could feed the world sustainably and address malnutrition concerns.

To demonstrate those possibilities, lead researcher at Nordic Food Lab, Josh Evans, proposed entomophagy as a possible response to food insecurity and sustainability dilemmas worldwide. Passing out insect-based food and beverages, Joshua proved that deliciousness and sustainability could go together. Dr. David Eisenberg called upon more doctors and health professionals to learn about food and nutrition by enrolling in cooking classes, such as Harvard Public Health and Culinary Institute of America’s collaborative program “Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives.”

Culture and the arts can also be a conduit for action. Poet Simone Bridges and non-profit Hip-Hop Health performed pieces that could teach today’s youth about nutrition and health through the spoken word. In a historical context, culture has also been a driver of nutritional theories and practices. Historians Ken Albala presented his research on sex, power, and food in the Renaissance while Betty Fussell discussed purity and danger in food advertisements in the 20th century.

The power of food is also an embodied knowledge. Betty Fussell, our oldest presenter, gave some sage advice on how food (along with naps, sex, and good friends) is a key factor in longevity not only from a nutritional, but also affective standpoint. No one could be a better spokesperson for this than our keynote speaker, Jacques Pépin. Reminiscing on his nearly eighty years, Chef Pépin’s lecture, “Food Memories,” touched on his life in food from his childhood in France to his most recent (and 14th food show!) on PBS. While Chef Pépin attributed his continued stamina to lots of wine, he also stressed the importance of the social and the sensory in his work as a chef. Despite the materiality of food, Pépin reminded us that food is ephemeral: “Food is fragile. You eat it, it goes. What remains are the memories.”
I can’t thank the Academy enough for giving me the opportunity to assemble a day’s worth of programming about the issues I care about most: Food, social justice, and public health. And I certainly will have those memories for a lifetime.

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. Nowadays, HVAC systems are used anywhere from family homes to offices to factories where they provide the means for environmental comfort. Becoming more and more popular in new construction, these HVAC systems use fresh air from outdoors to provide high-quality indoor air.
As per a report by Air Movement and Control Association International, Inc. in short AMCA “The UVC wavelength can kill 99 per cent or more of all microorganisms living on HVAC air ducts and evaporator coils, depending on UVC intensity, length of UVC exposure, UVC Light placement, and life cycle of UVC lamp.”
Many factories use the HVAC system to provide respite to workers from the extreme heat and humidity. This HVAC system requires regular cleaning and maintenance. If not cleaned, the HVAC system may become the breeding ground for harmful pollutants such as bacteria, viruses, and fungal spores. These harmful bacteria get accumulated at the HVAC ducts and are released into the environment by the AC vents.
Regular cleaning helps profoundly, but it does not completely kill the bacteria. The best way to eradicate the bacteria is the use of UVC purification. UVC purification is a method of killing harmful pollutants by breaking the cell structure of the bacteria. Once the cell structure is damaged, it stops mutating and vanishes.
According to reports, airborne particles and ergonomic risks account for a substantial part of chronic diseases. A report by WHO says that 4-6% of GDP is affected directly due to work-related health issues for many countries. An initiative by companies can ensure the health safety of workers creating a conducive environment for workers.
A vast section of a country constitutes of workers employed in the informal sectors such as a factory. One of the biggest challenges of working in a factory is the availability of clean air to breathe. The health of factory workers is a prerequisite for the economic expansion of a country. Occupational hazards are a common issue due to health risks such as chemical fumes, dust, heat, etc.
All factory workers need fundamental health care, especially the ones who work in high-risk occupation. Work-related contagious diseases and cardiovascular hazards result in long-term illness if not taken care of in the beginning. Chronic diseases are one of the most common health issues with factory workers.

Drugsbankrx.com is the online wing of Happy Family Store, a pharmacy that sells generic and brand name products. As their name suggests, they aim to keep the family happy by providing access to a quick shopping experience, prompt shipping, and dependable customer service. It is difficult to determine whether or not this company is as large as it claims to be. Some of its claims sound like they could have some truth to them. But the absence of tangible evidence creates suspicions that are difficult to ignore.
Domain Info
This website was created on the 3rd of October 2019. As of this moment, it is less than a hundred days old. In other words, it is a completely brand new website and that is a problem. First of all, it claims to have over a million customers but that is unlikely for a site of this age.
Larger, more reliable pharmacies with years of experience can only boast of a customer base in the hundreds of thousands. The notion of a pharmacy this young having over a million customers is ridiculous. Secondly, when a medical firm is this young, you have to consider the possibility that it might be a scam. There are plenty of young medical sites that are legit.
But the number of young sites that are scams is even larger. For this reason, you need to keep your guard up when transacting with this site
Related Websites
Scamadviser.com gave this website a rating of 52 percent. That is a mediocre trust rating which is problematic. It gives you even more reason to presume that they might be a scam. Their drugstore’s setup includes three different countries which is also a poor sign.
Fortunately, Ireland and the US, two of the countries, are not high risk. The third country is unknown. The pharmacy shares its sever with over a hundred portals, including:
■ rxlegal24.com
■ well-meds.com
■ payments-pages.com
■ rxmedonline.com
Some of the ratings associated with these sites are strong, Some of the ratings are mediocre.
Business Profile
This internet pharmacy keeps trying to convince its visitors that it is a large, successful medical entity. Their platform even features a picture of a massive building that is supposed to house its operations. No one would blame you for believing that this is a legitimate online drugstore.
However, you shouldn’t be so quick to trust them. For one thing, their platform has a picture of their headquarters but they haven’t bothered to share their business address. So you have no way of verifying that the building shown in the picture is even real.
They could have photoshopped their names onto any random building. If that was truly their HQ, the firm would have happily shared its address, allowing customers to authenticate its existence. Their owner is also hidden, so you should keep that mind before giving them your money.
Scams always hide the identities of their owners. They are also hesitant to provide any legitimate contact information.
Regulatory Authorization
This medical store doesn’t fall under the supervision of any regulatory body. Legitscript.com has never heard of them which suggests that they are illegally selling medical products
Available Products
The platform sells both generic and branded medicine, or so they say. They also claim to sell a variety of medical products. But one look at their site will tell you that they specifically peddle sexual enhancers. You don’t require a prescription to order for prescription pills which is another sign of fraudulent behavior.
Pricing, Payments, and Deliveries
Based on the information displayed on their platform, the drugs sold here are quite cheap, far cheaper than what you might find in a traditional store. But you have no reason to believe that any of the information on the site is real.
They accept Credit Cards like Visa, Discover, and JCB, not to mention E-Checks. As far as deliveries are concerned, as is often the case with pharmacies of this kind, they use EMS and Airmail to get your drugs to you.
Reviews and Testimonials
There are no trustworthy reviews for this internet pharmacy besides the ones found on its platform and those can’t be trusted.
Conclusion
This internet pharmacy is 20% of trust that bears all the signs of a scam.IF you visit any bingo hall, you’ll see players leave their tables in the intervals to enjoy a spin on the fruit / slot machines around the hall.

exceptional work, especially in the timeframe. would most certainly hire again.It’s agitating, uncomfortable and has been ingrained in us that it’s one thing all of us simply have to simply accept. Bloating.
It appears to at all times occur on the most inconvenient of occasions, particularly once we really feel we did all the things “proper” that day, reminiscent of maintaining a healthy diet or getting some train in. Like most well being points, bloating sometimes has a root trigger. And no, it isn’t simply because your abdomen is aware of that you simply picked out your tightest outfit to put on to dinner tonight.
Listed here are some tricks to repair each brief time period and persistent bloating for good:
Drink peppermint or ginger tea each day
Peppermint and Ginger are each beautiful herbs when used for relieving discomfort in our stomachs and GI tract. Each herbs assist in digestion and can assist settle the abdomen in occasions of ache or bloating. Incorporate these teas into a calming night time routine, or drink them everytime you really feel a flare up approaching to keep away from an uncomfortable intestine.
Ditch the responsible exercise
Once you’re bloated, it may be simple to really feel exhausting on your self and suppose you should work out to repair the issue. More often than not although, this does extra hurt than good. Vigorous train, reminiscent of operating or lifting, may cause a delicate abdomen to get extra infected. As a substitute of punishing your self with a grueling exercise, attempt taking an extended stroll or attempting these stress-free yoga poses for a fast bloating repair. These poses have the power to stimulate GI muscle contraction and assist transfer digestion alongside.
Create a deep respiration routine
Present your abdomen some love by taking a couple of minutes every morning to easily breathe together with your abdomen whereas maintaining your chest nonetheless. Latest research present that having a practice of deep breathing can enhance focus, scale back stress hormones, lower muscle pressure and far more. Incorporating a each day routine of deep respiration stimulates the physique by creating a mild massage-like motion, which is felt by our abdomen and intestines.
Check for meals sensitivities
If you end up feeling a bit like a balloon after some meals, you’re most likely delicate to one thing you’ve eaten. Meals like dairy and cruciferous greens are often accountable for this, however you’ll need to know precisely which ingredient your abdomen isn’t agreeing with. You may order an at-home meals sensitivity take a look at for this, or slowly begin chopping out meals till you discover the perpetrator.
Enhance water consumption
Water retention in our our bodies can simply be mistaken for bloating. Once we don’t drink sufficient H2O as we should always, our our bodies begin to retain extra water for later use. It may appear ironic, however to do away with this drawback, you should drink water extra repeatedly. The secret is to be ingesting numerous water all through the day, which can assist scale back fluid buildup and permit your digestive system to maintain issues flowing.
Test your sleep habits
Whereas one night time of dangerous sleep shouldn’t wreck your abdomen, making it a behavior will. Not getting sufficient z’s may cause your physique to launch the stress hormone cortisol, which sends our digestive system right into a state of stress as properly. If you end up feeling additional bloated for seemingly no cause, examine your sleep habits and also you may see an enchancment in different areas as properly.

Abstract
Chapter 1 deviates from the conventional practice by highlighting an alternative to forced CEO turnover. An interesting puzzle in corporate finance is the week sensitivity of disciplinary action against CEO to poor firm performance. I show that this weak relation is in part driven by an overlooked alternative to firing, which in practice takes the form of splitting the CEO-Chairman role or demoting the incumbent CEO to the executive Chairman position. I first document that such demotions are a frequently used alternative disciplinary mechanism, accounting for nearly 40% of all involuntary CEO transitions. I further show that the use of this mechanism is concentrated among firms in which the CEO is most entrenched or the cost of firing its CEO is high, i.e. CEOs with firm or industry-specific managerial skills and those with strong long-term performance and weak governance. Market reactions to CEO demotions are positive, on average. Finally, I show that classifying CEO demotions as an alternative form of involuntary turnover magnifies the sensitivity of involuntary turnover to firm performance and eliminates the relation between performance and voluntary turnover.
In chapter 2, we examine the role of deferred vesting of stock and option grants in reducing executive turnover. To the extent an executive forfeits all unvested stock and option grants if she leaves the firm, deferred vesting will increase the cost (to the executive) of early exit. Using pay Duration proposed in Gopalan, et al., (forthcoming) as a measure of the length of managerial pay, we find that CEOs and non-CEO executives with longer pay Duration are less likely to leave the firm voluntarily. Employing the vesting of a large prior-year stock/option grant as an instrument for Duration, we find the effect to be causal. CEOs with longer pay Duration are also less likely to experience a forced turnover and the sensitivity of forced CEO turnover to firm performance is significantly lower in firms that offer longer duration pay. Overall, our study highlights a strong link between compensation design and turnover for top executives.
Finally, in chapter 3,.

According to NoFap’s website, by abstaining from carnal behavior, a person can recover from “porn-induced sexual dysfunction” as well as enjoy heightened self-control, more hard-drive space, more free time, and an improved attitude.
The whole thing is supposed to be a joke. (Or at least we think so.) But more and more men seem to be taking it seriously, according to the blog Neon Nettle.
“First I thought ‘well this is a great way to get laid, because I’m like a girl magnet now,’ but then it just became ‘whatever… that’s not why I do this,’” Reddit user T_nyDubs writes. “Don’t get me wrong, I love getting laid, but primary motivation is me and fixing myself in my relationship with the world, not just some part of it.”
Reddit user killajoy714 claims that refraining from pleasuring himself has given him “insane confidence,” writing: .”
One guy went so far as to post a six-minute video on YouTube gushing about how amazing the experience of not masturbating has been for him.
But according to Neon Nettle, the practice of “nofapping” is nothing new. In fact, records show the practice dating all the way back to antiquity, when athletes in ancient Greece abstained from sex before a big game, believing that sperm provided an added boost of strength necessary to win.
Napoleon Hill’s internationally bestselling self-help book Think and Grow Rich labels the practice of “nofapping” as “sex transmutation.” The theory behind it is that by not releasing one’s sexual energies through regular means (i.e. masturbation, sex, etc.), those same energies find alternative, more productive routes of escaping the body (i.e. projects at work, artistic endeavors, relationships, etc.).
Neon Nettle also cites the website Yourbrainonporn.com, an online resource that explores the relationship between x-rated videos and the human brain. The website suggests that watching too much hanky panky on your computer can lead to a slew of long-term health problems, including your brain being “rewired.”
What do you think? Could you go seven days without masturbating? And do you think your sexual energies would find other ways of escaping your body? Sound off in the comments section below.

22-Year-Old Straight Guy Says He Gets Turned On By Big Erect PenisesAA When I first arrived in Australia at the end of May 1991 it took only a week to realise that I was in a culture that had certainly not shaken off the shackles of its colonial past. It was the Queen’s birthday—a public holiday. In the UK no-one knew when the Queen’s birthday was, let alone celebrated it in any way.
I realised there was a similar situation in music education. Except for some innovative exceptions such as La Trobe University Music department (sadly, now closed) and Southern Cross University, the model was by and large the traditional English one. Unfortunately classical art music in the UK is a pretty poor example. No English-born composer from the 18th and 19th centuries was considered internationally significant.
In the 1960s, by a series of lucky accidents, England at last discovered its musical creativity with rock music and the Beatles. This music found fertile soil at home and was easily exportable to other English speaking nations (most notably the USA) in a way the English classical composers had never experienced.
Until then music had been highbrow or lowbrow, then middlebrow. The 60s was the start of what John Seabrook called nobrow, “a world where anything goes provided it sells” (Nobrow, Methuen, London, 2000). This gave England the swinging 60s and a newfound confidence.
Not so here. Australia was too far from the epicentre of the music business. In an area where an idea can be 2 weeks too late, the physical time and distance was too great. Of course there were some successes, but nothing like the tidal wave that swept the UK.
Unfortunately the academy largely ignored this change, concentrating more on maintaining so called ‘standards.’ These standards did not respect and therefore did not respond to a public change of preference. Understanding this was left to the cultural theorists. Important influences were technology’s increasing connectivity, the mass media determining and being determined by audience taste, cultural change and the relationship between technology and lifestyle. All of these bring us to the double edged sword of globalisation.
RV One can see these global influences on tertiary music here. Many changes were triggered by the Dawkins Report (Parliamentary Paper: 20/2/1988), which required smaller tertiary institutions with student numbers less than 2,000 to amalgamate with a parent university or combine with other small institutions to form a new university. For the smaller institutions, amalgamation directly affected budgetary control as this was either lost or restricted. Student numbers became the basis for income generation, forcing departments to rethink their course offerings. The university system transformed into a market economy. Departments became competitive and vulnerable to decisions beyond their direct control. External influences needed to be taken into consideration such as industry trends, the mass media and globalisation.
AA The potentially good news for Australian music in the global economy is that we move towards a world where the centre is wherever the centre is. And any part of the surface of a sphere is equidistant from its centre. Most important is connectivity, speed and ideas. This is not, however, a world where classical music is doomed, nor popular music blessed. As Manuel Castells has argued: “Globalisation is highly selective. It proceeds by linking all that, according to dominant interests, has value anywhere in the planet, and discarding anything which has no value or becomes devalued” (“Materials for an Exploratory Theory of the Network Society”, British Journal of Sociology, vol no 5, no 1, London School of Economics, Jan/Mar 2000). In a globalised environment, cults can flourish, provided one is networked to seek out similarly minded individuals from around the world. In a networked world, however, you cannot assume to be the spokesperson of a dominant culture.
RV With so much music being made today and a student population well connected to various networks, the pressure on music departments to be ‘relevant’ and at the same time developing musical skills and thinking is enormous. Something must give as there are not enough resources to teach everything, nor staff fluent in all the forms of music-making activity. Consequently, the 90s have seen new approaches to content and modes of delivery.
For some institutions content delivery has been reprioritised. Traditionally, most music courses were based on performance and notation skills and an assumption that western art music repertoire was fundamental. The student population in Australia now consists of people from rock, folk, jazz, techno, rap, classical etc backgrounds. Who is to say that the values of western European repertoire are more important than those of Middle Eastern music?
Larger classes have required changes to the modes of delivery. The rule is: if a department wants an increased budget allocation, then student numbers must increase. In this paradigm, small classes such as one to one teaching are financially unviable. Today, a performance student receives only 26 lessons per year. This affects continuity and qualitative learning issues, and staff become overworked. However, solutions can be found in collaborative, modular and flexible learning, technology-aided teaching, web site access, teaching software exploring interactivity and project based learning. It would not be too difficult to implement and include alternative teaching deliveries to free up staff time and not diminish standards.
AA The focus on skill development is a result of course content being more career relevant. However, does this mean a downskilling of musicians? If viewed through the traditional lens of melody, rhythm and harmony, then the answer is yes. If viewed as a series of specific skills for a particular job then opportunities abound. It takes a particular skill and aesthetic to write and perform for the living room or the concert hall or the church or for film or TV or interactive media.
So we need a broader definition of musicianship and music literacy. We have to acknowledge there are many ways to be a musician and there is no hierarchy of goodness in this. It is significant that the UK’s richest person in 2001 is Paul McCartney, a man whose inability to read music would bar him from most music institutions in this country. The jobbing musicians whose only skill is to faithfully play the notes may be admirable, but their status is diminishing.
Music institutions and departments need to remain indispensable if they want to survive in a quickly changing music industry. There are no safe havens. Every musician has to work towards connecting with performers and audiences in various modes and media by using ideas that have cultural relevance, be that with a home-grown product, or by value adding to a product from elsewhere. It is becoming a truly borderless world. Whether the music is Australian or not is of little practical consideration. All that matters is that we create, not just copy. Our education structure has not been very supportive of creativity. However, encouragingly, the Australian Research Council recently has included Creative Arts in its research funding. If we as teachers can shift our emphasis away from repertoire to creation, we are truly assisting the education of future musicians to be professionals in the field, instead of McDonald’s workers.
RV A slow shift is occurring from copying to creating: a shift from repertoire based teaching (ie studying and emulating the great canon of set works) to generic teaching using cross disciplinary works. The generic approach enables musical understanding via analogy: the student transfers patterns heard in one structure to another, such as identifying various pulse and melodic relationships in an excerpt from Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, a samba from Latin America and an Aboriginal song. In both approaches creativity is used to facilitate an understanding of musical structure, style and form. However, in the former, creative thinking is confined to one of emulation, such as writing in the style of Palestrina or Charlie Parker, whereas through the converging of different traditions in the latter, creative thinking enables the creation of individual style, new repertoire, new contexts.
AA So, is creativity a free for all? I think not. It demands a set of skills, a knowledge of the buzz of the time, some nous and some luck. Be too similar to something else and you’re dead. Be too different and you are ignored. We are dealing in a market of symbols in what Justin O’Connor says is a “very volatile and fast moving symbolic circuit” (The Definition of Cultural Industries, Manchester Institute for Popular Culture, 1999). Not the classic environment of your average tertiary institution.
RV In order to survive this fast moving circuit, music departments must be adaptable, understand the benchmarks of creative thinking skills in music and identify the relationships existing between these skills, industry and personal vocation.
AA Just as enterprises in general have become information technology-intensive, they now are becoming more ‘creativity-intensive.’ Professor Stuart Cunningham, writing about Queensland University of Technology’s labelling as a Creative Industries university, says “the creative industries concept is a recognition that the future of the new economy lies in the move from IT to content‚ from infrastructure to creative applications” ( Higher Education Supplement, The Australian, June 27).
There is risk in this. Anything that relies on technology is constantly moving towards obsolescence. The recording industry is nothing like the industry of 10 years ago. And the next generation of musicians will need to be able to cope with these fast moving changes. They need to be creative within the market. They need to be connected and flexible. And therefore so do the staff of our music institutions.
RV Flexibility is the answer. In an environment in which industry relevance has become the benchmark, it is now important that staff actively engage with many industry stakeholders. This enables opportunities, peer interaction, the maintaining of relevant technical standards, potential increases in revenue from new sources, and provides dynamic role models for students. The tertiary music education sector engages with the music industry sector and vice versa. However, in conjunction there needs to be some development of a critical practice combining systematic enquiry and analysis into one’s own discipline area with creative thinking, as well as music literacy which embraces and positions new forms and contexts with the more traditional approaches to music making.

Doctors and public health officials say they're worried about the Bush Administration's plan to give smallpox vaccinations to as many as 11 million people over the next few months. That's because millions of Americans have medical problems meaning they could be hurt -- not only by the vaccine, but by exposure to a person who'd recently been vaccinated. Public health experts say it would be wiser to vaccinate a small number of people, and then assess the results before proceeding.

The first week has been a whirlwind! It has been amazing, difficult, challenging, and exciting all in one!
The gifts and talents that I bring into the ministry here seem like they are complementary to the gifts and talents the other staff and elders have. After the first week it seems like an amazing fit!
A lot has happened this past week with the ministry. There have been some deliveries of benevolence funds to people, helping someone find a new job, helping people get food at a local food pantry, and working with local organizations to see if they would be a good fit in our building during the off-hours.
Then there are those items that I have been doing for many years in the business industry: writing training programs for ministry leaders as well as church-wide, doing needs analysis of ministries, and studying up on topics I know very little about (when I started in the coffee industry about 15 years ago I had no clue what coffee really was, the same holds true today with ministry).
I sat down over a couple days and created some training programs. They need work, but I think they are pretty decent programs.
Then fear set in.
Proverbs 18:3 – To answer before listening – that is folly and shame.
How much prayer and seeking of God’s face did I do before working on these? I honestly couldn’t remember!
I knew I had prayed at least a little bit, but I couldn’t honestly say that I was putting God first as I put together those programs.
I hope I didn’t just do something successful without bringing Christ into it!!!
I know that ministry is tough. The first week here has been full, but not tough. I am wondering if I am missing something.
But what IS tough is keeping Christ at the forefront of the ministry.
Some tasks are simple. A door is broken, let’s get the door fixed. Not a lot of prayer time required to make sure I make the right decision.
But what about the benevolence and food pantry and job help. If I get those wrong, then more than my own ego would be in jeopardy. I honestly can’t remember how much prayer I put into them all.
Psalm 5:3 – In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning, I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.
So today I started something a little different. Instead of coming in and immediately getting to work, I am taking the opportunity to dig into the Bible for a few minutes and then go to prayer. Then, when I am about an hour or so from leaving, I go into the sanctuary and pray.
This is the reason that ministry is a calling and not a job. It is very easy to get caught up in the job aspects of the ministry, but if we look at everything as some aspect of “the job,” then we will never grow and excel in Christian ministry. But, on the flip side of that, if we spend all our time in prayer, fasting and dying to ourselves, then the little details like taking out the trash, setting mouse traps, and cleaning toilets will never get done.
1 Thessalonians 2:12 – Encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
I have had several jobs in my life. Every single one of them eventually gets boring and repetitive. I am sure ministry will be no different in many ways. But the call of ministry, if we see it as such, will carry us through the doldrums and bring us into exciting high winds to fill our sails.
So here’s to hoping that I don’t see only success. Here is to hoping that I fail a little. Here is to hoping I don’t get bored on the repetitive tasks and am able to enjoy the diversity of ministry.
And here’s to hoping that this journey will bring the discomfort to me and my family that causes the awakening that God so sorely needs in this world today.Artist News Business News Digital Gigs & Festivals One Liners Releases

By Wang Kaihao and Hu Meidong | China Daily | Updated: 2021-07-26 06:47
new entry includes 22 sites and monuments across Quanzhou, which jointly reflect a prosperous picture of maritime trade from the 10th to 14th centuries.
The Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties witnessed a peak in ancient Chinese maritime trade, and Quanzhou, then known overseas as Zayton, grew into one of the busiest seaports in the world.
The 22 representative historic monuments and sites include administrative buildings and structures; facilities showing the city's structure, such as its gates, walls and roads; religious sites and statues that witnessed multicultural communities; cultural memorial sites and monuments; iron and ceramic production sites; and the city's transportation network formed by bridges, docks and pagodas that guided voyages.
Together, these comprehensively reflect the Song-Yuan Quanzhou's highly integrated maritime trade structure, and the diversity of the social system formed by the supporting institutions, communities and cultural elements, according to the Quanzhou Cultural Heritage Nomination Office.Web Design Tips for a Professional Site
The Internet is full of web design tips and tricks available for dime a dozen. Everyone seems to have their own opinion on how a perfect website looks like! To an extent, I can say, like content, the design is also subjective. What may be amazing to you might be hideous for someone.
An effective web design is one of the most crucial reasons behind the success of a business. Studies and surveys reveal some of the following shocking web design statistics:
• 38% of the internet users stopped browsing a website if they found it unattractive.
• 40% folks leave the website right away if it loads later than 3 seconds.
• 94% base their impression of the business on the basis of their web design
• 75% judge business credibility from their website
Apart from a compelling web design and thought-provoking content, it's about the style that dwells on the user experience and that's easy to scan, read, and understand. Here are some research-based web design tips and tricks to ace your next web design project:
5 Web Design Tips and Tricks to Drive More Business
• Keep Your Homepage Minimalistic and Clutter-free
No one reads the entire website content. Rather they just scan through the pages quickly, take out important cues, and form a rapid opinion about the website and business. With such behaviors tapping into web space, it's important to focus on striking human emotions rather than content word count.
This is proven that less someone has to read or click on your website, faster he is able to retain the information gathered and acting upon it. Isn't that you want him to do ultimately? No, I'm not saying text and call-to-action are not important but breaking them into legible paragraphs, headings, and subheadings would do the job.
As images and icons wherever possible to express your point.
• Keep a Visual Hierarchy in Mind While Designing
Technology and phones have long evolved and so has the form of expressing information. With so much information in the form of texts and graphics is onboard to offer to readers, it is a designer's mastermind to strategically arrange and exhibit the information in a legit manner.
You have only a few seconds of the window to grab a reader's attention and make them stay on your website. If your website is poorly structured and doesn't follow a hierarchical pattern, chances are you're going to turn off the reader almost instantly.
Organize your website into clear and digestible pieces of content. Pick the right color, contrast, spacing, and size for further enhancement and you're great to go.
• Ensure Easy Readability
Thumb rule is " What you can't read is what you can't see." Make sure that your website doesn't lack easy readability. The readers on your website must be able to recognize words, sentences, and phrases clearly. Having a high readability score means your readers are able to take in the information without much effort and are able to retain it for a longer period of time.
To achieve website readability make sure there is ample contrast between the text and the background for the text to play. Make sure the colors you're using must be coherent with your brand's identity.
Keep body text font at least 16 pt. to appeal to the readers' eyes without much difficulty. Carefully select the font to appear soothing and makes for an easy readability score. If you're using a variety of fonts throughout the website, make sure they look harmonious and clutter-free.
• Easy Navigation is the Key
Don't send your readers on a wild-goose chase when they come on to your website looking for something. A website with a robust navigation system ranks better on search engines and enhances reader's experience in content indexing.
Synchronize your branding efforts with your brand's logo and linking it to your homepage to save your users some precious clicks. The menu bar is ideally on top of the homepage with sections arranged according to their significance.
Vertical navigation also works well when your website is of the long-scrolling variety. Users can easily navigate to the top, bottom, left, or right with the help of anchor menu. Another important web design tip is to include all the contact information, social media plugin links, blog, FAQs, and terms of use in the footnote of the webpage.
• Stay Upbeat with Mobile-Friendly Site
We live in a society where a smartphone is predictably the given medium to access any information. Having a responsive mobile design is of vital importance as not having one might jeopardize your chances of turning a lead into a conversion. Test your website thoroughly to see how each page, image, button or link appears to a mobile user. Conform to the best practices of a mobile-friendly website before going live.
This is just a needle in the haystack when it comes to best web design tips and tricks, never cease to look for inspiration around you. It's important to know what best can be done in order to get it done.

Web programmers, or ‘devs’, do it using an assortment of programming languages. The languages that they use are dependent upon the sorts of tasks they’re performing as well as the programs on which they’re working.
Web development skills are in high demand globally and well-compensated also — making creation a fantastic career choice. It’s but one of the simplest available higher-paid areas as you don’t require a conventional university diploma to become certified.
The subject of web development is usually broken down to the front end (the user-facing facet) and backend (the server-side). Let us delve into the information.
Assessing Front-End along with Back-End Development
A front-end dev manages layout, layout, and interactivity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They take a concept from the drawing board and turn it into truth.
Everything you see and what you are using, like the visual feature of the site, the drop-down menus, along with also the text, are brought together with the front end dev, that writes a collection of applications to bind and arrangement the components, make them look nice and include interactivity. These programs are conducted via a browser.
The backend programmer engineers exactly what is happening behind the scenes. This is the point the place where the information is saved, and with no information, there wouldn’t be any frontend. The backend of this net comprises the server which hosts the site, a program for conducting it, and also a database to include the information.
The backend dev employs computer applications to make sure the host, the program, along the database operate smoothly together. This sort of dev should examine what an organization’s requirements are and offer efficient programming options. To do all these wonderful things they use many different server-side languages, such as PHP, Ruby, Python, and Java.You are currently browsing the category archive for the ‘MSNBC’.…..”.
The Republican Debate.
Who frames it?
The team giving the moderator questions.
First the rules:
The candidates will make no opening statements and will have just a minute to answer.
Translated: Control the Message!!!!!!!!
So, lets look at what questions were given?
To Perry: You have touted your state’s low taxes, the lack of regulation, tough tort reform as the recipe for job growth in the Lone Star State Is that the kind of answer all Americans are looking for?
Perry: Duh..yes…
To Governor Romney: Massachusetts ranked only 47th in job creation during your tenure as governor. Your private-sector experience consisted of being “a buyout specialist.” Your response to that?
Romney: Duh,.. I will say that is not true.
Is it a disqualification to be in government all your career?
Romney: Duh… no.
To Santorium and Cain: Weigh in on what you’re hearing (ph).
Santorium: Duh, I’m great. i’ve done………”things”.
Cain: Duh, I’m greater..
Cain: Forget doing 69… Instead, go 999….
To Huntsman: Pick apart Romney’s plan…..
Huntsman: I’m the number one Job Creator…. I did it in 6 days and rested on the 7th…
To Bachmann: Which federal regulations have been most detrimental to your business?
Bachmann: Duh… Obamacare….
Harris: TIME!!
To Paul: What is not in the Constitution?
Paul: Federal Regulations; Let the Free Market decide their own rules. Let Rapists define rape, Let Murderers define what is murder, Let pornographers define what is pornography. Let child molesters define what is molestation. The free market can police themselves…. Regulations are stupid.
To Gingrich: You wrote Perry’s forward to his book?.
Gingrich: Yeah and I’ll write the next one too….. (And the fact that Obama didn’t do his homework here in the Reagan Library is proof he is not serious about jobs..)
To all: What I’d first like to do is ask if anyone else on this stage agrees that the Massachusetts example was a great opportunity for the rest of the country..
All: Duh….. No… (Hint to uninformed viewers: Massachusetts is a Democratic state and this is a Republican Presidential Debate.)
To Romney: Defend your role….
Romney: On day one, I will do the opposite of what i did in Massachusetts and order the annulment of Obamacare and the joyous return to insurers taking all your money and dropping you off their roles, at the first sign of you being sick.
To Perry: will you praise or trash you biggest opponents record on health care?
Perry: Duh…. trash him of course. I’m running against him you know… Oh? You didn’t know that? Oh My, Surprise, Surprise!
To Perry: Why are so many Texans under insured?
Perry: Duh, under my policy of offering very low wages with no benefits, Texas people can’t afford insurance… Duh,, what a dumb question….
Bachmann tires to interject: “John? John?”
HER INTERJECTIONS APPEAR TOTALLY IGNORED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT IN SCRIPT…..
(Moderators look at script, look at each other, shake their heads side to side, and move on with the next scripted question.)
To Governor Huntsman: Since you are so important, even though you lost to Bachmann in the Iowa Straw Poll where she got 28.5% of the vote and you got… 0.42% of the vote, us moderators will diss her and go to you instead… Obviously she doesn’t warner any respect and certainly, no one cares what she thinks, for her horrible performance in Iowa… Who fuckin’ cares about Iowa anyway? Ha, ha….
Huntsman: Duh…. no one?
To Congresswoman Bachmann, let’s turn to you. Is Governor Romney’s support of an individual mandate…
Harris: TIME!
HARRIS: To Governor Huntsman, everybody would like $2 gas, but is it realistic for a president to promise that?
Huntsman: Duh….. no…..
To Paul: Would getting rid of minimum wage like Texas did, create more jobs?
Paul: Absolutely, and what’s good, is that those working below minimum wage are too poor to quit, so essentially the corporations have their own slave labor… Legalized slavery, and it’s not just about black people anymore… See how far the South has come?
(The debate is interrupted for 5 minutes by the now obligatory discussion of the rules of debate…)
Five minutes later:
To Perry: I saw you nod your head; were you really nodding your head?
Perry: Why, yes I was….. Thank you so much for noticing…
To Perry: You are so welcome… It was a sort a cute little nod too… btw… (laughter)…. And that is a nice outfit .. looks really good on you too… You look quite handsome today…
Perry: Why thank you Brian. You look handsome today too…. (wink, wink…)
Paul: Oh, I need an answer to that….
To Paul: you have 30 seconds….
Paul: The eighties weren’t all that… We had AIDS, a famine in Ethiopia, and were forced to listen to this…. Ronald Reagan had good ideas, but the eighties still weren’t all that…
To Paul: Funny thing about mail: Mail is forever…
To all: we are going to take a break, mostly to screen the data in order to keep anything worthy of debate, from finding a way to come up here and enter the discussion… ….
Overheard off camera: Williams to hot female assistant: I have to pee, can you help me….
(End of transcript: This viewer never returned.).
Tired of looking at CNN’s Larry Kings’s big old head, I switched to MSNBC just in time to hear this exchange…
Reporter: “I’m at the Delaware- Pennsylvania Inaugural Ball and there is no one here… After Obama stopped by everyone packed up and went home… These guy’s in Delaware (and Pennsylvania) don’t know how to party….I’m the only female in the room.”
Desk Host: “Hey someone just walked behind you pushing a broom… See if they will party with you”…. (laugh, laugh)…
We are then lamely entertained by having the host ask the custodian if he will dance with her… Obviously aware of the nagging he would receive once home… the custodian wisely said “no”….
We are then entertained by a panel who has never been to either a Blue Hen’s tailgate party, a Point to Point, or a previous century’s visit to the Stone Balloon…. Peppered with comments about the prissiness of Delaware’s citizens… and as an aside Pennsylvania is mentioned as well, I’m sure they failed to consider that two of last weeks championship football games were played by hard partying Pennsylvania teams, and that they have never been to an Eagle’s or Steeler’s Tailgate party… I’m sure they have never even heard of Penn State’s Nittany Lions….
How stupid can they get? Are they really that daft?
Being nosy main-stream news media employees they probably were unaware that the real partying takes place …. outside the venue… Contrary to what was being publicly portrayed, Delaware/ Pennsylvania was not calling it a wrap and hitting the sack… They were getting the real party started elsewhere….
Their poor reporter… just didn’t make the cut…..…….Our Friendly And Knowledgeable Staff Is Here To Help You Find That Perfect Car You Deserve, Priced To Fit Your Budget. Apply Today To Start Driving Home.

Dear Beloved Prayer Leaders,
Please join in praying that God will use The Bible miniseries to stir Christians to read their Bibles like the Bereans in Acts 17:11 to see if these things are so. Also pray for unbelievers to find the channel and be drawn into the stories of the Bible, and ultimately to Jesus.
Many of you already know the The Bible miniseries begins this Sunday, March 3, 2013 at 8:00 pm on the History channel; but in case you have not heard about it, I highly recommend it to you and to those in your spheres of influence. We were blessed to see a portion of the movie at the October Mission America meeting and later to meet and talk with Mark and Roma Burnett about their passion to see God’s word read and known. Click here to see a trailer: at a. You can also do a bing search for- the Bible movie March 2013 - and see many articles about it.
Outreach Magazine created resources that can be used by churches and small groups in conjunction with the showing all five Sunday evenings in March leading up to Easter.-...
God is truly drawing His people back to their First Love – Jesus, this year. The Bible and My Hope with Billy Graham are just two examples of timely tools we can use to share the good news of Jesus with friends, family and neighbors. May God be glorified through these opportunities. Thanks for praying and spread the word.
For God’s glory,
Elaine

The thing that you program when you program! It's what runs the code, the CPU (Central Processing Unit). Kinda like the processor that runs in your computer but much much much simpler and smaller.
The chip has legs! In this case, the legs are plugged into a socket. If you took it out of the socket (not recommended because its easy to accidentally damage it!) you'd see something like this:
Each of those little legs is a pin (they're sharp like pins too, so don't step on one of these by accident, its incredibly painful - don't ask how I know). If you look carefully you will be able to read ATMEGA328P on the top.
Sometimes an Arduino has a different shape or form of microcontroller. Like the Metro:
This chip is a more compact version, but its functionally identical for use. It doesn't go into a socket, instead it is attached directly to the Arduino. It also has pins but the pins are much smaller and they sit on the surface of the circuit board, rather than go through holes in it. The main trade off is the bigger through hole version is user-replaceable (with care) whereas this surface mount version is less expensive but cannot be replaced.
The '328 microcontroller has:
- 28 Pins
- Requires about 0.1 Watts of power
- Runs at 16 MHz
- 32 KB of flash storage
- 2 KB of RAM
- Costs about $5 per
Compare this to, at the time of writing, a common computer chip, the Intel i5-6400
- 1151 Pins
- Requires about 35 Watts of power
- Runs at 2800 MHz
- No internal Flash storage, but most computers have at least 250 GB = 250,000 MB = 250,000,000 KB* of storage
- No internal RAM but most computers have at least 4 GB = 4,000 MB = 4,000,000* KB of RAM
- Costs about $200
(* yes I know its not exactly 1000)
So, clearly if you want an ultra powerful computer processor that can play the latest games, an i5 is the way to go. But its expensive, and requires a ton of power, and you need to have a full motherboard to run it so it's kinda big. If you just want to do some simple tasks, a microcontroller like the '328 is peachy. Also, its quite handy that it has the RAM and storage inside of it - its not a lot but that means you don't need to hook up a hard drive to this chip, its very compact and complete.
What's cool about the microcontroller is that unlike your computer which requires an operating system (Mac OS X or Windows) and booting up, the microcontroller is 'barebones'. When you plug it in, it immediately runs whatever you asked it to do.
And, you don't have to worry about a diskette or hard drive or cd-rom getting scratched or damaged. The storage inside of the chip lasts for a really long time. You could program your Arduino, leave it alone for decades, & come back and power it up with a post-apocalyptic-cyber-battery and it would work just as new.The Jefferson Project team is made up of scientists, meteorologists, technologists, engineers and environmentalists from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, IBM Research, and the Lake George Association.

I don’t know why but I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Maybe because I’m a sucker for a good teen romance movie or I look forward to watching the newest release that comes out at the end of the week. Chemical Hearts didn’t work for me though and instead was frustratingly dull. I regret waiting until 12 Am just to be able to watch it finally. Cause this movie doesn’t have a lot to offer other then a filter that has a nice aesthetic with some pleasing shots that come up once in a while, performances from the main two leads that really help this movie and a soundtrack that suits the the tone this movie is going for. Chemical hearts is a rather unfulfilling time and there’s not much to it. It has good themes and concepts but the execution of these concepts and themes never actually work. I couldn’t really care for any of the characters and oppositely felt like they were under developed overall. The movie tries to be so emotional, hard hitting and mellow but it doesn’t succeed at any. A lot of the story parts are predictable and if you have ever seen any modern teen romance flick this movie takes a lot of the same traditional routes and makes similar choices. Also it felt as though like the movie made decisions within the overall story just to be trendy. The choices and directions the story takes doesn’t have a lot of depth to it other then to appeal to a broader audience. I felt like that was lazy and wish they could of built better characters with a more engaging story leading viewers to care more. Overall Chemical Hearts was bland, it’s approach to this story was kind of predictable and I felt the outcome of it all was disappointing.
Of course the girl has blonde hair, likes to spend time alone, and has a really sad and traumatizing past. These stories just keep replaying over and over again, when will we get something new?
Heart Warming!
I feel like this is not going to meet the expectations of how good the book actually was. I feel like a lot of movies that come from books don't really live up to the actual book itself, which is honestly very disappointing.
i dunno if i like this like "damaged hot girl whose only prospect is the protagonist" fantasy
this guys been playing a high school senior since 2014
This is Harp.
When does this come out!?
How many movies are they gonna make like this can you come out with something in their original
Is there anything left in the story to watch the movie?
Rated R??? Hahahahahahaha.
THIS TAKES PLACE IN MY OLD SCHOOL OMG THATS SO COOL
he was really good in paper towns i cant imagine this movie
0:11 us up till March a few months ago 😂 btw this looks wack
Awwe it looks so cute ❤️😍
He played in “Scary Stories” 😱
Is this one of those movie ? Oh yeah, it is
Im sick of all of you… if
you wana know.. everyone is either great or terrible or we all are In-between
Looks dead.. arent we sick of teenagers yet?
well here we go, a good one from Prime 🙂
I thought this was s series
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 🥱
Ha, I'm almost that dude in real life
This ad lost me at when Lili opens her mouth: "Do you have a girlfriend?"
I dunno, Lili! Do YOU?????
i just really love to see Perfume Genius featured in like every teen movie trailer
Jesus Love's You
Its the kid from euphoria thats into Kat right?
yeah, like a girl who looks like that would have trouble socializing.
she made a movie about why she broke up with cole sprouce and how cole sprouce should have NOT let her go
Adults just doesn't know how it is to be young…
I thought its miley cyrus, still left a dislike lol
another angsty emo teen movie yaaay -.-
muito bacana
Out of the whole Riverdale cast Lili is definitely the most likely to break away from her character and be crazy successful in the future with serious roles. Not saying the others aren't talented to a point, but she unquestionably carries the show and makes the trash writing a little more bearable. While this could be another cliche teen drama/romance, at least she's a lead and will actually have a decent script to work with.
Oh, Prime Video? So not a REAL movie. Nebbermind den ✌🏽
OMG the dude from Paper Towns
Is he the guy from euphoria?
Is there going to be a Riverdale-esque twist? Like, serial killer alien baby with purple toast hats or something?
Ahh… this kind of movie really sucks. Why can’t they do a movie, same cast. But lili moves in next door, the guy is instantly attracted. But lili has a secret, she murders people at night. Secretly. For no reason whatsoever, it’s just a compulsion. She’s got the whole thing set up and thought out years in advance, even drives a car that is so abundant that no one would think twice looking at it, with mud smeared across the license plate. Then the guy and lili gets closer, he finds out her secret, she is sad and he wants to fix her. But there’s no fixing her. In the end, she dies in some ambiguous way and the guy goes on with his life. See? Something more interesting than… oh the girl has a broken leg. Come on Hollywood! Give me a new fking premise once in a while
I just came here coz I thought it was Timothee in the thumbnail
Thotty????🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

I’m sitting in car line waiting to pick up my kids, curious to know what they’ll tell me about their day (because, thankfully, they still do that, often without any encouragement from me). What emotions did they feel during their 8 hours away from me? What are their impressions of the day? Concerns? Comical memories? Will this day have made a lasting mark, or just be one in a long trail that makes up the fall of 2014?
I’m not so naive as to think they’re telling me everything, mind you. I’ve had the heartbreak of catching each child in a lie, and prayed the punishment would be effective enough to make them think twice before lying again. But if as parents we are the first models to our children of how God loves us, I want them to know they can share with me – good and bad – what’s been going on with them. My husband and I try to instill the values we believe will benefit them in their lives, and I’m sure you are doing the same with your children. It’s being conscientious and concerned for their futures.
The thing is – I know that I will fail. On my own I cannot do this. We cannot do this. I have a short fuse and get impatient with my kids. I have unfair expectations of them. I hold them to standards that I myself fall short of, and when pressed, I have denied this. Only in the light of God’s pure love can I really see just how imperfect I really am, and how many times throughout my life I’ve messed up. I’m blessed to have figured this out before my mothering years are over, so I can apologize to my kids when I make mistakes that I can see hurt them, and hopefully, they’ll become more empathetic to other sinners in the future.
So in car line, while I wait for my babies, I stare up at the gold cross on the top of the church adjacent to their school. To think that Mary watched her baby die an excruciating death, hanging from a cross. The only way she could have borne such misery was in total surrender to the infinite grace of God. And by clinging to God’s promises of love for the world. She stood on rock solid faith – belief in the evidence of what she could not see. As all of mankind’s evil was heaped on the shoulders of her son, she could not have understood in full the Lord’s plan. She must have been confused, in emotional turmoil and wracked with pain. What mother wouldn’t be? But she stayed there with Him. She needed to see her baby through the ordeal, and she knew she could trust Him. I trust Him too. And when I mess that up, I make the choice to trust again.
If there is one lesson I hope to teach my kids it’s this: He is worthy of ALL your trust. NO-THING and NO-ONE you will ever know is so worthy. And he hung there for you because there had to be a penalty for all of the things you’ve done that you want to hide from God, the same way you’d like to hide stuff you’ve done from me or Dad. Because in Perfect Love, absolute and Pure Light, there’s no room for dirt, no room for darkness. He KNOWS what you’ve done, but he wants you to come to Him, much the same way I want you to come to me – so I can show you again how much I love you and so I can help you see your problems in proper perspective. Because I want a permanent relationship with you. And so does God. So show HIM the dirt and the ugly stuff and He’ll gladly wash it away forever. Because he loves you more than you love yourself. And that’s a promise He can only keep, because God CAN’T lie.
For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
neither angels nor demons,
neither the present nor the future,
nor any powers, nor height nor depth,
nor anything else in all creation will be able
to separate us from the love of God
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

After winning the design commission in 2011, Zaha Hadid Architects recently broke ground on the Meixihu International Culture and Art Centre, a massive new cultural complex in Changsha, Hunan province. Encompassing an 1,800-seat theatre, a contemporary art museum and a number of multi-purpose venues, the complex spreads outward from a central plaza via interconnected lawns and foot-paths in a flower-like pattern, connected to nearby Festival Island via two pedestrian bridges.
As Dezeen notes this week, this complex is only the latest China project for the prolific Hadid’s firm. At the end of last year, Hadid completed the mixed-use Galaxy Soho complex, while the firm is currently in a rush to “finish the Wangjing Soho complex before a rival developer that has pirated the design.”

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive of all types of brain cancer. Especially in cancer research, the effectiveness of new drug candidates is being investigated with in vitro studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the antineoplastic effects of curcumin administration at different doses on U251 cells. We hypothesize that curcumin inhibits U251 cell viability by modulating prooxidant-antioxidant mechanisms, triggering ROS production, apoptosis activity, and inflammation. In this study, IL-1β, TNF-α, caspase 3/9 levels, total antioxidant (TAS) and total oxidant levels (TOS) were measured. Cell viability was determined by MTT and 10, 20 and 40 µM curcumin doses were found to be effective doses. It was found that the administration of 40 µM curcumin induced oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis compared to the control group and other dose groups (p<0.05). No statistical difference was found in the 10 µM curcumin group. We found that 40 µM curcumin had a dose-dependent effect on proliferation and migration of U251 glioblastoma cells and significantly inhibited their proliferation.Email Verizon Verizon Business customer service.

Absolute superstar of the collection - the gadget with cult status! Hardly any other statement piece is as multi-faceted as the innovative glasses cover. With the SunCover in Camouflage Black, you're right on trend! The pattern on the outside of the SunCover harmonises perfectly with the black interior. With the practical leather hanger it can also be easily attached to any bag or belt, so that your sunglasses are always ready to hand. The glasses are safely stowed away because soft microfibre pads protect the lenses from pressure, dust and scratches. The high-quality workmanship and silver-plated elements give the SunCover a noble touch. And this is how the cool EYE-accessory works: place SunCover over the lenses and close with the button. This gives the glasses a firm hold. Fold the temples at the back, done! Thanks to its patented design, the SunCover is suitable for all common shapes and sizes of glasses.

What I did do was almost complete a commission of Germans from a friend. I am a slow commission painter, which is why I only take commissions from friends. This one was a large German army with over 60 figures and half a dozen vehicles and had several pieces added mid commission, but it still took me about 6 months to finish. Clearly not the kind of speed to satisfy a customer I don’t know. I was down to 20 guys when the month started, and I’ve been banging out 6ish a week. The last NCOs are half done right now with just a MMG team left to build and paint and Chris will have a full force to march in front of my Americans.Continue reading “Meager progress for the week of April 19th.”Newman appears on the cover of People after dying of cancer.

Updated October 15, 2021 at 2:46 PM ET
Apple has fired a lead organizer of the #AppleToo movement, as the company investigates multiple employees suspected of leaking internal documents to the media.
Janneke Parrish, a program manager who had been with the company for more than five years, told NPR that she was fired on Thursday. Apple claimed she had deleted files and apps from her company phone amid an investigation into how details of a company meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook leaked to the press, Parrish said.
"This is retaliation. I have been one of the most visible members of #AppleToo. I know the risk of doing that," she said. "I see a consistent pattern when each of the members of #AppleToo are subjected to investigations or Apple leadership approaches them. There has been a pattern established."
#AppleToo has been spearheaded by Parrish and another Apple employee, Cher Scarlett, who is still at Apple but on medical leave and would not comment to NPR. The effort gathered hundreds of anonymous accounts from Apple employees who highlighted alleged verbal abuse, sexual harassment, pay equity issues and other forms of workplace mistreatment.
"I was hoping to give a voice to those who have been ignored, gaslit or retaliated against for abuse in the workplace," Parrish told NPR. "They are stories that echoed across the company."
Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said the company is committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive work environment.
"We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised, and out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters," he told NPR.
But employees at Apple who support #AppleToo say, like Parrish, they see her ouster as a reprisal for workplace organizing.
"Retaliating against Janneke is not going to stop Apple workers from standing up for themselves," said one employee who requested anonymity for fear of being targeted by the company. "There are many workers who support #AppleToo who are trying to break the culture of secrecy at the company, and they aren't going to stop."
A small but growing chorus of Silicon Valley workers, from industry giants like Google to smaller companies like Glitch, Mapbox and Change.org, has been drawing attention to everything from the precarious arrangements of contract workers to workplace harassment and abuse.
At Apple, a company known for respectable pay and generous company perks, workers have long had deference for leadership and kept complaints within the confines of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company. But Parrish and others became fed up with what they saw as a lack of progress inside the company, so they began speaking out publicly and organizing colleagues around common causes.
"Every internal avenue was closed," Parrish said. "Leadership closed them all. When that happens, what other option do we have?"
Vince White, a lawyer for Parrish, says Apple likely violated the law by firing his client.
"We're looking at a number of different retaliation claims under a variety of different statutes," White said. "This is an act of retaliation that can very well lead to litigation."
News of the firing comes weeks after it was revealed that the National Labor Relations Board is investigating two charges against Apple.
One was filed by former senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik, who claims that her manager at Apple harassed her and that the company gave her fewer responsibilities at work. In September, Apple fired Gjøvik for allegedly publicly sharing confidential company records.
The other charge was filed by Scarlett. She claimed Apple shut down her efforts to conduct companywide surveys of pay equity to shed light on what she says is a gender pay gap at the company. She said Apple even blocked her attempt to start a discussion on the workplace communication tool Slack about gender pay discrepancies.
The tech news website The Verge first reported on Parrish's firing.
Parrish said she has been overwhelmed with support from former colleagues at Apple, but she worries that her firing might have a chilling effect on other employees.
"This shows that there are consequences for standing up and saying, 'I disagree,' " she said.
On the other hand, she added, "I recognize how much this can galvanize people to do the right thing."

Where did whale hunting happen?
The Northern (or Arctic) whale fishery lasted from 1611 to 1914 and involved whaling primarily off Greenland, and particularly the Davis Strait. The Southern (or South Seas) whale fishery was active from 1775 to 1859 and involved whale hunting first in the South Atlantic, then in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
Which country hunts the most whales?
Norway has surpassed Japan and Iceland in its whale hunting quotas (which do not include dolphins), and now officially kills more whales than any country in the world.
When did whale hunting start?. hunting bad?.
Who killed the first whale?
Norwegians were among the first to hunt whales, as early as 4,000 years ago. The Japanese may have been doing so even earlier..
Does the US still hunt whales?
Catches have increased from 18 whales in 1985 to over 70 whales in 2010. The latest IWC quota regarding the subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale allows for up to 336 to be killed in the period 2013–2018. Residents of the United States are also subject to the federal bans against whaling as well.
What countries still kill whales?
Whaling is illegal in most countries, however Iceland, Norway, and Japan still actively engage in whaling. Over a thousand whales are killed each year for their meat and body parts to be sold for commercial gain.
Is Japan a whaling?
This was the first southern summer since Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and switched its explicit focus to commercial whaling, but only within its own exclusive economic zone.
Why does Japan hunt whale oil edible?
At that time, as The History of Modern Whaling reports, whale oil was “the cheapest of all edible oils”—a natural economic choice for margarine production. (It could, however, leave the margarine with a “fishy taste.”) As a result, margarine could be made with whale oil as its only fat.…
Where is Paul Watson now?
He is living in Vermont, writing books. He was in Paris since July 1, 2014 but has since returned to USA. In March 2019, Costa Rica dropped all charges against Watson and has removed the Interpol red notice.
Is The.”Planning go ahead for safety works at Llyn Tegid
Plans to make sure Wales’ largest natural lake remains safe in the long-term took a major step forward today (Wednesday, 19 May), with Snowdonia National Park Authority granting planning permission for the scheme to go ahead.
The work is designed to make sure Llyn Tegid in Y Bala can continue to withstand extreme weather now and in the future, while also bringing recreation and environmental benefits to the local community.
Sian Williams, Head of North West Wales Operations for Natural Resources WAles (NRW) said:
“The lake’s embankments give vital protection from flooding to the town of Bala and we have a responsibility to make sure the town remains safe.
“We’ve been discussing with people locally over the last two years to explore ideas for mitigation and wider community opportunities. These will be developed alongside the lake safety works, including improving paths and creating new wildlife habitats.”
The main focus of the work is strengthening the embankments and replacing the lakeshore stone wave protection.
Sian Williams added:
“It is a matter of regret for us that the work will involve removing self-seeded trees - mainly ash - which are growing in and weakening the lakeshore embankments.
“The removal of trees is unavoidable so that we can strengthen the embankments. But we are fully committed to retaining as many mature trees as possible and will be planting three times more trees locally than we have to remove.”
Sara Thomas, Planning Officer for the Snowdonia National Park Authority said:
“As an Authority we’re pleased to support this essential scheme that will ultimately protect the town of Y Bala and further areas along the course of River Dee from flooding.
“It is regrettable that the scheme involves the loss of trees that have established along the embankment, but we are confident that the mitigation measures which includes planting three trees for every one lost will, eventually, enhance the natural environment and create a new habitat for local wildlife”.
Other community benefits to be developed alongside the safety works include:
Improving footpaths for all abilities;
Creating new seating areas;
Restoring habitats including sensitive improvements to the lakeside car park;
Creating wildflower meadows;
Producing resources for local schools to use for environmental education.
Subject to meeting all planning conditions, works are expected to start later this year and last up to 2 years in duration. NRW will continue to work closely with the community and partners throughout to keep disruption to a minimum.
NRW also continues to work with Bala Lake Railway to consider how their proposed extension could be managed alongside this work.
Sian Williams added:
“The huge environmental value of the area and its importance to the local community, for recreation and tourism will be fully considered throughout the scheme to its completion.”

Description
Creating 3D environments in Blender!
The profession continues
For centuries, making environments has been something that many artists do to impress other people. Since the advent of computer graphics there is a new wave of designers studying this lovely profession. This course reveals some fundamental lessons from the old painting masters. Use the course to get the max out Blender and learn to create high quality 3D environments.
Starting from scratch
The complexity of many scenes is often holding people back from creating environmental scenes in 3D. Most designers drop-out halfway and are then facing their unfinished work because it takes a lot of time and work to create scenes with architecture and nature. I faced this many times, but because I was so inspired by medieval architecture, I took the time to learn how to create 3D environments in a way in which I could express myself. During this process I struggled hard and made many unnecessary choices that slowed down my progression. The power of this course is that it shows you exactly what you need to design 3D environments and which details you might want to avoid or postpone in order to make the most out of your own progression.
The road to perfection
We all want to create beautiful scenes, but making these scenes can be a big challenge. This course is not only a technical education, it also covers topics like focus, inspiration and organization. I believe that a well-organized focused designer, with the right inspiration, will be able to make every 3D dream come to life. This course is well documented and guides you through the process of creating 3D scenes in Blender 2.81.
From ruin to castle
This course will guide you through the new Blender 2.81 interface. Together we make our first steps in Blender. Slowly we start building objects and after one chapter you will be able to make a small dice scene. This warming-up is needed to get used to the workflow and make you comfortable with Blender and the things that will come. Shortly after that, we will jump into the node editor. We will start mixing textures, just like the old painting masters, to get decent looking results. We will apply the material on a ruin and build the first environment scene. Then we will start building a farmhouse in a medieval style. We will use the workbench for modeling, Eevee for the texture work and Cycles to render the scenes to get the max out of it. After finishing the farmhouse, we merge the building with a nature environment. We will create the trees with the sapling add-on, so you will not need any external plugins. There is a full chapter about creating nature assets and in the final castle scene we will merge everything together to make a wonderful environmental scene. All content and textures come from Texture/HDRI Haven and are included in the course.

As a kid, it was the best. I love that I have so much family and that we make time to see them all.
My little sister moved to Connecticut this year and after hours of face timing, the kids were pretty excited to see her in real life. Especially Quinn. We had a family night at my parent’s house Saturday night and we rocked a gingerbread house. Quinn really wanted to make one. At 29, this was my very first gingerbread house.
Sunday was Christmas with Ross’s family. There was this yummy veggie dish that I have to steal the recipe for. There were presents, of course. Ross and I were lucky enough to be gifted an iPad. WhatWhat! We also got the absolute coolest handmade gift ever from Ross’s sister. She made one for our family and her other brother’s family and her parents. This is so much cuter than the picture shows. I swear! Check out Ross with the new baby in a baby carrier.
By the time we got home I was beat. I slid on my new slippers and dug into my chocolate covered pretzels. Don’t judge. Ross and I decided we would worry about the pile of presents sitting in our kitchen later and chilled out with a movie, The Bourne Legacy. I was slightly disappointed. I am a sucker for Matt Damon. If he is in a movie, I instantly want to see it. Anyone else?
Monday was Christmas Eve and we had a lot left to get done before the big guy came. We let the kiddos open a present from us. Each kiddo got something and then we as a family got Brave, which we watched. We think a movie Christmas Eve day will be a tradition around here.
We did 4:30 mass. Unfortunately, in order to get a seat you have to get there kind of early. It gets long for the kiddos, but they were pretty good.
I attempted to take pictures of the kids in front of the tree. I really wanted a family picture, but setting up a tripod and timer was out of the question. I was barely able to capture anything useable. It was so cute how they tried to follow directions.
Then we got to baking. Santa needed cookies. This one had been on Quinn’s to-do list for sometime, but somehow it got put off to the last minute. I mean, Santa didn’t want stale cookies.
When we bake I just let Quinn do his thing. It isn’t about pretty cookies, it is about a pretty experience. After cookies Quinn put carrots on the back deck for Santa’s reindeer.
Santa’s reindeer ate them too! And they left chewed up carrots all over. Santa came!
Then it was Christmas morning. Hard to believe it was already here. We had told Quinn to yell for us when he woke up and we would come get him. We knew he would see the tree on his way down to our room and we really wanted to witness his reaction. Being the rule follower he is, that is exactly what he did. I actually had a hard time sleeping, because I was so excited for the kiddos.
Quinn yelled, Ross got him, we gathered in our room for a moment while Ross and I found our glasses and made ourselves presentable and then we woke up Eleanor. We told the kiddos to sit tight in E’s room while we grabbed the camera. I grabbed the digital camera and Ross grabbed the video camera and then we called them out. Quinn came out. Did some sort of dance.
There was no sign of Eleanor. Yelled for her again and she finally comes out pushing her cart (Christmas present from Ross’s parents).
We did the whole opening presents gig. Eleanor liked playing with her presents, but didn’t care too much for opening them. Quinn absolutely loved everything about it and exclaimed, “I didn’t know Santa was going to bring me this much stuff!”.
After all was said and done, it looked something like this.
By 8:30 we were at my brother’s house. Luckily he lives a street over and two blocks down. We were still in our pajamas. My twin brother and his wife hosted breakfast. Yummy french toast, sausage and fruit. My parents, my little sister and her husband and my little brother were all there as well. This is kind of our gathering for our immediate family before chaos ensues. Check out my cutie pie spy!
My brother’s wife is a Kindergarten teacher and her class has a pet turtle. The turtle was home over Christmas break. Eleanor is both obsessed and scared of it. She wants to see it, but she is unsure.
That is my brother showing Eleanor the turtle. Once again, more presents. Ross and I got a Keurig from my parents and we are kind of obsessed now. If you have one and found a k-cup flavor you love, SPILL! After breakfast and presents it was back home to shower and then off to our next Christmas event.
We do lunch and my grandparents on my dad’s side. We always play bingo. No, I didn’t win. My brother one twice. If you win, you win a scratch off lottery ticket and both of his tickets were winners too. Lucky guy. After my grandparents on my dad’s side we headed to my grandparent’s on my mom’s side. Eleanor fell asleep on the way (only a 10 minute drive) and stayed a sleep in Ross’s lap for a couple hours. Thank god, because she would have been a hot mess without the nap. My grandparents on my mom’s side is complete and wonderful chaos. They have 12 children. Their children, grandchildren, great grandchildren all add up to make some pretty impressive numbers. As a kid this was the best part of Christmas. I couldn’t wait to see my cousins and tell them what I got and spend all day playing.
Another holiday tradition we have is game night. It never really is planned, per say, but it always happens. We get new games for Christmas, everyone is off and home and it just seems like the right thing to do. This year we did a burrito dinner at my house for the family. My sister and her husband were the chefs. My cousin joined us later in the evening for game night as well.
So yes, our holiday is full and chaotic and crazy, but I feel so blessed to have so much family to share the holidays with. I hope that you had a magical, family-filled, Christmas as well.
