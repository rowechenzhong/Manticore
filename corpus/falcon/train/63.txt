We’re in Australia shooting photos. We hope to get to this in the next few days. Our apologies. September 10, 2010 at 6:36 am #19790 Duncan RawlinsonKeymaster When you ‘boil it down’ this assignment is really about the process of organizing chaos. This sounds like an oxymoron but in good photography you’re often forced to do this. When you’re out shooting the world is a busy, cluttered and distracting place. You have to focus on what makes a good photograph and often this just means cutting out everything except the utmost essential items to fill your frame. In your first image (the green leaves) you’ve got the right idea but your depth of field is a little off. One of the largest elements in the frame, the leaf in the foreground is out of focus and yet your eye is still drawn to it. This is distracting and it takes away from the image. If you had shot with the entire frame in focus this may have worked out nicer. One technique you may have chosen to use is called ‘focus stacking’ but that’s a bit too involved for this assignment. The second photo is much better in terms of this assignment. You’ve taken something complex and disorganized and added a layer of simplicity to it through composition and color. Well done! Photography is often about organizing chaos. Try to keep that in mind when you shoot. Author Posts Viewing 3 posts - 1 through 3 (of 3 total) You must be logged in to reply to this topic.

Supermarket giant Asda is facing a backlash after enforcing new contracts on all 120,000 of its staff, including those in its Lincoln area stores.
The GMB Union, which represents the Asda staff, says the new terms remove paid breaks, and allow Asda to change workers’ roles, hours, shifts and start and finishing times.
However, an Asda spokesperson responded: “This contract is about fairness for all our colleagues and moves us in line with our competitors.
“We understand people have responsibilities outside of work, we will not be asking them to constantly move the time they work, their days, or department.
“Although we did not want anyone to leave us as a result of this necessary change, around 200 people decided not to sign the contract, an average of less than one person for every two stores.”
Asda has three Lincoln area stores, with a superstore in North Hykeham, an Asda Living in Valentine Retail Park, and a supermarket on Nettleham Road.
Basic pay will rise from £8.21 an hour to £9, and then to £9.18 in April.
A worker from a store in Lincolnshire, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I know they’re giving us a pay rise, but I think that’s just to sugar coat the rest of it.”
They added: “You’re hearing stories of people who have worked at the store for years being sacked because they don’t want to sign away their bank holidays. An 18p pay rise won’t distract people from what they’re missing out on.”
#boycottasda was also trending on Twitter, with a GMB Union poll revealing 37% of people would be less likely to shop there after hearing about the new terms.
A deadline to sign the contract was initially November 2, but, this was extended by a week to give staff more thinking time, with the majority of staff now signing the contract.Markets and Economy
The Economic Toll and Recovery Efforts of COVID-19
The novel coronavirus outbreak has had a major effect on businesses in dining, hospitality and travel sectors, and small and mid-sized businesses. In response, the federal government is enacting fiscal and monetary relief efforts.
Key points:
- Local action in America’s largest cities have caused small and mid-sized businesses to close their doors, resulting in an unprecedented wave of layoffs—many may need additional assistance to stay afloat.
- On March 25, the White House reached a deal with lawmakers on a $2 trillion stimulus package to help buffer the US economy from COVID-19.
- The bill will provide direct financial checks to Americans, relief to small businesses and additional resources to healthcare providers.
- The Federal Reserve has taken action to stabilize credit markets and reduce borrowing costs to help larger businesses manage the crisis.
Listening to layoffs: The week ending March 14 saw a surge in layoffs in California, Washington, Nevada, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, Massachusetts, New York, Georgia and North Carolina.
- Subsequently, unemployment insurance applications—which offer the most timely, accurate and comprehensive measure of economic distress—increased in these states.
- As of March 23, local governments have shuttered restaurants across the country, with most only available for takeout or delivery. More than 28 states have closed non-essential businesses or ordered their residents to remain at home.
- Some job losses will be offset as consumer spending shifts, with online retailers and wholesalers adding positions to accommodate growing demand.
- But the economy is likely to continue hemorrhaging jobs until the outbreak is contained.
Federal action to the rescue: The legislative relief package will provide direct cash payments to millions of Americans and expand unemployment insurance benefits— helping low-to-middle-income households and those whose livelihoods have been placed on hold.
- The bill expanded unemployment insurance eligibility and offered workers an additional $600 per week for four months on top of state programs.
- It also created a $367B loan program for small businesses and put aside $50B for the Small Business Administration.
- A separate $425B lending fund was created for industries, cities and states.
- The Federal Reserve has injected liquidity into capital markets, cut interest rates to near zero, and established several new lending facilities to help maintain access to credit through the downturn.
- This expanded access to credit markets may keep some large corporations from suspending operations during the crisis.
Light at the end of the tunnel: Asia’s largest economies appear to be rebounding from the outbreak.
- In Japan, the infection rate appears to have crested at fewer than one in 1 million people. South Korea was harder hit with in an infection rate of approximately 1.6 of every 1,000 people. Neither country saw its workforce significantly diminished by the virus.
- In China, most businesses have resumed operations. Numerous indicators—including electricity production, coal consumption, traffic congestion and price data—confirm that mainland China’s economic activity has likely regained about 90 percent of its pre-outbreak levels.
- The timeline for America’s recovery depends on the efficacy of current containment measures.
Although economic uncertainty and layoffs remain on the horizon, swift government action to stabilize households and businesses should help the economy snap back when the novel coronavirus outbreak is contained..Recent Searches

On innovation, bathrooms, and bragging rights
Colin here. Most travelers to Japan will remember their first encounter with the futuristic TOTO toilet. Checking into a hotel like the Park Hyatt Tokyo after a long flight and encountering a toilet more advanced than the plane you flew in on can leave you feeling like US civilization is stuck in the stone age. As you approach the toilet, the lid raises with a gentle glow to illuminate your way. The seat is heated for those chillier winter months, and a console of buttons allows you to dial in specific preferences including the pressure on calibrated water spray that keeps things, shall we say, hygienic. The brand has seemingly thought of everything—from ambient sounds to mask unsavory sounds in more public environments, to anti-germ treatments, and even a dryer function. This sophisticated approach to the bathroom is ensconced across Japanese culture, with the seats are even featured in the national carrier, Japan Air Lines, as well as ANA (which introduced the product in 2007 on its Dreamliners).
Owning a TOTO is a wink at the international arbitrage of consumer culture: finding the best of something in a far-flung place and making it yours. It is a status symbol to have one in your newly renovated Wooster street loft, imbuing your new bathroom with worldliness and sophistication for your guests. Oh, this? I picked up the habit in Japan.
Why is this interesting?
But it turns out that the sales process for TOTO to sell to American consumers is a long, and convoluted one. One that defies the traditional purchase funnel taught to marketing undergraduates. According to the Times (from 2015):
Toto doesn’t sell its washlets in big-box stores like Home Depot, preferring the showroom experience instead….
Indeed, it seems that the catalyst for sales is often just exposure to the brand in Asia-centric travel which makes those Japanese airline integrations more strategic than they seem!
To note: COVID was also a sales accelerant for old school bidets, as well as the futuristic toilets in the US, amidst fears of runs on toilet paper. But overall, the future has failed to truly take hold on American shores. Our collective toilet dynamic seems akin to still using a Nokia phone when you know that an iPhone 13 Pro exists. Could the stranglehold of Kohler or the classic American Standard toilet be too strong? Or maybe it is truly the long game of brand building and sales penetration, one that TOTO seems happy to play. (CJN)

In this week's edition of our open source news roundup, we take a look at the adoption of open source databases, Creative Commons licensing to Open edX courses, SSH coming to Microsoft Windows, and more!
Open source news: May 30 - June 5, 2015
Why your next database will be open source
New data is increasingly finding its way into open source databases. This is what Matt Asay writes about for InforWorld. In his article, he says, "...open-source RDBMS products have matured in the availability of DBA skills, availability of DBA tools and near-equality of RDBMS functionality." The accelerated adoption has many reasons, the top one being community. Asay also looks at developers and DevOps teams who play a role in this increasing adoption.
In another article this week about databases, specifically about the NoSQL databases, Asay looks at PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra.
Open edX adds Creative Commons licensing
Open edX announced this week that it has added Creative Commons licenses to its platform. Course authors can now choose a Creative Commons license for their courseware. The platform also allows for a mix of licenses, so you can include copyrighted videos or other materials too. Creative Commons writes in their own blog post that with this addition, edX joins the global Open Educational Resources (OER) movement. The Delft University of Technology played a big role in this news as well—the CC plugin was developed during Open Education Week 2014, an Open edX hackathon organized by Delft.
Microsoft Windows support for SSH
Many news sites this week, including IT World, covered the news on Microsoft Windows, which will add SSH support to its PowelShell. Secure Shell protocol and Shell session, known as SSH, is used by many Linux administrators. With this SSH support, Windows users will be able to securely connect and run terminal commands on Windows and Linux machines. The PowelShell team will be sharing their work with the OpenSSH project and its community. This new open source addition to Windows is in the planning phase; there is no release date yet.
Toyota eyes Ford's smartphone interface
Toyota announced it might adopt the open source SmartDeviceLink (SDL) protocol from Ford. This is the open source smartphone linking technology called Ford AppLink. Lucas Mearian writes for Computerworld that Toyota is collaborating with Livio, a Ford subsidiary, to implement the SDL technology in Toyota and Lexus vehicles. "Ford created SmartDeviceLink by contributing the AppLink software to the open-source community. The carmaker rolled out the API in 2013."
Open data hiding in plain sight
Beth Simone Noveck, US first deputy chief technology officer, and currently director of The Governance Lab, writes about how open data can be a powerful tool for better governing. She looks at nonprofit tax returns and the richness of data contained in these filings. The Cancer Fund would benefit from this data being fully open, machine-readable. As Noveck writes, "major efforts are underway to make nonprofit filing data more open."

This is the item of clothing that allows women to look strictly, mysteriously, modestly or elegantly. With the help of him, a woman can discover in herself many, completely unknown to her earlier faces, try on various images. The presence of dresses helps to be completely different and unique every day.. And this wonderful piece of clothing can be worn not only for women with a perfect figure, but also full (you only need to choose it correctly).
Chiffon dresses
This fabric is especially relevant in the warm period of time. The reason for this is its lightness, almost weightlessness, as well as the images that are created with its help. Any girl in a chiffon dress looks graceful, there is lightness in the movements. Chiffon is a very durable fabric, and the patterns on it are unusually bright and juicy. Ideal for late spring, hot summer and early autumn!
Design of chiffon dresses for full
Of course, when there are flaws in the figure, it is necessary to emphasize the virtues so that no one ever guesses about these imperfections! Empress (high-waisted) or baby-dollar dresses will help emphasize the breasts and hide the wide hips and waist.
Pay attention also to trapezoid cut. These dresses do not fit problem areas, but rather distract attention from them. In such dresses, girls and women look very cute. If you are wearing such clothes, no one will need your flaws.
Another win-win option - sarong style. Such clothes are distinguished by the presence of a variety of draperies that will help to hide flaws. The main rule: do not overdo it! After all, with the help of decorations, it is possible to secure a far from unprofitable image. But if you have a taste and a sense of proportion, you can not worry! You will undoubtedly make the right choice! However, you can safely choose breasts dresses. After all, this is your main advantage!
The color of chiffon dresses for full
Proper selection of colors is very important when buying a dress. The effect of color on how others will see your figure is huge! It has long been known that the use of dark colors for clothing gives the visual slim figure. Guided by this, it is necessary to remember that it is better to choose a light "top" and a dark "bottom". Such a transition from color to color will visually stretch the figure, improve proportionality.
However, in the summer, you should not wear dresses that are too dark, such as black and dark brown. Take a closer look at the purple or turquoise. You may have the result to your taste!

Chiffon dress decor for obese women
It is not recommended for full women to wear plain dresses. This is due to the fact that the plain clothes attract attention to the figure. In the summer of lady with curvaceous better to choose a dress with a fun large floral print. Such a drawing distracts attention from your forms, and therefore, will hide the disadvantages. Besides, floral prints will give you romance and femininity. You yourself will feel charming, lift your spirits and be able to enjoy the summer sun, without thinking about any imperfections of your figure.
Full length chiffon dress
Girls with curvaceous shapes are advised to choose shorter dresses. If you have enough slender legs, then such dresses will create an emphasis on them, hiding your flaws. In addition, shorter dresses make you taller and your figure more elongated. And most importantly, short and medium length dresses make your look more flirty.
The correct dress is very difficult to find. But if you know what you want to hide, and what, on the contrary, to show, your task is greatly facilitated. The main thing, remember that in all good to know when to stop. Do not overdo it with brightness, decor or length! If you do everything right, your chiffon cloud will make you a queen and just a delightful lady in any setting!Our secret is to talk to old customers to improve continuously.

How to get maximum value from market research
Updated: Oct 16
A client case study : Inno Construction
The challenge
Having seen customer demand change dramatically during the first lockdown, we suggested to our client Inno Construction to invest in market research. Not only would this help with their marketing strategy as they would be better informed on rapidly changing customer needs, but they could use the research to create engaging marketing assets and raise their profile on a much wider level in Kent through communicating the most interesting results to secure press coverage.
The solution
Sharp Thinking suggested conducting some market research to find out home improvement priorities for homeowners across Kent via quantitative research. This is because it would be quick to undertake and would give us a robust sample to PR and leverage key findings using eye-catching infographics. From the market research, we helped to script and commission, our construction client not only gained invaluable insight but we were able to turn this into a PR campaign to raise their profile across the whole of Kent using expert agency Carnsight Communications.
The construction firm expected less business in an economic downturn, but the first lockdown turned out to be one of the biggest opportunities for the construction industry as homeowners were spending considerable money on home improvements. We suggested capitalising on this and also taking advantage of an increase in media and social media consumption whilst people were stuck in their homes.
The results
The results proved invaluable and could be leveraged in a number of different ways.
1. New positioning
The research showed a third of homeowners were no longer planning to move house and half had redirected these funds to home improvements. Interestingly, nearly a quarter of people had experienced DIY disasters and our construction client was already witnessing panicking customers calling them to help pick up the pieces when things had gone wrong during customer's own DIY attempts. This was an interesting insight and helped us construct a new positioning and messaging.
2. A new sales pitch
The research allowed the construction business to flex their offering and highlight sought-after projects they could help customers with like home offices on the top of people's wish lists. This helped both with sales and marketing ensuring their new business pitch was relevant, insightful, and topical. New messaging was developed and was used in customer acquisition letters and follow up calls.
2. Create eye-catching marketing assets
Infographics are eye-catching and get attention but you need data and a powerful story to tell. The research and data gave us the perfect foundations. We could communicate the key findings and tell a story visually using graphics. These were used across all our client's marketing.
3. Helped secure saught after press coverage
With specialist PR agency support, a prime time TV slot on KMTV was secured and a further six pieces of press coverage were generated. This gave the small business based in Kent exposure to nearly 4 million people and over 100 social shares.
4. Use in direct mail generating a ROI of 33:1
We also communicated key findings from the research in a direct mail campaign which generated 2 sales to the value of over £100k on a £3k spend in two months alone.
Although market research is often perceived to be expensive and used more for business planning purposes, a large scale quantitative based survey can be used in so many different ways. The content can be repurposed too so it has a longer shelf life. This case study shows how it can be used across sales, marketing and PR ensuring the client gets true value from the research.

Numerous authors have used cross-section regression methods to explain interindustry variations in net exports by means of factor-use ratios as one of the tests of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. This paper shows, via an algebraic proof, that the regression procedures used by these authors may be inappropriate tests of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. Specifically, the paper shows that in a framework of many goods and factors, inferences about the relative abundance of a particular factor cannot be made by looking at the signs of the regression coefficients unless very stringent requirements are met.

The former Hoops defender is the main man now after Neil Lennon's exit earlier this week and has made some interesting choices in his team.
And he's made a big decision by handing a starting spot to Polish striker Patryk Klimala for the first time since the Europa League win over Lille in December.
He starts up front alongside Odsonne Edouard in what looks like a 4-4-2 diamond formation, with Ryan Christie playing in the 10 position.
Scott Brown begins in midfield alongside Callum McGregor and David Turnbull and there's also one change in defence.
Greg Taylor drops out with an injury and is replaced by Diego Laxalt, who starts alongside Jonjoe Kenny, Stephen Welsh and Kris Ajer.
Vasilis Barkas remains an absentee with Scott Bain starting in goals.

Phone: 970-351-6255Today we are going to be discussing Contact Calendly Support…I have used Calendly in a handful of different methods. The most typical usage case for myself is through my emailing and prospecting tool. I connect to a lot of individuals via email. Many individuals do not wish to take the time to respond, so having a link in the email makes the scheduling procedure a lot easier. My variety of conferences increased when I was using Calendly.
Today comes news from a start-up that has actually been a part of that pattern: Calendly, a popular cloud-based service that people utilize to set up and verify conference times with others, has closed an investment of $350 million from OpenView Endeavor Partners and Iconiq.
The financing round includes both main and secondary cash (somewhat more of the latter than the former, essentially a really easy piece of functionality.
It’s a platform that provides a quick way to manage open spaces in your calendar for people to book consultations varieties from totally free (one calendar/one user/one event) to premium ($ 8/month) and pro ($ 12/month) for more calendars, occasions, combinations and features, with larger plans for enterprises also available.
Its development, on the other hand, needs to date been based mostly around an extremely natural technique: Calendly welcomes become links to Calendly itself, so people who use it and like it can (and do) start to utilize it, too.
The vast array of its use cases, and the virality of that development technique, have been winners. Calendly is currently lucrative, and it has actually been for several years. And more recently, it has actually seen a boost, particularly in the last twelve months, as brand-new Calendly users have emerged, as a result of how we are living.
We might not be doing more conventional “service conferences” weekly, but the number of conferences we now require to establish, has actually gone up.
All of the unscripted and serendipitous encounters we utilized to have around an office, or a neighborhood coffeehouse, or the park? Those are now arranged. Educators and trainees meeting for a remote lesson? Those also require invitations for online meetings.
And so do sessions with therapists, virtual supper celebrations, and even (where they can still occur) in-person conferences, which are often now happening with more timed accuracy and more record-keeping, to keep social distancing and potential contact tracing in much better order.
Currently, some 10 countless us are utilizing Calendly for all of this on a monthly basis, with that number growing 1,180% last year. The army of organization users from companies like Twilio, Zoom, and UCSF has been joined by teachers, specialists, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, the company states.
The company last year made about $70 million each year in membership earnings from its SaaS-based service model and seems confident that its aggregated earnings will not long from now get to $1 billion.
While the secondary funding is going towards offering liquidity to existing investors and early employees, Awotona said the strategy will be to utilize the main capital to invest in the company’s organization.
That will include constructing out its platform with more tools and combinations– it started with and still has a considerable R&D operation in Kiev, Ukraine– expanding its operations with more skill (it presently has around 200 staff members and strategies to double headcount), additional service development and more. Contact Calendly Support
Two significant proceed that front are likewise being revealed with the financing: Jeff Diana is coming on as primary individuals officer with an objective to double the already a huge change for Calendly. The start-up, which is going on eight years old, has been rather off the radar for several years.
That remains in part due to the fact that it raised extremely little cash already (simply $550,000 from a handful of financiers that consist of OpenView, Atlanta Ventures, IncWell and Greenspring Associates).
It’s likewise based in Atlanta, an increasingly noteworthy city for innovation start-ups and other companies however typically short on being credited for its heft because silently and continued to get on with organization, were it not for a short Tweet last autumn that indicated the company raising cash and shaping up to be a quiet giant.
” The company’s capital performance and what @TopeAwotona has actually built are worthy of way more credit than they get,” it checked out. “Maybe this will begin to change that acknowledgment.”
Does Calendly have a free option? Contact Calendly Support
After that brief note on Twitter– flagged on TechCrunch’s internal message board– I made a guess at Awotona’s email, sent out a note presenting myself, and waited to see if I would get a reply.
I ultimately did get an action, in the form of a short note agreeing to chat, with a Calendly link (naturally) to pick a time.

Dr. Moss' dental hygienist is very friendly and professional. He was careful not to cause pain since I have sensitive teeth. My teeth have quite a lot of stain and he worked diligently to remove as much as possible. Dr. Moss is always friendly and thorough.

Let's Reverse Our Perspective. We came here to learn and develop. Throughout life, you can choose to suffer or enjoy. I choose Joy!
Pathways to Happiness - there are two options for private sessions:
Mind & Soul Sessions
A set of hour and a half long sessions of guidance, in which we explore and study life changing methods and tools that are easy to apply, solve challenges and enable personal breakthroughs. The results are rapid, you come out feeling awesome and so will the people around you.
The Sessions are effective and enlightening for all human beings that want to live happy and fulfilling lives. But they are an essential opportunity if you feel stuck or exhausted, if you are struggling with a relationship (whether with yourself, another person, your past, your future, anything), if you want to adjust life stressor or depression – this is a wonderful opportunity for you!
Body, Mind & Soul Sessions
A set of 2-hour long sessions that include guidance and conversation, short therapeutic yoga practice and Thai-Yoga-Therapy. These sessions are marvelous! In an overall treatment we get a healthy, comfortable body, a clear mind and a happy soul. These sessions are a wonderful experience for all human beings, easing pains for both body and soul.
Background:
We essentially live in a giant amusement park, and in this park we can suffer from the sun, the yelling and loud noises around us, the long lines and crowds. Alternatively, we can enjoy the breeze, the fun vibe, the big Ferris wheel and the sense of childhood and freedom. It is all in our heads. Sometimes we need help to be pulled out of our current perspective to enable us a fresh view, a different and reversed. This allows us to enjoy our time here, be happy and succeed.
Our experiences affect us from a very young age. Everyone carries their own burden of habits, beliefs and challenges. All through life we meet various challenges with relationships and unique situations. These invite us to learn, grow and rid ourselves of unwanted stuff that weighs down our sack. In private sessions we discuss and learn tools, how to manage ourselves in life. We study the roots of our challenges and address them, leaving unnecessary burdens behind.
The body and soul are connected. The body informs us about what's going on internally, and the soul suffers, when there is an illness or pain in the body. Relief for the body is relief for the soul, and vice versa.
My tools come from a broad range of experiences, spanning from business and management tools to the wisdom of various beliefs and therapies. These include: the wisdom of Yoga, Zen, Buddhism and Kabbalah and therapies such as Yoga Therapy, Natural Health, the Ein Habdolach method, In consciousness love therapy, Thai Yoga Therapy, and Biorgonomy.
In every session we will explore and learn useful life changing tools relevant to your life.
If you have the will to ease the burden of your sack, that is heavy and restrains,
If you wish to reconnect with yourself, find your largest version and your purpose
If you want to live with joy and satisfaction and to bring your abilities and strengths to implementation
– I am here.
A small tip before we begin, always true: LOVE IS THE ANSWER : )
Long past time British government implemented the protocol - Hazzard
Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard has said five years on from the Brexit referendum it is long past the time the British government implemented the protocol to give businesses the certainty they need.
Chris Hazzard said:
"Five years ago today the people of the north voted to reject Brexit because they knew the impact it would have on our economy, our communities and on our island.
"The British government and its supporters ignored this and dragged us out of the EU against the democratic wishes of the majority.
"Now, five years on they are trying to undermine the protocol that was necessary as a result of Brexit and hollow out the protections that businesses, farmers, retailers and manufacturers need.
"The protocol has been agreed. It is long past the time that was implemented to give businesses the certainty and stability they require to get on with what they do."5-7 Rue Jean GiraudouxParis, France 75016View Large Map Phone: +33 1-5357-6789Fax: +33 1-4070-0670 Hotel E-mailHotel Website Commission Rooms Rates 10% 10 $666-$666 (USD) Hoteliers!

- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
Two teams evenly split the Championship 4 — Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing, two drivers apiece — but their 2021 season stats aren’t so even.
Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott represent Hendrick Motorsports, while Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. hail from Joe Gibbs Racing. Larson (nine) and Elliott (two) alone combine for 11 of the 35 race wins this season. Hamlin (two) and Truex (four) are responsible for six together — almost half the amount.
“Usually, a lot of times, JGR might be the favorite going into a championship race,” said Wally Brown, Joe Gibbs Racing’s competition director. “I think we’re definitely the underdogs. We have to beat the guy, Kyle Larson, that has won so many races, been so dominant this year. Then you have Chase, the reigning champion at this track. We’re definitely the underdog.”
RELATED: Championship 4 set for Phoenix | Hamlin blasts winner Bowman at Martinsville
According to the latest odds from BetMGM, Larson (7-5) is the favorite to win the championship after Sunday’s finale at Phoenix Raceway (3 p.m. ET on NBC/NBC Sports App, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Elliott (11-4) posts the next-best odds, with Hamlin (4-1) and Truex (9-2) following.
“As far as us going in with the advantage, personally I don’t see it that way,” said Jeff Andrews, Hendrick Motorsports’ general manager and executive vice president. “There may be statistically you could make that argument. From ourselves and how we’re approaching it, we’re going out there to race with Joe Gibbs Racing, one of the best teams in the history of this sport.”
Joe Gibbs Racing owns five NASCAR Cup Series championships. Hendrick Motorsports boasts 13.
Hamlin leads the title-eligible crop with two career wins (spring 2012 and fall 2019) at the 1-mile track in Arizona. Truex and Elliott have one victory each, both coming in the two most recent events held there. Truex won the spring race earlier this season; Elliott won last year’s season finale. Larson, meanwhile, has not won in the desert.
Overall this season, the four drivers lead the series in laps led. Larson (2,474), though, has nearly a 1,000-lap advantage over Hamlin (1,502). Elliott (858) doesn’t break into the thousands and has the third-best mark. Truex (793) rounds the group out.
“We just don’t have the raw speed they’ve had this year, to be honest,” Brown said. “We’re trying to figure that out. They’ve just beaten us, just faster everywhere. I think for us, we’re going to have to be able to do our best job, run a very clean race, have good pit stops, execute well. Hopefully we can run with them.”Huskers Leave Pokes In the Cold, 30-10
LINCOLN, Neb. Inclement weather is said to be a great equalizer in college football, but neither rain nor wind nor bone-chilling temperatures could prevent Nebraska's third-ranked Cornhuskers from whipping Oklahoma State, 30-10, Saturday night.
A hardy crowd of 76,041 in Memorial Stadium and a national cable-TV audience watched the Huskers shut out OSU in the second half and extend a non-loss streak to 25 games against the Cowboys. OSU won the first two meetings (196061) but hasn't won since, although there was a 17-17 tie in 1973.
This time it wasn't an untimely clipping penalty (1983) or a Nebraska punt return (1984) or a fourth-quarter Husker interception (1985) that did in the Cowboys. This time, Nebraska clearly had a decided talent advantage.
In fact, the score could have been more lopsided if Nebraska hadn't lost fumbles from the OSU 14 and two yard lines in the second half.
On the other hand, Oklahoma State played the Huskers tough in the first half and came within one yard of tying the game at 14-14.
The Big Eight opener for both teams and second-ever night game in NU's Memorial Stadium moved Nebraska to 5-0 and dropped Oklahoma State to 2-3. OSU will play the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman this Saturday. NU will play host to Missouri.
Nebraska rolled up 333 yards total yards, including 287 yards rushing. Oklahoma State, with true freshman Mike Gundy at the controls for most of the game, managed 229 yards but only 62 yards rushing on 38 carries.
Oklahoma State tailback Thurman Thomas, a 1985 first-team All-American, carried 22 times for just 33 yards to lead Cowboy gainers. Gundy completed half of his 14 passes but the 109 yards weren't nearly enough.
The Cowboys caused four turnovers (two interceptions, two fumbles), but Nebraska's special teams totalled 107 yards in return yardage and scored one touchdown and set up another with good field position.
OSU's defense, led by tackle Leonard Jackson (15 tackles), kept Nebraska magician quarterback Steve Taylor from breaking a big gainer, but tailback Keith Jones scored two touchdowns and rushed for a game-high 85 yards. Husker fullback Micah Heibel added 72 on 16 tries.
In essence, OSU just couldn't stop Nebraska when it needed to, and couldn't generate enough offense to get into a scoring match with the Huskers.
A tractor using a giant squeegee swept standing water off the field two hours before kickoff. The driving rain quit during mid-afternoon, but mist prevailed throughout the game and kept things from drying out.
The temperature was announced at 39 degrees at kickoff, but it must have dropped. A north wind, chilling to the bone, was clocked at between 23 and 31 miles per hour.
Nebraska didn't take long to get warmed up, however, and scored 14 points against the wind before OSU made a first down.
The Huskers won the coin flip and deferred the choice to the second half. Rather than receive, Oklahoma State chose to defend the north goal, but the strategy to get field position backfired when Nebraska's Dana Brinson returned the opening kickoff 58 yards to the OSU 40.
Eight plays later, Jones scored off right guard from a yard out to put Nebraska up 7-0 with 10:37 left in the first quarter. Taylor kept the drive alive when he hit Jason Gamble for 17 yards on third-and-11, then got some help when Reggie Christian, OSU's true-freshman defensive lineman, jumped off-sides on a third-and-three.
Oklahoma State, which had two weeks to tinker with new formations, came out in a one-back set with sophomore Mitch Nash lined up behind Gundy. The next play had Thomas as the lone ballcarrier; the third play showed a conventional Iformation.
The formation switching evidently did not fool Nebraska. OSU punted after netting two yards on three plays.
Oklahoma State must have figured it needed to play errorless football on the special teams, but once again the Cowboys' coverage unit failed to contain. This time it cost OSU a quick seven points, with NU's Rod Smith doing the honors on a 63-yard punt return to put the Huskers up, 14-0, with 8:17 still remaining in the first period.
It appeared that several OSU coverage men overran the play and once Smith broke free he had only to beat punter Cary Cooper. NU's Cleo Miller knocked down Cooper at about the 25, then it was clear sailing, er, sprinting.
A 16-yard Gundy pass to Hart Lee Dykes started OSU on the move into Husker territory on the ensuing possession, but the drive stalled when Thomas was nailed for a one-yard loss by defensive end Tony Holloway and friends on thirdand-three from the NU 31.
Oklahoma State came up empty when Brad Dennis came up 10 yards short on a 49yard field goal attempt with the wind spotters say the kick may have been tipped by NU's Miller and it seemed an approprite time for OSU to fold up its tent, or crawl into one.
But the Cowboys fought back. In fact, OSU had a good chance to tie the game at 14-14, but had to settle for a field goal after sitting first-and-goal at the Nebraska two.
Jerry Deckard, called a "drop" defensive end because he frequently drops into pass coverage, made an interception for the highlight films to put OSU on the board for the first time. The situation was second down at the NU 47. Taylor took the snap and began to scramble to his right, away from a pass rush. Suddenly, he turned to his left and aimed a screen pass for Jones.
The ball hung up in the wind and seemed to take forever as Jones and three blockers waited. Deckard wasn't suckered into chasing Taylor across the field, and no doubt saw the screen-pass opportunity develop in clear view. Then Deckard made his move, and on the dead run he burst between four red shirts for the theft and sprinted untouched 45 yards for a touchdown.
Deckard's second return for a score in the last two games went into the Husker record books as the first interception returned for a TD against Nebraska since 1979.
OSU got the ball back after Dale Klein missed a field-goal attempt from 55 yards and Gundy guided the Cowboys to their most impressive drive of the first half. Thomas ran on first down for 12 yards, then Gundy followed with a 21-yard keeper. Most of Gundy's run was nullified by a dead-ball clipping call, however, and OSU faced first-and-25.
Undaunted, Gundy completed consecutive of 10 yards to Dykes, five yards to J.R. Dillard and 27 yards to Bobby Riley. Riley's grab, a remarkable effort because both he and NU cornerback John Custard and slipped and fallen on the wet artificial surface, put OSU two yards away from tying the game.
Thomas gained one yard on a dive over center, but the left side of OSU's offensive line jumped off-sides on a false start and the ball was moved back to the six. OSU apparently called a trick play because Thomas looked to pass possibly to Gundy after taking the next handoff. But several Huskers had penetrated the line of scrimmage and Thomas had to eat a three-yard loss.
Gundy then missed Dykes in the end zone and Joey O'Donnell was called in to kick a 27-yard field goal, presumably because Dennis had looked bad on his attempt. O'Donnell split the uprights, his first field-goal try of the season, to pull the Cowboys to within four points, at 14-10, with 4:42 left before halftime.
But Oklahoma State had to be disappointed at not cashing in for a touchdown on first-and-goal, and perhaps the Cowboys relaxed or at least lost some concentration because Jones sprinted 49 yards on the Huskers first play of the possession. He scored on the fourth play, from five yards out.
Still, down by 21-10 at halftime meant Oklahoma State was still very much in the ballgame. But the Cowboys couldn't get anything going in the third quarter.
That's not quite correct OSU safeties Mark Moore and Mike Hudson got the Memorial crowd going by teaming for three personal fouls. A late hit by Moore out of bounds near the Nebraska bench put Taylor out of the game for the remainder of the series, then four plays later Hudson fell on Jones after the whistle. The third personal foul was a hit by Moore on quarterback Clete Blakeman after he had scored on a two-yard keeper.
Another personal foul almost cost the Cowboys. A late hit by linebacker Sim Drain III on Taylor moved the Huskers into OSU territory, but Terry Rodgers yes, he's the son of former NU great Johnny Rodgers lost a fumble from the Cowboy two late in the third quarter.
Interestingly, Oklahoma State would have stayed close under National Football League rules because Hudson and Moore each scooped up a fumble in the Husker backfield deep in OSU territory and could easily have run untouched for a touchdown. But college rules prohibit the advancement of a fumble which hits the ground.
Nebraska widened its lead to 30-10 when Husker defensive end Broderick Thomas sacked Gundy in the end zone for a safety with 5:05 left in the third quarter.
OSU's Ronnie Williams replaced Gundy at quarterback with 2:24 left in the third quarter, marking Williams' first game action since he was pulled for the second half of the Houston game. Williams looked like he might hit Dykes for a touchdown with a 30-yard spiral against the wind, but Dykes allowed the ball to slip through his hands at the five.
It's never unusual to suffer injuries against Nebraska, and OSU unfortunately had a bad one. Mike Wolfe, a starting left offensive tackle, suffered a fracture of the fibula (the big bone) in his left leg in the second quarter and no doubt is lost for the season.

by Mary Swire, Tax-News.com, Hong Kong
18 March 2011
The Indian Minister of State for Finance (Revenue) Shri S S Palanimanickam has announced that the Government has made plans to launch eight new Income Tax Overseas Units (ITOUs) in France, Germany, Netherlands, Cyprus, USA, UK, UAE and Japan in the next financial year.
The offices will be used for the exchange of information, speeding up of the resolution of tax disputes and also to assist in transfer-pricing cases.
Two ITOUs are already in operation in Singapore and Mauritius, although they are not engaged in the tax collection process directly.
Talking about the country’s plans for the ITOUs at the end of last year Sunil Mitra, Revenue Secretary, had said that there was a definite trend towards the Indian private sector moving away from developed country bank deposits to using offshore financial centres. He said that the share of Indian offshore deposits increased from 36.4% of total deposits in 1995 to 54.2% in 2009.
Mr Mitra also emphasized that the provisions of future Advance Pricing Agreements as proposed in the Direct Taxes Code would ensure proper bench-marking and stability in the transfer pricing »Isabel Hughes Via Delaware News Journal
When the plane tried to land, it's landing gear collapsed and it skidded on its belly down the runway before stopping. Video from the scene shows a fire truck stopped on the runway near the blue-and-white aircraft.
Two people were inside the plane at the time, but were able to get out on their own. Salmon did not give their ages or genders, but said they declined medical attention.
As of 10:30 a.m., Runway 27 remained closed, Salmon said.Tom Allen didn’t come out and say it, but based on his Thursday morning comments Indiana appears likely to be without both Michael Penix, Jr. and Jack Tuttle this weekend at Maryland.
Penix suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder at Penn State four weeks ago and hasn’t seen the field since, and Tuttle has a foot injury that occurred last weekend against Ohio State.
“Both (Tuttle and Penix) have been rehabbing strongly, even throwing some, so both are progressing in that direction, but the predominant snaps (at practice) were Donaven (McCulley) and Grant (Gremel),” Allen said. “Since they’ve had so little preparation, that’s been the focus to get those guys the reps that they need.”
McCulley and Gremel split the quarterback duties against Ohio State after Tuttle went down. Earlier in the week Allen cited the caliber of the opposition, the weather conditions, and McCulley’s lack of overall reps as contributing factors when it came to the decision to not fully hand over the job to his 4-star freshman last weekend. The fifth-year head coach didn’t say whether McCulley would be the full-time quarterback against Maryland, but he did note some improvements in practice this week.
“(He’s shown) a calmness, just letting your talent be what it is and not try to press and not feel like you have to go out there and put everything on your shoulders,” Allen said when asked specifically where McCulley made strides this week. “Just relax and play football. … Every rep he takes will allow him to have more confidence and go out there and play just more relaxed.”
Although it will be a road environment, Maryland could present a better opportunity for McCulley to take that comfort level out to the field on a game day. The Terrapins rank No. 83 overall in defense including No. 75 against the run and No. 88 against the pass.
Allen also indicated cornerbacks Tiawan Mullen and Reese Taylor are both working to get back on the field and will once again carry a game-time decision tag at Maryland.
“We’re really trying to get both of those guys back,” Allen said. “They’ve been working really hard. The medical staff has been relentlessly trying to get those guys ready. We’ll see, don’t know for sure. Will be a game-time decision (for both).”
Beyond just needing to pick up a win, Indiana could clearly benefit specifically by the return of Mullen and Taylor this weekend. Maryland has the No. 18 passing offense in the country, averaging 293.6 yards per game through the air.
Mullen, an All-American last season, has not played a meaningful role since the Western Kentucky game. He was in uniform and played a couple snaps against Ohio State but wasn’t able to continue. Taylor was injured in the Penn State game and had a similar false start against Michigan State, and he was not in uniform last weekend. The nature of both injuries has not been disclosed, but both are believed to be related to their legs..just tattoos and piercing6 cooksey lane

Covid exists. It came from a lab in Wuhan. The problem is we've been lied to directly, or they have outright omitted information, so many times that anything from [THEM] is more dubious than ever before. Covid is just the curtain they use to hide what is really going on with the global takeover by bad actors in most countries. Now, the variant? If it's more deadly than the OG Coof, then that shit has been engineered, thus the Clot Shots. Viruses are living organisms and like all living organisms, they want to thrive and grow. They can't do that on a dead host, so what happens is it literally mutates to be LESS deadly but more transmissible. Just like the flu. The only way a virus can be more deadly in a future mutation is if it was "helped" along the way. Either way, first world Western countries are actively committing war crimes RE: Nuremburg in their roll out of the Clot Shots.
Thank you for sanity. I'm starting to feel like we have a lot of sneaky shills here who have supported Trump and Q on the surface so that later they can make dumb ass statements like COVID isnt real in order to distract from the simple fact that CHYNA (/ global cabal) FUCKING PURPOSEFULLY ATTACKED US WITH A BIOWEAPON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT THE FUCK PEOPLE. WAKE THE FUCK UP!
Billions of people around the world have been living their lives normally as if Covid doesn’t exist and for them, Covid doesn’t exist. If it was only a couple hundred people doing that, and the rest of humanity was hiding in lockdown, then ok, it could be that those couple hundred people were just consistently getting lucky for the past year. But billions? How could that be a bioweapon? How could there be a bioweapon that billions of people are able to just ignore? It doesn’t make sense.
you sound like a China defending shill. not name calling you. but it's what you sound like.
nothing more to say to you. go ahead with the last word if you need to.
As others have asked: Why haven’t they been able to isolate it then? Why did the flu virtually disappear? Just because someone disagrees with you doesn’t make them a shill.
What if it just isn't a virus...
All the drugs that work that [THEY] don't want you to know about are all anti parasitic drugs. Seems strange.
Wait a minute. The flu "disappears" because of lockdowns and masks, but Covid numbers soar through the roof INSPITE of the lockdowns and masks??
Can't have it both ways, bud.
Not to mention the 90% inaccurate PCR tests Not to mention the Dr's and hospitals getting financial incentives to code FOR Covid
Exactly!
COVID-19 is more transmissible than the regular flu. That's the reason for the lockdowns in the first place. That's why it persisted even though the flu didn't.
FFS, it didn’t disappear you goob. They (hospitals and clinics) stopped testing for it because a positive covid diagnosis was way more profitable.
Post the study that isolates the virus, according to actual scientific method. Then post the study that proves it causes an illness, according to actual scientific method. Then send me your address and I will send you $500.
Take a look at some Andrew Kaufman material on bitchute, if you want to save yourself some time.
The flu disappeared because it’s no longer a money maker for big pharma.
They are doing the shills bidding. Has nothin to do with if they agree with facts.
Fuck China.
But I have a hard time marrying that many here sometimes think Covid is a psyop, then other times many think it's a bioweapon China created.
Why haven't people dropped dead at Walmart across the nation though and why did 2 weeks become over a year?
I think it's both somehow. PCR tests were fucked, "hospitalizations doubled) can be true when 2 people become 4 people in the hospital.
Multiple comorbidities in whopping majority of victims.
Who knows, I still don't want any shots or masksnor lockdowns. My state reopened mostly for over a month and things have been fine..
We are all trying to find the truth in a sea of lies. We are all thinking of it from various perspectives. It should not be surprising that we have differences of opinion.
Covid could be both a psyop and a bioweapon. Just speculating, but [they] could have taken the flu virus and modified it for gain of function (which is possibly why Tony Fraudci became so hysterical when Rand Paul pushed that issue), for the purpose of intending more people would get it.
Then, they politicized and lied (claiming "cases" that mean nothing because of a bogus PCR "test" and claiming "deaths from" Covid that had nothing at all to do with Covid) for the purpose of controlling people, and/or pushing people into accepting the idea of getting drugs shot into them on a regular bases (for future really bad stuff), and/or setting up a cover for election fraud.
All of these things could be part of the total picture. But when you are swimming in a sea of lies, it becomes difficult to know how far you are from land (truth). That's why it is so important to uncover the election fraud, get the correct winners back into office, prosecute the criminals, and start the process of revealing the truth of everything.
We can't continue to function as a peaceful society when lies are the standard operating procedure, and the criminals who push the lies are not prosecuted.
I listen to every podcast from every doctor I can find. My take is that Covid is a real virus, actually 5% virus and 95% hoax. They needed to come up with some kind of a virus that would show up on over ramped PCR tests. They punished us, conditioned us, with over a year of social distancing, mask-wearing, and watching small businesses disappear forever. That was all theater for the Final Act, which was to inject the entire world population so quickly that they have no time to find out what's in it. Nancy Pelosi would be proud. There are many immunology experts warning us that the spike protein is the actual bioweapon, and it is looking like the spike protein can be passed from a vaccinated person to one who has not taken the shot. They use transmissible vaccines to eradicate rabies in wild deer populations where they can't get to each individual animal, so it's possible. The bloodstreams of the world are the final frontier of enslavement. Now is a good time to brush up on your knowledge of injectable nanotechnology.
Yeah that last part is instrumental. Fixing the election is the keystone that'll crumble this arch of lies.
From your keys to God's ear.
A well written perspective of the trap each of us Truthseekers find ourselves in. We’re all antsy and full of angst and we ALL need to continue working together to help uncover these Truths.
I agree completely. However, anyone that immediately calls the other a shill because they believe differently when there are no facts or data to back up their viewpoint is not interested in working together.
Yes. Yes. Because it's partially bullshit. Nailed it. Yep. Agree and glad to hear it.
Taiwan is an independent nation.
COVID isn’t real. It’s the flu that develops into pneumonia because doctors stopped testing and treating the flu. Anyone you know who died of COVID died of underlying causes and/or pre-existing conditions worsened by the flu. My husband is 30+ years my senior, overweight, and has been smoking since he was 18. If anyone was going to die of COVID, it would be him. He hasn’t worn a mask since this plandemic started yet he hasn’t been sick once. You can call others shills or you can accept you fell for another one of ((their)) bullshit schemes and learn from your mistake.
Thanks for the useless anecdote. It totally didn't change the facts, or my mind.
COVID is a bioweapon used to attack us, and combined with false testing, hot spot packing, media lies, and other lies, has successfully convinced you (unless you are a Chyna defending shill) that it isn't real, so that it takes pressure off Chyna.
Wake up.
I don't understand how you can come to conclusion that the media has convinced me it's not real when the media is STILL telling people to wear masks and to be even more afraid of the delta variant...In my experience, the ones who throw around shill in this community are always projecting.
Exactly, I mean shit I know 2 people that did indeed die from Covid, they were both overweight so it’s no surprise. It’s was in the middle of summer though so likely not the regular flu they died from. I also know one person that died from the vax and another that we believe was caused by the vax.
Fat people die.
The end.
… all people die, my point was that I know 2 that died from it and they were overweight, this isn’t dangerous to anyone else but it does exist.
My fathers new primary care physician knows 9 people that died from the shot. My dad had already got the shot but he's doing ok now. He did have a bad reaction though. He's pretty elderly...
I know more than 5 that died from complications from COVID. All old and or sick and didn t get treatment. But probably if it was normal flu they'd have lived.
Insane.
Strains of regular old fashioned influenza do not routinely cause viral pneumonia. Yeah, you may feel like shit for several days, but you aren’t buying yourself a hospital stay with oxygen saturation levels in the 70s.
Viral infections can lead to bacterial infections. Just saying standard flu never behaved or presented the way this shit does. This spiked last summer, and regular old influenza is always worse during the cold months. It might simply be the spike protein is the bioweapon, so we are getting it via regular transmission and vaxxed shedders now.
Are they falsifying data with high PCR cycles? Yep. Are they treating it correctly? Nope. Sending you home until you are too sick to breathe? Ivermectin, HCQ, and various other meds have shown effectiveness so why are we in this position? Greed. Drug companies, hospitals, doctors, etc.
prove that it exists. where's the isolate? did they introduce the isolate into healthy tissue and infect it?
It is funny that in the old days people used to think viruses were evil spirits. There were a lot of shills back then too
If I was a wealthy medical research company and was going to pay you $1,000,000 to catch COVID 19 so that I can draw your blood and study the virus, where are you going to go to catch it?
covid has been isolated and studied. where the fuk you been man, you're making us look crazy here.
Read the book Virus Mania (3rd edition), friend. If you still call us crazy after that, I'll at least call you reasonable. All the "big" viruses like polio, measles, HIV and yes, Cooties 19, were frauds, and the "epidemics" based on them were psy ops.
1). The Bioweapon is the mRNA shot they are promoting as a “Vaccine”
2). There is absodamnlutely NO ethical medical reason to give this EUA spike protein forming cocktail when we have MUCH better and much SAFER treatments with HCQ, Ivermectin, Budesonide, Vitamin D, zinc, etc.
3). Their actions are reckless and criminal in the extreme.
4). The CDC/MSM Coronavirus fear porn operation was to psychologically drive people into a mental “corral” where they would voluntarily take this mRNA shot.
I actually agree with everything you said. Also COVID is real.
Sure, it’s a real virus. With a 99.875% survival rate, without treatment. Not as toxic as many influenza strains. With this mRNA spike protein inducing shot — all they have to do is reduce life expectancy by a few years to WIN. Have a slow acting “poison”, ifyou will, residing in the population’s biochemistry acting itself out in all kinds of ways that have “plausible deniability”. Remember where Dr. David Martin said the invisible hand belongs to the insurance companies. The “actuarial science” guys, the eugenecists. Peeps have been living too long…. for them.
Totally on board with all you said. Just sick of the divisive people here (probably many shills) who are trying to poison the exact take you put out up there with "It's not real".
Maybe. But first, you have to explain how the flu disappeared for the first (and only) time in history.
Next, you have to explain why if SARS-CoV-2 exists, then why has it never been isolated and purified, and no sample exists anywhere.
Then, you have to explain how if no sample exists anywhere, what was put in the "vaccine," since a portion of a virus is what is supposed to go into a vaccine. Moderna admits they had no sample, and they just invented a new concept they claim replicates having the sample virus. What about the other 3 experimental drugs?
Saying "Covid exists" is statement you claim is true, but there isn't much (if any) evidence to back up that claim, and plenty of reason to be skeptical.
Remember, the flu could have been bioweaponized, too, and then renamed. That is actually a much simpler explanation, and seems to check all the boxes (Occam's Razor, and all).
COVID may or may not exist, but the manmade spike protein sure does.
The flu didn’t disappear, it was counted as Covid used to inflate the numbers.
I would say that viruses are not living. Not in the way we typically define life. A virus is a small bit of genetic information.
With that said, everything else you wrote is SPOT ON.
If there are variants that come out after the initial "pandemic", and those variants are more deadly than the original SARS-CoV2, then I would consider it a guarantee that they were engineered bioweapons. Due to "more deadly" running exactly counter to natural selection.
Thank YOU, I didn’t say this as it was a minor quibble about what a virus technically IS. Further, everyone needs to understand another simple factoid. Viruses, when they mutate...always become LESS deadly and MORE contagious.
BINGO.
Natural selection for something that wants to spread means Rule #1 applies. And Rule #2.
#1 Don't kill the goddamned host, you moron. #2 Ideally remain contagious for a good long while before you make the host "symptomatic".
I just made up those rules, based upon my more-than-a-little understanding of biology and somewhat-more-than-nothing understanding of game theory.
And you’re correct. Nature plays by those rules EVERY TIME. Survival of the fittest...😎👀
The wheels of justice are training wheels, when compared to the wheels of Nature.
Government runs on molasses juice. I’m a man of action...the movie is a slow burn.
The sloth in Zootopia.
BAD movie.
But that character was a government employee who moved at 1/20th time. Loved it.
Btw, this forum and format does not lend itself to me not being a dickhead.
So I should clarify that on one hand I say that a virus is not alive, and on the other hand I am an asshole and talk about it like it has motivations and write things like the virus "wants to spread".
So I am always up for confusing people with jokes funny only to me. But in this case I should be clearer and less of a dick.
Natural Selection is like a math monster. You cannot stop it. It is not "intelligent" so much as it has a logic and always solves for the best outcome, except when it decides on an experiment. Solving in rapid succession for a best outcome does not require a brain. It does not require life. It just requires math. Therefore, a virus is a math and gene-based destructo-tron that makes no value judgements about what it is doing, has no malice, does not care for its progeny, has no memory (that we know of), breathes no air, requires no water, and does not need a place to quietly shit. It's just "attack of the (bio)math."
Very cool. I love the...
(lmao). I get caught-up in that too. It’s actually great all the minds assembled here, who see things from various angles like a mega-computer crunching logic. We’re up against a semi-predictable enemy and our calculated logic goes mainly unheard thanks to said enemy. I really hope many of us can get together in the future, after The Storm. Then again anytime would be great, but we would be infiltrated. Just a bunch of frogs, so threatening, eh?
The quality of people here has made me feel like I am amongst my wolves. Amongst my true friends.
Heck yeah man. Hey I forgot; what happened to Marvelous Marvin? He was my all-time fav boxer. We watched every fight in College. ...being from New England helped 👍🏽
Dead from Rona/Vax.
Sadly, this is the stuff they have to sell the population, because most people aren’t willing to believe that the entire thing was a lie. And that they lost their job over a lie, and they abused their own children and masked them up all for a lie, and got the vaccine all for a lie, and weren’t allowed to go to their father’s funeral all for a lie, etc. Instead they have to sell the people the typical worthless narratives that they’ve been selling for years. Same nonsense as climate change. Control both sides of the story.
Viruses don’t even exist, none have ever been isolated, and they don’t work by taking over a cell and then hijacking that cell to then create more of itself. If this is true, why has it never just been seen? They say they assume that’s what happens. It’s all fear-based fairy tale stuff.
Very well said. Virus Theory is a scam top to bottom. Virology as a field is as corrupt as the media, and more corrupt than Climatology.
I wish I could get every member on this site to read Virus Mania (3rd edition). Everyone's always extolling the romance of redpilling, but when it comes to Virus Theory most have little idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.
It was all patented years ago. Ignore the german part, listen to Dr. David Martin:
At 56:00 he talks about the so called variants. Do yourself a favor and watch it in whole.
I watched him several months ago and everything he has said, he has proof. His interview also says all his research is in the public domain.
It’s not a Pandemic — It’s an IQ Test
It’s not a Vaccine — It’s a Darwin Award
I made a meme with it using a photo of a thoughtful gorilla, putting this text to one side. But I don’t know how to post pics on here. Have at it ! I got it from one of the protestors in France yesterday. 😂
The title of the post is …” Harambe sez…”
Just did it ! Thanks !!
Lots of Trump voters have received this genetic modification more so than just willingly you know.
IDK. When morons procreate, which is often, the grand idea which Darwin stole doesn't seem helpful in explaining anything.
India said the variant was caused by the jab. Stats seem to back this concept.
As Dr Martin says there is no vaccine. It’s a jab.
I believe he called it a bioweapon.
He’s also a Freemason, part of a Satanist group- experts at keeping secrets.
Yeah...got sauce with that spicy meatball? If he is, wouldn’t deception be part of his anecdotes? He’s a damn good professional when it comes to his knowledge. And if so, why would he be trying to uncover Fauxi, GOF research etc etc?
Look at my reply above.
That is a paradox, he brings some serious data (assuming, i havent looked at it). Misinformation requires there to be truth. He brings a lot of what seems very plausible.
Yeah… NM. 👍🏼
I dont think we have enough info to connect the dots. The more this movie plays out, the more confusing it gets.
Proof?
Start here. He is the founder of M-Cam, check out the logo. You only do that if you are mocking them or you are on, and you don’t mock them...
His involvement in the UN? The globalist military.
Doesn’t look good for his credibility.
I decided to spend a couple hours looking around; my main interest was trying to get a good look at his rings, on the chance that one was a mason ring.
And lo and behold, I found a video where he shows them (spoiler - none of them are mason rings), and he also addressed the accusations that he's a deep state shill in one of his recent youtube videos. He even calls out the Q community at the end of it and leaves a sort of research challenge.
I will say this much - most people wouldn't take the time to respond to accusations, let alone say anything about them. At least he pays attention.
This makes sense. A virus is not alive therefore its not airborne. Only way to catch a virus is an injection.
so all the people who get the flu every year got secretly injected? :/
Please please please do some research. For gods sake do some research.
Do you believe in electron microscopy? Do you believe in electricity? Do you believe in microwave ovens? Do you ever use a freaking toaster?
Yeah I was reading on here about the body is detoxing and that's the flu. Even that's too crazy of an idea for me.
Probably the people saying that are the same ones that go to Tony Robins seminars and believe that you can detox by putting Noxema pads on the soles of their feet lol.
He means that what we think of as viruses are exosomes which (allegedly) the body releases and purges in abundance resulting in cold and flu symptoms.
Jury's still out but it's an interesting theory.
Terrain Theory - Germ Theory's suppressed competition
No it's not. You can see viruses under an electron microscope. Or are electron microscopes a conspiracy now too?
Everything the scientific and medical community claims is open for doubt at this point. We have seen they are willing to forge peer-reviewed studies. These industries are just as corrupt as media and education and politics. And we have certainly seen that doctors and scientists are willing to blatantly lie to push a narrative for money, blackmail, fear, and prestige. I am not making any specific claim about electron microscopes or whatever, just that scientists are not the independent, fact-based heroes of truth they pretend to be. In 2021 I consider it stupid to call other people stupid for being skeptical of all so-called “authorities”.
I remember back in middle school? (late 60's to early 70s) that the "tobacco mosaic virus" was listed in the biology text as an example of a virus. I think they had an electron microscope image of one even back then. Viruses are definitely real, and covid is definitely a virus; what is untrue are the stats being reported and also the lies regarding known treatments as opposed to the bogus "vaccinations".
You've brought a knife to a gunfight.
What's crazy is eating processed food, aka pure poison.
What?... A virus is not "alive" because it has no means of reproduction on its own. A virus can survive without a host for a while. You have the gall to tell someone to research?
India can be SO based. One of our greatest allies 👍🏽
The vaccine is the variant..... everything we are seeing that these variants are the result of the vaccine..... along with the changing symptoms to suit the variant narrative......
The vaccine is causing the ‘variants’ ...... by using this narrative they can blame the unvaxxed as well as keeping the fear porn going to push for more control....
WWG1WGA
Diabolical genius
It’s obvious to me that as fear of coronu is declining, even amongst the normies, that they just moved to the next letter in the alphabet and are trying to transition the fear over to this new word “delta”. It’s a bait ‘n’ switch.
"delta variant"
But yeah that's what they are doing for sure.
That's what I did. Showed it to the boss. Boss said yeah I hear ya, but continued to conform.
The viruses don't select victims.
Viruses get people who are weak and old. If you're gonna be victim to influenza, you're gonna be victim to this.
Numbers aren't really gonna change much because these are THE SAME PEOPLE that would've died to influenza anyway.
There may even be a slightly higher death rate, in terms ONLY of death to virus, because some had immunity to influenza
EXCELLENT!
Keep Spreading the Truth about Virus
Q: How do you design a test to identify something that has not been isolated?
A: You can't, you first must fully identify what you are looking for.
Q: How do you design a test to identify spike proteins or antibodies allegedly created by something that has not been isolated?
A: You can't, you must first identify the agent that creates the spike proteins or antibodies and than demonstrate the process to create them by (1) isolating the agent, (2) introducing the agent to a body, and (3) witnessing the body producing spike proteins or antibodies.
These are facts. Do your own research. Do not ask me to prove what can readily be discovered on your own.
You can start by watching these videos:
SpaceBusters
Typical shill need not reply with:
The Sars-Cov-2 virus has been isolated
The vaccines for Sars-Cov-2 are safe and effective
PCR tests are accurate at detecting the Sars-Cov-2
Thank you, I could not have said it better myself.
Considering the fact that LA is still muzzled even with vaccines is the biggest reason I refuse to get it. No point.
Actually, and I’m a full go here, there was a real virus. I do think Trump Might have been accurate when he said it’ll be gone by April last year hahah. In my area, I was a front line worker, the numbers don’t lie. Something was out in March and April 2020. At least in my area.
The rest- yea fake as fuck.
of course there was a real virus. Chyna/cabal attacked us. it is war
I'm not convinced that there are no viruses. I've seen folks here throwing that around. The bioweapons labs are working on all kinds of crap. The statements like, "there's no such thing as viruses" is ridiculous. Now what viruses really are vs what we think they are, well there is some wiggle room on that. Somehow colds, flus, miscellaneous shit diseases throughout history are coming from somewhere and they have to be spread somehow. As to this covid thing, I think you are partially right. I think the covid virus was released and did initially do some damage, but I think it has mutated its way into less effective and less dangerous or people developed antibodies faster than anticipated, whatever the cause, I think it is not a threat anymore. I think the new thing is our regular annual flu variant. The death rate is even more insignificant for healthy people with this new delta variant. We can't trust anything we are told anymore unless we get all the data and allow it to be vetted among everyone. I believe in vaccines, at least the old ones. I've had to get vaccinations before I've travelled to multiple third world countries and second world countries. I didn't get the crapfrom those places and I believe it was from the vaccines that i took before hand. Now if vaccines do work and you go to a place with unvaccinated people, why aren't they a threat? Throws their whole logic about unvaccinated being a threat to the vaccinated right out the window
Friend, please read the book Virus Mania (3rd edition), if you want to see how deep this rabbit hole goes. I promise you, it will not be a waste of your time.
Checking it out now. Thanks.
Besides playing fast and loose with the word "isolate" the word "sequence" is thrown out as a big, in your face, "so there."
A year of my PhD was spent in bioinformatics -- the use of computer algorithms and heuristics to compose a sequence from fragments and segments mined from gene databases. Every SARS-CoV-2 sequence in every paper I have read that claims to have derived it from an "isolated" virus is in fact a composition of RNA fragments taken from a toxic cell culture, and database queries based on the writer's assumptions. Such as, 80% similar to SARS-CoV-1 (which is a mythical composition, as well).
So, not only is there is no isolated virus; there is no sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that corresponds to reality. I'm pretty sure that can be said of every virus, but I haven't done the research on that.
I'm not at the point of saying that viruses don't exist (though I am close). But... nobody can point to a SARS-CoV-2 virus, nor can they know that it causes COVID. And not knowing what it looks like either physically or genetically means that they can't test for it, and certainly can't vaccinate against it.
Thanks very much for telling me this! You have first hand knowledge of the fraud. You will be able to do a lot of good with that. Also, check out some interviews and presentations by Andrew Kaufman on bitchute. He'll confirm what you're saying, and perhaps convince you to generalize what you've discovered about one virus all the way to the theory of viruses itself.
Funny, I didn't know I was studying fraud, but now that you mention it...
Watched one of Kaufman's videos, and was impressed. Good stuff.
Well, you seem to have a strong grasp of things, and your explanation of your year in bioinformatics was well written. Maybe you should do something like what Kaufman is doing.
If you get to the point of disproving virus theory, you may find yourself interested in applying the same research and analysis to germ theory, which means moving on to questioning bacteria and fungi as causative pathogens. Although true that these organisms are easily isolated, the rigorous testing for causality is not there. Only honest researchers who understand what the scientific method is constructed upon allow themselves to grasp the utterly disqualifying fact of this lack of causative evidence. Most scientists don't seem to know that Pasteur was a charlatan. This is where Terrain Theory starts to prove itself a worthwhile working theory as it becomes apparent that pathogen causation has not been proven. Some microbes do create metabolic byproducts that are toxic to us or cause inflammation, even benign ones if they are forced into anaerobic metabolism. But such pathogenic action is only indirect and results from a toxin, not the "aggressive" attacking nature ascribed to microbes. In other words, they are not actually out to get us. Pretty much all disease, therefore, can be ascribed to either trauma, toxicity, malnutrition, mental trauma, or parasites. Microbes for the most part only assist in the healing process, and when they contribute to toxic shock it is usually because the injury is so traumatic that it facilitates too much bacterial growth that introduces unsustainable levels of their metabolic toxin. But microbes should not be interpreted as infective agents of disease. They show up to assist when disease is already present, and sometimes this healing process gets out of control when the injury is severe enough (i.e. septicemia and/or excessive inflammation).
"The terrain is everything," eh?
You have good understanding of how it all works, yourself. I'm a computer guy by training and profession. Never had a reason to doubted germs or viruses until the advent of CV. The dive was eye opening to say the least. Wish more of my colleagues would make it. But they have the same knowledge that I did before looking.
Alas, one person at a time.
Yeah, something like that. Not sure it's quite everything. Parasites are real. Microbes can kill indirectly, but only because their healing assistance (remove dead tissue, stimulate inflammation) gets ramped up to the point of becoming counterproductive when the trauma is severe (which is why antibiotics are necessary for surgery and severe injury). But that's true also of the body's own healing mechanisms such as fever and inflammation. Malnutrition invites disease not by lowering immune resistance to microbes but by causing malfunction of processes, preventing proper growth and repair, or causing degenerate tissue and cells that invite the microbe crews to clean them up. Gut bacterial colonies can get out of balance, with some strains that work more harmoniously with us than others. But the imbalance is always caused by a terrain imbalance within us, usually brought on by mental stress or a diet that does not pay heed to our evolutionary requirements. Microbes are the proverbial firemen that get blamed for the fire. Firemen often do a lot of damage to a structure in order to save it. Rarely would one ever say this damage is worse than the outcome had they done nothing. And viruses don't exist. Germs are the scapegoat, the contrived cause to cover for all the inhumane actions men do to others that actually cause disease (pollution, war, theft of land and resources), or else the excuse provided to those who do not take care of themselves and want to blame something outside of themselves for the consequences. So what remains of Germ Theory? It has always been a lie used to control people and extort wealth.
I didn't start out questioning germ theory, either. I started years ago with the HIV fraud and reading Duesberg's "Inventing the AIDS Virus". Then I read Virus Mania very soon into the Cooties 19 roll out. Eventually, I started listening to Kaufman who provided the generalization to germ theory as a whole, and an introduction to the alternative. Like any paradigm shift, once I saw the implausibility and lack of evidence for the old theory, and began operating under a new working theory, the world looks very different. And, there's no reason to fear all this talk about gain of function and weaponization of microbes. The fact that they still need a needle in your arm is proof that they still haven't figured out how to transmit disease by means of contagion.
Anyway, you are no doubt able to comprehend and appreciate a fuller exposition of the theory, so I thought it worthwhile to take the time. One person at a time . . .
Thanks, I now have three books on my list. I will check it out. You can never be overarmed with knowledge, as long as you can discern truth from lies.
Great, I hope you let me know what you think of the book!
Several Dr.’s and virologists agree with Dr. Martin. There IS NO COVID-19. It has NOT been isolated. I was not convinced that there was in the beginning either. How can someone (that I personally know) that oversees three clinics, not have one covid-19 + patient, especially at the height of the pandemic? Of coarse, once the vaccines were rolled out the numbers changed, as did myocarditis, stroke, and heart attack.
In addition, if I have an autoimmune condition, why was I not developing symptoms after working in a high risk health settings with blood and body fluids? Yes, I was using PPE and practicing good hand washing, but still, I have a weakened immune system and it’s so deadly! 😂
I was concerned at first, but within about 2 weeks I knew that something just didn’t make sense.
You must listen to the video with Dr. Martin and Dr. Gene Ruby. The real virus is FEAR.
That is not a hypothesis, it’s based of facts. The bioweapon is real, but it is in the form of PCR tests and vaccines, Fauci and his cronies have developed a Frankenstein vaccine/virus and have been injecting it into people based on FEAR.
He has been involved in creating the first covid viruses (sars-cov-1) since before 2002, This happens to be “just before the first SARS virus hit the scene.” Wow!
The Dr. Martin’s Video is amazing. Very fact based. Not based on emotion, like I can get. 😂🐸
Also, Stew Peters had Dr. Gene Ruby compare blood smears of non-vaccinated patients, to vaccinated patients that we’re experiencing various health issues. The results were astounding! She has provided some amazing research and facts about the research study that all vaccinated people are all involved in NOW, without consent. The videos are on The Stew Peters Show, Rumble..
For those who have not seen this, there is research from Spain where they analyzed the components of the shots which they claim contains a nano chemical called graphene oxide (GO).
GO coincidentally causes symptoms such as loss of taste/smell, respiratory issues, etc.
GO is also found in PCR tests and masks.
GO is a toxin but has biosensor properties.
GO can be detoxed and thus the booster.
99% GO was also found with 1% mRNA in the jabs.
Also research Dr Jane Ruby w/ Stew Peters.
I lost my taste and smell for weeks & my daughter lost hers for a week from whatever bs sickness we ended up catching back in May. Neither of us took the experimental jab.
Whats to stop the medical field from telling everyone that if they lose their taste and smell its covid, when they know its just a more common symptom of the flu for this season? Most hospitals just get information shoved down their throat and say "ok" not even questioning it.
That’s true. We didn’t get tested for covid or anything else. We just assumed. From what I understand we could get tested for T cells but we aren’t that concerned. We just tell everyone that we’ve had covid so they leave us alone about the shot.
I recall just how ambiguous covid symptoms were...
Sniffle and sneeze?
Covid
No sense of taste or smell?
Covid
Watery crusty eyes?
Covid
Gastrointestinal symptoms?
Covid
Erectile dysfunction?
Covid
I feel ya bruh. Scamdemic was scam and Mexican Beer virus was overhyped worse than Avengers: Ass Game and the all the post Return of the Jedi movies combined.
The shitty thing though is, try explaining this to someone who took the jab. They will be so cognitively dissonant that you'll see their soul leaving their body as they project themselves into the Astral Clown Realm. Not good.
WHOA WHOA, episode 1-3 were tits, especially RotS.
Bruh, let's geek out.
I'll admit RotS was the best of the 3. Still wish it had more scenes of Vader in his suit instead of Hayden, but eh, Rogue One fulfilled that (I kind of wish RO didn't have everyone die in it but I know it makes sense since none of those people are around in the subsequent movies).
On the first 2 post RoTJ prequels - just never could get into Phantom Menace or Clone Wars. Menace was especially annoying to me because that year when I was in high school, EVERYWHERE I went, Maul's face could be found. Banners hanging from the ceiling in the malls (imagine indoor malls in 2021 with people in them LOL), cardboard cut outs and balloons in the grocery stores, action figures of him up the wazoo, his face peering at me on the back of a freaking paper mcdonalds bag, etc. And then what? He gets sliced in half, lulz.
Oh well, Christopher Lee wasn't bad as Doku though. And Ian McDiarmid will always be Palp (and Soros).
You are aware Maul survived? right? Up until the events of A New Hope
Yeh, I saw he got robot legs and ended up fighting Obiwan again; I haven't watched any of those cartoons though, just know about it from screen shots and rummaging through SW news. But in case I didn't make myself clear, I was talking about the circumstances in 1999.
It cannot be fake and also be created in a lab Fauci was involved in.
It is a bio weapon, not a virus. CDC even admitted they couldn’t isolate the Covid virus.
I'll take my chances with the possible "flu" over the jab any day, free crispy cream or not..
I have to disagree with this post. I believe there was a virus, created in a lab and released. It burned out way too soon. The media had to maintain the hype. The “delta strain” is the side effects of the vaccine. The media fear hype of “delta strain” is encouraging more to get the vaccine which is going to snowball the “delta strain” even bigger, then sell more “vaccines”. We’re fucked if something doesn’t stop what is coming.
IMO, there never was a virus, it was a bio weapon disguised as a virus. Dr David Martin has some great interviews on this subject.
You're arguing the same point.
Interesting theory, and I appreciate your original post, but I don't see any additional mortality figures for 2020. So if it was a bioweapon, it was one hell of a piss poor one. And you would have to offer an hypothesis of what the mechanism is of the bioweapon. Without that, what are we talking about? Show me a virus that has ever been isolated according to a method that the rules of logic don't require me to mock. The field of Virology is a sham.
Let’s not argue what color the apple was. You think there was nothing at all? To me, it seems like there was something and it was greatly conflated.
I have two good friends, one is a long time friend who developed something. He was only given proper treatment as soon as they learned he is a firefighter. The other, a very black male... they tried to kill him by intubating very quickly and for over two weeks. He is left with a $1m bill.
Check out Dr David Martin interview on bitchute. Great info, but no Covid.
So, is this post your own theory or a rebuke to Dr. David Mason’s video. I’ve watched it twice, very actively listening- I assume you mean the one with the German and him explaining patents and timelines. I’d love to believe him and I did, then the Mason thing came up...
I've been saying this for 18 months. You could do a google search in February 2020 and find out that a virus doesn't spread. Makes the whole narrative BS.
What do you mean?
He doesn't know what he means because he's retarded or a shillfag. He also said this:
tell that to people with herpes, chicken pox, mumps, etc...
Causation proved?
What exactly is the point of getting the injection?
To get the spike protein into you
Could be, but giving them credit for being able to do something as sophisticated as that may be overdoing it. It may be as simple as crude toxification. Take a look at this vid which offers a unique and plausible alternative:
truthcomestolight.com/la-quinta-columna-scientists-how-zinc-helps-the-body-get-rid-of-graphene-oxide/
I'm completely against vaccination, distancing, masking etc.
But I do know people who've had the whole "Illness with the weird symptoms" including lost of taste and smell.
I don't doubt that they folded the flu numbers into it, but I feel clearly SOMETHING was going around. That many people don't die in nursing homes all at once.
This is exactly my thoughts. Myself & a few family members had some kind of unusual sickness for sure. Call it covid, wuflu or whatever but it was a sickness none of us experienced before.
The only way to catch a virus is through a vaccine just stating this has gotten people killed before
No.
Dr. Stefan Kanka, Dr. Tom Cohen & Dr. Andrew Kaufman have all carefully researched and analyzed thousands of scientific papers about viruses over the past one hundred years. The come to the simplest conclusion possible; viruses don't exist.
"The flu" is caused by a lack of fresh air, lack of interaction with nature coupled with an overly toxic terrain.
Yes! Lanka, Cowan and Kaufman are leading the way in taking anyone who wants to look to the bottom of this rabbit hole. There's a lot of macho talk on this site about redpilling, but few seem to understand how deep the fraud of viruses goes.
Yep, it's a slow-burn. Glad there are a few of us here who understand.
It's perhaps the toughest pill to swallow. That we could have been lied to for 100+ years. Very disheartening indeed....
why are you people still running on germ theory?
I love it! Well, you have to admit exposing the fraud of germ theory means you've gotten to the bottom of this rabbit hole. Takes a while to get there. Folks are coming along, though, more and more. The ultimate "silver lining" of the Cooties 19 fraud would be humanity liberates itself from the shackles of germ theory, don't you think?
Big Hoax
It's probably just the yearly flu, but the yearly flu is also made in a lab somewhere. Why else is there conveniently (for vaccine companies) a new flu every year?
I agree with you rather than Q. It was never about the election. It was about force "vaccinating" the human population with secret sauce, a eugenicist's dream come true.
Spot on!
More than likely, yes. However, we still need to let the movie play out.
Well you’re wrong, it is real. But it is being blown out of proportion, politicized and weaponized as propaganda
I don't know if we can prove this
but I don't know if they can prove covid exists either
In practice I see little disease more than normal, or even maybe less at times because people are taking more "safety precautions" - or even if there is more illness, that could be because people live more unhealthy lives (not due to any uptick due to extra spread of disease or covid)
In any event, even if there is more disease, that is not a reason to promote mandatory lockdown measures - the opposite is perhaps needed, more freedom to be able to adapt to the issues and implement effective ways to deal with whatever problems come up
If you're dumb enough to have taken both Pfizer shots, you will absolutely REQUIRE a booster shot for as long as you remain above ground, as you basically have no (natural) immune system left.
Enjoy.
Dude, you wake the fuck up.
It's a real virus.
Denying it's existence shows how incapable you are of thought or being aware of it's existence.
The panic is the hoax. My boss got it and the only symptom was loss of smell, dude still can't smell. That's not a symptom of any normal illness.
People like you who think that circle jerking about your feelings until you convince yourself it's reality are what keep normies skeptical of anyone pointing out the corruption of the government.
How the fuck can you make it far enough in life to use a computer when you're this retarded?
The virus is real, it's not deadly, and people like you PREVENT us from pointing out the bullshit going on from the virus
Read the book Virus Mania (3rd edition) and clear out your head. This rabbit hole goes way deeper than you realize, and you're just making yourself look like an idiot with your obscene bravado. You're bringing a knife to a gunfight. If you're willing to learn something and pry open what you seem to have closed shut, you'll see what a gun looks like after reading just one chapter of the book.
i mean I had covid and lost my smell for like 6 months and it's still not back 100%. def wasn't the flu. covid is 100% real created in a wuhan lab funded thru the NIH w/ fauci to study gain of function research. china created bird flu, swine flu, and now bat flu to control their population.
But Trump daddy wanted you to get vaccine why you no listen.
Trump Daddy said getting the vaccine is a "choice". Anybody who got it is an idiot who made that choice.
But yet he talks about how great it is and he deserves credit and you should take it. Why would he do that if it was bad?
The answers to your questions are well hammered out here on this board. Do some quick digging (searching) and you'll find them.
At what point do you realize this is all bs? The dates just keep moving back and the only proof you have of anything happening is random people on the internet telling you it’s happening? Do you have a breaking point or are in just in too deep now?
Actually, in my studies of logic, there are situations in which it is entirely rational to act in a way that would be irrational in other situations. The only logical behavior for a pilot on a plane with engines on fire and going down is to stoically continue to look for a solution, even if the chances seem slim. As long as one is always trying, there is at least a slight chance of solving the problem. Not looking for a solution means 100% failure. Any situation that offers only two choices between 100% failure and 99.9% failure means that even the most distantly possible course for behaving is entirely, completely logical. Even if Q were the Grand Lord of the Cabal, we don't know that, so we're still trying, even if the engines are on fire and the plane is going down.
It's a fair question. However, if expediting the roll out of it was a strategic move somehow against the plotters, then it does seem reasonable to me to interpret Trump's bragging as a form of trolling. They wanted a vaccine. Trump called their hand, and bragging about rushing them into it could be trolling. The vaccine was coming, no matter what Trump did.Abstract
We describe a series of experiments to demonstrate holography at far-infrared wavelengths using an uncooled microbolometer array. Simple interference patterns and Fresnel zone holograms are recorded with a laser illumination in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer setup. A sparse-sampling method is used to sample the hologram at a rate dependent on the bandwidth of the object wavefront rather than the carrier frequency. The samples are then used to reconstruct the complex object wavefront in the hologram plane, which is Fresnel backpropagated for image reconstruction. Uncooled microbolometer arrays are most commonly used in passive mode to image the thermal–blackbody radiation. Their technology has matured to include the wavelength range of far-infrared to submillimeter radiation. The use of microbolometers with active illumination for holography, as described in this paper, suggests their interesting future applications.

Samantha Cox examines the risks
The enactment of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 was seen as a landmark change in the law – for the first time, companies and organisations could be found guilty of corporate manslaughter as a result of serious management failures resulting in a gross breach of a duty of care.
However, although the statutory offence of corporate manslaughter has been in place for seven years now, the defined margins of the offence are still in the process of being clarified through case law.
At the time of writing, the number of convictions for corporate manslaughter stands at 11.
‘Fines must be punitive and sufficient to have an impact on the defendant’
There has been a marked increase in convictions over the past year or so: six companies have been convicted since January last year.
The recent increase in convictions is likely to embolden the authorities to continue bringing charges of corporate manslaughter in further cases.
What is corporate manslaughter?
The act replaces the old law of corporate manslaughter.
It does not impose any new duties or obligations on companies but is linked to existing health and safety requirements.
An organisation can be found guilty of corporate manslaughter if the following elements are proved against it:
- The way in which its activities are managed or organised causes a person’s death.
- The death is the result of a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed to that person.
- The way in which the senior management dealt with or organised the organisation’s activities is a substantial element of the breach.
If found guilty of the offence of corporate manslaughter, the organisation will be subject to a fine.
Currently, the sentencing guidelines state: “There will inevitably be a broad range of fines because of the range of seriousness involved and the differences in the circumstances of the defendants. Fines must be punitive and sufficient to have an impact on the defendant.”
The guidelines suggest that the appropriate fine will seldom be less than £500,000 and may be measured in millions of pounds.
‘Large companies with turnovers substantially higher than £50m could be fined more than £20m’
The fines for the 11 companies that have been convicted to date range from £8,000 to £500,000 (excluding costs orders), and the average is around £220,000.
However, the legislation is yet to be tested against a large corporate defendant.
Judges have given consideration to factors such as the impact the fines will have on the companies and whether the firms have made any monetary gains from their actions.
It should also be appreciated that the Sentencing Council for England and Wales has published a consultation on new guidelines that suggests fines for corporate manslaughter should be increased.
The draft guidelines propose that a medium sized company with a turnover of between £10m and £50m could expect a fine ranging between £3m and £7.5m for the most serious offence and between £2m and £5m for a less serious offence.
Very large companies with turnovers substantially higher than £50m could be fined more than £20m.
We are currently awaiting the council’s response to the consultation.
From viewing the cases that have progressed to a charge of corporate manslaughter, it is clear the prosecution process is not a quick one.
The cases that have been heard so far have taken between 18 months and 63 months to be decided from the date the incident occurred.
Individual prosecutions
It is often the case that individual directors and senior management are prosecuted under the common law offence of gross negligence manslaughter alongside a corporate manslaughter case.
Individuals within the organisation can also be prosecuted for breaches of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.
‘The legislation is yet to be tested against a large corporate defendant’
Individual prosecutions of senior management can assist in bolstering the chances of securing a conviction for corporate manslaughter.
Indeed, in around half of the convictions to date prosecutors have also pursued individual prosecutions, some of which have been upheld and resulted in large fines – and prison sentences in two cases – being imposed on individuals, usually under the Health and Safety at Work Act.
Care home case
To date no charges of corporate manslaughter that involve care home organisations and companies have been concluded.
However, one case involving a care home provider is scheduled to be heard in the courts later this year and the sector will remain vulnerable to such charges if steps are not taken to ensure that appropriate health and safety measures are promoted by senior management.
There are steps organisations can take to reduce the risk of prosecution. They should:
- have written health and safety policies in place that are subject to regular review;
- have appropriate auditing systems in place that enable an assessment of the effectiveness of health and safety systems;
- ensure there are clearly defined roles and responsibilities for safety matters at all levels throughout the organisation, including having an appointed board member that has overall responsibility for health and safety;
- ensure regular health and safety reports are submitted to and reviewed by the board;
- provide appropriate and adequate training to relevant staff and keep a record of the training undertaken including the content of the training; and
- carry out regular risk assessments to identify and manage potential risks to individuals and ensure any necessary resultant action is communicated to the required person.

You. Cant. Do. It. Alone.
You can’t do what alone Tara? You cannot truly reach your wildest dreams alone. Was your dream to finish school? You had to lean on teachers and small groups at school to finish school. Was your dream to get super fit and start a health blog? You may think you did it all by your lonesome, but you didn’t. Someone motivated you, you may have spent countless hours vetting instagram pages for health models who inspired you or maybe you found a fitness trainer who helped you get motivated. My dream was to release my first solo album and I sure as heck didn’t do it alone.
Eleven Eleven was a dream made possible because of some amazing people in my life.
My husband, Ankit Chugh. I can’t tell you how grateful I am for him. I feel bad for making him listen to my tracks over and over and over again. When I felt discouraged and wanted to throw in the towel, he kept me afloat. Along with my hubs, I gotta include my two puppies Bailey and Baxter. You two doggos are the best dogs a girl could ever ask for. They support me with kissies and never ask for too many treats ; ) I love my little family.
My producer, Quinton Davis (Tacoma Records, LLC). This guy has taught me so much about producing that I actually hope to one day be as good as him so I can help others achieve this dream. Thank you Q!
My guitarist and instructor, Abe Landa. This guy has magic fingers I tell ya! Not only is he my guitar instructor, but he is featured in two of my tracks. All I had to do was give him the vision for my song and some chords and VOILA there it was. Thank you Abe!
My photographer, Samir Chugh. I’ve never had a real photo session and he made it so fun! I’m not too keen anymore on taking my photos, but he found the perfect spot and took the best shots for my album. Thanks Sammy!
My graphic designer, Jen Agulay. She’s been doing our album covers since back in the CS3 days and she is amazing! I wouldn’t even know where to begin. This girl is seriously talented and even when I asked for changes over and over again, she was always there to help. Thanks cuz!
My contemporary dancer, Gillian Grabowski. She choreographed a dance for my song, Break Away which will be featured in a music video releasing later this year. She danced her ass off and I’m forever grateful for her hard work. She actually made me cry the first time she showed me the dance. My talented BFF! Thank you Gilly!
My videographer, Luis Perez (Eljay Beats). This guy made my vision come true with my very first music video! He is such a professional but he knows how to have fun. I couldn’t think of anyone more perfect for the job. Thank you Eljay!
My cellist, Dora Lim. I found Dora through a friend in Arizona. I’ve actually never met her in person but she is so sweet and kind. When I wasn’t satisfied with my logic computerized strings, she added something real to two of my tracks. Thank you Dora!
My co-composer, Ben Binderow. Again, I’ve never met this person in real life, but he has been great. He composed the song, How on Earth and asked me to write the lyrics for him. I immediately fell in love with the song, so I composed my own instrumental for it since we were both 50/50 owners of the song. Thank you Ben!
My mentor, Ree Boado. Ree has been so helpful and wonderful. We met via Skype once a month and just talked about songwriting, recording tips, licensing advice or just about life. I used to do back up vocals and keys for her shows in Arizona and I’m just so thankful to have someone like her in my life. Thank you Ree!
Family & Friends who supported me, I’m also grateful for you guys. A support group is so underrated and I could not have done this without your support. Even if it was a quick pat on the back or even just simply asking me how the album is going went such a long way.
God. Yes God is on this list too and it's only fitting to save the best for last. My life has changed so much in the 3-4 years and if I had not strengthened my relationship with him, I don't know where I'd be right now. "God is always for you, never against you" is the mantra I kept telling myself and it's 100% true.
Point is - you can. not. do. it. alone. friends. (Pretend I clapped after each word lol) I don’t know how to tell these people I’m forever grateful for them but I am. If I can ever do anything to help any of you on this list, you name it and I’m there.
Pre-order starts today! You can pre-order on iTunes or Amazon (links under media tab) and don't forget, album release is 11/11 ;)
Love you all!
Tara AnneEarlier in the week, I wrote a post about how grounding into double plays erased 16.5% of Jim Rice's career offensive value. Of course, Rice isn't the only player I looked into, but the story really evolved to go into Rice further. Today, I'll share a few graphs of some other players of interest.
One player who was similar to Rice is Joe Torre. Torre actually was worth more offensively than Rice (300 runs above average to 279) and his double plays were just a tad less damaging (-43 runs compared with Rice's -45). As a result, the double plays cost him 14.3% of his career value, by far the highest total of any player with 300+ batting runs above average (Rocky Colavito was second at 8.5%).
Among the players with the worst GIDP runs in history, George Scott also stood out to me because he had far fewer batting runs than Rice and Torre. As a result, 36.4% of his offense was erased.
The highest active player (though he did announce he's now retired) is Mike Lowell.
Think that's bad? How about poor Eric Karros? A full 40% of his offense was wiped away by the ol' 6-4-3.
Lastly, this one was even tough to visualize in the same manner as the others. Brooks Robinson, of course, is a Hall of Famer with his glove. But he still collected 2848 hits and 268 home runs, which would make you think he was a pretty darn good offensive player. The problem is, it took him forever to do this, and he didn't have much plate discipline while doing it either. It all adds up to a marginally above average offensive player, according to both batting runs (+20) and OPS+ (104).
Sadly, all of it (and then some!) is wiped away by double plays. The GIDP knocks Brooks Robinson into a slightly below average offensive performer.
Here's the table that I used (from Rally's WAR database, then hand-updating the active players from Baseball-Reference). I used players with -20 GIDP runs or worse, then sorted by percentage of offensive value erased.8 Marketing Ideas from Facebook Groups
I admit I'm part of the Facebook bubble. The group of people who joined in the months after Facebook has been opened up to the masses outside of the college students ... now I am doing my part to overtake the college and high school students and corrupt Facebook as a tool for business and post-school networking. But I'm ok with that and ok with Facebook growing up, and even if that means some high school or college students will shy away from it in the short term because "mom might be watching" ... they'll likely be back if Facebook does ultimately become the social network it is trying to be. What is has the potential to become is the umbrella network that we have all wished for. Through the open approach and increasingly popular applications, Facebook has the ability to sit above other social networks aggregating their information together. I can access my Slideshare, Gmail, Twitter, Flickr, and Upcoming accounts all through Facebook. Probably there are other accounts I could do that with as well, but haven't found the applications or added them to my profile yet.
About 10 days ago I started my own group for readers of this blog called Influential Marketing Friends and it already has more than 425 members ... and so far I love the additional place of discussion and content that it gives me. Several months ago I was considering starting a network on Ning, but considering the numbers - I'm much happier I waited to start it on Facebook. Aside from my own group, I have also started paying attention to the many ways that other Facebook groups are being used for marketing. Here are a few of the more interesting marketing uses I have come across in the past few weeks:
- MyHome2.0 - A group to recruit tech challenged families for a new reality TV show
- Support Monk's Protest in Burma - An online petition, of sorts, which more than 400,000 have added their names to
- Yahoo! Pilot - A new group from Yahoo for those interested in hearing about and testing some new pilot technology in the works from Yahoo
- Target - An award winning Facebook campaign targeted at college students decorating their dorm rooms with prizes and contests.
- I read Business 2.0 - and I want to keep reading! - A grassroots and ultimately unsuccessful effort from the editorial team and readers of Business2.0 to keep Time Inc. from closing the magazine
- Bhargava Clan - A group for people with my last name originated to connect Bhargavas together worldwide and perhaps even facilitate some arranged marriages along the way (has more than 125 members)
- Dancing with the Stars Vote for Mark and Kym - Mark Cuban has been working his Facebook friends for the past few weeks to keep the votes coming and to combat some of the celebs that he is up against. Reading his status updates about being nervous 55 minutes before showtime puts you in the midst of the action and makes you care. I've been voting for him even though I don't watch the show.
- Event Related Groups - Just about every marketing or tech event now has an associated Facebook group. The nice thing about these groups is that it makes it somewhat easier to connect with folks that you meet at the event as many are listed in the same place. Ad-Tech, SxSW and Intel's IDF all have facebook pages.

Sir, I have too added myself into your "Influential Marketing Friends" group list...now one thing is very certain looking @ the power of networking or more so about the power of viral...it seems that Facebook is future of social networking..Now if I sit and think why..a lot of things comes into picture...any take on that...

You've got a new friend on FaceBook, happy ? ;-)
I think the real challenge will be to keep these networks and groups alive by driving concrete projects to avoid the mySpace effect : a lot of friends you don't know and will never build anything with. But I agree the-amazingly-hot-in-France-FaceBook is the best positionned to achieve this.

Rohit - For the running list...the TV Show "How I Met Your Mother" is running a CGM promotion through their Facebook Group.

There are really a lot of cool uses for Facebook. I love the part in your entry where you admitted to voting for Mark Cuban even if you don't watch Dancing with the Stars. I guess that's a concrete example of how powerful marketing on Facebook can be. But I also loved numbers 6 and 2. They are very refreshing and positive ideas.

What was once a "social" networking platform, has been transitioned into a business networking database. As an original user from my college days, I'm both excited and hesistant. I'm just happy there are privacy options.

The Cabinet Office have issued a Procurement Policy Note reminding the public sector of the Regulations concerning excluding bidders from tender processes that are subject to The Public Contracts Regulations. Should you be running your own tender processes for contracts exceeding £181k, this is a must read policy note. It explains in more detail the mandatory and discretionary grounds for exclusion contained in the mandated Selection Questionnaire which you must use when publishing a contract opportunity on Open Journal of European Union (OJEU) – or whatever systems replaces it should we Brexit with no deal!
The PPN also describes how to evaluate any ‘self-cleaning’ evidence supplied by bidders, namely that measures taken by the bidder are sufficient to demonstrate their reliability despite an exclusion ground applying and also has some useful guidance on preventing and managing conflicts of interest.
You don’t need to consider any of these grounds for exclusions if you are using a CPC framework agreement as we have already done all of this work for you!
Should you have any queries on excluding bidders from a tender process, do contact your local Regional Procurement Advisor for assistance.Custom vintage camo music artists jackets-assorted

Newly issued guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that some immunocompromised people may need a fourth COVID shot. Over the summer, the CDC authorized a third dose for some immunocompromised people. The agency considers a third dose different from a booster shot, which was recently authorized for all three coronavirus vaccines available in the United States.
," the CDC explained.
The CDC is not recommending that everybody who is immunocompromised get an additional shot and said that a healthcare professional should make a decision on a case-by-case basis.
The CDC said that there are about nine million people who are considered immunocompromised in the country, including people who are currently undergoing treatment blood cancers and tumors, those who have undergone certain organ transplants, stem cell recipients, people with HIV, and those who are taking drugs that suppress their immune systems.to DJ Davant's landing page.

The results highlighted that the British public is set to dispose of 67 million items of clothing as we come out of lockdown.
Two in five citizens had a clothing clear out during lockdown and most are storing items to donate to help charities.
However, as many as 14% of people will throw their unwanted clothes in the general rubbish; and of those who’ve already cleared out their closets, more than one in three (36%) used the general rubbish.
Please remember that the rubbish bin is no place to throw unwanted clothing, as it damages our environment.
With some charity shops now re-opening, there are various options for donating and recycling clothes and other textiles. We encourage you to always check your local council and charity shop website to find out what options are currently available in your area. Please read our updated guidance on donating and recycling clothes during the Covid-19 crisis for more information.
You’ve already helped charities and the environment immensely by holding on to unwanted clothing while previous lockdown restrictions were in place. Please continue to help by donating and disposing of clothing in the most responsible way you can.Peace: Salam, ShalOM, OM Shanti
Sant Mat Quote of the Day:
{"The affairs of the world will go on forever.
Do not delay the practice of meditation." -- Milarepa}
"Through inner meditation the jivatman (individual soul) begins its ascent toward the Soundless State where it will eventually merge with the Divine. When the soul thus experiences oneness with God, it will attain ultimate peace and supreme joy. Sant Mat teaches a path to the attainment of this joy and peace. This is the significance of the way of the Saints and the importance of Santmat." (Swami Sant Sevi Ji Maharaj, Harmony of All Religions)
Maharshi Mehi:
1. Stillness or steadiness is the essence of Shanti [Peace, Tranquility, Bliss, Communion with God].. (The Philosophy of Liberation)
"The souls are all bound by illusions and are rotating round the great wheel of birth and death. This state of the individual soul or souls is the root cause of all sufferings. In order to come out of these, the only remedy is devotion to God." (Padavali of Maharshi Mehi)
"Such is the peculiar efficacy." (Sar Bachan Poetry, Volume One, Agra)
Daya Bai: "My heart burns, O Ram [God], with the fire of separation; I yearn to behold You, O lovely enchanter of my heart."
"True bliss of meeting the Beloved Lord is such that its rapturous absorption does not diminish or wear out. There is continual intoxication of the Holy Name and nectar." (Huzur Maharaj Rai Saligram, "Nij Updesh")
Anurag Sagar: "Whenever you are in trouble, sit down for doing simran (repetition of the holy names). When you reach the state of concentration, then you are surrounded by a protective aura automatically. No power on earth can harm you then. Therefore, do simran and be anxiety-free."
Sant Ravidas: "My (inner) tongue is constantly preoccupied with repeating God's Name, and my hands are constantly engaged in doing my work. Thus have I become carefree. God will take care of me, says Ravidas."
Sant Dariya Sahib of Bihar: "Be not intimidated by any fear. Hold fast to the Naam (the Positive Power of inner Light and Sound of God) which is always there to help."
Kabir said, "Manifest the Guru in the form of the Sound Current behind the eyes [at the third eye center]. Then you will have no doubts left. If you want to be free from anxiety, then catch the Sound Current."
"There is nothing more important than meditation. Increase this practice from day to day; never decrease it." --- Baba Jaimal Singh
"Do not live even a single day without inner meditation." --- Baba Devi Sahab
"Always keep your mind in simran. It will purify the mind. When pure it will be able to hear the inner Sound (Shabd Dhun)." - Baba Jaimal Singh
Inner Seeing and Hearing: "Just as we need light and sound in the outer universe, we need light and sound in the inner universe, too." - Swami Sant Sevi Ji Maharaj
Shah Niaz, Sufi Saint: "The whole world is reverberating with Sound. To listen to It thou must unseal thine inner ears, then shalt thou hear an Unending Music, and that shall lead thee beyond the confines of death."
Seek Only That Which Is Immortal
Like a swan, oh soul, separate the milk from water,
and live in perpetual ecstasy.
Understand the method, and focus your attention at the eye center
so as to merge your soul in the Music Divine.
Renouncing the attractions of food and drink, sleep and sloth,
listen to the Tale of the Beyond.
If you lose this golden opportunity, you will continue to wander
through the Four Grand Divisions of Creation.
Oh friend, pay attention to the command of the Guru,
practice what He has taught you.
Invert your senses and control all desires, discipline the mind;
only then can you rise within and listen to the Unstruck Music.
There this blissful enchantment is continually resounding within,

Shaan's Story
‘Reconnection is the cure, disconnection is the disease.’ This moving quote from her mother has been at the forefront of Shaan Hamann’s mind throughout her life, and has played an integral part in defining who she is today.
Shaan grew up in the predominately indigenous community of Darwin in the Northern Territory with a strong sense of Aboriginal culture. She now resides in Burpengary and identifies strongly with her mother’s indigenous heritage as well as that of her Dutch-born father.
A proud woman of Gamilaroi (from Castlereagh River, NSW) and Weilwun (from Warren, NSW) tribes, Shaan’s family has undergone a journey of awakening through reconnection and restoration. Lorraine Peeters, Shaan’s mother, is a survivor of the removal policies, or Stolen Generations. At the age of four, she was forcibly removed from the Brewarrina Mission and institutionalised in Cootamundra Training Home for Aboriginal girls. Shaan vividly remembers both sad and happy stories of her mother’s experiences and subsequent delayed trauma.
“My mother is a deeply spiritual woman who has always taught me that our spirit is our core,” Shaan explained. “If we don’t look after it, we become ill. For my family, this journey has created a strong sense of belonging and connection, to reach a place of peace, identity and strength.”
This spiritual journey has led to Shaan’s deep involvement in Aboriginal affairs over the past 30 years. With a degree in Adult Education, Shaan is now Principal Director of Winangali-Marumali – Gamilaroi words meaning ‘to hear and listen’ and ‘to put back together’.
“Since 2000, the Marumali Program has been delivered throughout Australia to counsellors, psychologists and health carers,” explained Shaan. “The healing model is trauma-informed care for Stolen Generations survivors and prison inmates.”
The success of these nationally-accredited workshops has been a huge step forward since the launch of the ‘Bringing Them Home’ report 20 years ago, and is one of the few recommendations to be implemented by the Australian government. Shaan and her mother travelled to Canberra this year to present ‘The Healing Foundation’ report, which the government are yet to respond to.
Shaan feels strongly that healing has a very strong part to play in addressing indigenous trauma, but for as long the trauma is ignored, the cost of ‘fixing’ it will increase.
“What I’m saying is that the government needs to understand that each community has their own solutions, which need to be implemented. We need to right the wrongs of the past to move forward completely,” she said.
Shaan feels this can be further achieved by teaching today’s Australian school children.
“I’d love to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture taught in all schools. All service providers should be trauma-informed to be able to give appropriate support to our mob.”
Shaan believes this would be beneficial in moving forward as a nation and help all Australians understand the trauma faced by our indigenous people in the past, as well as understanding the spiritual importance of their healing. She feels very fortunate to have an avenue to share her indigenous culture with others, and considers it a privilege to provide a healing path for those wanting to reconnect.

Whirligigs have become a staple feature of Folk Art this century alongside decoys, and weathervanes, and shop signs, but it is not always easy to give a precise definition of a whirligig nor is it clear always to say what they did. Decoys clearly had a specific job so too a weathervane and a shop sign and these are clear cut.
Whirligigs meaning a carved figure with spinning arms or legs is a most general definition and items like this seem to have been made even in antiquity. It may be that these were actually toys for children and some whirligig figures do seem to have been toys such as the dark wood carved and unpainted figure illustrated here.
If one were being fussy one might separate out figures with spinning limbs (toys) from true whirligigs whose spinning arms form propellors or blades. You can see this in almost all of the whirligigs illustrated here. The purpose of the whirligig's distorted arms is to catch the breeze. One might say the true whirligig was a carved figure designed to live outdoors but even then one would have to discriminate between the functional practical whirligig on a field fence and the garden ornament.
Our rare English Somerset whirligig we know as we are lucky enough to have a full provenance on it sat on a farm fence in a field back in the days when Thomas Hardy was chronicalling through his novels the gradual disappearance of the old country way of life - the suggestion is that it was a form of scarecrow so it had a practical function, when the wind set the arms spinning it (obviously) moved and so help to deter the crows and so on.
When a whirligig is set in motion by the elements it is quite entertaining, in the way of an Aeolian Harp, the soulless elements bringing to life the equally soulless and inanimate puppet figure - so even when a whirligig is supporting a practical goal - it is also a form of entertaiment. So for this reason we also see whirligigs sometimes sited not on field fences but just as decorative features in gardens or on buildings, forming part of a weathervane for example, or simply in a garden much a set of wind chimes.
In the 19th century in certain parts of the U.S.The Carolinas and Vermont, it seems, but elsewhere whirligigs were popular in gardens and here too they may have also served to scare off birds. The interest in whirligigs gave rise to all sorts of unusual forms and the quantity and variety of them in the U.S. gave rise to interest in them in the early 20th century as a form of indigenous and unique American art or folk art form. Much of the staple folk art that is collected now was inherited by us from America and so this is where the interest in whirligigs came from.
At some point people started to collect old ones and put them in their houses and in museums.
Of course manufacture of whirligigs continues and contemporary folk artists continue to make them, ordinary ones for the garden or specialist craft pieces for indoors and for the collector and our sailor whirligig by contemporary decoy and folk artist Martin Scorey is such a one (see illustration).
Currently we show 3 whirligigs on our antiques website.
Boy whose remains were found behind home died as result of homicide
Parents of Dontrell Melvin could face more serious charges
A South Florida medical examiner says a 5-month-old boy whose remains were found buried in the back yard of a home died as a result of a homicide.
The Broward County medical examiner's autopsy was released Friday for Dontrell Melvin, whose remains were discovered in January after officials realized he had been missing for 18 months. The report says the boy died by "violence of undetermined means."
The boy's parents are currently in jail, with Brittney Sierra, 21, facing neglect charges and Calvin Melvin, 27, accused of giving police false information.
They have blamed each other in statements to police.
The autopsy results could mean more serious charges against them.
Sierra's attorney called the autopsy results vague.

Verizon, the biggest wireless carrier in the United States is joining all the other major companies to offer that plan. But with everyone promising the best deal, how do you know what's right for you?
Kimberly Wachel is over her spotty cell phone service.
"It's like one bar," Wachel says. "If I wanted to go somewhere it takes a couple of minutes to pull up. If I keep walking I might manage to find five. I hope."
That's why she's on the hunt for a new carrier, and a new plan. But picking one hasn't been an easy task.
"It's kind of been difficult because everybody has the unlimited same price," Wachel says.
With all the ads from cell phone companies it's easy to see why she's overwhelmed. So how do you determine which plan is best for you? We asked Nerdwallet for help.
"It's getting harder and harder to make that call," says Kelsey Sheehy a consumer expert with Nerdwallet.
Sheehy says it's not impossible though, and the best place to start is with your own cell phone bill.
"Look at your last couple of bills see how much data you are using," Sheehy advises. "If you are on a family plan add up all of your lines how much data do you use together and then look at the plans that are out there."
From there Sheehy says look at the type of plans available, knowing unlimited might not be for everyone. Then compare prices for the plans, and look through the fine print that could affect price. Find out if it is a promotional rate, for new customers, or based on a phone trade in.
"A lot of carriers now are baking in auto-payment discounts and other things like that to the advertised pricing," Sheehy says. "And if you don't want to sign up to automatically pay your bill each month you could be paying an extra 5 dollars a month per line."
Nerdwallet has this free tool on it's website to help you find the best plan for you based on what you need. A tool that could help wachel's service go from spotty, to spot on.
Nerdwallet says because many carriers no longer have contracts you also have to figure in the price of a phone, which can often add anywhere from 20 to 30 dollars to your monthly bill.Thomas Catenacci
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a previous decision to temporarily block the Department of Labor’s vaccine mandate Friday evening in a blow to President Joe Biden’s agenda.
The three judge panel wrote that the mandate likely “violates the constitutional structure that safeguards our collective liberty.” The appellate court’s ruling added that the mandate was “staggeringly overbroad.”
On Sept. 9, Biden authorized the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to craft a rule requiring businesses with more than 100 employees to mandate workers to either get a COVID-19 vaccine or submit weekly tests proving they aren’t infected with the virus. While the administration said the mandate was in response to an emergency surge of coronavirus cases, it was officially published on Nov. 4 and won’t go into effect until early 2022.
More than 80 million Americans, or over half of the U.S. working population, work for a business that has more than 100 employees, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
“Applying to 2 out of 3 private-sector employees in America, in workplaces as diverse as the country itself, the Mandate fails to consider what is perhaps the most salient fact of all: the ongoing threat of COVID-19 is more dangerous to some employees than to other employees,”.”
Immediately after OSHA issued the rule, multiple states and business groups sued the Biden administration, arguing the the mandate was unconstitutional.
The Fifth Circuit blocked the mandate pending further action in a ruling issued on Nov. 6, just days after the lawsuits were filed.
.”
But Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda said the Labor Department was “confident in its legal authority” and that it intended to defend the mandate in court moving forward in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

At Rochester Radiology,
What is Breast Imaging?
Breast imaging includes exams including mammagrophy, needle biopsy of the breast, preoperative needle localization, breast ultrasound and breast MRI. While each procedure offers specific diagnostic information, breast imaging overall is essential to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of any abnormality in the breast.
Digital Mammography
What is a mammogram?
A mammogram is a test performed using safe, low-dose x-ray that films the internal tissue of the breast, often able to detect breast cancer as early as two years before a lump can ever be felt, at which time it is more than 90 percent curable. As the most commonly used procedure for early detection, mammograms are recommended to be performed in women every year beginning at age 40.
What will happen during the exam?
The technologist will call you in to a private section of the office. They will then bring you in to a mammography suite and position your breast on the detector of the mammography machine. A special device will then gently compress (or flatten) your breast to spread the tissue and produce a more uniform thickness. You may feel a sensation of pressure or tightness as the breast is being compressed. Once the technologist takes x-rays of your breast in different positions, the procedure is repeated from the other breast. The entire procedure usually takes about 30 minutes.?
We ask that our patients refrain from wearing deodorant or powder the day of the exam as such products leave a residue on the machine that may interfere with the images. No dietary restrictions exist. We also suggest that women consider scheduling the exam with their menstrual cycle in mind to avoid times of breast tenderness.
Any special instructions for after my test?
If you are pregnant or suspect you may be pregnant, please discuss this procedure with your physician before making your appointment.
Needle Biopsy of the Breast
What is a needle biopsy of the breast?
As the only definitive way to confirm if breast tissue is malignant or benign, needle biopsy is safe and minimally invasive. The procedure is used to retrieve a sample from an abnormal breast lesion by obtaining small amounts of breast tissue through a needle. The tissue is then studied by a pathologist to generate a diagnosis.
There are various needle biopsy methods, including ultrasound-guided biopsy (for highly visible lesions on an ultrasound), stereotactic (for more conspicuous lesions), and MR-guided biopsy (guided in real-time by MRI for potential lesions not visible by mammogram or ultrasound).
Breast.
Breast MRI
What is Breast MRI?
Breast MRI is a sophisticated technology that uses a computer, magnetic field, and radio waves instead of traditional mammography to produce images of the breast. It is a non-invasive procedure that is used in conjunction with screening and diagnostic mammography, providing valuable information for the detection of breast disease.One of the most common VA Disabilities is hearing loss. And for that reason, one of the most commonly asked questions by Veterans is: What is the VA disability rate for hearing loss?
Ask this question to most VSOs, attorneys and your fellow Veterans, and you are going to get the wrong answer. Or, more properly said, the answer we have been taught for years, which happens to usually be wrong.
In fact, after 10 years of talking to thousands of Veterans like you, assigning a VA Disability rate for hearing loss is one of the most common errors the VA makes.
Why is that?
Well, for a long time, we Veterans have been taught that the VA rates hearing loss just by looking at a bunch of numbers, and matching them up to a chart. That’s the simple answer, and simplicity often reigns supreme in a complex world.
But in this case, the simple answer is the wrong answer.
In this post, I am going to walk you through 3 – CORRECT – steps to make sure that the VA disability rate for hearing loss which you are receiving is, in fact, the correct and highest rate you are entitled to.
How is the VA disability rate for hearing loss Currently Decided?
To understand whether you are getting the correct VA Disability rate for hearing loss, we need to first take a step back and understand what the whole point of an impairment rating is in the first place.
As I teach in my 5+ hour training video, “How to Prove the 4 Pillars of your VA Service Connection Claim“, the Impairment Rating is the 3rd Pillar. It is how the VA takes the frequency, chronicity and severity of your disability, considers how it affects you in your daily life with special focus on its impact on your ability to work, and converts that to a percentage for disability compensation purposes.
Over the years, I have noticed that a lot of Veterans put so a lot of energy into proving the 2nd Pillar – proving that their current disability is related to service – but lie exhausted on the field of battle and don’t fight as hard when it comes to the ratings.
And VA disability ratings for hearing loss are no exception to this observation. I teach, in great detail, how to maximize your VA Disability Rating for any condition by using the right evidence to prove the right facts in the “4 Pillars” Training Course, and won’t repeat them all here.
The first thing I teach, though, is to look at the VA rating tables to determine what symptoms – or manifestations of your disability – that you need to prove for that condition.
If you go to the VA hearing loss rating table, you would find that the VA focuses – in the rating table – on 2 very mechanical criteria.
The first is the “puretone audiometry test”, which is the test that measures the decibel levels of sound that you can hear at various sound frequencies. The VA first started using this test around 1987. This can get confusing, so let me see if I can help you understand the difference between frequency and decibels.
(As always, doctors and scientists, please forgive my over-simplification, here…if you have a better way of explaining this, I’m all ears. Pun Intended).
Sound is made by vibration of air waves, and every sound vibrates at different rates. The faster a sound vibrates, the higher it’s “frequency”. Frequencies are measure by “Hertz”, and the higher pitched a sound, the higher the frequency, and the higher the number of “Hertz” a sound measures at. Every sound has a different frequency…and the range of human hearing is from frequencies of 20 Hertz (Hz) to 20000 Hertz (Hz). The VA doesn’t care about the whole range of your hearing loss when it rates your condition.
It cares only about a few key ranges: 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 4000 Hz. Without getting too detailed, the VA hearing tests the level of sound you can hear at those 4 frequencies. It measures those levels in decibels.
What is a decibel? It’s the “loudness” of the sound at a particular frequency – and this loudness is measured in decibels. So the louder a sound, the higher the decibels. This chart has a GREAT listing of all the different decibel levels of particular military sounds – it won’t have any role in your VA Claim or Appeal, but it gives you an idea of how loud particular sounds we experienced in the military were.
The key number for rating purposes is the “Puretone Threshold Average” – as determined in your hearing test, it is the average decibel level you can hear at each of the 4 frequency levels above.
A couple points about this – these 4 frequencies the VA cares about are LOWER sound levels, and you will notice that they cover the bottom 20% of the human range of hearing. In simple words, the VA only compensates for low-frequency hearing loss. The problem is that most hearing loss begins at the high frequency levels, and can take years to begin to erode at the low frequency levels. So, by restricting hearing loss compensation to the lowest frequencies, the VA has created its most common reason for denial: hearing loss is due to degradation of hearing in older ages, not due to military service. Understanding that the VA does this not just for hearing loss but for EVERY medical condition (it rates conditions in such a way that those Veterans most needing the most help are excluded from compensation programs) is key to understanding the fundamental reasons that the VA disability claims process and system is, in my opinion, the equivalent of a car full of clowns doing a fire-drill at a traffic light. Allow my good friend “Elmo” to explain:
The second test that the VA uses to mechanically rate your condition on the VA Hearing Loss Rating Table is called “Speech Discrimination”. This also came into use in 1987. The test that the VA uses -the only one that is allowed – is the Maryland CNC Controlled Speech Discrimination test
It’s not a widely used or accepted test. In fact, in 2014, the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) found that “The Maryland consonant-vowel nucleus-consonant (CNC) Test is routinely used in Veterans Administration medical centers, yet there is a paucity of published normative data for this test.” Loose Translation? The VA loves this test, even though there isn’t a lot of data to show that it means anything relevant.
What the Maryland CNC test does, in theory, is measure your ability to hear and recognize a variety of words at different Puretone Audio Thresholds (the number achieved in the first test). The result of this test is what is called a Speech Discrimination % – roughly stated, it is the percentage of words you recognized at different decibel levels.
So, now that we know those 2 numbers, we go to the VA Impairment Rating Tables at 38 CFR 4.85 and use the instructions at 4.85(e) to useTable VI to come up with a percentage of impairment. For each ear, find where the PTA and the Speech Discrimination Percentage intersect, and write down the Roman Numeral that appears. Then, turn to Table VII and go to the column corresponding to the Roman Numeral for the worse ear. Find where it intersects the row for the Roman Numeral for the better ear, and you have a percentage rating.
And, for most Veterans, VSOs, and attorneys, the analysis stops here.
But that is where we are missing out on higher ratings.
Here’s why.
First, where do most hearing tests occur?
In a soundproof room with a nice set of headphones on so you can have the best chance of hearing the sound the examiner is testing for. How many of you work or live in sound-proof chambers? Even morticians – who work around the quietest people on earth – do not work or function in such a controlled environment.
Second, remember what I said above about how the VA’s tables are skewed to the lower frequency hearing loss that presents late in life?
How many of us left the Army at age 25, 30, 35 or 40 years old, and have difficult hearing our bosses at work, our clients on phone calls, etc. I will tell you that my hearing is largely high frequency hearing loss, which limits my ability to hear on the phone – that is one of the reasons I don’t take a lot of phone calls. I can’t hear very well on them, and I spend half the conversation saying “What? Who? Spell that for me?” It’s frustrating and embarrassing. Many of you have it much worse, and know what I’m talking about.
Those 2 situations have one thing in common – hearing loss has effects on our lives and our jobs that are no contemplated by the VA.
And it is in those “effects not contemplated” where the higher VA disability rates for hearing loss lie.

The Martinak case was published in 2007 – and it’s a pretty important case. So important, in fact, that you cannot get a copy of it on the website of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
Click here and see how they have deleted all links to the briefs and decision in this case.
I’m not suggesting ANYTHING improper here – in fact, the Court is doing what it is supposed to do – complying with what Congress is telling it to do. So, to my friends and colleagues at the Court, please do not read this as an attack on or jab at the Court. It’s not. It’s a jab at our colleagues in the Legislative branch. Congress doesn’t require the Court to keep copies of case related records for this long. This is just another reason that Congress is part of the problem. It would take 6.5 minutes to write and pass a law that says that any Court reviewing a Veterans claim under Title 38 must maintain copies of the case files digitally for 50 years. Or 100 years. Digital storage is so cheap that I can’t fathom why we wouldn’t keep these records forever.
You can get a clean copy by looking up the case in a legal reporting service like Westlaw or Nexis. Here’s the citation: Martinak v. Mansfield, 27 Vet. App. 447 (2007). (I’m working with Lexis to see if I can publish a copy of the decision without violating my terms of service agreement with them…once I get permission, I will put a link here.)
The Martinak case considered whether the VA policy of conducting the Puretone Audiometry and Speech Discrimination Tests in a controlled soundproof environment was a valid and appropriate way of testing hearing loss.
It found that it was, but also found that the VA policy included another requirement: “[I]n addition to dictating objective test results, a VA audiologist must fully describe the functional effects caused by a hearing disability in his or her final report.” Martinak, 21 Vet. App 447 at 455 (2007).
What does that mean?
When you get a hearing test at the VA, get a copy of the C&P Exam Report (click here to learn how). Look at the report, and see if the doctor asked, or considered, the following factors:
- Impact of decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech in an everyday work environment
- Dizziness related to your hearing or hearing loss (and its degree of frequency)
- Vertigo resulting from your hearing loss
- Ear pain
- Recurrent loss of balance,
- Social Isolation
- Workplace isolation
- Any other functional impacts other than #1.
If the only functional impact your hearing loss has is that it results in “decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech in an everyday work environment” than you are likely stuck with the disability percentage that resulted from the 2 tests described above – those are, according to the law, the very functional effects that the Puretone Audiometry and the Maryland CNC Speech Discrimination Test measures.
But, if you have functional impact from your hearing loss that falls into any other category, then the examiners failure to consider those criteria renders the exam inadequate.
In short, if you have a functional impact from your hearing loss BEYOND decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech, then as a matter of law, the VA rating criteria do NOT adequately compensate you for the symptoms of your hearing loss.
What to do when the VA exam doesn’t Adequately Compensate the Symptoms of your Hearing Loss.
If you have read the Veterans Law Blog for any amount of time, I think you know the answer.
Lay Evidence. Get more Lay Evidence. Get more Lay Evidence into your C-File.
Why? Well, here’s how the Veterans Court answered that question in a recent case called “Doucette“:What Is a Forex Buying and selling Platform?

Tumblr Fans Abandon Ship as Tumblr Bans Porn
Pornographic content, which had a large female viewer base on the site, will no longer be allowed.
Dec. 6, 2018
[photo –
Inside the Manhattan offices of Tumblr.
Michael Appleton for The New York Times]
Elle Chase, 49, has run Lady Cheeky, one of the most celebrated pornographic blogs on Tumblr, for eight years.
It features short video clips, often focused on female pleasure, that she sources from around the internet. Celebrated by Glamour and Cosmopolitan as a great sex blog for women (Cosmo lauded its GIFs as “classy and smart”), Lady Cheeky has over 200,000 followers and gets two million page views a month.
But Ms. Chase will soon have to take her classy GIFs elsewhere.
Tumblr announced on Monday that, starting Dec. 17, what it calls “adult content” will no longer be allowed on the website. The company, which is owned by Yahoo, is defining adult content primarily as photos, videos or GIFs that “show real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples, and any content — including photos, videos, GIFs and illustrations — that depicts sex acts.” (Tumblr will continue to allow images of breast-feeding and nudity in art.)
The reaction from users was swift. A Change.org petition started by someone who identified as a NSFW (short for “not safe for work”) Tumblr artist drew hundreds of thousands of signatures in just two days, with many commenters decrying the decision. But critics applauded the move, citing the site’s lax policing of piracy and arguing that Tumblr does not do enough to keep minors from having access to pornography.
In interviews, creators and proponents of pornography on Tumblr expressed a mix of outrage and resignation. Many said that they planned to leave Tumblr for other platforms but were not sure where they would go.
Sera Smith, a 24-year-old from Los Angeles, said she has been visiting the Lady Cheeky Tumblr for three years and is drawn to the blog because it feels like a tasteful departure from sites like PornHub.
“I don’t have to worry about seeing something objectifying and terribly jarring,” Ms. Smith said. “It just feels like a safe space where things were curated for a variety of different social backgrounds and ethnic backgrounds.”
Founded in 2007, Tumblr reached its heyday around 2012, and hosted 108 million blogs the following year, when it was acquired by Yahoo. It wilted under the company’s leadership and is broadly acknowledged to be on the decline.
Still, some of its most faithful users have remained loyal to the platform for the pornography. According to a 2017 study that analyzed Yahoo data from 2015, approximately 100,000 producers on Tumblr generated sexually explicit content and 30 million people engaged with it.
The study found that 82 percent of the producers of that content were male and 68 percent of the consumers were female. (The study found that 72 percent of Tumblr users were female more broadly.) The average age of consumers of pornographic content was 26 years old. A little over 10 percent of those viewers were younger than 18.
“Most of the popular content was coming from professional producers,” said Luca Maria Aiello, one of the authors of the study and a former researcher at Yahoo Labs.
That content often appeared as GIFs — looping, second-long videos pulled from pornography produced by others — and were shared across the platform on blogs like Lady Cheeky.
“This is how porn started on the internet, with these little thumbnail galleries back in the late ’90s,” said Chauntelle Tibbals, the author of “Exposure: A Sociologist Explores Sex, Society, and Adult Entertainment.” What set Tumblr apart, in this internet era, was the range of content available, and as Brett L., a 28-year-old New Yorker who runs one of the most popular adult Tumblr accounts, put it: “Tumblr always was a place for all.”
Jorge España, a 24-year-old resident of Mexico City who hosts a Tumblr page called Stunner Pone, which featured what he calls “naughty furry art” (sexualized drawings of cartoon animals), said that outsiders could not understand how much work went into sites like his, and how much of a niche it filled.
“It may not be to their taste, and that’s fine, but trying to pretend that there isn’t a user base that craves this kind of content and goes to Tumblr specifically for it is misguided at best,” Mr. España said.
Tumblr was also a home for many L.G.B.T. pornography blogs, including that of Steven Toushin, 72, whose Tumblr, Bijou World, was an extension of the film and merchandise empire he has been running since the late 1960s.
Mr. Toushin said that Tumblr’s ban was a story that was familiar to him from his decades in the pornographic film industry. Any time a small, unregulated platform was acquired by a bigger one, he said, the new company would invoke a “morality clause” and attempt to shake people like him from using it.
“We try to find platforms to sell our product,” he said. “That’s all you can do is look for distribution platforms.”
But loosely regulated distribution platforms can also harbor illegal content — in this case child pornography, which Tumblr said caused Apple to remove its app from the App Store in November.
A source familiar with Tumblr’s decision to ban pornography, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the decision had been in the works long before that.
There have also been reports of nonconsensual pornography, or revenge porn, on the site. In 2017, a 27-year-old Bronx woman sued Tumblr after a tape emerged of her having sex with her boyfriend when she was 17.
Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law and the legislative and tech policy director at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, said she has been asking Tumblr to address nonconsensual pornography on the site for years.
“If five years ago they had gotten a handle on nonconsensual pornography or the child pornography issues, maybe they wouldn’t have to resort to something so extreme,” Ms. Franks said.
Stoya, a pornographic film performer who maintains a Tumblr, said she has been contacted by underage users on the site.
“I got a message from a 16-year-old Irish girl,” she said, adding that she asked her to “come back in two years.”
Stoya thinks Tumblr’s ban ignores a larger problem. “Let’s think about what can actually be done here that would result in a world where people have better tools to navigate sexuality,” she said.
Few expect Tumblr’s decision to decrease the amount of pornography online. Many users predict the content will just migrate elsewhere.
Carlyn M., a grandmother in her 60s who works as a lawyer in the Netherlands and runs a Tumblr page dedicated to female masturbation in her spare time, said that she was “looking for a good alternative, just like many people.”
But none were “as good as Tumblr at the moment.”

Thanks! Jerryhealth authorities in Chile I mentioned this Monday that Second doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine banned in men under 45 years old, World Health Organization They will get Pfizer to finish their immunization starting this week.
“For (men) under 45 years of age who have already received a dose of AstraZeneca, they are determined to complete their vaccination with Pfizer.”Health Undersecretary Paula Daza said.
On June 3 A confirmed coagulopathy in a 31-year-old man led to temporary suspension of second doses English vaccine, which is only applied in Women over 55.
Chile implements one of the most successful immunizations against COVID-19 in the world: Already vaccinated 59.2% of the target population with two doses, which means that all people over the age of 20 were already voluntarily recalled. Starting this week, the process will begin with minors.
despite this, The country has been experiencing a worsening of the epidemic for several weeks led to the setting Quarantine in all of Santiago since last Saturday Oh extension of the state health alert for another three months, Until September 30.
The authorities indicated that the health alert allows some to be taken restrictive measures Regarding the epidemic, but Does not mean that the state of exception will be extended, which must be proposed by the President and approved by Parliament and which allow, among other things, Street militarization.
In the last 24 hours, the ICU occupancy rate was above 95% after enrollment 3,290 patients are in serious condition (One of the highest numbers since the virus arrived), Which means that there are only 160 free critical beds in the entire country.
What is more, 6,234 injuries and 97 deaths were added, leaving the total balance of the epidemic at more than 1.46 million cases and 30,804 deaths. And the national positivity rate — the number of positive PCR tests per 100 taken — is 8 percent.
From the Ministry of Health they reported that 73% of the injuries recorded last week correspond to Persons who have not completed the vaccination.
The country maintained a state of emergency due to the disaster for more than a year, The curfew is from ten in the evening until five in the morning, and the borders are closed until June 30.
Yesterday, for the fourth day in a row, Chile passed the barrier of 7,000 new infections with the Coronavirus after adding 7,529 infections and 128 deaths, leaving the total balance of the epidemic at more than 1.46 million cases and 30,707 deaths.
The country is witnessing the most dangerous moment since the start of the epidemic, a situation similar to the second wave in March and April, in which the country with intensive care units has been on the brink of collapse and a besieged capital since last Saturday. Prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that the country is implementing one of the most successful vaccinations in the world, almost 60% of the target population has received two doses, in the past 24 hours only 180 critical beds and 3,292 healthy patients were counted. Seriously, one of the highest numbers since the arrival of the virus.

Ever heard of "Free Won't"? In 1983, Benjamin Libet, a scientist in the field of human consciousness, conducted a study on what happens in the human brain during voluntary movement. He and his team realized that after our brain sends a message to act it takes five-tenths of a second for us to follow through. What he also found is that in the last three-tenths of a second, we can control our urge to act, and change how we follow through. It's known as "Free Won't Theory." I love the concept. Thinking about our "Free Won't" versus our "Free Will" can not only reframe our thinking behind the how and why of how we act, but also reassure us that we can change our behavior--even in the last second. I'm going to try to practice "Free Won't" this holiday season. Good idea?HIGHLIGHTS

A petition in favour of building a new stadium on Peterborough’s Embankment will not be accepted by Peterborough City Council despite attracting nearly 3,000 signatures - but the petition organiser has said it is still important.
The controversial scheme would see the 19,400 capacity stadium - which along with Peterborough United football matches would also be used for concerts and other events - built on the land by the river.
Two petitions have been set up after it was revealed there were plans to build a stadium at the Embankment - one in favour of the plans, and one against.
The petition set to protest against the plans was set up on October 11, and in a month has so far gathered 861 signatures.
The second petition, in favour of the development, was set up last week, and has gathered 2,826 signatures.
The anti-stadium petition was set up on Peterborough City Council’s website, and people who sign the petition have give information about where they live, or if they work or study in Peterborough.
However, the pro-stadium petition was set up using the change.org site, where people who sign the petition do not have to give information about their connections to the city.
Peterborough City Council’s constitution says: “To qualify as a petition the submission must meet certain criteria. The petition must:
“Clearly state the concern or problem to be addressed.
●”Clearly state what the Council is being asked to do.
●”Must be relevant to a function that the Council has a responsibility for and/or directly affects Peterborough inhabitants.
“State who the lead petitioner is and include their contact details.
”Must not concern a planning, licensing or verge parking application or decision.
“Must not be similar to, or a duplicate of a petition submitted within the previous 12 months. Past petitions can be viewed on our website.
“Contain at least 20 names, address and signatures of people living, working or studying in the area.
“3.2 If the petition does not contain 20 signatures it can still be considered if the issue relates to a small local area. Further information is available from Democratic Services, Town Hall, Bridge Street, Peterborough PE1 1HG 01733 747474 or by emailing [email protected]
“3.3 The address given by those signing the petition must be within the Peterborough City Council area. People who work or study in Peterborough and are affected by the subject of the petition must use the address of their place of work or study to be counted. Email address are also required for online petitions.”

However, while the petition will not be accepted by Peterborough City Council, Adi Mowles, a long time Posh fan and chairman of the PISA 2000 supporters group, who organised the petition, said it was still important.
He said; “Thank you for signing the petition, atm you have been joined by over 2300 others, however, we need to double that number to really ram home how important this facility will be for our great city and not just for Posh fans. This is what the opposition fail to understand. They make fun of the petition by gloating they did one on the PCC site and claim that’s the only one worth anything. I am aware of that option but it is postcode based and so due to the fact that as an estimated 30% of Posh live outside of the city they’d not be recognised on the PCC petition it is pointless at this stage. We are trying to make PCC aware of the overwhelming support for the arena from Posh fans and non Posh fans, so please persuade your family and friends to sign it if they agree. We really would like to hit the 5000 mark so if all of you managed to get 10 relatives or friends to sign it would make a massive difference. Share away and make a difference. Thank You.”
A Peterborough City Council spokesman said: “We had received a request to set up a ‘pro-stadium’ petition last week, which was then withdrawn as there was another petition online (outside of our scheme) that already existed.
“We went back to the lead petitioner and confirmed that if they were referring to the change.org petition, it is likely that this would not be accepted within the council’s required criteria. This is because change.org doesn’t tend to collect information on addresses, so we can’t validate signatures.
“The lead petition has been invited to resubmit their petition through the scheme on our website in order for it to be accepted.”As you peruse this issue of The Pittsburgh 100, may I ask you to make one more click?

According to pro-life watchdog group Operation Rescue, an abortion business in Ohio that is operating with an expired license recently sent an abortion client to the hospital with injuries.
On July 25, 2020, Northeast Ohio Women’s Center called 911 for a 29-year-old patient who was suffering “uncontrolled bleeding” after undergoing a surgical abortion at the facility. Operation Rescue was able to obtain the 911 records and learned that the staff member who called 911 asked that the ambulance drive to the back door upon arrival. Pro-life advocates on the scene were able to take photographs of the ambulance despite attempts by clinic escorts to block the unfolding medical emergency with a large banner.
Northeast Ohio Women’s Center is operating without a current license. The center’s previous license expired more than a year ago on March 31, 2019, and the last inspection on record for the facility was over three years ago in July 2017. That inspector listed 24 pages of deficiencies at the facility.
The owner of Northeast Ohio Women’s Center, 73-year-old abortionist David Burkons, had his license suspended for six months in 2017 after he was caught prescribing narcotics to patients and friends without making note of the prescriptions in their medical charts.
Despite this, the Ohio Department of Health has allowed the abortion business to continue to operate — but it is not the only unlicensed abortion business open in the state.
.”
According to Operation Rescue, Women’s Med Center, a late-term abortion facility in Dayton, was allowed to remain open despite a ruling from the Ohio Supreme Court to allow the closure order to stand. The Ohio Department of Health continues to ignore the rules when it comes to abortion businesses, and as a result, women suffer and babies continue to die.

Over the past few years, the technology group has been implicated in various bribery scandals, leading to Microsoft cancelling its software licencing agreement with EOH, after it emerged that a deal with the Department of Defence did not follow the correct channels and was corrupt.
Since the corruption came to light, Van Coller has instituted several changes within the organisation to not only root it out but also to change the organisation.
Poor governance
Van Coller in his testimony said EOH’s governance failure started with its board. The failure of the board was not only in its oversight role but also in how it was constituted.
He said the King IV codes of governance, for instance, say there should be a cooling-off period before an executive joining the board can be considered for the role of board chair, to ensure they can act as an independent director.
This, however, did not happen with Asher Bohbot, the founder and former CEO who became chair soon after leaving the CEO job. Bohbot was one of four ‘non-independent’ directors on the board as he, along with the other three, had served on it for over 10 years.
Van Coller saw how this attitude to governance affected the organisation. For example, no minutes of executive committee meetings – the next oversight level down from the board – were kept. There was also no centralised legal accounting entity. And the group had 232 separate bank accounts.
These issues were compounded by there being no delegation of authority. Without it, they found instances people of being able to sign up a supplier and be directly responsible for paying that supplier – with little to no oversight.
Under the new structure, Van Coller said even as the CEO, he does not have the power to make a payment, as that now falls under the chief finance director or the chief financial officer.
The lack of oversight can also be seen in there being no share dealing policy in place that required directors to get approval for selling shares.
Such a policy would have prevented a margin call triggering a 35% drop in the share price to R45 in December 2017.
“If the board and the executive committee are not walking the walk, people will follow them and they will do whatever they are doing and so it is a very important thing. And we started with that coming from the top, which was the leadership commitment, anti-bribery and corruption.”
Read: EOH subsidiary accused of sabotage and racketeering
When there are no proper oversight structures in place, it opens the way for some in the organisation to take advantage of the situation.
Schemes, ploys and go-betweens
This led to schemes where “rogue employees” were selling 20 000 Microsoft software licences but only delivering 15 000, and charging above the normal rate.
Another ploy is to rope in subcontractors under the guise of enterprise development in government tenders. “But in nearly all these tenders these companies never featured in the tender.”
Van Coller said there were several issues around these subcontractors that hinted at the dubious nature of their involvement.
Project managers could not remember them, they were paid for no work or questionable work, no timesheets were handed in, and they were not part of the original tender bid. They were also paid in round numbers and were not hired for a specific job.
There were also instances of EOH winning tenders regardless of what it put in the bidding documents. “The costings did not really make a difference.”
This tender fraud resulted in EOH writing off R900 million in “problematic contracts” because it under-tendered and could not deliver on the contracts.
Van Coller said there was also misuse of regulations that allowed state entities to buy from a single source.
The curious role of go-betweens known as ‘introducers’, who were paid a fee for setting up meetings, was also an issue.
One of the more cunning schemes was issuing loans to subcontractors and then writing the loan off.
This way it would not be questioned by project managers as it would not go through a contract account.
So far 85 EOH and 12 government employees have been investigated for corruption.
Culture eats bonuses
To turn around the organisation, Van Coller has not only implemented more stringent controls, he is also trying to change the culture of EOH by making people attend anti-bribery and corruption attestations every year.
Not taking governance seriously can cost employees in their pockets.
“If you have not done your anti-bribery and corruption attestations, you have not done your compliance training and/or you have not done your conflict of interest disclosure, you are gonged out for any bonus for that year,” he says.
“It does not matter how well you performed, and that has been a very good start for us.”
What? We need a new book on this now? We know how corruption happens and the reasons for it happening and how ‘moral paragons’ are turned into ‘money bag mules’. We don’t need another book, we need the evidence to be submitted to the police and for responsible parties to go into the slammer. And for the shareholders to be made whole, and not left with a hole in their pockets and bank accounts. We don’t need company leaders coming out there and going on the lecture circuit about ‘how corruption happens’. Just the evidence and charge sheet, trial and sentencing will do. Thank you very much. Mon Ami.

Agreed. When are we going to see some action? Up until now it has been all talk.
54
There is a book? The Zondo commission testimony is a lecture circuit? I’m sure the evidence has been submitted to whomever should have it (as per other articles in the past), now go write a letter to government telling the prosecuting authorities to get on with it.

Agree about the biggest issue being further pandemic reactions. Dems want lockdowns until vaccinations completed = success for economic suicide and vaccine merchants. But now there is a truth leak that must surely sprag the vaccine merchants and scuttle the prospective bargain business acquisition targets. A high level analysis of the US Covid-19 deaths reveals errors that reduce these numbers into non-existence.
All hands on deck to fix the leak and PR it into river? You bet.
The acceptance of this analysis will have global repercussions.

I’d wager on the fact that EOH management knew exactly that there was corruption going their firm. They simply turned a blind eye to it, rationalizing to themselves that its just the way business gets done in Africa.
54
That is 100% correct. And the Dept of Water Affairs investigation is going to dwarf the Microsoft Licenses when and IF it ever gets finalized. And the prime culprit – SAP. Watch this space – there time is coming as they were also complicit in a huge number of dodgy deals.
Hell SAP even bribed the Panamanian President for a contract and they were caught out. The SEC in USA fined them $2m.
37
And with SAP, it’s not just the SOE’s that have been caught out, but banks, like Standard bank.
But this has just been swept under the carpet.

In today’s global economy you have to be either (1) innovative and come up with new inventions like i-Pads or electric cars or (2) you have to be more productive like the Chinese and produce more goods at lower prices. However, there is 3rd and much more easier way and that is bribery/corruption. For this you don’t need skills and you don’t need to be competitive nor innovative. You just need to have LEGISLATION and EVERYBODY must be in on the deal. Why make all the effort to go and pick the bananas off the tree when you can sit in the shade and wait for them to fall on the ground?? And that is why Africa will never get out of the mess it is in. Because people don’t want to be productive or innovative – they just want to be lazy.

Corruption happens when there are too few rules and no transparency. It thrives where petty officials are allowed by loopholes in the rules to award bids based on pigmentation and not to the lowest bidder who meets the technical requirements. It happens when the contents of tenders are kept secret.

”Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the question vole”
Waugh Evelyn (1903-1966)
My ex-Boss at my old shop – I was very impressed by his presentation before the Zondo Commission yesterday He spoke and explained very clearly, direct sensically. I totally agree about crime starting right at the top – Kebblegate, the front runner of all crime that followed in sunny SA, like Guptagate – started right at the top!
That is why I think, people like Zuma and his cronies absolutely fear the Commission – their plot and modus operandi will be exposed by performances like this!
32
That would be Evelyn Waugh, but a great quote nonetheless.

Absolutely, thanks – I corrected a line above and unfortunately I missed that – screwed it up!

Fish rot from the head ..

How does corruption happen? By implementing BBBEE.
32
It was no secret amongst suppliers in the government space that EOH had an “inside track”. There were cozy meetings with government officials that nobody else could get meetings with, weekend golfing outings and junket trips and then “surprise” EOH would win the tender. This sort of thing does occur in the private sector but there are more checks and balances in place to curb it. EOH was nowhere near as effective in being able to win business in the pvt sector. In the government sector controls are poor and when combined with influence and patronage they are non-existent. I do hope the current management team follows through on providing evidence that will see those crook ex-directors behind bars.
21
This outpouring by Van Coller is way too late and means nothing, it merely demonstrates that all of them were hell bent on getting rich quick. Now they implement a directive that if you haven’t signed a piece of paper that you have not committed a crime you won’t get a bonus. I sincerely hope that this company is ethical enough to institute legal proceedings against all parties involved in the corruption and that the culpable parties pay back the organization all excessive salaries and bonuses and end up in jail
32
I am aware he is the new CEO and is trying to get things right and that employees do sometimes get up to corrupt activities especially when the culture at the top is rotten.
However every article written on EOH, this narrative seems to imply.
Good hardworking executives but NOT aware and just not following governance properly and allowing bad corrupt employees to go crazy.
Puleeez, these guys at the top must have known what was going on and even possibly involved and even instructing these corrupt activities otherwise this would not have happened. We want some truth and transparency here and not a book and/or lecture on how it happens such as executive so and so did this and we are laying charges against him.

hells bells…. as soon as a corporate… or ANY business telling the story of a figure of 232 x BANK ACCOUNTS??? then you know… there’s plenty of bank dongles & passphrase around… every Dick just put into the LOGON screen; 123

How is delivering 15k licenses but charging for 20k licenses at marked up prices corruption? Or inflating time sheets? I suspect that these are not even outright fraud, but merely businesses being a bit generous in the rounding. It’s up to the client then to fight back and say, no, the service wasn’t delivered per the invoice.
The client is asleep if they’re signing off on non-delivery. After that stunt, you’d use a different contractor to do the work that doesn’t try to pull a fast one. I can’t blame EOH here really. Well, except for that part where they paid bribes in order to get paid for the nondelivery.
Even the payment of introducers is a grey area actually. If the introducers were on EOH payroll and got commission for sales then it likely would be fine. If they are employed by your customer to ensure EOH wins then it’s a problem. And if they’re middlemen, then they’re enabled by the business environment that Government has created. Take your pick..

When the ANC gets involved.

Who cares about the facts and evidence. No one gets reprimanded or jailed.
Even SARS is sleeping.
Will anyone in SARS follow this one and check if it was declared in the returns? NO
6
“And the group had 232 separate bank accounts.”If that isn’t a red flag, then I don’t know what is.
And when will the 85 EOH and 12 government employees that have been investigated for corruption actually appear in court and get convicted?
Errr …. never?

Their research and development has put a lot of effort into creating products that are not just durable and powerful, but stylish too.
In-built features
According to Solar Choice what sets Sofar Solar inverters apart are the in-built functionalities that would typically require a separate device to manage. These include the I-V curve scanner which is designed to help identify where the output of the panels is declining more rapidly than the normal degradation rate. And the export limiter which effectively ramps down the power generated to match the requirement of a home or building in situations where excess energy cannot be exported to the grid. Sofar Solar’s residential inverters also feature an LCD display and built-in sounds which enable the user to be better informed about system performance. In addition, the inverters are equipped with an SD card that records power generation data for up to 25 years.
Commitment to quality
Sofar Solar offers a wide range of residential and commercial inverters and as Queensland Solar and Lighting points out their research and development is focused on improving the efficiency of their inverters and the accompanying software.
Solar Choice highlights that their residential solar inverters are equipped with a moisture ingress protection of IP65 which makes them suitable for indoor and outdoor installation. This feature can also be seen in their range of hybrid inverters that can be used in both grid-connected and off-grid systems. The inverter can charge both lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries with a voltage range of 42-58V.
The promise of reliability
Queensland Solar and Lighting reminds us that The Australian Clean Energy Council (CEC) has approved the entire range of Sofar Solar inverters while Solar Run points out that they have become popular for their efficient power conversion, durable frame and affordable price. For their price range, Sofar Solar inverters have some of the best efficiency rates in the market. They have even been praised for their sleek and minimalist design.
When it comes to warranty they offer the standard 5-10 years. However, as Solar Run reveals they offer customers the option to purchase an extension of 10, 15, 20 or even 25 years and have a good reputation for honouring their warranty.

*Source: Solar ChoiceThe owner of a Somerset pub has urged the county council to make urgent repairs to the coast to protect her premises and the village from erosion.
The Blue Anchor pub, within the village of the same name, is in danger of falling into the sea as a result of significant erosion on the West Somerset coast.
Somerset County Council has published a report laying out several options for protecting the B3191 coast road between Blue Anchor and the nearby town of Watchet, which is also at risk of erosion.
But landlady Cara Strom has called for urgent action to prevent larger sums of public money having to be spent in the years ahead.
What has happened so far?
Concerns about the fate of Blue Anchor, and the eponymous pub, have been raised for some time.
In early-June, Somerset West and Taunton Council inspected the sea wall near the pub and found "significant" gaps at both the top and base of the wall.
Rachel Burden, the Environment Agency's area flood and coastal risk manager, gave a verbal update on the situation at a virtual meeting of the Wessex regional flood and coastal committee on July 21.

She stated: "The area was hit by a number of storms over the winter, which has significantly lowered beach levels in front of the wall and exposed the toe.
"The council notified us of their intention to carry out ‘emergency works’, which they began on June 12.
"The initial works consist of grouting and backfilling the wall with lightweight concrete, and it is proposed to add rock armour to the base of the wall to
protect the toe from wave action.
"These emergency works, will help protect the hotel, four adjacent properties and the B3191 road from further coastal erosion."
What are the options?
Working with its consultants WSP, Somerset County Council has now come up with a number of schemes to protect the B3191 at both Blue Anchor and Watchet.
A total of nine separate schemes have been proposed - six for Watchet and three for Blue Anchor.
The six proposals for the Watchet end are:
- Option 1(a): this involves extending the access road to the former paper mill site on Brendon Road, building a new bridge over the West Somerset Railway and Washford River, and connecting with Cleeve Hill near the Warren Bay holiday village. Projected cost: £49.8M- £71.7M
- Option 1(b): this shorter scheme would see a new road built from Market Street, running south behind the existing properties at Greenway and Lorna Doone and rejoining the B3191 at the Virginia Lodge holiday accommodation site. Projected cost: £12.6M-£20.2M
- Option 1(c): instead of re-routing part or all of the B3191, this scheme would see a stretch of 100 metres of the existing cliff and coastline stabilised, focussing on the areas most recently eroded or damaged by storms or tides. Projected cost: £9.05M-£14.48M
- Option 1(d): this option combines elements of the previous two, strengthening up to 350 metres of the lower cliff slopes along the coast and realigning the B3191 inland towards Saxon Close, allowing traffic to bypass the at-risk section on Cleeve Hill. Projected cost: £18.3M-£28.1M
- Option 1(e): this option involves linking the B3191 with the B3190 Washford Hill to the south of Watchet, extending a new 2km road over the river and railway line to link up with the coast roast to the west of the holiday village. Projected cost: £47.6M-£68.6M
- Option 1(f): the most ambitious proposal involves creating a new four-and-a-half mile long "tidal lagoon", along the lines of a similar lagoon planned near Swansea. The lagoon, which would be used to generate electricity would be separated from the sea by a new road linking Watchet directly to Blue Anchor. Projected cost: £1bn+
The three options for Blue Anchor are as follows:
- Option 2(a): this proposal would see the existing Blue Anchor Bay Road bypassed inland between the western end of the Beeches holiday park and The Smugglers Inn near the seafront - though this would leave the Blue Anchor pub at the sea's mercy. Projected cost: £10.6M-£15.3M
- Option 2(b): this would entail a longer bypass, also beginning near The Smugglers Inn, which would run to the south of the Beeches holiday park through the hamlet of Chapel Cleeve and rejoin the B3191 further to the east. Projected cost: £20M-£28.7M
- Option 2(c): the cheapest of the three proposals involves stabilising and "regrading" the upper slopes of the cliffs near the Blue Anchor pub, as well as protecting a further 130 metres of the coastal area. Projected cost: £2.5M-£4M
What does the county council want to do?
The county council has concluded the best course of action would be to proceed with Option 1(d) and Option 2(c), at a combined cost of between £20.76M and £32.13M.
The council had originally hoped part of the Watchet end of the scheme could have been funded through a housing development in that section of the town.
A developer had applied to Somerset West and Taunton Council to build 136 new homes on Cleeve Hill, offering to realign a small section of the coast road if permission was granted.
But the council's planning committee refused the plans on July 16 - meaning the entire scheme (and the work at Blue Anchor) will be paid for by the taxpayer.
The county council may also struggle to obtain central government funding for the road improvements unless it can demonstrate the proposals deliver value for money.
Each of the options highlighted currently deliver "poor" value for money, in that the benefits they would bring (e.g. protecting properties or encouraging economic growth) are outweighed by the impact (e.g. environmental damage).
This is not an insurmountable problem - but the council has its work cut out if it wants to make a convincing case to the Department for Transport in the near-future.
What does the owner of the Blue Anchor think?
Cara Strom, owner of The Blue Anchor pub, has supported the cheapest option being implemented at the Blue Anchor end - but said the work needed to be carried out very soon to be effective.
She said: "Option 2(c) is by far the most economical and sensible option - but it needs to be started whilst the land is still there to enable .
"Should this option disappear in the storms this winter, the road will need to be moved, costing millions of pounds of public money."
The county council has said it is taking Option 1(d) and Option 2(c) forward for further work, but has not given a time-scale as to when this could be completed or implemented.
A spokesman said: "Estimates are based on outline design information only and should be considered preliminary.
"Costs at this stage given are for comparative purposes only between the various options and should not be used for budgetary purposes."The Promoter of the Cradle of Family Health
The post-modern changes in social value and the emphasis on individualism have conceptually altered the traditional value system. In the post-modern society, there is no clearly demarcated definition of the so-called appropriate "family type" in the sense that post-modern society allows family diversity and differences, including nuclear families, extended families of three generations living together, grandparent-breeding families, single-parent families, new immigrant families, etc. In fact, no two families are identical, and new types of families are seen as a form of adjustment and adaptation, so these differences should be equally accepted and respected.
Family education, social education, and school education are more or less equal in strength. In addition to preparing the community with the concept of respect and acceptance for different types of family members, a family education worker's responsibility is to foster the self-esteem and confidence of different family members, thereby imparting the family-related knowledge, values, and skills needed for the family members to adapt to life. To meet the demand of the times since the Family Education Law was passed, Tainan City was the first to establish a "Tainan County Government Family Education Center" and "Tainan City Family Education Center" in Tainan County and Tainan City in 2005, both of which are Class II agencies under the jurisdiction of the local governments. On December 25th, 2010, the county and city family education centers were combined into the "Tainan City Family education Center", now under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, Tainan City.
In accordance with the Family Education Act, the Center has promoted preventive programs and counseling programs focused on family education related matters. Of which, the preventive programs include: parenting education, child education, gender education, marriage education, orphanage education, ethics education, family resource management education, etc.; the counseling programs include: Help Me (412-8185) Family Education Inquiry Hotline and an individualized parenthood education program. Through the effort of Director Chang and the colleagues, the performance of the programs has been well received by all levels of executives and has been appreciated by the community. I personally feel proud to be a part of it.
Family education undertakings must be comprehensively promoted for the long run to yield results. In addition to the professional planning, promotion, and supervision undertaken by the Family Education Center colleagues, special thanks are extended to the social affairs, the policing affairs, and the culture, labor, and health departments for their assistance, as well as the schools (lower than senior high schools), associations, and community universities for their first-line efforts. I truly believe that the completion of such enormous projects is the result of the collaborated efforts and mutual support of the respective units. I earnestly hope that the implementation units can continue to achieve breakthroughs in their work. I also look forward to seeing the center's colleagues uphold the attitude of humility and learning, seek advice with an open mind, solicit resources, and engage in more detailed, thorough, and effective program planning in order to enable the citizens to establish warm, harmonious, and happy homes, and that the center can be the backbone of all families while the children grow up in healthy family environments!

BRFD: Arson caused 2 early morning house fires
Trending News
BATON ROUGE- Authorities are looking for the person responsible for setting a house on fire early Monday morning.
Firefighters say they responded to a call about a house on fire in the 2200 block of Thomas H. Delpit Drive. Firefighters weren't able to contain the blaze before it spread to the house next door.
It took firefighters about 30 minutes to get the fires under control. The first house that caught on fire suffered serious fire damage and was considered a total loss. The second fire suffered heavy smoke damage. Red Cross is assisting three people who lived in the house.
Both houses were unoccupied at the time of the fire. After an initial investigation, the fire was determined to be the result of arson.
Officials are asking anyone with information on the fire to call BRFD ArsonJason Hope is an Internet entrepreneur that’s built quite a reputation for himself when it comes to being able to predict trends in future technology.

A series of hand-written letters from Britney Spears to her high school boyfriend will also be offered for sale in the Music Icons event at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills.
The lyrics to Dylan's 1969 song, written in pencil on a sheet of notepaper from a lumber company, carry an estimate of $500,000-600,000.
"That's the most expensive item in the auction in June. It's with all the hand notations from Bob Dylan, including chord notations," said Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien's.
Cobain's self-portrait is a caricature in black felt pen that he drew in 1992 during a tour in Singapore for his punk band Nirvana's "Nevermind" album.
It depicts the late singer playing the guitar with the words "I don't know how to play and I don't give a hoot!" Cobain memorabilia has soared in price in recent years; an acoustic guitar he played in 1993 sold for $6 million last year.
The collection of letters between Spears and her boyfriend Donald "Reg" Jones were written just as her pop career was about to explode in the late 1990s, and carry an estimate of $4,000-6,000.
"It’s sort of part of her pop culture history and part of her journey, if you will," said Nolan.
Five Charvel EVH Art Series electric guitars designed and played by Eddie Van Halen, who died of a stroke in October 2020, are expected to sell for up to $50,000 each.
"He signed each of the guitars. He actually dated the tour that he played each of these individual guitars," said Nolan.
The two-day auction will take place in Beverly Hills from June 12-13.

Osijek will welcome Lokomotiva Zagreb to Stadion Gradski vrt for a matchday 17 fixture in Croatia Prva HNL. The last meeting on 12th September 2021 ended in a 1-1 draw. Both sides have met thirty-three times in the most recent seasons. Osijek has won 14 matches, and Lokomotiva Zagreb triumphed in 13. Recent outings average 2.79 goals, while both teams score 52% of the time.
Osijek's latest fixture against Dinamo Zagreb ended in an away 1-1 draw. They were not spectacular, so this result seems fair. Osijek set the tone early and scored in the 16 minute.
Lokomotiva Zagreb's previous game in the competition versus Gorica ended in an away 2-2 draw. It was a disappointing day for the club. They were constantly overrun in the midfield and failed to keep ball possession. Lokomotiva Zagreb outshone Gorica early on and scored in the 34th and 60th minute.
Since the start of the season, Osijek is more dominant at home. They have five wins out of 8 games on home soil. Bijelo-plavi's good defensive display is key to their success. They didn't concede in 63% of home games.
Lokomotiva Zagreb has picked up 8 points from the previous six league games. They still have a lot to prove when playing away from home. Lokomotiva Zagreb wins 1.00 points per away game, a bit less than their home record shows. To improve results, they have to be more compact in defence. Lokomotiva Zagreb kept a clean sheet in just 0% of their visits.
It is not a surprise that the hosts stand out as a favourite to win this one. Recently they enjoy playing at home, having won two consecutive matches. Osijek is currently unbeaten at home in four games. Since the start of the season, they have lost at home on just one occasion.
Lokosi failed to win in two consecutive away games. It will be a big surprise to turn up on Friday and win against Osijek.
I am confident that the hosts will prove their worth and triumph with another home victory. Osijek wins on average 2.13 points per home game, compared to 1.00 points per away game for Lokomotiva Zagreb. My prediction is Osijek to win.
Lately, there are not that many high-scoring games for both sides. I am confident that the tendency will keep going and at least one team will keep a clean sheet. A bet that both sides will score wins in an average of 50% of Osijek's home and Lokomotiva Zagreb's away games. My prediction is Both Teams to Score: No.

by William Hayslett
While mutual fund investments can be exciting, the variety of products available in the mutual fund market can be overwhelming at times. As far as a fund manager’s involvement is concerned, there are essentially two types of funds:
- Actively managed funds
- Passively managed funds
Actively managed funds are equity funds where the fund manager actively monitors the stock market movement and pushes around investments regularly in an attempt to deliver high growth to the investors in the shortest time possible. Here, simply because of the effort and expertise it takes to make the funds profitable as well as deliver above-market returns for investors, the cost for the investor is higher than other types of funds. The expense ratio, which defines the percentage of investment it takes to manage and administer the fund, gives a rough idea of the cost of the fund.
Passively managed funds, as the name suggests, are funds where the fund manager does not need to be on his or her feet, tracking the market or moving investments regularly. This means that the return on investment is generally slower and your wealth increases over a longer duration of the investment. The expense ratio, and therefore, the overall cost of investment, is generally lesser in passive funds than in active funds. A perfect example of a passive fund is an index fund.
What are index funds?
Index funds are specialized equity mutual funds that track a benchmark index, like the FTSE or the S&P 500. The main difference between index funds and other equity funds is that the objective of index funds is to deliver returns at par with the index being tracked, and not attempt to surpass index returns like other equity funds do. Index funds are traditionally low-cost funds because the composition of the funds simply ape the chosen index and are passively managed funds. The expense ratio is one of the lowest in the industry.
Financial institutions and financial advisors are often quick to promote actively managed mutual funds as a guarantee for a financially secure future and returns that beat the market, consistently. Yet time and again it has been observed that these actively managed funds have been underperforming the market, i.e., delivering returns that are lesser than the market returns, over a long period.
In fact, according to a recent S&P study (2020), a staggering 82% of US equity funds with active fund managers have failed to beat their S&P 500 benchmarks in the past 10 years! The 15-years performance is even more dismal. Regardless of a bull or bear market, this underperformance seems to continue, the report said.
In contrast, there is no such pressure in index funds simply because the goal of the fund stated upfront is that it will return whatever the benchmark does. The fund manager simply picks the same composition of the index in the same weightage and then may sit back and watch the fund perform at par. There is a marginal variance that occurs in returns called tracking error, which is the only variable that the fund manager needs to monitor occasionally and attempts to keep at the minimum.
It therefore shouldn’t come as a surprise that investors are finding favor in passive funds, and are moving away from actively managed funds in large numbers. After all, meeting market returns is logically better than underperforming the market! This influx spells trouble for active funds. Actively managed funds have gotten so big (in size of fund) that fund managers have no option but to track the market benchmarks.
As a workaround, many fund managers have created mutual fund schemes which in reality only replicate the index, but they pass them off as actively managed equity funds. Two motives are achieved here: a) The fund manager is not hard-pressed to move money around within the stock composition of the fund since the results are likely to be at par with market returns, and b) the higher expense ratio (what the fund charges customers as management fees) of the active equity fund is maintained.
The expenses on these funds are displayed four to five times higher than actual index funds. We shall attempt to outline ways in which you can identify whether or not your actively managed fund is just an expensive alternative to an index fund.
What are closet index funds?
Closet index funds refer to the actively managed funds which just shadow an index. Considering its nature of being an actively managed fund, higher charges are levied – such as a higher expense ratio, professional charges, and so on. But in reality, these funds just clone an index fund.
The latest SPIVA scorecard – a comparative study of the performance of mutual funds with the benchmark index S&P 500 – released by S&P annually, has some interesting insights. It provides evidence for the trend that over the last 20 years, only 4% of large-cap mutual funds, 10% of mid-cap mutual funds, and 6% of small-cap growth funds (actively managed equity funds) were able to outperform their benchmarks.
The cost of investing in closet index funds
The second issue here is that retail investors are often not aware of the fact that they are investing in closet index funds and are incurring 4-5 times the cost for the returns provided by any index fund. The average annual expense ratio for index funds usually hovers around 0.17% of the investment amount whereas the average expense ratio for actively managed funds is around 0.75%. The expense ratio for some funds is even as high as 1.5% of portfolio investment in the fund.
How does the expense ratio matter to investors?
The expense ratio is a percentage of the investment amount that is adjusted against the NAV of the fund when calculating your returns from the fund. This means, the less the expense ratio of a fund, the more likely it is that the returns you earn from the fund are higher.
Did you know that it is estimated that every additional 1% in fees and expenses charged by an actively managed fund reduces roughly 17% of returns over twenty years? It becomes clear and even more important now to recognize if your actively managed fund is just a closet index fund, robbing you of your future returns. What is even more troubling to note is that the expense ratios stated on the “closet” index funds may not even be reflective of the true cost of managing the fund.
How to identify if your fund is a ‘closet’ index fund
We’ve established the importance of identifying whether the actively managed fund your advisor is pushing to you is just replicating an index fund. Using the combination of the below-mentioned metrics, one can decipher whether or not that is the case:
- R-Squared: R-Squared is an extremely important statistical measure that helps compare the movement of a given fund to the benchmark index, expressed as a percentage. The higher the R-Squared value, the higher is the correlation between the given fund and the benchmark fund – i.e, the majority of the movement in the fund is as a result of the stock market itself moving.
This translates to the revelation of a level of duplication between the actively managed fund and the index benchmark. An R-Squared value of 100 indicates that the performance of the fund entirely tracks the benchmark index fund, and all movements in the fund are a result of movement in the index. An R-Squared value of 95 would indicate that 95% of a so-called “actively” managed fund’s movement can be explained by the movement in the benchmark and only the remaining 5% of the fund’s movement can be attributed to actual active management by the fund manager.
Generally, R-Squared values are divided into the following tiers:
1-40%: Low replication of the fund in comparison to the benchmark
41-70%: Average level of replication in the fund when compared to the benchmark
71-100%: High level of replication in the fund when compared to the benchmark; therefore, most likely an index fund.
Even though there is no threshold of R-Squared value that classifies an actively managed fund as a “closet” index fund, it is advisable that if your actively managed fund shows an R-Squared value of 85% or above, you would be much better off buying an index fund rather than an actively managed fund that mirrors the benchmark and charges you significantly higher for doing so.
- Tracking error: Tracking error refers to the difference observed between a fund’s performance and the performance of the benchmark it is being compared with. This metric is also expressed as a percentage. A low tracking error would indicate that the fund is duplicating the index. Even passively managed funds that are perfectly indexed against a benchmark exhibit some tracking error because even they don’t match the benchmark perfectly. However, over the years, the tracking error is likely to be minuscule.
- Active share: Active share refers to the percentage of holding in the fund that differs from the benchmark index. The higher the active share percentage, the higher the chance that the fund manager is trying to actively beat the benchmark using his/her skills with stock picking. On the contrary, a fund with no active share percentage essentially means that the holdings of this fund are the exact replication of the benchmark. Funds with high active shares tend to outperform their benchmark indices, and hence command a higher level of expense ratios and fees.
Even though R-Squared, Tracking error and Active share are all good indicators of whether or not a fund mirrors the benchmark, they do not guarantee the future performance of the fund. If an investor is looking for an actively managed fund to beat the benchmark returns, he/she could look for funds with a low expense ratio and overall fees to reign in the outflows from the profits.
To conclude
Closet index funds just shadow a market benchmark providing similar returns while having expense ratios that are 4-5 times higher than the benchmark costs.
It is imperative to recognize when a “closet” index fund is masking itself as an actively managed fund to save on the hefty costs associated with actively managed funds. To do so, three metrics play an extremely crucial role: R-Squared, tracking error, and the number of active shares.
It is important to note that even if a fund performs well on the above-mentioned metrics and qualifies as not a “closet” fund, that is no guarantee of future performance. Market risks, risk appetite, diversification of the portfolio, expense ratios of the fund, and asset allocation are some of the factors that must be taken into consideration before investing in any mutual fund.

Nows a good time to anticipate them.I'd say most of the barriers are the obvious ones.

So, I'm not sure the demand will ever be huge because there is always going to be enough work involved that will scare some contributors off.

Global revenue from tourist visits to protected areas is high enough to allow more of this money to be spent on conservation, a study has found.
The paper estimated that tourism in protected areas around the world generates US$600 billion a year in revenue, but only US$10 billion is spent on conserving these areas and their biodiversity.
The scientists behind the study, who include Matt Walpole, a programme director at the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre in the United Kingdom, call for higher spending on conservation of protected areas. The paper was published last month (24 February) in PLOS Biology.
“Conservation and wise use of biodiversity and natural capital can be a valuable contribution to local and national development, rather than a hindrance to it,” Walpole says. “The effectiveness of protected areas has been shown to be closely related to levels of investment.”
Walpole says current budgets for managing protected areas are often insufficient to do so effectively. But as the revenues these parks generate vastly exceed their running costs, there is scope to increase such spending, the researchers say.
The economic benefits of nature-based tourism should be an important consideration when making development choices, he says.
Each year, parks in Africa receive around 69 million visitors and those in Latin America 148 million visitors, compared with North America’s 3.3 billion visits (see graph). But their exclusivity makes visitors prepared to pay more, with average direct spending per visit in Africa as high as US$698, and US$311 in Latin America — compared with just US$103 per visit to North American parks, according to statistics gathered for the paper.
sustainable development and “will be high on the political agenda in 2015 when the UN Sustainable Development Goals are expected to be finalised”.
Will Turner, chief scientist at US-based NGO Conservation International, says underspending on protected areas risks endangering essential things such as water supply that underpin economic growth. “We could up our funding to parks tenfold and it might be the greatest investment humanity has ever made,” he says.
Turner adds that steps are required to ensure that revenue generated by parks is fed back into the local economy. “Where tourism has worked, it’s been because it was done consciously, with clear planning and management to provide incentives for conservation, and by keeping the revenues local,” he says.

Before God sent His Son to the earth, God was asked His name at least three times, during His glorious visitations with man.
All three times, God hid His name.
The three events were:
1. When Jacob wrestled with God (Genesis 32).
2. When God visited Moses in the burning bush passage (Exodus 3).
3. When the Angel of the Lord visited Manoah and his wife (Judges 13).
Twice, God answered with a question, to Jacob and to Manoah.
God told Moses the name I AM and I AM THAT I AM.
When Manoah asked his visitor his name, the answer was, in various translations (Judges 13:18):
““Why do you ask My name, seeing it is wonderful?” (NKJV)
“. . .).
God Sends Jesus
When” (Matthew 1:18-21).
3. Announcement of the birth of Jesus: An angel visits shepherds; “There is born to you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord’” (Luke 2:8-14).
4. John the Baptist announces that He is the Lamb of God and the Son of God (John 1:29,33).
5. When Jesus was baptized, God spoke audibly: “‘This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased’” (Matthew 3:17).
6. During the transfiguration, God spoke audibly: “’This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased! Hear Him!’” (Matthew 17:6).
The name of Jesus is indeed . . . too wonderful for us to comprehend.

Just as cinema changes and evolves, so the festivals and institutions around it change too. A more diverse demographic of delegates than usual descended on the newly renamed National Science and Media Museum in Bradford to attend the 21st Widescreen Weekend for four days in mid-October. It billed itself as “the unique festival of big screen technology, past, present and future”. Incorporating its IMAX auditorium alongside the analogue, digital and three-strip projection facilities in its Pictureville cinema, and programming recent releases alongside classic big screen films, efforts were clearly being made to deliver on the promise of presenting past, present and future of cinema technology.
The best things come in threes
Nothing demonstrated the uniqueness of this festival more than the programming: a presentation on the Barco Escape system alongside the exhibition of a digital restoration of a Cinerama/Cinemiracle film. These accompanied the presentation of an original three-strip Cinerama film, as well as the legendary triptych from Abel Gance’s Napoleon (1927) — a three-strip cinema heaven almost no other venue can emulate.
Barco’s Stefan Vandemaele and Frederick Lanoy referred to the company’s development and launch of the three-wall Escape system as almost part of another repeat of cinema history. They asserted that recently, whilst box office takings were remaining steady, due to the utilisation of higher prices for PLF and an improved and wider range of offer and other sales factors, there will always be a concern about falling attendances in auditoria. As in previous eras, there is always that imperative that cinema must offer exceptional experiences that cannot be replicated at home. With large 4K TVs, surround sound systems,
2K and 4K movie streaming services all available, the imperative on cinema to offer an experience that cannot be imitated at home is as great, if not greater, than before. Barco’s Escape utilises a three-screen system as Cinerama and “The Triptych” did before it. No-one will be utilising three walls of their living rooms any time soon.
Stefan and Frederick maintain that Escape is a compelling experience that can only ever be enjoyed at the cinema. It can be retro-fitted by Barco to existing cinemas whilst retaining the integrity of the existing central screen. An additional pair of acoustically transparent, and retractable screens, with additional curtaining, are added to the two sides of the existing screen. It is DCI-compliant and versions of movies will be available with DCPs encoded so that either the movie can be run with just one central screen, or in a version that has the two added screens available to project. They argue that, due to digital projection, Escape is deliverable far more easily and reliably than was Cinerama. There is no need for three projections boxes — “hushboxes” can be fitted round the additional two projectors in the auditorium. Synchronisation of sound and picture is far more reliable and easily achieved than it was with Cinerama.
The aspect ratio can be as wide as 7:1 (3×2.39:1), with today’s shooting of three-panel movies not having to be restricted to the three-camera rigs of times gone by. High resolution digital motion picture cameras making movies for large-size PLF screens are capable of achieving the required 858 x 6144 pixel image size via their large sensors: e.g. the Arri 65 (6560×3100), Red Weapon (8192×4320), Red Epic (6144×3160) and the Sony F65 (6144×2160). Obviously the making of movies or sequences in “Escape” has significant pre-production, production, post-production and workflow issues. Even a movie been shot with just one central screen in mind could have sequences added that are in Escape, or could be entirely Escape, enhanced by CGI fabricating the two additional panels to add immersion.
One Cinerama expert mentioned to me in conversation that, in his view, Escape had the danger of just producing “visual eyewash” to either side of the central screen. His fear was that whilst “eyewash” on either side might give a feeling of immersion it might not be used narratively. His point was that in Cinerama and its predecessor, “The Triptych”, side panels were used to depict action and characters essential to the scene, and hence story development.
Cinerama screenings this year included a screening of the museum’s rare and fragile three-strip print of The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. The Cinerama restoration team of David Strohmaier and Randy Gitsch presented their improved restoration of the three-strip nautical feature length travelogue Windjammer. In today’s climate of PLF formats and discussions on how VR may impact mainstream cinema, Cinerama screenings at Bradford demonstrate just how much resolution and detail is presented across a deeply curved Cinerama screen and how immersive and like VR it can seem.
Still on the three panel theme, the release of the silent masterpiece Napoleon in 2017 on both DCP and BluRay has made the viewing of the legendary Napoleon triptych far easier to arrange. Kevin Brownlow gave an illustrated account of his epic lifelong journey to restore the film, and his partner at their company, Photoplay, Patrick Stanbury, told us about the restoration of the triptych for digital release and presentation.
a modern widescreen Classic
Even in the year of its release, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk has already reached classic status among widescreen and 70mm film fans, and was the opening night film, projected in 70mm, of course. The closing night film Lawrence of Arabia featured a glorious pristine new 70mm print without a mark on it, and it looked and sounded magnificent. Its visual and dramatic power, and thoughtful and layered unfolding of an epic story reminds us just how good classic films can be. Classics are not reliant on the transitory nature of sensation and spectacle alone, or on the latest technologies to deliver them — the ingredients and craft of good storytelling are just as important, if not more so. Gregory Orr, grandson of Jack L, Warner, and a filmmaker in his own right, attended the whole event and introduced a beautiful 4K DCP of “My Fair Lady” on the flat screen and in 2.2:1.
As well as the films mentioned, the weekend featured a broad mix: The Fortune Cookie (35mm B&W 2.35:1); Jailhouse Rock (35mm B&W 2.35:1); Apocalypse Now Redux (35mm 2.35:1); Moon (35mm 2.35:1); The Untouchables (70mm “blow-up” 2.2:1); Suspiria (35mm 2.35:1); La La Land (DCP 2.55:1); and Sleeping Beauty (DCP 2.55:1). Interspersed with the films were a number of “in conversations with” discussions on stage relating to the films.
Now in its fourth year, the IMIS International Student Widescreen Film of the Year Competition” featured the screening of a shortlist of student films from around the world. The competition, which only features films in aspect ratios of 2.2:1 and wider, showed some which had outstanding commercial production values.
Within the overall programming mix, there was an opportunity to choose between two different films on two separate occasions and programming strands within the evolving weekend were becoming evident: the traditional fare of 70mm, three-strip and widescreen classics; a whole day dedicated to students and a younger age demographic; celebrating monochrome widescreen; a family film for Sunday afternoon; the inclusion of a cult film or two; and the brilliant idea of a celluloid Saturday when every film shown was on celluloid so that people who had never experienced celluloid projection could buy a day pass and experience analogue cinema without having to subscribe to the whole four days.
Programming suggestions from a number of delegates had clearly been taken on board by the festival director and been amalgamated into this year’s event. Programme consultants Rebecca Nicole Williams and David Strohmaier and guest curator Sir Christopher Frayling had contributed to the work of the triumvirate behind the organisation of the weekend: Kathryn Penny (festival director), Rebecca Hill (festival co-ordinator) and Tom Perkin (technical manager). Double the number of student day passes had been sold this year and there was an overall 15% increase in attendance for the whole event. IMIS was pleased to sponsor the weekend once more.
A Three-panel finale
To end on the three-panel cinema theme, I asked Stefan Vandemaele of Barco, who I knew had never ever seen Cinerama before, to comment on what he thought of it. He said “Cinerama was the first format to expand the theatrical experience beyond the traditional rectangle, offering an immersive new format to moviegoers for the first time ever. I enjoyed seeing it in its full glory during the Brothers Grimm screening, using three original analogue projectors. A challenging job for the projectionists, but one very well done! I was excited to join the Widescreen Festival at Bradford to bridge formats like Cinerama with new formats such as Barco Escape, our own three-screen, panoramic cinema experience. It’s good to reflect, look into movie history and learn from it. Today, we’ve overcome projection challenges of the 1960s and have the luxury of working with advance digital projectors that allow easier synchronisation and modern post production equipment.”£4,999.00 £6,999.00 You Save 28% (£2,000 5 flawless.

2020 Iowa Colleges Admission Comparison Table
The following table lists Iowa.How does one find any kind of faith in the hour
of someone else's urgent deepest need
of what benefit are my faithless prayers
said in yearning hope rather than conviction
Is it the futility of hope against the inevitability of fate
or does earnest prayer tip the balance in any way
anyway, I have been re-learning the art of prayer
not hard you might think, after all it's just words
But prayer for me is essentially an act of faith
and faith is something I find I have in short supply
but in the absense of concrete ways to offer help
I resort to applying myself to this simple task
Ambivalent if only because of the deep injustice
of seeing one person bearing the burden of many
of seeing misfortune piling higher each day
eroding hope, despite heroic laughter after tears
Aware once more that lifetimes are so short
when measured against the yardstick of infinity
that my perception of injustice and unfairness
is also my ignorance in the face of omniscience
And so it is that faith flickers on in my soul
enabling entreaty, conferring grace and hope
asking only that the unendurable be lifted
that strength be given to bear what can't be borne
Healing, can I ask this if it's on behalf of another
if I only get one wish it would have to be this
if you can create does it mean you can re-create
actually I don't really mean can you, but will you
Will it be too much to ask that you are where I cannot be
holding her hand and the hands of those she loves
if I cannot be there to share in the fire walk
will you hold them up, provide courage in the flames
Safely guiding them through the darkest of times
binding them tightly to you and to each other
the faint flicker of faith is still alight here in me
so I hold her in my heart as I say another prayer
I could rail against a God who lets this happen
curse him or her all the way to hell and back
... and I have, far too many times to mention
but when I ask on anothers behalf it's different
I made a promise that I would pray every day, so I do
faithfully praying for more faith to pray for miracles
faithfully praying that miracles happen for these few
wishing it with all my might, with all my heart
Renee I love you too. xx Jos

Jos you are a gift to me. When I pray I ask for God to be with me and I see that he is through your prayers, because you are God-like and you are with me.
I love this so much and it means the world to me.
Love Renee xoxo
Uncanny.
I planned on going two places when I sat down. I just went to Renee's and now I am here. All the way through this I wondered if it was her you were talking of. I have given up my hedonistic ways and offered to pray on Renee's behalf, leap on faith for the sake of a beautiful woman. And I just left there offering to flip god off I she requested.
I have thought on this curious notion, the praying for others. I've offered to do it. And then the prayers get caught in my mouth, a strange lump that I'm unsure how to articulate, but I do, and then I hope, and I leap and then when all else fails, I flip the universe off.
Dear Jos how are you doing? I want to know how you are doing.
Love Renee xoxo
Jos I am glad that today is a good day. Today is a good day.
Jacquie and Sheldon aren't doing to well and it is a hard day today, but it is still a good day.
Love Renee xoxo
I love you and I'm crushed today.
Love Renee xoxo
Renee I left a message for you on your blog (as usual) I just want to say that there isn't a day goes by that I don't think of you, of Jacquie, of Sheldon ... that I don't pray that you be made well ... all of you ... and if not well then that you feel close to God, surrounded with hope, peace, faith. xx Jos
xoxoxo
You do more than you will ever know.
Love Renee xoxo
Jeeze, this is hard. I just popped over here for the first time and I have no idea what's going on but I feel so bereft! For whatever, I am so sorry.
Loved this post on prayer. It is one of my greatest struggles and God and I battle over this a lot. I push against the need to shoot up wishes and repentances like arrows, hoping they find their mark. But when you have no control and the world spins on an unearthly axis...what have you left but to cry out "Oh great God, be small enough to hear me now." (Nicole Nordeman)
Anonymous me- a common thread it would seem. Curious that so many are feeling the same way of prayer and faith at once. The fervent prayer of a righteous man is supposed to avail much but I feel anything but righteous these days. Take care~rickHey, friends! I have a cool post to share with you today–we're throwing it back to 2010 to talk about Elisabeth and Jon's wedding day at the Inn at Erlowest in Lake George! I first met up with Elisabeth in early 2010; she was recently engaged and she and Jon had made some major wedding decisions already, but was looking for some help with the day-of the wedding. At that time, KOWE was still in its infancy and I didn't offer any day-of coordination. Elisabeth and I immediately hit it off and I was really hoping that she and her fiance would hire KOWE!
Alas, Elisabeth and Jon didn't need full service planning. Fast forward to July of 2010 and I was still thinking about my conversation with Elisabeth; I reassessed my business model and thought, “Maybe I SHOULD offer a day-of coordination package!” So I called Elisabeth and Jon and pitched the idea to them and they said yes! Hence, the “One Special Day” package was born.
Elisabeth and Jon were married October 16, 2010 (yay, 3 years yesterday!) at the Diamond Point Community Church with their reception at the Inn at Erlowest. They had one of my most favorite ceremonies to date, too–it was very personal and very moving; not a dry eye in the house!
How amazing is the Diamond Point Community Church? It dates back to the 19th century! I LOVED the wreath on the church door by Renaissance Floral Design.
Back at Erlowest, this image shows how chaotic the bridal suite can be! The Elarios are good at concealing the craziness! Below, me and my wedding planner bag-o-tricks!
Alayne and her crew from Make Me Fabulous were on the scene, too.
Some details…the ring bearer bowl was engraved with a lyric from the song that played during their ceremony. It read, “the only truth I know is you.”
Sparkly shoes. Check!
Here's a fun shot of Elisabeth and her ladies.
And Jon and the fellas…one of the taller groups of groomsmen we've ever had (one of Elisabeth's brothers is 6'7″!).
Ready for our first look! Here she comes, Jon!
And he loves what he sees. These two are too cute.
A quick touch up…
I LOVE this photo of Elisabeth and her, Dad, Pete, getting ready to head down the aisle.
The inside of the Diamond Point Community Church–so quaint.
Jon and Elisabeth used Horsin' Around Trolley out of Saratoga to get them to and from the church and then the trolley transported guests from their hotel in the village to Erlowest so no one had to drive. Transportation is a must!
Love these shots down by the lakeshore.
You know me and forehead kisses…Elisabeth's beautful gown was by Cymbeline from Something Bleu Bridal.
Some detail decor shots! Elisabeth's Mom, Sue, found all of the white “ghost” pumpkins and their favors were tulip bulbs! This former Tulip Queen approved!
Getting ready to be introduced for the first time as Mr. and Mrs. Draper and walking in to the theme from the show “Mad Men.” Awesome.
Fun fact, this was the first wedding that senior coordinator, Megan, worked with me on back when she was my intern! Love you, Megan!
And I'll end with this one. Amazing.
I know I say this a lot, but it's so awesome to look back and relive these days! I'm also starting to get ideas for my own wedding, too! Hope you enjoyed this Throwback Thursday anniversary edition! What was your favorite wedding planning memory? Let me know in the comments!

Held on October 30 at the East of England showground, Peterborough, the conference will tackle some of the big issues facing the machinery industry and it’s theme asks: ‘Can big data lead to smarter farming’?
In recent years there has been a rapid rise in the amount of data being collected throughout the agricultural supply chain. Farmers are gathering huge amounts of data, for example using sensors and mobile apps to analyse soil samples, and cameras and drones to monitor pests and diseases.
The conference will look at how can farmers, agribusinesses and researchers can gain real value from this and how industry should be harnessing it to support future decision-making at field and farm level – but experts report that 90% of it is being ‘wasted’. programme includes:
Benjamin Turner, of Agrimetrics, talking about the role of ‘big data’ in unlocking previously unimaginable solutions to feeding the world.
Practical lessons from the farm about how big data will transform agriculture – Oliver Wood, precision technology manager with Omnia Precision Agronomy.
Dr Joachim Stiegemann, of Claas, will talk about the next generation of Claas' Lexion harvester and how data collection will contribute to smarter farming.
How the Internet of Things has morphed into the Internet of Agri-things. The speaker will be from a major software company
The Royal Academy of Engineering will speak about developments in the use of artificial intelligence, imagery and analytics from satellite, drone, plane and robots.
Cranfield University and Harper Adams University will talk about ‘big data’ in the arable and livestock sectors, the use of sensor technologies and the ethical dilemmas around data.What’s the biggest barrier that’s blocking your path to success? As I ponder this question, I’m reminded of a story shared by author Ryan Holiday.
In his book The Obstacle is The Way, Holiday shares the story about a King from the ancient times, who conducted an interesting experiment with his subjects. The king purposely placed a boulder on a roadway and hid in a nearby bush to see who would move it.
First, one of the wealthy merchants in the kingdom walked by, noticed the boulder, and continued to walk around it.
Next, a rich nobleman observed the obstacle, stopped, and started complaining about the King, blaming him for not keeping the road clear!
Finally, a lowly peasant showed up carrying several bags of vegetables. He set his baggage to the side and tried to move the stone out of the way.
He continued to push and strain until finally, he succeeded! As the peasant was about to pick up his bags, he noticed something strange.
There was a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. Inside the purse were many gold coins and note from the King confirming that the coins belonged to whoever removed the boulder from the road!
Every obstacle gives you an opportunity to improve your condition! The peasant had to physically lean into the problem, to overcome the obstacle in his path. Leaning into the problem was the critical step that separated him from the merchant and the nobleman.
Have you ever had a “hiring boulder” that was blocking your road to success? Some shop owners are like the wealthy merchant, in that they avoid the problem by giving up on placing ads and doing interviews.
Or maybe your obstacle is keeping the good people you find. Some shop owners are like the nobleman when it comes to retention.
They complain about the millennials, blaming them for not staying in a shop environment with high attrition and low morale. (Are you like some shop owners?)
So, how do you to lean into your problem and overcome the obstacle in your path? Keep reading if you want the gold that’s under your boulder!
Change Your Perspective
The story is told of a farmer and his horse. One day the horse runs away. The farmer’s neighbor comes over and says, “I’m sorry about your horse.” To which the farmer replies, “Who knows what’s good or bad.
The next day the horse comes back, bringing with him with 12 additional horses. “Wow, congratulations on your great fortune!” says the neighbor. To which the farmer replies, “Who knows what’s good or bad.”
The following day, while attempting to tame one of the wild horses, the farmer’s son gets thrown and breaks his leg. The neighbor comes back over, “I’m sorry about your son!” To which the farmer replies, “Who knows what’s good or bad.”
The next day, the army comes through town looking for able-bodied young men to fight in the war. The son is spared from battle because of his broken leg. By now, you know how the neighbor and the farmer responded!
The story of the farmer is a reminder of the following fact: Everything is happening FOR you and not TO you! To lean into your problem, you must change your perspective.
For example, the inability to find the right technician is happening for you to improve your recruiting and interviewing skills. The great technician you hire tomorrow will be the result of your inability to find the right technician today.
The low car count you are experiencing is happening for you to develop the habit of building a marketing calendar, which will help you improve your future car count condition! You used to sing the back to school blues but leaning into your problem will cause you to change your tune!
Your service manager turnover is happening for you to build a shop culture that attracts “Mr. Right” instead of “Mr. Right Now.” The right manager will also bring the right technicians from his previous shop, which will free you up to spend more time at the farm with your horses!
Your problem can become the starting point to your success if you’re willing to change your perspective.
Summary
So, there you have it. When you’re faced with an obstacle at your shop you have the choice to ignore it, look for someone to blame, or you can use it as an opportunity to improve your condition.
I challenge you to set your baggage to the side, lean in, and choose wisely!
P.S. Email etwiggs@autotraining.net and I will send you a Failure Takeaway Worksheet to help you lean into your problem at the shop.Unlock Hidden Revenue With Metrics
What to Monitor and How to Coach to Specific Metrics That Move the Needle for Your Rep
As you grow and scale your sales team, metrics become increasingly important. Being able to define, measure and act on key performance indicators can help you not only quotes to your individual reps' performances at a granular and specific level driving the right organizational change but you can also literally unlock hidden revenue in your sales organization.

- How to measure them
- How to act upon the story that they tell
We are going to look at metrics across the revenue operations of your team focusing not only on new business revenue and metrics but also the impact of the right metrics on the overall customer journey and growth opportunities which much of the time without the right metrics are hiding in plain site.
We will start by just listing out the metrics that matter to the different parts of the organization and we will dig into them through out the course.

A Look at Patient Barriers to Pain Management and Acceptance
The barriers that we face when we tell patients they can learn to live with pain…they’re quite vast. There are some patients who say “I don’t want to live with pain. The pain has taken a lot out of my life and I don’t want to learn to live with it. I just want it gone.” That’s a significant barrier, but it’s understandable, and the way that we approach dealing with that is helping a patient work toward a model of acceptance. “Acceptance” doesn’t mean that they give up the fight, but accepting the reality of the chronicity of their pain and learning how they can still have very good quality of life despite the presence of pain. For a lot of patients it’s hard to conceptualize that, because their experience of pain is just what is it at that time. When you tell them you have to learn to live with pain, they think it’s learning to live with pain at that level of intensity and with that degree of interference. But managed pain is completely different. The discomfort of course will still be there, but if a person is able to be engaged in more productive activities, things that are more meaningful, then the pain becomes more of a nuisance variable. When we conceptualize that to patients, or help them start to see what that can look like, that goes a long way, and we’re able to help shift their conceptualization of learning to live with pain and they become more open to it.Finance Minister Israel Katz launched a threat to Hamas leadership on Monday and said that even the slightest breach of the ceasefire between Israel and the terror outfit will prompt Jerusalem to act forcefully, even targeting its leader Yahyah Sinwar.
Speaking to the Ynet studio in an interview, Katz — a senior Cabinet member and close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — said that Hamas had suffered a heavy defeat in the latest spate of violence and that Israel will come for "Yahyah Sinwar's head."

Although Sinwar was seen in public since a ceasefire whose terms remain undisclosed took hold, Katz claimed that he was not given immunity from Israeli assassination as part of the agreement.
"He's leaving the bunker, but he should understand that he is not Saladin who defeated the Christian empire and liberated Jerusalem. He led Hamas to its most severe defeat in terms of the intensity of the blow it took, in my opinion," Katz said. "These are blows, the like of which we have never delivered before. We have set new rules, and Hamas will have to abide by them."
The Likud lawmaker also conditioned extensive rebuilding of the Gaza Strip and civilian assistance on the return of the bodies of soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul and captives Avera Mengistu and Hisham a-Sayed who are held by Hamas. However, Israel allows the entry of urgent supplies into the Palestinian enclave.

The finance minister rejected criticism from other members of the Cabinet who were not pleased with the results of the operation in Gaza and said that they all showed great appreciation to the military leadership, IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi, and Shin Bet chief Nadav Argaman during Cabinet meetings.
Katz also praised the police for cracking down on Arab riots that erupted across the country and called to continue the efforts to eradicate crime in Arab society and cut it off from religious extremism and radical nationalism.Lokotrack 174 lt130e mobile jaw crusher metso outotec.quoted price.stone crusher machine from china zenith.this page is about the zenith stone crusher machine,or crusher machine,or crushing machine,includes jaw crusher,cone crusher read more how does a quarry operate complete stone crushing palnt

Date of last revision: 13 November 2020At their recent meeting in Palm Springs, Barack Obama and Xi Jinping, leaders of the world’s two largest police states, exchanged jocular remarks about keeping citizens in line when they complain about massive surveillance procedures. “Like unruly teenagers,” said Xi Jinping. “Sometimes they just have to be grounded,” said Obama, to which Xi Jinping replied, “Drone ground them fast!” The two leaders chuckled and then walked off out of the hearing of reporters and photographers.Sanya
Why does the author use different tenses? Dr Scott SUGGESTED women tend to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they are expected to be more emotionally expressive than men. Therefore, faking a smile while feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behaviour and cause more harmful feelings. Although, 'deep acting' seemed to improve mood in the short-term, Dr Scott SAYS it's not a long-term solution to feeling unhappy. He SAID: "There have been some suggestions that if you do this over a long period you start to feel inauthentic Why does the author use the simple past tense 'SUGGESTED' in the first paragraph, use the simple present tense 'SAYS' in the third paragraph, and then use the simple past tense SAID in the last paragraph? Thank you!

Doctor Scott SAYS = that is his opinion! (not a quote!!!!) Examples: Most women say Brad Pitt is good looking. This expresses an OPINION, and is not quoting what people actually speak.

Well the answer's pretty obvious. He uses the past to indicate something in the past, then uses the present to indicate something in the present, and so on. Where do you see a difficulty?

A zebra crossing is black and white so I guess it is multicultural. But guide dogs know what it is and so it saves lives both of blind people and of kids who want to cross the road. But this is 2021. So it is not enough. First there was the LGBT crossing. Okay it was very expensive and totally confused the guide dogs so was a pointless virtue signalling health hazard. But the wider LGBTQ community is only so far up the pyramid, we can do better. and so to Camden Council in London which, as is the wont of such bodies, pays its senior staff mouth watering saleries but bleats endlessly about how front line services are having to be slashed back because of cuts in Government funding made by the evil Tories. As you can see below, Camden does have money for some vital projects…

It was late in the evening at Real Man Pizza in Clerkenwell and another hectic day at our quirky Celtic Italian restaurant was drawing to a close when this couple wandered in. They ordered and then asked if they could sit outside. Sure – no problem. And then the bloke asked for an ashtray!
How very European. When the smoking ban came in we, like all bars and restaurants, got rid of our ashtrays. Keeping hold of them would in today’s puritan climate be like stashing hard corn porn behind the counter. I may be a smoker but I have to accept that I am a filthy, disgusting human being guilty of the greatest crime on this planet.
And so when folks smoke outside Real Man they just drop the butts on the pavement. Camden Council pisses away thousands of quid a week sending round vans with posters saying that if you drop a butt on the street you can get fined £80 or whatever but that is what folks do. Because in Aitstrip One ashtrays are just another relic of the 20th century.

I am sitting in Real Man Pizza Company trying to catch up on my writing backlog before heading to Paddington and yet again the bastards at Camden Council have sent little men to dig upo the road outside our door. The drill is incredibly load. You would think there was gold buried on Clerkenwell Road as this is about the tenth time in two years that a small patch of tarmac has been dug up and resurfaced. I am assured that the racket will end soon but what is the point? Perhaps it is a cunning job creation scheme where Camden pays men overtime rates at weekends to dig up the same few square metres, resurface and then dig up again every few months.
I have no idea. I just feel that Camden Council hates me. Why can’t they go and plague some of the other restaurants around here and drive away their customers for a change? I am promised the pain will within an hour or so. Meanwhile I have turned the music up full blast so poor Aldo is suffering a CD Punk Compilation 2 prepared by my friend Paul in the IOM and which we play on Monday evenings as well as the drilling.Daichi Miura and his wife are now the proud parents of their first child together.

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are widely considered the next stage in monetary evolution, having the potential to overcome long-standing challenges within the global currency and payments system. Our recent article explores the range of benefits they can offer, from ensuring that public money remains a dominant unit of account as private currencies emerge in increasing numbers to fostering financial inclusion of the unbanked and underbanked in our communities. More rigorous evaluation of their viability and fitness for purpose in countries with undeveloped digital and financial infrastructure needs to be undertaken.
The envisaged role of CBDCs has varied across countries and this is reflected in different design cho-ices. Since advanced eco-nomies are mostly concerned with payments safety and opportunities to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments, and are more likely to opt for a ‘wholesale’ CBDC. This has the potential to improve the efficiency of interbank payments and securities settlements. Banks interested in addressing financial inclusion challenges can be expected to consider issuing ‘general purpose’ CB-DCs since these are broadly available to the general public for day-to-day use.
The Pacific islands include some of the world’s most remote and geographically dispersed countries. Despite years of effort, financial inclusion is a major challenge and many in the region still lack access to financial services due to geographic remoteness, limited digital infrastructure and insufficient financial literacy. These challenges are heightened by the progressive withdrawal from the region of two major Australian banks — ANZ and Westpac — and the general reduction in correspondent banking relationships globally.
CBDCs can offer a potential solution to the financial inclusion challenges of Pacific island countries and the problem of high remittance costs that currently serve as a tax on the earnings of Pacific Islanders abroad. CBDCs will also likely serve as a preferential alternative to private sector cryptocurrencies that some are seeking to develop and launch in the Pacific, which may prove more attractive than the current expensive remittance procedures. But the private sector cryptocurrencies are likely to come with high volatility and potential unreliability.
Today, cash remains the preferred payment method for most transactions in Pacific island countries. This requires the payer to travel to the financial centre, and is typically costly and time-consuming in a region with a highly dispersed population and mou-ntainous island geography.
CBDCs can improve access to financial services by those in remote areas and reduce cash management costs. CBDCs can lower the cost of maintaining the supply of physical currency and protecting it against counterfeiting. They can also create benefits for private payment system operators by reducing bookkeeping, operational and payment reconciliation costs. Merchants may benefit from reduced cash logistics and individuals from minimised ATM withdrawal costs.
Although the opportunities for financial inclusion generated by CBDCs can be substantial, underlying challenges can also be significant. This is particularly so for Pacific island countries where the digital and financial infrastructure necessary to successfully imp-lement the technology rem-ain relatively undeveloped.
Effective implementation of CBDCs is conditional on the availability of required infrastructure, including electricity, internet and cellular network coverage, smart phone penetration, and digital ID systems. Some countries may already have in place established physical payments infrastructure that could be adjusted to accommodate CBDC integration. Others will need to develop it specifically for the CBDC.
As with any other types of currency, the level of implementation of a CBDC will depend on the level of trust, demand and understanding among users. In Pacific island countries, the roll-out of CBDCs will require additional consumer-centred programs focusing on financial literacy and awareness raising, the collection of feedback and complaints from end users, and consumer protection standards.
The establishment and o-peration of a CBDC by any Pacific nation will require considerable expe-rtise and deep understanding of the design choices and issues to which this fundamentally new form of currency will give rise. Now is not the time to issue a CBDC in the Pacific. Development of a safe, efficient and accessible CBDC will require regulators to redirect scarce resources away from pressing challenges, such as enforcing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations and maintaining correspondent relationships with ove-rseas commercial banks.
Instead, now is the time to develop CBDC expertise. Understanding such matters requires study and time for reflection to work through the policy implications. If well designed and implemented, CBDCs offer a genuine solution to financial inclusion and remittance problems. Now is the time to begin laying the groundwork for this potentially game-changing innovation by developing the expertise required within the region’s central banks.

What are they, what do they do to skin? How are they different from regular water or a toner we all are used to see around? What do they put in there that makes it micellar?
The Right Brain responds:
Wow, we thought we’d seen it all when it came to Marketing co-opting technical terms to make products sound differentiated, but this is a new one! In reality, any product that contains a detergent (aka surfactant) can said to be “micellar water.”
What are micelles?
Micelles are the structures that surfactants form when they reach a certain concentration in water. Think of it this way: Surfactants are little chemical bridges with one end that loves water (hydrophilic) and one end that loves oil (lipophilic). Here’s an actual electron micrograph of a surfactant molecule:
Sarah Bellum says this picture reminds her of something else but I have no idea what she’s talking about. Anyway, when you dump a bunch of these molecules in water, the oil loving parts want to be close together to get away from the water. So, surfactant molecules spontaneously form these spherical blobs where the oily ends all point toward the middle of the sphere and the water loving ends all point to the outside of the sphere where the rest of the water is. That’s why surfactants are so good at dispersing oil: oil droplets can “hide” from the water in the middle of the micelle so they can be suspended or washed away. And here’s a real picture of a micelle:
Once again, I point out that ANY product with surfactants will do this. It doesn’t have to be called a fancy name like “micellar water.”
Is there ANYTHING different about micellar water?

The Beauty Brains bottom line
If you’re looking for a mild, low-foam face wash, micellar water may be just the thing for you. But don’t be tricked into spending a ton of money just because of the micelles.

I have been using this micellar water for cleansing eye lashes on myself and dog. We both have eye conditions where our lashes need to be very clean and I feel it works well but can not find a place to buy it in US so have to order on internet
Yon ka is just releasing a new cleanser with this technology. Look for a spa that sells Yon Ka and ask for Eau Micellaire.
I know use it as a make up remover and it doesn’t leave a film at all.
hope that helps
For Carol – the brand Simple has just released a product called Simple Micellar Cleansing Water. According to the February 2015 issue of Better Homes and Gardens, the product is sold at drugstores for $6.99. I have seen Simple products at Target, so that might be a good place to look for this. Good luck!
Walgreens carries both Garnier and Simple Micellar Water too, as do some grocery stores, do check prices, they vary. Love this product! No more expensive cosmetic cleansers for me — this truly does leave my skin feeling clean and moisturized, and is very refreshing when hot and/or traveling.
Where I can buy this :micellar water. Thank You
How well does this work on acne?
Unless the formula contains approved anti-acne agents like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, I don’t think it will work on acne at all.
The “Yes To” micellar waters in cotton and cucumber helped my acne, I think in large part because they were so gentle and had a light moisturizer so I wasn’t in constant battle with extremely dry patches and extremely oily patches. Plus, as a disabled person, it made it possible to manage twice daily cleansing on days when I couldn’t stand for long or had so little energy I could barely get out of bed (let alone stand at the sink raising my arms up above my heart for 2-5 minutes for cleansing and moisturizing). I’m hoping to find a replacement for them soon as trying other cleansers, I keep having so many problems with the fragrances and harshness, putting me back a year’s worth of progress in healing my troubled skin.
I think if someone’s acne was triggered by over cleansing or a sensitivity they didn’t recognize, it’s not unreasonable to think it’s a possibility of helping.
Garnier Fructis just came out with a fairly inexpensive micellar water and it is awesome!!! It’s sold in drugstores and in Walmart.
So I use baby oil to remove mascara. I can get a huge bottle in the baby section. Seems this Micellar ‘water’ is a gimmick. ah well.
Garnier’s Miceller for waterproof products works great and faster on eye products than baby oil. Plus it’s not greasy and doesn’t hurt your eyes. It’s the Bomb!
The best Micellar water I have used is from H2O at Home. Their Micellar Water is natural with witch hazel and hyaluronic acid. My skin feels amazing afterwards: clean, toned, and moisturized.
Can you use this on eyelash extensions for cleansing
You really should not use micellar cleansing water on lash extensions because it contains glycol. You’re supposed to avoid products that contain oil or glycol to prolong the life of your extensions.

After spending over two years learning how to do this the hard way and after buying tens of books, attending several workshops and buying multiple online courses, I decided to organize everything I learned and record it in over 120 lessons of first person step-by-step video tutorials. I also decided to provide my students with lifetime access to the courses and all future updates to ensure you can go at your own pace and always come back to the course for new lessons or to refresh your memory.

In addition to an interesting set of facts in this case, the FCC’s decision also reviews several other recent decisions in explaining why it came to the decision it did as to the amount of the proposed fine.
In this case, the contest was promoted on the air as an opportunity to win a choice of three cars. The "Cool, Hot or Green" contest announcements never revealed on the air that the winner in fact did not receive the car, but instead only a two year lease on the car, and only if the winner passed a credit check. Nor did the on-air announcements mention that full contest rules were available on the station’s website. While the written rules on the website made clear that the prize was merely a lease of the car, as has been the case in many recent decisions (see our summaries here and here), the Commission faulted the licensee for not broadcasting an accurate disclosure of these rules on the air. While the licensee argued that this was but a minor ambiguity in the rules, the FCC, reviewing some recent decisions, disagreed.
In reaching this decision, the FCC looked at two recent cases in drawing a distinction between a case that deserved a fine, and one in which only an admonition was appropriate. The case that drew an admonition was one where a licensee had a contest where parties could try to win prizes during different music segments – telling listeners that they could "enter as often as you like." The complaining party interpreted that to mean that they could enter multiple times during a particular segment, when the station meant that they could play at as many different times as they wanted as long as it was in different segments. The FCC found this to be merely a matter of interpretation as to the meaning of the promotional phrase, and just admonished the station.
That was contrasted to another case that the FCC found to be more similar to the current case. In that case, the licensee announced that it was giving away tickets to the premiere of Spiderman, without disclosing that the tickets did not guarantee that there would be room in the theater for the winner. When the winner showed up and was denied access to the premier, the station gave him tickets to another movie, and tickets to a later showing of Spiderman. As the station did not deliver what was promised (tickets to the premier) and did not disclose on the air that the "ticket" did not guarantee entry to the theater, the FCC fined the station $4000. The Commission felt that this precedent was more akin to the current case, leading to the fine in today’s decision.
What this decision once again shows is the Commission’s insistence on stations providing clear rules for their contests, following those rules, and announcing all the material terms on the air in a clear and unambiguous way. As the cases make clear, it is difficult to tell whether a misleading contest promotion will lead to a fine or an admonition – neither of which a station wants on its record. If the material rules of a contest (which we summarized here), including the nature of the prize and any material limiting factors on the value or availability of the prize, are not clearly disclosed in on-air announcements, and the FCC gets a complaint, a fine like that imposed here may very well result.METTLER TOLEDO

12th September 2018
How many possessions do you really need to live comfortably?
There is no right answer - but this question is one that must be contemplated by those seeking to downsize in order to move into a retirement village. The size of your home will dictate how many belongings you can bring, and while this can be liberating for some, most of us struggle to part with items that hold cherished memories.
At Dalkeith Heights Retirement Village, we provide spacious rooms and storage facilities, including a roof cavity to house your hard-to-part-with items. The trouble is, we can’t keep them all. Need tips and tricks for downsizing? Read on.
1. Parting with 'sentimental items'
Sentimental items are the hardest clutter to dispose of because often you can feel like you’re betraying a loved one or your own fond memories. You need to implement the “Where will it live?” principle, and downsize each collection.
For example, if you’ve kept multiple items from your child’s christening - dress, spoon, gifts etc, just choose two things. Then, commit to caring for, displaying or storing them properly. This will help you decide what ‘treasures’ to keep or what has to go.
Another tip regarding keepsakes might be to take a photo of the item, and store it electronically to look back at later.
2. Find out how much you need
So, how do we know how much ‘stuff’ we should have? Apparently you will know, listen to yourself, be realistic and it will click into place – keeping only the items that ‘spark joy’ and ‘add value’ to your life is a good place to start.
We all have 50 cookbooks which look great, but in reality we just google ‘chicken dishes’ on the iPad when we need inspiration, proving that those cookbooks aren’t a necessity.
Apparently the experts say once you have found the sweet spot for how much is right for you, that amount will never increase.
3. Photos and albums, books and DVD's
Technology is the future – and it will aid you in your mission to de-clutter. You can clear tonnes of space simply by scanning and storing photos electronically. USB’s are great for storage and don’t forget to back-up on a hard drive or save it to the cloud – maybe ask a tech savvy pal for this one.
When it comes to books and DVDs, we are lucky enough at Dalkeith Heights to have a library where you may be able to donate these items and lighten your load.
4. Things to part with now
These are items that need to go…yesterday. For the BIN
- Expired pantry items
- Lonely or disfigured Tupperware (missing lids, melted plastic, etc)
- Random cords and remote controls (If you don’t know what it does by now- ditch it)
- Receipts – includes warranty and guarantee booklets (check dates, and where possible obtain electronic receipts)
- Old prescriptions and other medications
To DONATE or SELL
- Utensils or appliances you never use
- Accessories, clothes and shoes (if it’s been unworn for 2 years - donate it!)
- Old towels and bedding
5. Avoid buying unnecessary items
Preventative measures need to find their way into your newly downsized lifestyle. How to avoid ‘stocking up’?
- Don’t buy clothes unless you have an occasion in mind – It’s a waste of money and valuable robe real estate.
- Don’t buy canned items/spice jars unless you need them for a specific recipe – likewise with cleaning products, get them when and if you need them.
- Get organised. Make lists and stick to them. Replace items, but don’t ‘stock-up’.
If the above tips are still causing you to cringe, try to compact your belongings and utilise storage options or invite a friend to help you cull, you could benefit from a different perspective.‘Streets of Truckee’ gaining local following
ajensen@tahoedailytribune.com
When Truckee resident Richard Blair released “From the Streets of Truckee” this summer, he had no idea the songs on the album would become so popular.
The collection of tales about Truckee’s early history has been a hit, with dinner shows at Cottonwood Bar and Restaurant, selling out in both October and November.
With the help of a handful of musicians and actors, Blair will perform a third “From the Streets of Truckee” dinner show at Cottonwood on Wednesday. The special dinner show includes actors taking on the roles of historical characters and performing brief skits in between songs as a narrator sets the stage.
The stories told include that of Theodore Judah, who engineered the first railroad over Donner Summit; a gunfight between Truckee’s first Sheriff Jacob Teeter and Deputy James Reed; Snowshoe Thompson’s volunteer effort to deliver mail across the Sierra Nevada in winter; and a Boca brewery that sent beer to the World’s Fair in Paris in the 1880s.
“All I’m doing is just really passing it along,” Blair said during a Tuesday phone interview. “I’m just keeping the stories alive. That’s my whole goal here is just keep the stories alive.”
Truckee residents’ connection with their local history has been inspiring, the 62-year-old computer network manager added.
“And I swear to go a I had no idea it was going to be this popular with local folks,” Blair said. “They’re just like totally connected with their local history. They love celebrating it. They love seeing the people they know and hearing songs about the stuff that they see every day.”
A longtime guitar player and builder, Blair was inspired to continue writing songs looking at Truckee’s history after writing a few historical pieces and being encouraged to write more by Truckee resident Mary Lou Cooper.
“I just set out to start writing stuff about Truckee’s history and putting it together with the melodies that I was kind of working out in my head,” Blair said.
He researched the stories and turned them into short-form pieces. The dinner shows at Cottonwood arose from considering what to do for a CD release party.
“The whole thing just started snowballing after that and it turned into a show,” Blair said.
The 28-year Truckee resident counts the Grateful Dead, Buffalo Springfield and Bob Dylan among his musical influences. He describes his songs as folk, roots-rock and bluegrass.
“There’s a special connection between the history and the type of music it is,” Blair said, saying it fills a unique niche.
The third dinner show was barely advertised and sold out primarily through word of mouth, Blair said.
Following Wednesday’s show, Blair said he is unsure of what’s next for “Streets of Truckee,” although he expects the songs to live on.
The success of the album has offered him a musical direction. He’s working on new material, which has included tales of how people arrived in Truckee.
As much as the album and live shows have delved into Truckee’s past, Blair said he hopes it will also be part of the town’s future.
“We’re trying to create this ‘Streets of Truckee’ thing that will live on in Truckee,” Bl…The newest craze in the more than extravagant world of art investment is blockchain-based NFT art objects. Powered by the cryptocurrency hype of the last few months, more and more artists discovered a way to sell digital art with blockchain-technology. And where money and tech meet, Adult Entertainment is not far. As it turns out, many performers and adult artists are already at the forefront of the upcoming NFT boom.
While most people still are skeptical of cryptocurrencies and a majority still doesn’t even really know how to even buy bitcoins, the hype at the crypto markets did lead to an increasingly accelerating development of additional uses of the blockchain-technology. Digital artists found a way to make their artworks unique by transforming them into so-called»non-fungible tokens« on the blockchain. Basically, they found a way to circumvent the problem all digital-forms have: they can be copied and hence there would not be an original as in traditional art forms. An NFT can exist once, making the artwork or picture or movie or whatever you transform into an NFT the equivalent of an original that then can be sold at a higher price.
Recently the artist Mike Winkelman (Bleeple) made headlines with a Jpg he created and sold for nearly 70 million dollars through the famous auction house Christie’s. But that was not a singular moment, shortly before he sold an NFT video clip for nearly 7 million dollars. Not only art but also strange other digital »objects« get the NFT treatment. F.ex. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey auctioned off his very first tweet or a digital NFT of that very tweet.
Adult Entertainment again a driving force for new technology?
As with VHS and the Internet, streaming platforms, torrents, and subscription-based websites, adult entertainment is already an active driver of the NFT movement which up until now might only be a short-lived hype. But if adult performers, artists, and sex workers find ways to make NFTs a way of stable income, that would probably mean that NFTs are here to stay and become common-place.
Rolling Stone Magazine published an article about several adult performers and femdom producers that started to use NFT to make money. They tell story of a woman calling herself Cryptonatrix selling digital images of Silicon Valley capitalists like Elon Musk and Vladimir Tenev (the CEO of Robinhood) in BDSM-related scenarios where she is dominating the seemingly powerful man. One of her pictures sold for nearly 2,000 dollars.
Owning unique art objects
Cryptonatrix refers to her digital art as »commentary on political or social happenings with femdom themes« and hence is targeting the art market. But it’s easy to imagine other forms of usage of the NFT technology in adult entertainment. Especially for content creators already successful on clip sites (as many femdom artists and custom porn producers are) can cash in on their fans desire to own unique pictures, videos and hence very authentic, private, rare digital objects of their stars.
No censorship, no piracy: A perfect business model for porn?
The cryptocurrency-based NFT platforms might also be a good way to circumvent censorship and shadow-banning problems many adult entertainment professionals encounter when they try to use traditional banking services and payment processors. Paypal still is famous for its refusal to process adult business transactions.
The adult performer Allie Eve Knox f.ex. is offering a fetish and kink piece called »Allie in the City, Two,” in which she is depicted as a giantess towering over Madrid’s famous Edificio Metropolis. Before that, she successfully sold »Allie in the City, One,« for over $500.
About the advantages the new technology might offer adult entertainment creators, she said: »In the old Limewire days, people were just downloading shit because they could, because we trained people to believe that it was so easy and available you could get it anywhere. Training people to buy art or music or nudes is a good step in sex workers’ direction because it encourages someone to invest their money in individualized, exclusive content. It’s training people to pay for their porn.«
Porn Studio releases one of its hit movies as NFT
One of the legendary porn site brands Wasteland.com has now announced the release of its first award-winning porn film available as an NFT. AVN reports on the new way of using a website’s catalog: »Wasteland’s newly released NFTs features Raven Riley and Liz Vicious from the horror porn feature, Succubus—a full-length motion picture that was produced in 2005-07 in Dayton, Ohio—with never-before-released footage of the two performers.«
Wasteland owner and co-founder, Colin Rowntree, said about his experiment on the new market: »I find NFT fascinating as a technology and distribution medium. At a time when the unfettered piracy of adult content has absolutely cratered the perceived value of porn as a product, NFTs are an intriguing, emerging means of reinjecting some value through real scarcity.«
Risky costs and the unpredictable future of the blockchain
But as with many of the new technologies, there are downsides and insecurities as well. F.ex. right now, NFTs can only be created on the blockchain used by Ethereum. And so-called gas fees which are Ethereum processing fees make it quite risky to create an NFT. And due to the highly volatile market price of crypto-currencies like Ethereum the costs and benefits are difficult to predict. Additionally, as with all internet platforms, growing success and growing audiences might mean that platforms selling NFTs might also start to censor content, just like social media platforms and payment processors did in the past.
And right now age verification is also not addressed. Cryptonatrix said: »You don’t know the age of the buyer or who’s in the content, or how old the person is or if they gave consent for that. So that’s a huge concern of mine.«
For the moment though, the new technology is creating a new rush and a highly innovative push for new ways of creating and selling content. And there is no question: Adult entertainment will play a huge role in its success or ultimate fizzling out.
If you want to know more about the technology and what is needed to created NFT artworks, here is a tutorial and some background information by digital artist Aaron Rutten.His four blacktype winners were also more than any other first season sire could achieve and they included the brilliant Group 1 Racing Post Trophy hero Kingston Hill, successful also in the Group 3 Autumn Stakes at Newmarket and one of the leading contenders for this year’s classics. He was rated the second best two-year-old in Europe in the World Rankings. Two more group scorers for Mastercraftsman were Amazing Maria in the Prestige Stakes at Goodwood and Craftsman in the Killavullan Stakes at Leopardstown, while Pablosky won a listed race in Rome; all three of these are out of mares by sons of Storm Cat. Three others by Mastercraftsman were placed second or third in group races.
Mastercraftsman had been officially assessed as the champion European two-year-old of 2008, after winning four of his five starts including two Group 1 events, the same double that his sire Danehill Dancer had also achieved in 1995.

What started as a company manufacturing white Dixie Cup hats for the Navy in 1962 quickly grew into one of the largest suppliers of military apparel in the US. Through decades of hard work, Propper was able to expand into the law enforcement and public safety markets with a line of tactical apparel and equipment. Today, Propper meets the ever-evolving needs of our public safety professionals with the durability, precision, comfort and style found in every product they produce. From tactical apparel to tactical gear, Propper’s collections and product lines keep you safe and looking sharp.
Galls proudly carries over 175 different types of Propper apparel and equipment including tactical shirts, tactical pants, outdoor clothing, outerwear, footwear, women’s gear, clothing accessories and much more.

Propper crafts their tactical apparel with only the most rugged and durable materials capable of withstanding the harshest conditions. Each stitch is sewn for maximum wear resistance and professional function. With styles for both men and women, Propper has the tactical shirts, pants and outerwear you need for on or off duty work.
For a budget-friendly, uniform-style shirt with performance features, the Propper Uniform Polo comes highly recommended. This uniform shirt is constructed from a soft knit performance polyester that dries quickly and withstands fading, shrinking and wrinkling. This polo shirt includes a mic/sunglasses tab under the front placket and a pen pocket on the left sleeve. You can also have this polo customized to meet department standards.
The Propper Ripstop BDU Uniform Trousers are sewn to military specifications and present a clean, professional look with its fused pocket flaps. These BDU pants feature a six-pocket design, felled inseams and a reinforced seat and knee. These ripstop pants are also made fade-, shrink- and wrinkle-resistant.

Propper’s line of tactical footwear is designed to meet the demanding needs of our service men and women. These duty and military boots not only look sharp, but they also keep your feet comfortable and protected as you face a variety of weather conditions and environments.
For a lightweight boot that reduces the impact of everyday duty, the Propper Duralight Tactical Boot comes highly recommended. These duty boots are built with an EVA rubber outsole for excellent traction and a removable EVA contoured footbed for comfort. These tactical boots also provide oil/slip resistance and are reinforced with double/triple stitching for longer wear.
The Propper 8” Series 100 Side Zip Boots are constructed for high-risk situations and intense field training. These side-zip boots feature polishable cattle hide leather with 1000D nylon upper and an antimicrobial lining for odor control and breathability. The oil/slip-resistant outsole helps with hard-hitting traction and impact absorption while the 550 paracord lacing adds durability.

We use cookies to ensure that you receive the best experience possible whilst you use our website.Tailwind allows you to set up and manage separate user accounts for different employees or roles in your company. These user accounts can also be set up to have different levels of access to your data and modules, allowing you to restrict access to sensitive information while also ensuring that your users don't have their screen cluttered with modules they will never use. Please note that these settings will only be available if your account is set as an Administrator. Accessing the User Management Page. The User Management settings are available by clicking on the gear icon at the top right of the page, next to your user name. Click on 'User Management' in the menu that appears. The User Management page is broken up into three sections. The 'Manage Subscription' section lets you manage your Tailwind account type and total number of Tailwind user subscriptions, the Registered Users list shows you all your existing User Accounts, and the Personnel list shows all the Personnel records in your database that do not currently have their own Registered User Account. Managing Your Subscription. The Manage Subscriptions section shows how many User Accounts you are currently paying for on your Tailwind account. It also allows you adjust that number up or down in real time, in case you need to expand or reduce your total number of users. The number here is the maximum number of Registered Users you can have configured, so if you are already using all of your accounts and want to add a new one, you will need to increase your Subscription Count first. If you find over time that you are not using all your available accounts, you should feel free to Decrease your Subscription Count - this will ensure that you are not charged for users you are not using! Make sure to do so well before your next billing period if possible, to be sure that you are not charged. Managing Your Subscription - Changing Your Product Tier. This section also allows you to upgrade or downgrade your product subscription to Tailwind, between the 'Standard', 'Pro', and 'Enterprise' options. This may come in handy if you find yourself in need of the additional features provided by the 'Pro' or 'Enterprise' tiers, or notice that you are not actually using those features and want to downgrade to a more basic set. More information about the different tiers and their features can be found here. Adding a User Account. So long as you have fewer Registered Users than your Subscription Count, you can add a new Registered Account. To do so, start by finding the Personnel record you want to associate with the new User in the Personnel List, then click on the 'Create Account' link on the far right column. If you do not currently have a Personnel record for the person you want to add as a user, you will have to create one first. Once you click on the link, you will be prompted to choose a username and password for the new account. After you have done so, click 'Create' to create the new user. (Users will be able to change their password after they log in, using the 'Settings' in their Options menu.) Creating the user will return you to the User Management page. The new user should now appear on the list of Registered Users. User Account Security. Now that you have created the new account, you may want to adjust the Security settings. These settings control what modules in Tailwind the user will have access to, and whether they will be able to view or edit the data in those modules. To access the Security settings for a user, click on the 'Security' link next to the account name. This will open up the Personnel Security page for that user. Each module in Tailwind has its own section, allowing you to adjust the user's access in considerable detail. Modifying User Security - Saving and Loading Templates. In fact, the amount of detail available may seem somewhat overwhelming at first. Going through every section and setting everything by hand for every user would be a lot of work - certainly not work you want to repeat for every new account! To avoid this, Tailwind allows you to save and load a set of Security templates. We also provide a set of default Templates that you can use, or modify to fit your business security needs. To apply one of these templates to your new user account, open the 'Load Settings From Template' section, right at the top of the Personnel Security page. You can then select a template from the drop-down and click 'Load' to apply it to this account. The first time you load a default template, we recommend looking through the different sections to ensure that it matches up with your expectations. If you decide to make some changes, you can open the 'Save Current Settings Into New Template Security' section and save the new settings as their own template - be sure to pick a name for your new Template that you will remember! You can use the same method to save new Security templates for any role in your organization that requires its own specific set-up. This will save you a lot of time if you are setting up multiple users right off the bat, or if you end up needing to add or replace users in the future. In all cases, changes to the user account security are saved automatically: if you make changes, or load a new template, there is no need for any additional action. That said, we always recommend testing the new account to make sure that the security settings are working as you expected - particularly if you have just loaded or configured a security template for the first time. Once you have updated the security settings, you will have to return to the User Management Page via the gear icon for now. Resetting User Passwords. The User Management page can also be used to reset the password on an account. If you have a user who has forgotten their password, or it needs to be changed for other reasons, just click on the 'Reset Password' link next to the user account in the Registered Users list. You will be prompted to enter and confirm a new password for the account. Disabling, Enabling, and Deleting Registered Users. Controls are also available to Disable/Enable or Delete any of the non-administration Registered Users. Disabling the user will make it impossible for anyone to log in to the account in question, while still maintaining the account information; you can then Enable the account when you are ready for it to be used again. Deleting the account will remove it completely from the Registered Users list - the related Personnel record will no longer be associated with a user account, and should reappear on the Personnel list at the bottom of the page. It will also free up a subscription 'slot', so that another user account can be created. If you do not plan on replacing it with another user, you may want to Decrease your total Subscription Count, so that you are not billed for user accounts you are not using.decided to do just that.
We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made. In this item, we'll look at how Sanders characterizes the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In a separate item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil.
Here's a portion of Sanders' speech, which came during Senate debate over extending tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Democrats and Republicans divided over whether the cuts should be extended for the wealthiest Americans.
."
To keep matters simple, we'll stick to checking Sanders' claim that "the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income," which is "more than the entire bottom 50 percent."
When we asked Sanders' office for a source, they pointed us to a study dated Aug. 5, 2009 by University of California (Berkeley) economist Emmanuel Saez, "Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (update with 2007 estimates)." We looked at the paper and found this line: The top 1 percent "has gone through enormous fluctuations along the course of the twentieth century, from about 18 percent (of income) before WWI, to a peak to almost 24 percent in the late 1920s, to only about 9 percent during the 1960s-1970s, and back to almost 23.5 percent by 2007." An accompanying chart confirmed the 23.5 percent figure for 2007.
In a chart subsequently updated by Saez and forwarded to us by Sanders' office, the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent actually fell modestly by 2008, to just under 21 percent. Still, Sanders was specific in his speech about referring to 2007, and the number he cited was calculated by a credentialed academic economist specializing in income and wealth statistics -- a pretty credible source, in our view. So the number looked pretty solid to us.
Still, we've looked at a similar question before, so we were aware that various economists have attempted to grapple with this question. In the interest of making extra certain that Sanders was right, we decided to see whether the results in the Saez study mirrored those published elsewhere.
One paper we found is by Arthur B. Kennickell, assistant director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. This paper, published Jan. 7, 2009, found that the top 1 percent's share of income was 21.4 percent in 2007 -- slightly lower than the 23.5 percent that Sanders cited but certainly in the ballpark. That's also higher than the 14.6 percent taken by the bottom 50 percent, which is consistent with what Sanders had said.
Another study, published in 2010 by Adrian Dungan and Kyle Mudry of the Internal Revenue Service's Individual Returns Analysis Section, found the top 1 percent taking 22.8 percent of income. Once again, this is slightly lower than what Sanders quoted, but in the same vicinity. That was also well over the 12.3 percent earned by the bottom 50 percent, which is once again consistent with what Sanders said.
The differences from study to study likely stem from two factors -- the source of the data (using information from tax returns rather than surveys of American families, for instance) and the definition of "income" (such as whether capital gains are included in the calculations). When we asked Kennickell whether there was some reason to prefer one study over another, he responded that they all have their own merits. "There are many definitions of income that may be appropriate for various purposes," he said..

Is it possible for marketing firms to save lives? India based FinalMile has proven to me it is. Using what has become known as behavioral economics in the U.S., the company reduced train track related deaths by 75% in one city and was commissioned improve safety by India’s national railway system because of this. Moreover, other industries that might not usually used marketing are also employing FinalMile to campaign for initiatives involving safe driving and toilet use as opposed to public defecation. While this could be looked at as a progression toward more government propaganda, I think the initiatives that are currently being promoted are a good use of the government’s limited resources since health, wellness, and safety education is likely to be scarcer among India’s large poor population. In fact, I feel that it has just scratched the surface in terms of what it could do and that it should be used more regularly throughout the country. It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words and with India being a country with citizens who use many different languages and are often illiterate, graphic illustrations such as those used by FinalMile are probably the best way India’s government could reach the largest number of its constituents with the clearest message. Obviously, radio and television can be used to help shape its citizens behaviors are both require technology while FinalMile goes back to the tried and true permanent billboards that require nothing more than an observer’s attention.West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis has backed his decision to appoint Darren Fletcher as the new captain of the club.

"Brunty was asked to be captain a while back I think and he took it," said Pulis. "I don't think he has ever said he wanted to be captain or anything like that. He was asked and he took it.

Hiya T! Did you make it home? Hope you had an uneventful flight back.
I had a fun time trying two new restaurants today! My older sister and her beau and a special guest – my niece who is graduating from Harvard next month – had breakfast at Waypoint in Harvard Square. $1 oysters! So I answered the long-pondered question as to whether I can eat oyster for breakfast. Oh yeah!
This afternoon was quiet, then we went off to Highland Fried, the barbecue place in Inman Square. It was okay but I don’t need to go back.
I’m debating whether to go to work tomorrow… don’t have anything pressing so it is tempting.
Take care! Best of luck going back to work!

$1,708.00 – $2,500.00Fruit bowl beats the lockdown
Shree Padre, Kasargod
Kanakgiri Gangadharayya was certain he would earn a substantial profit this March by selling grapes. A farmer in Koppal district of Karnataka, he’d pruned his grapevines a little late last year, figuring it would help him reap a bountiful harvest. And he was right. His field was full of luscious grapes. Last year, he had earned Rs. 12 lakh. This year he thought his grapes would surely fetch him around Rs. 20 lakh.
Then came the lockdown on March 24. Gangadharayya’s dreams turned to dust. Suddenly there were no buyers and no transport. “I was in complete shock. I feared that my entire income would be wiped out,” he recalls.
Like him, hundreds of farmers in Koppal, a fertile fruit and vegetable growing district in Karnataka, were in a state of utter panic. They were staring at huge losses. Tonnes of pomegranates, bananas, grapes, papayas, guavas, figs and citrus fruits were ready for harvest. The fate of Koppal’s most famous fruit, the mango, especially the Kesar variety, hung in the balance.
What should they do? Gangadharayya and other farmers trooped off to meet the district collector (DC), Sunil Kumar, who advised them to get in touch with Krishna Ukkunda, deputy director, horticulture (DDH), of Koppal since three years.
Ukkunda and his department listened to the farmers’ woes and swung into action. Actually, they had been waiting for precisely such a moment. For the past three years the department had tried to persuade farmers to market their produce directly to consumers, adopt new technologies and set up storage facilities. They had even organized fairs and set up buyer-seller meets. But the farmers were indifferent and apathetic.
Now the tables had turned. Farmers were desperately calling officers of the horticulture department. “We have started harvesting, what should we do now?” they asked in anguish.
Ukkunda was sanguine. “The moment I heard about the lockdown, I felt happy. I saw this as a golden opportunity to finally realize my dream of linking farmers to consumers — something we have been advocating all along.”
Horticulture officers, the administration and the police quickly came together to ensure farmers sold their produce in the shortest timespan possible. Buyers were found, passes issued and storages installed. In the first month of the lockdown, the district succeeded in marketing about 23,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables thanks to the dedicated activism of the administration, led by the horticulture department.
This department has virtually turned into a ‘horticulture produce marketing control room’. Farmers and buyers contact them through the phone, WhatsApp and in person to get their work done.
HARVEST TIME
Although Koppal district gets only 600 mm of average annual rainfall, it is a productive fruit and vegetable growing region. Its main crop is a mango variety which grows on 2,900 hectares. Onion, too, is a major crop.
It has pomegranates growing on around 1,500 hectares, bananas on 1,100 hectares, papayas on 900 hectares, grapes on 780 hectares, guavas on 650 hectares and figs on 210 hectares. A variety of citrus fruits grow on 687 hectares.
When the lockdown began, most grape farmers in Koppal had completed harvesting their grapes. Papayas and watermelons were becoming ready to harvest. Mango is harvested in late April. Onions were waiting. Figs had just ripened.
Ukkunda advised grape farmers to invest quickly in raisin-making units. This way the grapes they couldn’t sell could be stored and sold later.
He helped Gangadharayya instal one such unit and assured him he would sanction the subsidy at the earliest. Gangadharayya got two raisin-making units of 10-tonne capacity each installed within 10 to 12 days during the lockdown.
Farmers like him were put in touch with grape buyers who were given passes quickly. As a result, Gangadharayya could sell about 30 tonnes of fresh grapes for Rs. 28 to Rs. 30 per kg. Prices were hovering around Rs. 35 per kg prior to the lockdown. He also converted his grapes into one tonne of raisins which he has stored in a cold storage to sell when prices rise. About 10 tonnes of his fruit went waste during the early days of the lockdown, he says, causing a loss of Rs. 3 lakh.
“But I have no regrets. If the DC and horticulture officers had not helped me, my entire crop this year would have rotted,” he says with obvious relief. “The DC was so kind. I didn’t need anyone’s help to meet him. He listened patiently and advised remedial measures.”
Bheemarao Deshpande, a grape farmer of Katagalli in Yalaburga taluk who owns five acres, was on the verge of harvesting grapes when the lockdown was declared. Last year, he had harvested 13 tonnes and earned Rs. 35 per kg.
He too approached the horticulture department in March-end. They helped him find buyers and advised him to also instal a raisin-making unit. With his family members and a few workers, he erected the unit. It cost him Rs. 1.7 lakh but he will get a subsidy of Rs. 90,000.
“There is an added advantage. After grape buyers take the best bunches we are stuck with leftovers. By converting the fruit into raisins we can now sell all that we grow,” says Deshpande.
He now has three tonnes of raisins parked in the cold storage. “I don’t have money in hand but my raisins are like a fixed deposit. I am happy that no portion of my crop has been wasted. All the credit for this crisis management has to go to the horticulture department,” he says gratefully. Koppal district now has around 20 raisin-making units.
HELPLINES FOR FARMERS
The horticulture department’s first crisis management step was to set up helplines for farmers and publicize them on social media. “Farmers who want to sell their vegetables and fruits can contact these officers between 7 am and 11 pm,” said their post. It had the phone numbers of the DDH, all senior assistant directors of the taluks, officers of the APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee) and of HOPCOMS (the state’s co-operative marketing society). The DDH’s office had two mobile vending vans lying idle. They had been specially converted by IIHR (Indian Institute of Horticulture Research) into vending vans to encourage farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers.
After a brainstorming session, the DC and DDH sent word to two young farmers. “We will provide you with two mobile vending vans and a pass to sell directly. Are you interested?” The farmers grabbed the opportunity. Since all fruit and vegetable shops were closed, they did brisk business and made Rs. 3,000 per day. Word spread.
Suresh Chowdaki, one of the farmers selling from the van, says he had grown a lot of brinjal, which he used to sell for Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 per kg. When the lockdown was declared he couldn’t find a buyer for even Rs. 2 per kg. Thanks to the van, he made between Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 15,000 per day. He sold all his brinjals and started buying vegetables to sell.
Thereafter, horticulture officers began cajoling farmers to sell their vegetables and fruits themselves to consumers and offered them passes. They pointed to Chowdaki as a shining example of success.
Finally, farmers decided to take the plunge. The officers were careful not to issue passes to two vehicles for the same area. Within a month the number of vending vehicles increased to 200. The administration, consumers, the police and farmers were happy. Citizens didn’t need to crowd around markets and social distancing was maintained.
Linganagouda Patil, a Senior Assistant Director Horticulture (SADH) from Gangavathi taluk, talked to the Bhajantris, a community who traditionally earned their livelihood by selling fruits in crowded places, to include vegetables by buying directly from farmers and hawking in residential areas. The Bhajantris were happy to do this, since the lockdown had rendered them jobless. To ensure their areas didn’t overlap they were allotted separate areas of operation. About 700 push carts and hundreds of two-wheelers loaded with fresh farm produce now spread across the district.
Confined within their homes, with eateries and bakeries closed, people readily bought fresh farm produce when it sailed past in front of their eyes. “You could say they became sort of captive consumers,” says Patil.
One month after the lockdown started, sales of horticultural products in the district came to 5,995 tonnes valued at Rs. 353,80,000. This means every day 200 tonnes of produce worth Rs. 11,79,333 were sold.
“Many farmers have realized that direct marketing is the key to prosperity. After deducting expenses they had 50 percent more returns,” said Ukkunda.
LIST OF BUYERS
The DDH’s office also compiled a list of traders who routinely bought vegetables and fruits. A database of 500 buyers of onion and 150 buyers of watermelon, papaya and other fruits and vegetables was put together and widely circulated among farmers.
“Thanks to the various fairs we organized in previous years, we could get contacts of buyers immediately. Details of crops that we have in the district were sent to them,” says DC Sunil Kumar.
“We worked overtime for a week to draw up this list,” recalled Ukkunda. “Previously, a few farmers wouldn’t divulge the details of buyers they had sold to. We made all such details available to farmers.”
This database of buyers proved very useful for farmers. Language barriers were overcome. In almost all farmer families there is a second generation that knows English. Local drivers of national permit lorries which were lying idle also know a few languages and they helped farmers converse with traders. There were also some 50 to 60 WhatsApp groups which shared information.
Passes were given without any red tape for transporting horticultural produce. “Farmers acknowledge that our district started this process long before other districts. We issued passes from our office and from the horticulture office. This helped farmers transport their produce not just within the district but to some other states as well,” said Sunil Kumar.
“Many times it was tough for farmers to come to our office to collect their passes. Police wouldn’t allow them. So we sent passes to the farmers. There were days we delivered 10 to 15 passes to their doorsteps,” said Ukkunda.
Nazeer Ahmad, SADH in Koppal, took personal interest in ensuring farmers got a fair price. When Hanumanthappa Katapura, a papaya farmer with three acres in Irkalagada, contacted him in alarm, he quickly put him in touch with a buyer in Chitradurg who agreed to buy his papayas at Rs. 7 per kg.
However, since temples were closed and all festivals cancelled he couldn’t offload the Crossandra flowers he had grown on one acre. All the floriculturists in the district underwent losses.
“Every day we received 20 to 25 phone calls from farmers. Mostly they were worried about selling their produce,” said Ahmad. “When a farmer’s problem was redressed, it was posted on WhatsApp with a picture. We try to link farmers with buyers and support them in selling. We successfully sent fruits and vegetables to other districts and states. We sent papaya to Delhi. Not more than 10 to 15 percent of the district’s horticultural produce might have gone to waste. We started direct marketing to consumers and then the other districts followed.”
ROLE OF COLD STORAGES
The lockdown underlined the critical role cold storages play in the lives of farmers. There were four in Koppal. The government-owned one in Kushtangi taluk could store 500 tonnes. The other three were privately owned and their total capacity was 450 tonnes. All were closed.
Till the lockdown struck, the cold storage owners used to store fruits and vegetables from other districts and sell when prices were remunerative in the off-season.
The horticulture department struck a deal with them. If they helped local farmers they would be permitted to be open so long as they observed safety rules. The storage owners readily agreed.
Ramesh K Bannigol, a banana farmer, has a cold storage of a capacity of seven tonnes. He used to sell five to six tonnes of bananas per day. He would buy bunches of raw bananas for Rs. 5 per kg and sell them after ripening for Rs. 8 a kg. “During the lockdown I bought about 100 tonnes of bananas from farmers and 30 to 40 tonnes of watermelon. If the officers hadn’t taken an interest in reopening my unit, it would have been closed even now and I would have incurred considerable losses.”
Farmers also benefited from impromptu onion storages. Onions were selling for Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,600 per quintal but when the lockdown was imposed prices crashed.
Horticulture officers had often tried to persuade onion farmers to construct storages so that they wouldn’t have to sell immediately after harvesting. Demos were also arranged but the farmers showed no interest.
Finally, during the lockdown, the onion farmers decided to opt for it. Six farmers of Odaganala village took a welding unit owner to see how such a storage unit was fabricated and then make a similar one for them. One of the farmers, Mahantha Gowda Mali Patil, has been cultivating onions on his six-acre plot for decades. He spent Rs. 1,30,000 on making a storage unit with a capacity of 25 tonnes. He will get a subsidy of Rs. 85,000 from the department.
“I believe we can store onions for four or five months in this unit. We sold some stock in between but six of us now have a stock of 100 tonnes. If we hadn't acted quickly none of our crops would have been saved,” he said.
His case encouraged other onion farmers to get similar storage units constructed. “Our neighbouring village, Handrala, is far ahead in onion cultivation. They have about 5,600 acres under onion cultivation. They seem to have grown onions everywhere. Even a farmer with one hectare of onion is constructing a storage unit to augment his income,” remarked Patil.
“During difficult times, horticulture officers have voluntarily worked overtime to solve our problems. Generally, to get any subsidy sanctioned under any scheme, one has to chase officers. But in our case, it is the officers who prevailed on us to implement all this. They actually tried to compel us,” said Patil.
Subrahmanya of Gunnala village in Yalaburga taluk grew figs on 18 acres. This fruit has the shortest shelf life. It can survive just one or two days after being harvested. When the lockdown began, Subrahmanya lost `4 lakh worth of figs because the fruit dried up since harvesting was delayed.
The department linked fig farmers to local sellers who have been buying one to one and a half tonnes every day for Rs. 24 per kg instead of Rs. 35 which was the earlier price.
“We harvest about five to six tonnes of crop every day. We are ready to send our figs to other districts and states. The officers are also ready to issue passes. Unfortunately, the centres which regularly buy from us are closed so we have no choice,” said Subrahmanya who is planning to put up a fig drying unit next year.
MANGO’S RISE
The horticulture department’s Mango Fair was an annual affair, held just before the monsoon. Watermelon, grape, pomegranate and musk melon fairs were also held during their peak season. The Mango Fair often went on for over a week and used to net a turnover of Rs. 1 crore.
Mango is Koppal’s main crop, grown on more than 3,000 hectares. Since this year was a rest year in a three-year cycle, farmers feared they would get only 10,000 tonnes or one-third of their regular output. The second blow was that the Mango Fair would not be held this year. So marketing opportunities would be lost.
Moved by the disappointment of the farmers, the horticulture department ideated and arrived at a solution. Proposals for branding the Koppal Mango had been in the air for quite some time. This was the best time to go ahead with it, it was decided.
The department approached the Karnataka State Mango Development and Marketing Board and requested financial help to produce cardboard boxes. The board obliged and 10,000 boxes arrived at Koppal. Each box costs Rs. 29 and can hold 2.5 kg of mangoes, priced at Rs. 250.
Keeping social distancing in mind, the department decentralized mango marketing. First, it selected farmers with the best mangoes and trained them in harvesting and post-harvesting practices. Fruits were graded into A, B and C categories. The best Kesar, Apoos and Beneshan varieties were to be sold under the brand name of ‘Koppal Mango’, in boxes.
Ten farmers grow these varieties. Their names and telephone numbers were listed on a handbill and circulated through social media. Four vans directly sold boxes of Koppal Mango in the city and through doorstep delivery. In a week, about 1,500 boxes were sold.
Three years after the department launched the annual Mango Fair, the Kesar variety began to rise in popularity. An exporter from northern India arrived to assess its worth. The fruit ripens in Koppal by end-April whereas in Gujarat, the prime home of Kesar mangoes, it ripens only by the second week of July. The exporter quickly signed up with a plantation to buy Kesar mangoes worth Rs. 2 lakh. Other exporters followed and now a few farmers are earning Rs. 10 lakh each by selling mangoes to them after signing an agreement.
Out of 3,000 hectares, the Kesar variety is grown on about 1,200. Because of the premium it fetches it is becoming the preferred choice of farmers.
The problem was getting good quality planting material. It was available in different areas of the district. To resolve this problem, the department under Ukkunda organized a 10-day Sasya Santhe or plant market where Rs. 2 lakh worth of plants were sold.
“For our first Mango Fair, we had to compel farmers to participate. But when they saw several varieties of mangoes and managed to sell theirs at good prices, they got interested,” said Ukkunda. After that, whenever the department announced the date of the Mango Fair, farmers would immediately book stalls.
“Out of 850 mango farmers, more than 100 have understood the advantages of marketing directly. Three years ago, none of them knew about this concept,’ said Ukkunda.
“The lockdown crisis has made farmers understand that raisin-making and onion storage are essential for them to withstand the challenges they face in the market,” said Ukkunda. “Figs are an example. Farmers grow them on a big scale. But it is the farmers who dehydrate and sell figs who earn much more. They have also understood that direct marketing is the key to success.”
The time is ripe for Koppal’s farmers to organize themselves into a farmer-producer company or a cooperative society. Delay might dampen the tempo and enthusiasm generated during this period.

This is an extra-ordinary and deeply inspiring story... Of Shri Krishna Ukkunda. What change one Individual can bring about.....Salam and Namaskar to this officer whose Vision, Passion and Investment into the wellbeing of his farmer friends led him to inspire his entire team to ideate, conceptualise and execute so many schemes to help the farmers sell their crop in this unprecedented circumstances and prevent them from sliding into poverty. From Vending vans to raisin making units to storage units! Absolutely amazing. I do hope this story is read and emulated by many officers across the country to help farmers. In our entire economy, farming is the only business where the producer remains poor while everyone else benefits. This story shatters that reality! Thank you Sir for standing by your farmers and helping them to lead a life of dignity!

This shows how amazingly well a system can work to alleviate poverty and bring dignity if officers so want. If only there were more officials who genuinely want to bring hope and joy and livelihoods, we could become a strong countryThe Guilford County Board of Education deserves to be congratulated. While the salaries of other senior government executives in the area are rising at alarming rates, the Guilford County Schools superintendent hasn’t had a significant raise in 10 years.
Much of the credit for that salary cap goes to former Guilford County School Superintendent Mo Green, who refused to accept a raise from 2008 to 2015 when he was the Guilford County Schools superintendent. There aren’t many people out there who turn down raises from their boss every year but Green did. He could have easily been making $300,000 when he left, but in 2015 he was being paid $250,000 a year – the same as he was when he arrived in 2008.
The school board gets credit for not raising the salary since 2015.
Since the superintendent wasn’t getting raises, the salaries for other senior staff have been kept in line. Greensboro and Guilford County could learn a lesson. When the executive team gets higher raises than the rank and file year after year, it increases the disparity between those at the top of the salary heap and those at the bottom.
Guilford County School Superintendent Sharon Contreras did receive a raise of $1,008. In 2017, Contreras was being paid $250,000, and this year she is being paid $251,008. Chief of Staff Nora Carr received the same raise from $157,624 in 2017 to $158,632 in 2018. Number three on the list, Shirley Morrison, the chief human resources officer, is being paid $156,006 this year and in 2017 her salary was $154,998.
Chief Financial Officer Angela Henry moved up from ninth on the list in 2017 at $138,892 to fourth on the list in 2018 at $154,009.
The highest paid principal is Rodney Wilds, the principal at James B. Dudley High School, who is being paid $126,927, and in 2017 his salary was $122,932.
The second highest paid principal is Ralph Kitley at Northwest Guilford High School, whose salary is $122,303; in 2017, Kitley was paid $117,036.
In the North Carolina budget passed by the Republican legislature over Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto, principals will receive an average raise of 6.9 percent and teachers an average raise of 6.5 percent.
The highest paid teacher on the 2018 salary list is Frank Shearin, who is a Navy Junior ROTC instructor and is paid $83,684. And the highest paid non-ROTC teacher is Brenda Cox with a salary of $78,035.

Women of the Wall negotiated officially recognizing the prayer site as mixed-gender.
The Government of Israel has given its seal of approval to expand the non-orthodox and mixed gender prayer section located at the Jerusalem's Western Wall. The new area, known as Azarat Yisrael, is scheduled to be positioned at the southernmost corner of the Western Wall beneath Robinson's Arch. It has been often used for the purpose of egalitarian prayer services. American Jews, in particular, are celebrating this development.
The Western Wall is considered the second holiest site in the Jewish religion after Temple Mount. It is an ancient architecture of second Jewish Temple. Romans destroyed the temple in 66 CE. The decision will result in, among many other things, allowing women to read a Torah scroll. In a joint statement, the Jewish Federations of North America and Reform and Conservative movements said in a new statement that the new space is a critical, dramatic and unprecedented acknowledgment by Israel that the holy site must incorporate traditions of both Reform and Masorti or Conservative streams where both sexes pray together.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, were at the forefront of talks when it came to negotiating the officially recognized mixed gender space. He was urged to do so by Women of the Wall, a feminist prayer group and U.S. Jews belonging to non-Orthodox denominations.
The Orthodox establishment of Israel has marginalized both the groups. The Israeli government gives no recognition to authority of the Reform and Conservative rabbis along with their institutions. They only get nominal funding.
@NCJW #Israel dec. Western Wall Huge victory 4 relig tolerance & gender equality @jtanews
— Penny Schwartz (@PennySchwartz) January 31, 2016
As per agreement, the part governmental Jewish Agency and the Israeli Government will offer the majority of $8.8 million budget spread over a period of two years. The soon to be bigger prayer space will come under the joint administration of a new body including Conservative and Reform movements and Women of the Wall. It will be headed by the chairman of the Jewish agency. According to all parties, the deal was compulsory as the main, northern part of the Western wall was overseen by ultra-Orthodox religious bodies. They refuse everything and accept only strictest interpretation of the Jewish law.
The group which calls itself Women of the Wall, and who fights for the right to pray at the holiest accessible site in Judaism, welcomed the decision of the cabinet. It said that through this action, the state has acknowledged autonomy and full equality at the Wall.

Despite the occupation of Austria by Allied forces after the Second World War, the country, remaining faithful to the legacy of the pan-European idea of the interwar period and favoured by its geographical location, aspired to play a central role in the organisation of post-war Europe and in the European integration process. In 1948, although part of the country was still occupied by the Soviet Union, Austria became a member of the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC). The signing of the State Treaty in 1955 enabled Austria to regain its independence, but its commitment to securing a permanent neutral status did not preclude its participation in other European organisations. Accordingly, Austria became a member of the Council of Europe in 1956 and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960.
However, the focus of this research corpus is Austria’s relationship with the European Communities. In 1956, Austria signed a customs agreement with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). During the 1960s, negotiations were held with a view to securing an economic agreement between Austria and the European Economic Community (EEC). These negotiations successfully led to the signing of a free trade agreement with the EEC in 1972. In 1989, Austria officially applied for accession to the European Communities, and six years later, in 1995, the country became a Member State of the European Union.
The research corpus on ‘Austria and the European integration process’ offers a wealth of varied resources concerning Austria’s accession and the country’s participation in the various European organisations. This corpus, which is primarily aimed at the research community, has been developed in association with Thomas Angerer, Assistant Professor in the Department of History at the University of Vienna, and Michael Gehler, Professor in the Department of History at the University of Hildesheim, who has written an explanatory note introducing the corpus, and with the backing of the Austrian National Library. The corpus also includes suggestions for further reading and a chronology of events.Sorry, but there are currently no Akita puppies for sale in Indianapolis, Indiana that matched your search.

Jerk is a style of cooking native to Jamaica, in which meat is dry-rubbed or wet marinated with a hot spice mixture called Jamaican jerk spice. Growing up in South Florida we had access to authentic Jamaican, Cuban and other Island foods, and I’ve worked hard to accurately replicate those flavors. It is quite spicy, as Jerk is supposed to be, but loaded with all the exotic flavors needed to really satisfy. It’s the perfect Cooking/Dipping Sauce for almost any food.

Do you dream of having long, healthy hair? Vegetable oils are the perfect care for this. We present you the best to promote hair growth.
Vegetable oils are unparalleled natural treatments to stimulate growth. You certainly know it thanks to the many articles that we write for you on the subject of natural care, vegetable oil is a very good option for those who want to take care of their hair naturally by following grandmother's advice as simple as effective. In an oil bath to intensely nourish dry hair, applied to strands as a mask before shampooing to repair brittle hair, or as a touch of nutrition at the rate of a few drops deposited on the lengths and ends (at the instead of a serum) to avoid split ends: each use reveals certain benefits for the hair. But it is also possible to make it play the extensions on the scalp so that the vegetable oil accelerates hair growth (or slows down hair loss and promotes regrowth in the event of seasonal or reaction hair loss due to stress or fatigue...).
It is definitely a multi-functional treatment that does not lack the beauty of our hair. Which vegetable oils to bet on to gain precious centimeters in length quickly? We've made a list of the best ways to care for your hair at home and show off XXL lengths easily.
It is arguably the best-known vegetable oil for hair care, and for good reason. Castor oil or castor oil of its English name (which is confusing because it has nothing to do with the rodent), is indeed rich in minerals and essential fatty acids which give it excellent nourishing and repairing properties. and strengthening. In particular, it contains ricinoleic acid, an omega 9 that is unique to this oil. Thanks to all this, it maintains an optimal supply of nutrients to the hair bulbs and is therefore extremely effective when it comes to countering hair loss or stimulating hair growth to have long hair quickly.
Note, however: given the fairly viscous texture of castor oil, do not hesitate to mix it with another more fluid oil (such as jojoba oil or nourishing coconut oil for example which will do your hair good) to make it easier to use.
Very nourishing thanks to its richness in essential fatty acids (omega 3, 6, and 9), this oil suitable for the care of all types of hair is particularly interesting for their growth because it is a natural veinotonic. In short, it strengthens the walls of the veins and stimulates blood circulation, which also helps mustard oil to promote a good supply of nutrients to the scalp like castor oil. The secret to seeing your lengths stretch again and again...
Note: we also advise you to dilute mustard oil in another more neutral vegetable oil such as jojoba, olive, or coconut before applying it to your scalp at home, not because it is viscous but because it may be a bit irritating to the skin on your scalp. Beware of overheating at the level of the skull if you massage it pure!
Also known as black cumin oil or Pharaoh's oil, black cumin oil (an aromatic plant with blue flowers) is less known than the other two oils above but it is just as effective in promoting growth. hair. Rich in fatty acids, oleic acid, palmitic acid, and vitamin E, black seed oil reveals powerful antioxidant properties and together strengthens hair follicles and lengths. It is therefore a ready-made answer to slow down hair loss or accelerate the growth of your locks.
Concentrated in antioxidant vitamin E and essential fatty acids (Omega 3, 6, 7, and 9) which give it nourishing properties very useful for dry hair that it cares for and softens, and to nourish damaged ends, vegetable oil avocado also contains vitamins A, B, and K which strengthen the hair fiber and vitamin D which helps to generate new hair follicles. It is therefore a perfectly natural product to boost growth!
Derived from the seeds of an herbaceous plant which is rather well known in the culinary field, fenugreek oil is also used in cosmetics for the skin and hair. Rich in fatty acids (omega-6, omega-9), minerals (iron, magnesium, calcium), vitamins (A, B1, and C), and antioxidants, this oil nourishes and strengthens the hair. It is thus an ideal response in the event of seasonal hair loss (it readily replaces anti-hair loss hair products) and therefore also a perfect active ingredient to stimulate growth.
Original and little known in the hair industry, onion oil is also one of the most formidable natural treatments for accelerating hair growth. It is thanks to its high sulfur content (a mineral that helps synthesize essential amino acids for hair) that it owes its growth properties. And since it also has nourishing and moisturizing virtues, it strengthens the hair so that it stays on top of its form until the ends as it grows. Bonus: naturally antifungal, it is sometimes the ideal answer to dandruff problems. It is then sufficient to apply it to the skin of the skull as an anti-dandruff serum.
Note: although its onion smell can scald some, it quickly disappears after shampooing.
Opt for safe products by preferably choosing an organic oil that does not contain chemicals.
favor mechanically cold-pressed oils without recourse to other processes to ensure the quality of your product.
Don't hesitate to add a few drops of essential oils to your oil to boost its effects even further.
Apply a small amount of the product (pure oil or a mixture of oils and essential oils if necessary) on your scalp by massaging it in circles with your fingertips before shampooing. Leave on for a few minutes (even if it means extending the treatment over the lengths in a hair bath) then shampoo.
The massage is just as important as the product chosen because it promotes good blood circulation which increases the effects of the oil on the growth tenfold.Hundred Suns is a trio featuring Cory Brandan (Norma Jean), Ryan Leger (Every Time I Die) and Chris LeMasters (Dead & Divine).

*photo: Jay Perry Quds Force is one of the most effective military forces in the Middle East, a far cry from the undisciplined and disorganized Iraqi forces that fled from a much smaller ISIS force in Mosul. One former CIA officer called Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani “the single most powerful operative in the Middle East today.”:
The al Qaeda affiliated ISIS considers Shias heretics who deserve to be killed, and is taking forth its campaign to liberate Iraq from what it sees as Shia domination; the group has said it will destroy Shia shrines along the way, stoking fears in Tehran of an attack on Shia Islam’s holiest sites, Najaf and Karbala.
Social media sites have quoted Suleimani saying if ISIS destroys the holy shrines, it will face Iran’s ire. Asked what the manifestation of that rage will be, the former Iranian diplomat laughed nervously. “They [ISIS] know that we’re not kidding around, so we shouldn’t worry about them doing anything stupid. And if they’re foolish enough to even approach the shrines, they have to be prepared for anything.” The diplomat paused. “Battles, attacks, raids, massacre. All the options will be on the table.”
Ali Hashem notes that Iranian involvement might be as much about Syria as it is about Iraq:.About PSCU

Daily Telegraph proprietor that appears in the current edition
of Spear's Wealth Management Survey magazine..These Taco Tortilla Stacks have been made in our family for years! Assemble them ahead of time then serve them as a quick snack for a crowd. The cheesy layers and Mexican flavors make these tortilla stacks totally irresistible.
Can’t get enough cheese? This Instant Pot Queso needs a place on your party menu!
Why this Recipe is Best
- Taco Tortilla Stacks take 5 minutes to put together. Then you let them chill in the fridge until you’re ready to eat.
- No stove or oven is needed for this recipe. Even the kids can help make these!
- Serve them as a party ready appetizer, or assemble a batch for a quick lunch.
These check all the boxes: easy, exciting, and crowd pleasingly delicious!
Ingredient Notes
Flour tortillas. The “taco” tortillas that are 6 inches in diameter work best. If you use larger tortillas you won’t have enough filling to cover all of them.
Taco seasoning. You can use the store bought packets but I strongly recommend making some Homemade Taco Seasoning! You’ll have enough to use in this recipe AND plenty leftover for seasoning taco meat too.
Assembly
First, mix together the cream cheese filling.
Place one tortilla on a cutting board or clean surface. Spread a generous amount of the cream cheese mixture on top.
Top with another tortilla. Repeat three more times. You’ll have a total of 4 tortillas topped with the cream cheese mixture. Add a final tortilla on top.
Wrap the stack in foil and chill for at least 1 hour. When you’re ready to eat, cut the stack into 8 triangles.
Serve with a side of your favorite salsa for dipping.
Tips and Tricks
- Dipping ideas: these taco stacks are tasty with all kinds of salsas. Give our Avocado Salsa or Tomatillo Salsa Verde recipes a try with these. They are also wonderful dipped in Guacamole or Jalapeno Spinach Queso!
- Storing: You can assemble taco tortilla stacks up to 1 day in advance. Keep the stack wrapped tightly in foil until ready to cut and serve.
- Cream cheese: Make sure to let the cream cheese soften on the counter for a few minutes. This makes it easier to blend with the other ingredients.
Recipe FAQs
I don’t recommend using corn tortillas in this recipe. They crumble and break much more easily, so your stacks are likely to fall apart.
No need to do anything to the tortillas! We always just open up the package, add the filling and stack!
Turn Taco Tortilla Stacks into a complete meal by adding a few side dishes. For a quick lunch you could serve them with some sliced veggies or fruit. Perfect for a packed lunch!
At dinner time, round out your taco stacks with a side of Mexican Street Corn Salad and some Cilantro Lime Rice.
Low fat cream cheese can definitely be used if you like! My family always prefers the rich creaminess of regular cream cheese in this dish.
Some family recipes never go out of style! When you know how to make Taco Tortilla Stacks this good, you’ll always be ready to feed a hungry crowd.

So, It’s important to have all information about your customer available at one place in order to maintain a good buyer-seller relationship. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems are designed to optimize your business processes with the participation of your current and potential customers. This software automates the various stages of the customer relationship (pre-sales, sales, marketing, after-sales service).
Among the other advantages of Customer Relationship Management CRM is that they pay for themselves quickly through added value, it participates in the digital transformation of businesses and it can be used for any business size.
You can easily manage your customers with CRM’s many benefits, some of which are outlined below:
One of the most significant advantages of CRMs is their ability to master customer relationships, as they are long considered its primary purpose. With a few clicks, you will be able to access all historical information regarding your exchanges carried out with relevant clients: number of transactions, number of calls, proposals sent out, minutes of meetings, and so on. Using this tool, you can strengthen your customer relationship for a better customer experience.
Having a complete data history of a customer or a buyer’s journey is a crucial part of business strategy. In this way, we can identify customers’ behavior and their mindset about pursuing products. Thus, we can offer them other products and services based on their needs.
Whenever a company uses a standardized and central CRM solution, all departments can access standardized information of client pursuing – from sales, to marketing, to customer service, to management.
As part of your information flow, it actively communicates with all your employees in a passive way. In addition, it centralizes data to ensure better internal organization of different works. This can track, for example, the development of a client’s case in official forms and how much time the company has spent on it. The interesting fact is that as a boss or supervisor, you do not need to ask your associates for his updates on different proposals as long as you have an active internet connection!
You need to log into the CRM system and go to your dashboard and relevant reports; and that’s it! You will subsequently have access to all your necessary information about a particular employee. By utilizing this service, you save more time and become more productive both at work and home since you can access it remotely.
The use of CRM software is recognized for its effectiveness and efficiency. CRM is a powerful business application that offers significant flexibility but doesn’t require a significant investment. In addition, its profitability is immediate since it will improve sales productivity, increase sales, and attract new customers at the same time.
It acts as an efficient project management tool and does many benefits to the business. For example, it makes it easier to measure performances by tracking modules and therefore reduces processing time; as a result, lead scoring becomes more productive and brings more supervision at the same time.
Keeping an existing customer costs five times less than attracting a new customer. Customers have different wishes, needs, and potential that require individual measures.
A CRM can help you retain your customer by taking different customer centric actions proactively, by ensuring that you have a better understanding of your customers. So, it is a fundamental requirement that all sales companies have CRM software to track their sales. Doing so creates a platform to understand consumer purchasing behavior, defines areas for improvement, ensures products selling more, and opens up the horizon for new opportunities and future growth.
By using CRM software, you can now know your customer’s tastes and act accordingly. You now have a set of targets for your products for a particular period. As a result, you are now aware of your customer’s desire and can offer it to them.
No company wants their employees to burn their office time in repetitive and unproductive works. Here, CRM enables the automation of specific processes and routine tasks, and thus employees need not to do repetitive tasks. It reduces the manual inputs which used to be done through pen and paper. Now through automation, time-consuming and hard-to-get information is readily available within a click. As a result, employees can focus on more strategically important and productive tasks.
This software will help you to improve your business communication. Sharing customer information across different departments is one of the most important benefits of CRM. As a result, this will help you to work as a team and optimize your customer experience. Also, each employee can answer customers’ questions in an aligned format about what’s happening with their products and services. Overall, it helps to increase the efficiency of the organization and improves information sharing between related departments.
One of the advantages of CRM is that it can optimize and automate the company’s internal processes. Using this system, managers will be notified about when it is time to make an important call, or when an active task is coming to an end. All actions are recorded in the CRM database, and the employees calendars are updated as well. This system is made in such a way that it will show a new set of tasks whenever someone completes a particular stage. Moreover, it comes with templates to automate your tasks, so you can just pick one that’s right for you.
Having a centralized location for all of your clients gives you a chance to improve your company’s marketing strategy. You now know what your clients are looking for; thus, analyzing customer data and identifying their needs. As a result, it’s easier to develop a cross-selling and up-selling strategy to sell your products and services. Again, as you know who your target customers are and their requirements, you can now do segmented marketing campaigns and promotional campaigns online and offline for different industries. These efforts will indeed have an impact and boost your marketing strategy.
Using a CRM in your organization can greatly improve the efficiency of your sales processes. You are more likely to avoid losing a potential opportunity if you use this solution, while you can manage your customer database better. Ultimately integrating CRM into an organization’s business processes, companies can effectively gather, analyze, and process information related to their customers and prospects in order to increase sales and customer satisfaction.
With all the advantages of Customer Relationship Management CRM, implementing it for your business is definitely a value-added step.

On September 25, 2020, the NIAID training office hosted a graduate school panel discussion to cap off its intensive Applying to Graduate School Workshop. The panelists included Victoria Avanzato (M.D./Ph.D. OxCam student), Portia Gough, Ph.D. (NIAID postdoctoral fellow), Rodrigo Matus Nicodemos (NIAID Ph.D. student), Adam Nock, Ph.D. (NIAID postdoctoral fellow), and Juan Pablo Ruiz Villalobos, D.Phil (postdoctoral fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Madison).
The panelists answered questions ranging from how to ask a potential PI about the funding situation to answering tough interview questions. Through their answers and subsequent discussion, a common message shone through — no two people are the same and no two graduate school journeys will be the same. This message was further highlighted by the diversity of the panelists’ own experiences and paths through gaining their degrees. Some participated in the NIH Oxford Cambridge Scholars (OxCam) Program while others earned their Ph.D.s through the NIH Graduate Program Partnership.
The panelists urged attendees to take time to look at all of their options, not only to determine what they value but to find the program that is the best fit. Reflecting on their own graduate experience, they emphasized the importance of looking outside of the lab. Giving weight to things like geographical location and city versus suburban life are not superficial considerations. In addition, finding a lab that will allow you the time to continue personal pursuits and hobbies is also paramount. As Avanzato put it, “don’t give up what makes you you.”
In line with finding the best fit for you, the panelists also emphasized the importance of finding a program and school that would support you both academically and mentally. Dr. Ruiz Villalobos advised attendees to investigate programs’ demographics with regards to attrition rates and graduation rates to gain insight into whether there is institutional support for underrepresented students in STEM. I personally appreciated how panelists did not shy away from the reality that graduate school can be taxing on a person, both physically and mentally, and having support systems are vital.
By the end of the hour, the panelists had empowered attendees to find the path and fit best for them, drawing on the panelists’ own unique journeys and successes.

Time Out says
Theater review by Adam Feldman
“I don’t do labels,” says Trey (the impressive Will Brittain),. In Joshua Harmon’s family dramedy Skintight, nakedly inspired by the 2010 relationship between Calvin Klein and sometime porn model Nick Gruber, the gentleman in question is Elliot Isaac (Jack Wetherall), a megarich clothing designer who has come out swinging late in his life. Trey is not entirely averse to labels, after all: His underwear has Elliot’s name on the waistband.
Their relationship mortifies Elliot’s daughter, Jodi (an amusingly self-absorbed Idina Menzel), who is reeling from her ex-husband’s marriage to a younger woman; meanwhile, it both frustrates and titillates her gay son, Benji (the nicely wistful Eli Gelb), who is Trey’s age but plaintive and plain. As in Bad Jews and Significant Other, Harmon gets good mileage out of Jewish anxiety and discomfort; he is not afraid to make his main characters intensely abrasive. And Daniel Aukin’s staging gets laughs where it should, making excellent comic use of the brutal gray stairway (reminiscent of the one in Klein’s 1980s Obsession ad) at the center of Lauren Helpern’s sternly elegant set. But the play is so tightly corseted by its central concern—”What is so great about hot?”—that its characters don’t have enough room to breathe. It makes good points, but as a human story, it seldom digs beyond skin-deep.
Laura Pels Theatre (Off Broadway). By Joshua Harmon. Directed by Daniel Aukin. With Idina Menzel, Jack Wetherall, Will Brittain, Eli Gelb. Running time: 2hrs 15mins. One intermission.

FRAME SIZE FOR EYEGLASSES - HOME PAGE
Keywords: Eyeglasses, Glasses, Spectacles, Glasses frames, Spectacles frames, specs, chasma, eyeglasses frames, chasma frames Choosing the best-ever eyeglasses (chasma) frames could be a daunting process if you are unsure about what size suits you, and how to find the optimum frame size. In spectacles, there are four key dimensions that ought to be considered before making purchase decisions. Let us now help you choose the perfect size spectacles frames that suit your face, with a few pointers and tips.
Frame Measurements
The easiest way is to read the code on your old chasma frames, or measure the following distances using a ruler-
- 1) Eye Size- Eye size refers to the width (in millimeter) of one of the lenses, using the farthest points on both sides of the lens. Usually, the eye size lies in the range of 40 to 60 mm. If the eye size is less than 50 mm, small-sized glasses frames will work well for you. In case the eye size is between 51 mm and 54 mm, you can opt for a medium-sized chasma. If your eye size is more than 55 mm, we recommend you choose large-sized eyeglass frames.
- 2) Bridge Size- Bridge size refers to the distance between the two lenses, measured at the closest point between them.
- 3) Temple Length- The length of the temple is measured from one end of the temple to another, including the bend.
- 4) B Length- B length is the height (in millimeter) of the lens of the glasses. It is measured from the tip of the lens aperture to the bottom of the lens aperture. This parameter is usually ignored, except in cases of multi-focal or progressive lenses.
- 5) Total frame width- The total frame width can be gauged by using a ruler to measure the distance from one end of your glasses to the other.
Face Measurements
Before considering the frame sizes of the specs, you can measure the size of your face and find the perfect fit. Here's how - In front of a mirror, hold a ruler horizontally across your face. Measure the distance between the left and right sides of your face, across the temples, in inches. If your face size is less than 4.5 inches, a small-framed chasma would look good on you. If your face size lies between 4.5 and 5.75 inches, we are sure that eyeglasses with a medium frame will suit you well. If your face size is more than 6 inches, we recommend large frame sizes.city council representing Ward 3 — breaking the long-held tradition of an all-white city council.
The late Honourable Lincoln Alexander was the first African Canadian to break the colour barrier in federal politics. The year was 1968 and there were no other blacks running for office. But Alexander, who would later become known as Hamilton’s favourite son, “picked up the ball and ran with it.” He ran for the Conservative party and made history when he won and soon became the first African Canadian to represent Hamilton in any political leadership role. Alexander held the seat until 1980 when he stepped down and became chair of the Ontario Workers’ Compensation Board and later made history again when he was appointed in 1985 as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, the first African Canadian to serve in this important role.
It’s worth noting that Sandi Bell, an African Canadian woman was elected to the Hamilton public school board in 1975.
Forty-six years after Lincoln Alexander was first elected, history is once again being made as Matthew Green is sworn into office next week, taking his rightful place at the city’s decision-making table. He will become the first elected black councillor in the city’s 168-year history.

We are EMS
EMS stands for Electro Medical Systems, the market leader in prevention, inventor of the original technologies PIEZON® NO PAIN as well as AIRFLOW® and pioneer of modern biofilm management, the Guided Biofilm Therapy (GBT).
With unique ideas, passion and know-how, Bernd Bühner and Pierre Mabille founded their company in the Swiss Vallée de Joux in 1981. Since then, EMS has developed into one of the world's most successful dental companies with a focus on innovation, precision, ergonomics, design and quality for the benefit of patients and clinicians.
The first instruments, including the piezoceramic ultrasonic device PIEZON® NO PAIN, were manufactured by EMS at the renowned watch manufacturer Jaeger-LeCoultre.
In 1982, EMS presented the AIRFLOW® and changed oral prevention forever. Following the market introduction of the AIRFLOW® Prophylaxis Master in 2017, EMS introduced the new and more gentle AIRFLOW® MAX handpiece in 2020. With the patented Laminar AIRFLOW® Technology it strongly reduces aerosols. Thanks to good suction technology, AIR-FLOWING® has become even safer and more convenient in times of COVID. For more sustainability, the erythritol-based AIRFLOW® PLUS powder is available in a high-quality aluminum bottle that can be used as a drinking bottle after using up the powder.
GBT – the Game Changer
With GBT, EMS has redefined oral prophylaxis. It is a true game changer for the gentle and complete removal of oral biofilm - according to a clinically comprehensively documented protocol. In eight steps, patients are diagnosed, motivated with the aid of systematic disclosure, and the biofilm is removed completely and painlessly both supra- and subgingivally with the original EMS technologies.Pumping Waves, High Scores at Burton Automotive Pro
MERERWETHER, NSW, AUSTRALIA – Thursday, February 19, 2015
A field that started with 144 surfers has been reduced to just 16 at the World Surf League (WSL) Qualifying Series men’s Burton Automotive Pro QS6000 – the Burton Automotive Women’s Classic was off for the day. The athletes were treated to 4-to-6 foot clean peaks producing long lefts and rights, the perfect platform for exciting action in the water.
Willian Cardoso (BRA) put on a dominant performance in his Round 4 win over Joel Parkinson (AUS), who advanced in 2nd position, while Cardoso’s countryman Ian Gouveia (BRA) was eliminated in 3rd. Cardoso posted excellent scores by producing some of the most powerful turns of the event thus far.
“I’m stoked to beat Parko (Joel Parkinson) and Ian (Gouveia) – they’ve been ripping!” Cardoso said. “That was my first heat where I’ve really found some great scores. I’ve had a tough time in the earlier heats trying to find the right waves and it all came together for me in that one.”
Parkinson was on the ropes from the start of the heat, picking waves that didn’t quite allow him to open up with his trademark smooth carves. With 90 seconds left on the clock Parko unloaded two massive hacks to score a 8.23 and jump from 3rd to 2nd place.
“I was probably frothing a bit too hard at the start,” Parkinson said. “It was a frustrating heat, but I guess it doesn’t matter if you get two scores at the start or the end, just as long as you get them. When Willian (Cardoso) is on the best waves he’s really hard to beat.”
Keanu Asing (HAW) is preparing for his rookie season on the Samsung Galaxy WSL Championship Tour (CT). After an uncharacteristically early exit at the last QS6000 event, he’s managed to find his form at the Burton Automotive Pro to advance to the final 16 and the first man-on-man round of the event.
“Manly didn’t go my way and my preparation was terrible so I learned some lessons,” Asing said. “Now I’m working harder and trying to better myself at least one percent each day and I’m starting to gain some momentum. It’s still really surreal that I have qualified for the CT – it’s been a dream since I started surfing which has been my whole life.”
Jack Freestone (AUS) put on a show in Round 4 – winning the heat by combining inverted aerials and stylish wraps. Freestone also made the final 16 in the last QS in Manly but was eliminated in Round 5 by event winner Kolohe Andino (USA) in one of the most exciting heats of the event.
“The ball is starting to roll and I’m feeling much more confident in my surfing,” Freestone said. “This is already the best result I’ve ever gotten at this event and I’m still going which is a good feeling. It was hard to walk away from that loss to Kolohe (Andino) because I feel like I was surfing well in that heat, but that happens. I’ve just been surfing more, that’s what we do in events is surf and so it’s the best way to improve.”

Small businesses usually have their own bookkeeper to manage the basic finances but find that this is not enough.
A part-time financial controller can provide a one day a week, in-house finance expertise, performing:
Weekly flash update reports on key metrics
Weekly review of sales, debtors ledgers, accounts payable, cashflow
Monthly management accounts and report
Regular Profit and Cashflow forecasts
Financial modeling to optimise pricing and costing
Set up and review Google Adwords campaigns and SEO of website
Review Xero or QuickBooks accounts set up and tune "built in reports"
Recommend process improvements
Review potential for efficiencies and cost savings in all areas of the business
Annual budget planning and coordination
Year end pack preparation for accountants
Can you afford a Part-time Financial Controller?
A full time financial controller would cost an employer between £600 and £700 per day which would include salary, car, employer's NI, pension, holiday, bank holidays, sickness, IT costs, training, rent, telephone etc. This not a problem for £5M+ companies, but is not affordable for the smaller companies.
Smaller companies in the £300k to £5M range do however need access to the same level of expertise, but for only a few days per month - so you just pay for what you need.
High street accountancy firms are generally not able to offer this flexible, cost effective daily, weekly or monthly package.
Existing clients find that the costs are more than covered by profit improvements - they find that they simply can not afford not to have their own part-time financial controller !

About a year ago, I was at church and a friend of mine, Michelle, came up to me wearing a floating locket which I had never seen before. I asked her about them and she said that it was a floating locket from Origami Owl and that she was a rep.
She told me that she was going to switch to South Hill due to losing orders because of items being out of stock. This gave me an idea. Ding, Ding, Ding.
I have been an importer for 17 years. First with TheKnot.com, then WholesalePocketWatches.com and 5dollarflasks.com. I thought "what if I could import floating lockets." She told me that to do this I would need the quality to be as good as the other 2 major brands.
After months of importing from different companies and getting a bunch of junk, I found a supplier that said they once produced stock for the other brands. These came in amazing. We could not see any differences in the floating lockets.
We starting selling them in our local area and got a few sellers in our program. After 9 months of trial and error I finally launched floatinglocket.com.I hope you love them as much as I do. Have fun shopping.Returns Policy

By Maryam Sinaiee
May 30, 2020
Iran has completely lifted all coronavirus restrictions across the country while according to health officials infections still remain high at more than 2,000 new cases every day.
Speaking at a meeting of the National Coronavirus Combat Taskforce on Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani said mosques have opened for prayers throughout the country, restrictions on the opening hours of shopping centers and malls which had to close at 6:00 pm have been lifted and government employees are back to work now.
Meanwhile, the number of newly identified cases of COVID-19 that dropped to below 2,000 in April has risen again. According to the latest official statement on Friday, 2,282 new cases were identified in the last 24-hour reporting period. The previous day there were more than 2,800 infections; the highest since April 2. The highest number of new cases, 3,111, was reported on March 31.
The number of COVID-19 deaths announced on Friday was 57. The highest number of coronavirus deaths in Iran in one day, 157, was registered on April 5.
The Health Ministry Spokesman Dr. Kianoush Jahanpur on Saturday said the total number of COVID-19 cases and death toll in the country have respectively risen to 148,950 and 7,734. So far, 915,998 coronavirus tests have been done, he said. Iran is the worst-affected country in the Middle East.
Dr. Jahanpur also pointed out that the southwestern province of Khuzestan is still considered as a “red zone” due to the higher number of infections and deaths and the situation in several other provinces including East and West Azarbaijan, Lorestan, Kordestan and Kermanshah in the west of the country, the central province of Esfahan and the southern provinces of Hormozgan is still alarming.
The health ministry has divided the country into white, yellow and red zones on the basis of the number of cases of COVID-19 infection and death.
Iran’s economy, already under the burden of U.S sanctions that were re-introduced by President Donald Trump, has also been hit hard by the pandemic. According to President Rouhani the service sector has experienced the worst among all sectors of the economy since the breakout in February.
Speaking at a ceremony held by the Information and Communication Technology Ministry to unveil new projects on May 28, Rouhani urged investment in digital economy, particularly in view of the coronavirus pandemic. Digital economy only makes up 6.5 percent of the Iranian economy while in some countries it is as big as 14 percent, Rouhani said.
President Rouhani on Saturday stressed that people must believe that “going back to normal” is not possible in the short term and they need to consider the changed lifestyle for years to come. “A new wave [of the pandemic] is possible if people do not take notice of health warnings,” he said.
In a program on the state-run television on Friday, the Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said the observance of social distancing rules by people has dropped from 90 percent to 40 percent. According to Harirchi the number of those who will stay home for the fear of the virus has also dropped from 80 percent to 32 percent now.
In the capital Tehran Deputy Mayor Manaf Hashemi has said that tougher measures will be implemented about wearing masks. “Those who are not wearing masks will not be allowed to enter underground stations,” he said.
RFE-RLThe Dos and DonвЂ™ts of Borrowing Cash. Do: Comparison store when determining where you should borrow
Full Description
Dealing with debt is really a thorny subject. Signing for a mortgage that is affordable a very important factor. Racking up credit debt on unneeded acquisitions? Quite another. When you borrow cash, you place your money in danger. ThatвЂ™s why it is essential to complete pursuit before investing in brand new financial obligation. If youвЂ™re perhaps maybe not sure whether or not to borrow cash, read our list of 2 and donвЂ™ts. Of course you’ll need hands-on help handling your economic life, consider connecting up having a economic consultant.
Do: Comparison store when determining locations to borrow
Thinking about borrowing cash? DonвЂ™t just try using the credit that is first you’ll find. Look around for a financial loan that satisfies your requirements and leaves you with monthly premiums you are able to actually manage. If youвЂ™re maybe perhaps maybe not satisfied with just just what loan providers are selling you, it may possibly be better to take time to build your credit score up then decide to try once again.
DonвЂ™t: simply go through the rate of interest
Comparing loans is all about more than trying to find the interest rate that is lowest you may get. Watch out for warning flags like prepayment charges. Stay away from unsecured loans that include costly insurance coverage add-ons like credit life insurance policies. These insurance coverages, especially if you choose to fund them by rolling them into the loan, will enhance the effective rate of interest regarding the cash you borrow. Approach loans that are payday installment loans with careful attention.
Do: aim for вЂњgood debtвЂќ
Good financial obligation is debt you’ll pay for that you apply on a thing that will appreciate. That might be a house in an appealing neighbor hood or a training from an established organization that can help your own future making energy. Needless to say, you canвЂ™t be 100% certain that your property will appreciate or your degree that is advanced will down you could simply take leaps predicated on thorough research.
DonвЂ™t: exaggerate with unsecured debt
Personal debt is normally considered debt that is bad. Why? Because it is financial obligation removed for something that wonвЂ™t appreciate. YouвЂ™ll invest the funds and acquire enjoyment that is fleeting youвЂ™ll be making interest re payments for months or years. Simply put, it is generally speaking far better to cut back for that new tablet or getaway rather than fund it with personal debt.
Do: Keep a spending plan
Genuine talk: whoever has financial obligation should really be on a tight budget. Spending plans are excellent for all, but people who owe cash to loan providers are prime applicants for a practical spending plan. Month start by keeping track of your income and your spending for one. At the conclusion of the sit down and go over what youвЂ™ve recorded month. Where could you scale back? You canвЂ™t be sure youвЂ™ll find a way to help make on-time payments unless youвЂ™re keeping tabs on your investing вЂ“ and maintaining it under control.
DonвЂ™t: Be belated
These are making on-time re re payments: creating a belated repayment for a bill you’ll manage to pay for isn’t just careless. It is mistake that is also costly. Late re re re payments reduce your credit rating while increasing the attention your debt. They are able to additionally lead your loan provider to impose late-payment penalties while increasing your interest, making your borrowing more costly so long as it can take one to spend down your financial troubles.
Do: Seek help
If youвЂ™re having problems maintaining your financial troubles re re payments or youвЂ™re uncertain how exactly to tackle a small number of various debts, seek assistance from a credit counseling organization that is non-profit. A credit therapist will sit back with both you and review your credit rating and credit file. She or he shall allow you to correct any mistakes in your credit file. Then, youвЂ™ll interact to create a debt repayment plan up. That could suggest you make re re payments to your credit therapist, which in turn will pay your loan providers in your stead.
DonвЂ™t: throw money that is good bad
Why a non-profit credit therapist? Well, there are lots of individuals and organizations out here that are looking one to toss good money after bad. They may provide guidance or they might attempt to offer you on bad credit loans. At best, theyвЂ™ll charge a fee a supply and a leg for advice about financial obligation payment that you may be getting 100% free. At worst, they are able to lead you further into financial obligation.
Do: Automate
Then automation can be your friend if you have debts to pay off. Establishing automated transfers for the bills along with your loan re re payments will get rid of the temptation to overspend, in order to make just the minimal payment or to skip a payment completely. It, set up automatic savings while youвЂ™re at it if you can afford. The earlier you begin saving for your retirement the higher. Simply you should defer your retirement savings until middle age because youвЂ™re still paying off your student loans doesnвЂ™t mean.

Starting on Friday, Mather sophomores participated in team building exercises and workshops led by House advisers. They were also placed into small groups meant to connect them with peers outside their blocking and existing friend groups. Just over 80 percent of sophomores in the House participated, according to Mather House co-master Michael D. Rosengarten.
In addition to a traditional sophomore adviser, sophomores were for the first time also assigned a “House advising peer” who is either an upperclassman or recent graduate of the House.
Rosengarten said Mather launched the pilot program in the hopes of fostering more community among House residents—a College-wide goal that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who is also the co-master of Cabot House, has pushed publicly since he became dean last year.
In Mather, students say they often leave the House without meeting all their peers there, Rosengarten said.
“Most [of] the students we’ve talked to said, in their senior year, the maximum amount of people they know in the House is 30 people out of 400 people,” Rosengarten said. “The idea is perhaps there are a lot of barriers in the House we could lower and make the experience better.”
The exercises and advisers, Mather administrators hope, will make the sophomore community more integrated now that they have moved in.
“We’re not sure that we have all the answers, but what we’re looking for are exercises that will break down barriers and help people connect with each other,” Rosengarten said.
Trevor A. Mullin ’17, Mather House Committee’s Secretary and a House advising peer, said transitioning to upperclassman life and a move from freshman dorms to the House system comes with difficulties, given differences in how entryways function and the smaller size of dining halls. But prior to the orientation, he was optimistic about the prospects of the program.
“I think it will introduce sophomores to more people earlier and create a more inclusive community,” Mullins said.
Mather sophomore and orientation attendee Leesa C. Quinlan ’18 praised the House’s community building goals.
“There’s a really great opportunity to become a family, to get to know people, to learn people’s last names and not just their first names,” Quinlan said.
According to Rosengarten, after the program, sophomores will fill out a survey about their experience and the general transition to upperclassman life. Administrators will then compare the responses of Mather residents’ responses with 20 randomly selected sophomores from three other Houses to assess the program’s success. From there, the College may expand the program to other Houses.

Add CommentHuman brain is one of the most interesting, yet complex parts present in the human body that exists in the universe. The brain does all the functioning and operates other parts of human body, but there’s still so much that we don’t know about it. All of us have always been fascinated by the brains of some genius people who can easily figure out things and take less time to learn things. We call them “born intelligent” and secretly envy them, but we also have wondered many times how they do all that.
Now let’s have a quick sneak peak on some interesting and surprising facts of human brain which we have never come across.
Yes you heard that right- human brain produces the amount of electricity that can easily light a small bulb. Of course this doesn’t mean you try producing light from your brain. Let’s put it this way- without electricity you wouldn’t be reading this article for two reasons. One, you would need electricity to run your device and second, you need your brain to generate the electricity you need.
In Physics we were taught that human body is a collection of huge masses of atoms that produce electricity which makes our bodies function. Now, when we talk about our brain sending signals to- or receiving signals from- the brain as in the cases of closing the door, or opening a book, it’s simply the electricity produced in our brain that carries messages from one point to another. The difference is here we don’t have cables and electric wires, but nerves and neurons to do the job.
Did you know that our brain weighs half as much as our skin does? Next time someone calls you chubby, take it as a compliment because it means you have a larger brain too. Human brain is considered the fattest organ in the human body. A normal human brain weighs 3lbs, out of which 60% is nothing but fat.
One more interesting fact about our brain is that it utilizes one fifth of a calorie per minute even when we are resting. If we diet too strictly and eat too meagerly, we could force our brain to eat itself due to starvation. This will come as good news to foodies, who get a license to eat freely- atleast eating freely is much better than starving your brain and making it eat itself, right?
Yes, it’s good for your brain to forget things because when you forget something, it means that your brain is deleting some unnecessary information. This is a good thing for your nervous system as it helps to retain its plasticity. Next time you forget something, remember it’s not your fault- your brain who thought it as some unnecessary information.
The human brain takes 6 minutes to react to alcohol, so when a person is under the influence of alcohol and experiences a “blackout”, it’s not as if person remembers nothing but his brain temporarily loses the ability to capture memories.
The brain feels no pain at all. That’s because the sensory nerve fibers that make us feel the pain called “nociceptors”- found in all parts of the human body- are not present in the brain, making it unaffected by any kind of pain. Now this explain us how neurosurgeons easily operate on a patient’s brain when they are awake.
Now the question arises if the brain feels no pain then why we get headaches. Actually, this is completely a different story- there are layers of tissue between the brain and skull called “dura” and “pia”, that act as a protective coating to the brain. These layers of tissues have nociceptors in them so when we are stressed out, or when there is too much pressure on our brain, our blood vessels release some chemicals near these tissue layers which in turn, activate the nociceptors and cause headaches.
Sometimes we get a strong “gut feeling” of whether an action/person is correct or something is going to happen, even without having any facts or proof to justify our feelings. Actually these feelings, also known as “intuition”, are triggered by an electric simulation caused in some specific parts of our brain that are linked to analyzing risks.
Let’s think of brain as a prediction machine. The brain stores memories it receives from the outer world, and combines them with past experiences to sum up the possible outcomes of certain situation. Our brain is designed to not just see and hear, but also predict what we should be hearing or seeing next moment to moment. This is the basis of the “Sixth Sense” concept.
Human brain uses 20% of the total oxygen and blood in our body. Our brain can normally survive up to 4 to 6 minutes without oxygen, after which, it slowly begins to die. Lack of oxygen supply to the brain for more than 10 minutes- caused due to choking, carbon monoxide poisoning, non-functioning of heart, injuries sustained at birth, or drowning, etc. – may result in permanent brain damage.
When our brain is deprived of oxygen for a very long time, it shuts down resulting in a medical condition where a person doesn’t react to any kind of stimuli like pain, touch, noise, etc. often referred to as “comatose” or simply, coma. In this condition, a person cannot perform any voluntary actions and even if there are possibilities that the person may recover from coma if oxygen supply is regained, there is a permanent damage in the brain.
Sounds surprising, doesn’t it? Human brain also has taste receptors. We know taste buds in tongue are responsible for the kind of taste we get but these sensors present in our mouth are just initials. The most important part of the taste journey is how does the brain interprets it. Yes, the brain is responsible for translating what kind of taste we experienced. There are parts in our brain which are dedicated for different tastes.
Yes, you heard that right! It’s no more just a fictional movie plot. Scientists have discovered that there are many brain parasites which can actually make the “Zombie Apocalypse” real. It must sound surrealistic that a tiny creature can govern such a large human body, but these parasites do actually control their hosts so zombies can be made through these parasites.
A recent study has found that “Toxoplasma Gondii”, a parasite known for infecting rodents and cats and is making its way to humans as well. Scientists are now linking schizophrenia, the medical condition where a patient can no more separate reality from fiction, also with a parasite. This research is an ongoing process but it’s still creepy to know that there is no cure available for the condition.
The structure of human brain starts changing from the time of birth and it keeps doing so throughout lifetime. There is a change every time we learn something new. The structure of our brain also changes without the usage of any drugs or life-changing situations.
Now the question is- how does it change? The change can occur even by simply doing something again or again. When we do something different too, it brings a change in the structure of your brain. This explain us why sometimes psychotherapy works great when drugs fail. This is because it changes the way our brain thinks presently and gives us a different way of perceiving things. This leads to changes in the structure and biochemical of our brain.
When we talk about brain it’s hard to avoid the matter of depression. Doctors no longer dismiss depression as an imaginary concept; it’s a real illness that impacts the brain.
It is caused because of chemical changes in the brain. Any person of any age can suffer from it.
There is a change in structure of brain when depression occurs. Several parts of brain slow down and some parts get hyperactive. This explains why depressed people feel lethargic and exhausted. The equilibrium of the brain is upset. It is mainly caused due to biological factors, rejection, and failure. A recent study shows that violent households and rough child-raising can have the same effect on a child’s mental state as the soldier’s mental condition.
We have discussed some very interesting and mindboggling facts about human brain. Did you know that our brain gets almost 70,000 thoughts in a day yet we never acknowledge it? In short, we underestimate the power of our brain. There is nothing like a “dumb person”; if we can optimize the way we utilize our brain, we could all be smart. The trick is in not expecting everyone to be smart in one field, as everybody’s brain is not developed to be interested in one particular field.
Everything we do, every thought we’ve ever had, is produced by the human brain. But exactly how it operates remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries, and it seems the more we probe its secrets, the more surprises we find ~ Neil deGrasse Tyson+50 points in the past 30 days

22 Nov 2021 04:24PM (Updated: 22 Nov 2021 04:36PM)
NORWAY: China's Ning Zhongyan stepped up preparations for the Winter Olympics that will be on home ice in February after winning the men's 1,500m final at the speed skating World Cup leg in Stavanger, Norway on Sunday (Nov 21). Ning won gold in 1:45.16 and took the lead in the World Cup rankings from South Korean Kim Min-Seok, who won bronze in Stavanger. American Joey Mantia took the silver medal to complete the podium. Ning, who stepped up his game after last week's silver medal in the Poland leg of the World Cup, said the gold medal will boost his confidence before the 2022 Winter Olympics begin in Beijing on Feb. 4. "It's very important for me to win this medal. It gives me great confidence for the Olympic year going forward," Ning said in a statement. "Yes, there's some degree of pressure for sure with the Olympics in China but I believe athletes from other countries have pressure too." World Champion Thomas Krol and Olympic champion Kjeld Nuis had yet another disappointing week, with the Dutchmen finishing fifth and seventh, respectively. Japan celebrated three gold medals on Sunday, thanks to Tatsuya Shinhama, Nao Kodaira and Miho Takagi. Shinhama won his second 500m race of the new World Cup season, though Canada's Laurent Dubreuil held on to the lead in the rankings after finishing second. Kodaira and Takagi won the women's 500m and 1500m, respectively. Kodaira completed the medal set in Stavanger, having won 1000m bronze on Friday and 500m silver on Saturday. Source: Reuters/ga

Without proper laws protecting digital privacy, inappropriate use of facial recognition technology will enable mass surveillance
Facial recognition technology (FRT) has been deployed by social media platforms to tag a person in a photo or video, and by law enforcement agencies to nab criminals. Rights activists have for long questioned its use citing algorithmic bias and mass surveillance.
Facebook, now renamed as Meta Platforms Inc, said earlier this month it is shutting down its facial recognition technology (FRT) on its platform. It would no longer auto-recognise faces from images and videos and as a result, the company hit the delete button on over a billion users’ faceprint templates it holds.
THE GIST
- Facebook, now renamed as Meta Platforms Inc, said earlier this month it is shutting down its facial recognition technology (FRT) on its platform. This comes after a class action lawsuit against them for failing to perform necessary disclosures related to handling of its users’ biometric data.
- A growing body of research shows that biometric scanning technologies coupled with AI have an inherent bias.
- India lacks a robust legal framework to address the use of biometric technology. In such a scenario, the National Crime Records Bureau has already requested for proposals to create a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
Facebook built this large dataset pixel by pixel since it launched the photo-tagging feature in 2010. The controversial automatic face-tagging feature scans faces and suggests who the person might be. Although users were given an option to switch off the biometric feature, there was no explicit consent to use the feature in the first place.
In mid-2015, Facebook was sued in Illnois for failing to perform necessary disclosures related to handling of its users’ biometric data. The case was approved to become a class action lawsuit in 2018.
According to an Illnois state law, the Biometric Information Privacy Act, it is illegal to gather or use “face geometry” data without disclosing methods, intentions and guarantees regarding the data.
In February, Facebook settled the long-running dispute and agreed to pay $650 million to the 1.6 million members of the class in Illnois.
Facebook isn’t the first company to be accused of using biometric technology inappropriately, and it won’t be the last as several large tech firms build and sell FRT tools to government agencies.
An FRT software made it possible to identify perpetrators of the infamous U.S. Capitol siege in January. Pictures of the attackers were run through a facial recognition software to find similar faces in a database of social media headshots and other images scraped from the internet at large.
Using a software, built by Clearview AI, the police were able to identify perpetrators and submit their names in court. The technology has been hailed as a great tool that helps law enforcement agencies nab criminals.
Algorithmic bias
But a growing body of research shows that biometric scanning technologies coupled with AI have an inherent bias. A report by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) noted that facial recognition technology found Black, Brown and Asian individuals to be 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white male faces.
A 2018 research paper, co-authored by ex-Google top AI scientist Timnit Gebru and MIT Media Labs’ Joy Buolamwini, found that machine learning algorithms discriminate based on classes like race and gender.
Their study titled ‘Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification’, evaluated automated facial analysis systems and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups and concluded that the database was overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned individuals.
To curb the ill-effects of FRT, some U.S. lawmakers introduced the Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act last year.
A legal bulwark needed
India lacks a robust legal framework to address the use of biometric technology even as the Union Government deployed over a dozen different FRT systems across the country that collect and use biometric data.
The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has requested for proposals to create a National Automated Facial Recognition System (NAFRS) to build a national database of photographs to identify criminals.
In the U.S. several states have banned its use, but there is a no sweeping legislation that bars law enforcement agencies in the country to stop using FRT.
In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides the bloc a first line of defence against FRT infringing on individual’s privacy. Article 9 of GDPR prohibits processing of personal biometric data for the purposes of identifying an individual.
India still does not have a personal data protection law. A draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 was introduced in the Lok Sabha two years ago, and the Select Committee of Parliament is yet to finalise its report on it.
Scanning technology and biometric tracking pose a grave threat to freedom of expression. Its use by law enforcement agencies in India during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and in Hong Kong against pro-democracy protesters, highlights how this technology can be used by law enforcement agencies for mass surveillance.
A start
While Facebook’s decision to shut down FRT sounds like a blanket ban, it has grey areas. For instance, the embattled social media firm said it will keep its facial recognition services open “to help people gain access to a locked account, verify their identity in financial products or unlock a personal device.”
But according to the digital rights organisation, Electronic Frontier Foundation,“ Facebook’s step is just one very large domino in the continued fight against face recognition technology.”Original design 1000 reeds machine carpet with 3000 density Toos Mashhad

Junta No 2 Gen Prawit Wongsuwan has ordered police to speed up investigation of a brutal assault on Sirawit “Ja New” Seritwat, amid a growing belief that the anti-junta activist is being targeted for political reasons.
Prawit was responding to public claims that the junta is using violence against its critics, after a spate of assaults on political activists culminated on Friday when men on motorcycles beat the 27-year-old Ja New with baseball bats, leaving him severely injured. Prawit countered on Monday that he had no violent tendencies.

Posted on
Jayne & Godfrey Wilkinson collected their Go-Pod from Red Lion on the 2nd August 2019 - and then set straight off on an epic road trip across Europe! This is what they said;
We picked up our new Go-Pod on 2nd August 2019.
We then travelled for a month across Europe, staying in the Go-Pod on a number of campsites in France, Switzerland and Italy, to our final destination on 31st August, the Mani, in the Peloponnese, Greece.
We travelled a total of 3158 km (1963 miles), it was a great trip and the perfect way to travel.
Jayne & Godfrey.
The Go-Pod's ease of use and manouevrability make it an excellent choice for road trips abroad.
Have a look at some of their pictures from the trip below!A Federal High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti on Thursday dismissed the suit by the Ekiti Government against the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) over the dismissal of a pregnant officer on grounds of abuse of court processes.
UGAMATV reports that Ekiti Attorney-General, Wale Fapounda, in the suit, is seeking an order of the court to nullify Section 127 of the Police Act and Regulations, which provides for the discharge from the Police Force female officers who become pregnant while married unofficially.
Delivering judgment, Justice Babs Kuewumi, said:”this suit can not validly co-exist with the suit at the National Industrial Court, sitting in Akure in Ondo State with suit number: NICN/AK/14/2021.
“The Originating Summons of this suit is hereby dismissed.”
Justice Kuewumi had however, earlier decided in favour of the plaintiff the reliefs bothering on “locus standi”, whether the court has jurisdiction and whether the appropriate parties have been joined in the suit.
READ ALSO: BREAKING: Obiano meets Buhari, says President not in support of State of Emergency
The plaintiff’s reliefs were opposed to by the respondents, CSP Femi Falade in the Preliminary Objection with 18 paragraph affidavit deposed to by one Ariyo and a written address.
UGAMATV reports that Fapounda acting on the public interest had approached the court seeking the interpretation of the constitutionality of Section 127 of the Police Service Regulation Act, 2001.
He told the court that the dismissal of the police woman, an indigene of Ekiti on the ground that she got pregnant before legally married violate her fundamental right as entrenched in the Constitution of Nigeria,1999( as amended).
Fapounda therefore sought the interpretation of Section 127 Police Regulation.
But Falade, counsel to the respondents, opposed the plaintiff prayers, saying similar suit had been instituted at the National Industrial Court, Akure.
Speaking with newsmen shortly after the judgment, the Ekiti Attorney-General, Fapounda said he had sought from the court, a copy of the judgment in order to know the next line of action.
He expressed delight on the court pronouncement on the reliefs that he has the “locus standi” to institute suit that will be of public interest, especially for the indigents, saying woman police should be treated the same way with male counterpart.Sword?

Just a few years ago Pete, his wife Anda and their daughter Sidonie, back then 2 1/2 years old, gave up their life in Brooklyn to make Berlin their new home. Anda, a graphic designer for Etsy.com, illustrator and all-round-DIY talent and Pete, a tattoo artist quickly fell in love with the new city. Reason enough to add to the family! Last year their son Jude Alvin was born.
Vor nicht so vielen Jahre sind Pete, seine Frau Anda und Tochter Sidonie, damals zweieinhalb Jahre alt, von Brooklyn nach Berlin gezogen. Anda, Grafikdesignerin für Etsy.com, Illustratorin und DIY-Talent und Pete, selbst erlernter Tattoo-Künstler verliebten sich schnell in die Stadt und blieben. Letztes Jahr kam Söhnchen Jude Alvin auf die Welt. Hier erzählt Pete von ihrem Leben in der deutschen Hauptstadt.
Dieses Interview ist vorerst nur auf Englisch verfügbar.
How does one become a tattoo artist?
I’m a self-taught tattoo artist. So, that means I practiced a lot on my own legs. I was also quite lucky in that pretty much as soon as I started tattooing I had plenty of people willing to let me tattoo them as well.
We see a lot of your tattoo art in the pictures above. Where do you get your inspiration from?
Wherever I find it really. Anything from folk art paintings to hand-painted signage to children’s book illustrations might make a good a tattoo. Also, old tattooists like Herbert Hoffmann, Stoney St. Clair and Lee Roy Menugh have great style. Right now I’m obsessed with this book Mauvais Garçons that is pictures of French penal colony tattoos from around the turn of the 20th century. Really tough stuff.
When are your kids allowed to get their first tattoo ?
I get this question a lot. Almost as often as: “Have you ever tattooed your kids?” Of course I haven’t! But, I have designed temporary tattoos. I gave some to our daughter, Sidonie, for Christmas last year.
Anda, your wife, designs her own fabric and sews clothes for your kids. You both are super creative parents…What do you plan for Alvis first birthday party?
Alvie’s first birthday is going to be “Thumbs Up!” themed, since when counting on the hand in Germany one uses the thumb as “one”. In the states we use the first finger. His birthday is only a few days before mine, so I think this year I might not get much of a party myself, but that’s OK.
Why did you decide to live in Berlin? Something about the US that you miss?
We came to Berlin about 4 years ago. Berlin has tons of parks, good schools, good vibes and decent Mexican food. It’s also a major European capital city that is still affordable and welcomes people from all over the world. It’s pretty much perfect. I love it here, I hope we never go back! Just kidding. I miss family and friends back stateside but I don’t miss living there. Too hectic.
Last June the second child, Alvie, was born. How is family life with the second one?
We’re a square now, no longer a triangle. It’s a big change but Sidonie, who is 6 now, is an awesome big sister. She helps out a bit, feeding him some food or just entertaining him while we work on something else. But now when Anda or I want to give each other a break we know the other will have two to deal with.
How do you guys manage to get some couple time?
Well, we share a studio at home and spend time there together almost every night. It’s great. We were both very productive this winter. I’m hoping that Alvie will be ready for a babysitter before fall so Anda and I can enjoy some summer nights in the Bier Garten, ohne Kindern.
What’s the best advice parents-to-be can get?
Remember to sleep. Trade off mornings with your partner so one of you can always sleep in. Also, travel as much as you can in the first few years. Infants are great travelers.
What’s the hardest about being a dad?
In a lot of ways my life is much easier now that I’m a father. I mean, sure, there’s a lot more to think about and coordinate, balancing work and play and life and love but I like that. Things can get monotonous when all you do is make art, skate, work a bit, drink coffee and tattoo. But real talk, living overseas has made me really aware of how much easier life is with family around. So I am very thankful living with Anda and the kids.
What’s the greatest?
Kids. Kids are the greatest.
Thank you Pete!

Colonial Pipeline back online, but gas might not be back until the weekend
After almost a week since Colonial Pipeline shut down for the very first time in its history, President Joe Biden announced Thursday that the pipeline was back to full capacity. But, that doesn’t mean gas stations that were emptied over the last six days will be immediately replenished.
“But I want to be clear, we will not feel the effects at the pump immediately,” Biden said during a press conference. “This is not like flicking on a light switch.”
The pipeline is over 5,500 miles long. So Biden adjusted everyone’s expectations during the presser. “We expect to see a region by region return to normalcy beginning this weekend,” he said.
Yet Colonial Pipeline’s own statement was even more vague about the timeline. “Following this restart, it will take several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal,” their statement read.
However, when asked if Colonial Pipeline paid Ransomware, the group of hackers who initially attacked the pipeline’s cybersecurity apparatus, Biden refused to answer. From the beginning, the Biden administration has been clear that it is not the government’s decision to make. On Monday, Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology said it would be a “private sector decision” whether the ransom would be paid or not.
Sources involved in the transaction reportedly confirmed to Bloomberg News that a $5 million ransom was paid.!5 in 1 Best Way Air sofa perfect for two or three people as a short term sleeping solution A raised air bed that measures Five uses from one product - hence the name 5 x 1 nozzles and a lightweight carry bag to take everything with!

Additional Information:Trump wants to win the 2018 mid-term elections
United States President Donald Trump hosted a dinner for members of his faith advisory group. Together they celebrated “evangelical leadership.” Invitations were sent out to about 100 leaders. The president, according to Robert Jeffress, an advisory group member, expressed genuine appreciation for the more-or-less solid approval ratings he has with evangelicals. An overwhelming 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
The list of attendees includes faith leaders like Jerry Falwell, Dr. James Dobson, Franklin Graham, Lester Warner, Alveda King, Darrell Scott, Ralph Reed, Paula White, and Tony Perkins. The president paid a special tribute to Dr. James Dobson and Dr. Shirley Dobson, who were celebrating their 58th wedding anniversary. As usual, Trump boasted about his administration. He claimed to have ended all government attacks which were allegedly done during the Obama era. He portrayed himself as a protector of religious liberty.
The list of other attendees included Mike Pence, the Vice President of the United States, Ben Carson, the Homeland Security Secretary, Sam Brownback, the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, and Alex Azar, the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services. First Lady Melania Trump was the official host of the event.

The true significance of the dinner was not lost on anyone, least of all the attendees. Robert Jeffress, a Dallas megachurch pastor and a known supporter of President Donald Trump, said the environment of the event was like a "campaign rally." Evangelical leaders, one after the another, stood up and explained why the president has their continued support. A substantial number of attendees promised they would do their utmost to ensure Trump gets the maximum number of votes in the upcoming midterm elections. Public prayers were heard for the president and the first lady. Spiritual assistance was also sought by the Vice President and Karen, Pence's wife. The gathering was clearly encouraging for the president and for the attendees.
Among the audience were Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Press Secretary of the White House, Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior adviser, along with Jared Kushner, her husband. Kushner also holds the post of senior adviser to the White House. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, was also present. Incidentally, this meeting is the second of its kind in recent months. A dinner with 50 evangelical invitees was hosted at the White House in May 2018.

NT Robotics team and our pet drone at the booth. Our indoor navigation software is unique, so we love to show it off.
Other exhibiting companies were from Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Serbia, Israel, Belgium, Canada, the US, China, Germany, Slovenia, France, England, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Norway, Ireland and Slovak Republic.
Most of the drones were large, for outdoor use and required pilots.
Most attendees were also working in the drone industry: drone insurance, cameras, boat inspections, pipeline inspections, tunnel inspections, ship inspections, bridge inspections, stack inspections, UAS repair service centers, lecturers at universities, 3D printer companies that make drone parts, IMU producers, mini drones 200gm, recharge landing stations, issue flight licenses, outdoor mapping, encoders to stream video, 3D city map makers, etc.
I talked with visitors about what they were looking for at the expo and if they found it, they replied yes, they found some interesting stuff. It was the right place to get new ideas.
Flights inside the Drone Cage were cool. One small drone could go inside a pipe and the operator could see what the drone sees.
This was our first dedicated drone expo, which is why there was a lot more interest in our unique software and we made more solid connections than we have at more general expos.
There were a lot of visitors, the first day we greeted them from 10 am to 5 pm non-stop. Many countries, from Colombia to Singapore, many professionals, from engineers, with detailed knowledge of drones, to government managers looking for solutions.
We’d like to thank the organizers for producing such a great event. It takes a lot of effort to organize a successful conference & expo, especially in a foreign country.
It was really busy, useful, informative and I think everyone found it valuable!
Here are the details of the solution we presented and why it is unique.
A truly Autonomous Indoor Navigation System that requires no light, GPS or human intervention. It is a platform for developing applications for industrial drones.
Navigation system
Fully autonomous.
Original SLAM implementation working with a carefully selected set of sensors.
The navigation system is compatible with most robotic platforms.
It navigates without GPS, in a complex magnetic environment, in total darkness, and without radio control.
Does not require pre-existing maps.
Product line
Navigation kit: can be installed on any robot or drone to provide totally autonomous indoor navigation capability in total darkness.
Payload kit: includes navigation kit and a sensitive global-shutter camera synchronized with a powerful light source. It can be installed on any drone to provide indoor navigation capability in total darkness. Also allows the drone to perform surface coverage, with high-quality imagery for technical inspections purposes.
Small industrial drone: turnkey 24” drone for technical inspection of tanks.
Large industrial drone: turnkey 32” drone for technical inspections.
Use cases:
- Technical inspections (e.g., oil tank)
- Data harvesting
- Mining and ore processing (e.g., inside the tunnel after explosions)
- Security systems (e.g., foreign objects on subway tracks)
- Construction
Drone website: NT Robotics.
Our technology is unique, innovative and advanced.
We specialize in technical inspections. We are available and interested in opportunities for test flights and pilot projects around the world. We can place our software in other hardware, as well as drones and crawlers. (It’s our super power.)
We are happy to send more information to interested parties at no obligation. And we appreciate your passing our information on to companies that need technical inspections.

What Is Trauma?
Is it time to dump the diagnosis of PTSD?
Posted January 5, 2012 | Reviewed by Devon Frye
My dictionary defines trauma as a deeply distressing or disturbing experience. Defined like that, the events which can be considered traumatic are wide-ranging indeed—from what might be considered the stuff of ordinary life such as divorce, illness, accidents, and bereavement to extreme experiences of war, torture, rape, and genocide.
Insofar as we adopt this wide-ranging definition, trauma is the stuff of everyday life.
The American Psychiatric Association's current definition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), introduced in 1994, states that a person must have experienced or witnessed an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and which involved fear, helplessness, or horror.
While the American Psychiatric Association's definition is more restrictive than my dictionary definition, it is still far more wide-ranging than the original 1980 definition of PTSD, which stated that an event had to be outside the range of usual human experience. Then, only the most horrific events would qualify.
Looking to the future, debate rages in clinical and scientific circles about whether the next definition of trauma in DSM-V should be more or less restrictive.
Should we go back to something closer to the original idea—that trauma was an experience that, when encountered, would psychologically overwhelm all who encountered it? Or should we move in the direction of thinking that all life events have the potential to be perceived as traumatic?
Not surprisingly, the elastic nature of the concept of trauma over the years has caused a great deal of public confusion. And the topic of PTSD seems charged with emotion. There are two points of view.
First is the view that PTSD results from a stressor that is so overwhelming that no matter what the person's resources, they will develop PTSD. As such, the diagnosis of PTSD does not reflect any personal vulnerability.
The second is that people who develop PTSD are vulnerable in some way. As such, the diagnosis of PTSD does reflect some kind of inner vulnerability. Those who do not develop PTSD are resilient.
Sometimes, people who take the former view are dismissive of those who have received a diagnosis of PTSD following more "everyday" events—as if their PTSD is somehow less valid. It has also been claimed that PTSD is being over-diagnosed.
But the fact is that since the 1994 definition, research has defined PTSD in such a way that trauma is necessary but not always sufficient to produce PTSD—so both these points of view are right. The current definition has it both ways by understanding PTSD as the outcome of an interaction between trauma intensity and personal vulnerability.
An "extreme" event may be sufficient to produce PTSD in all who experience it so that personal vulnerability is not a factor. But a less "extreme" event may only produce PTSD in those who are already vulnerable.
Not surprisingly, in a culture in which mental illness is stigmatized, the issue of whether PTSD is caused by an event or by personal vulnerability is one that is charged with emotion. As the public understanding seems closer to the original definition of PTSD, the current definition is fraught with problems.
How should the next definition of PTSD deal with this issue—or is it time to dump the diagnosis of PTSD?

After a few purchases that required total assembly, I became frustrated because what should have taken an hour or two turned into an all day project. So I came up with a plan to make the assembly less painful. Here are a few tips for assembling furnishings that you purchase from Big Box stores like Ikea and Kmart.
FIRST
Lay out the parts in order ( either by letters or numbers )
SECOND
Make sure you have all necessary tools are present ( as per instructions ) and all parts / pieces are accounted for
THIRD
Place box with picture on a wall in your view ( this ensures that as you build your furniture, it resembles the picture )
FOURTH
Briefly, Read the instructions from start to finish. ( the more knowledge you have of what you are building gives your brain a better picture of the right way to assemble the furniture )
**** If possible, build the furniture near where you eventually want to place it ( takes less effort to move into place )
DISCLAIMER – Make sure another person is present if the furniture you are building is heavy!!!!
I hope these tips encourages someone to not be afraid of building big box store items.

Google has today announced an update to the Google Docs app for Android, bringing realtime collaboration tools, rich text editing and a refined interface.
With the new realtime tools, you can see editing from multiple invited participants happen live, just as it does in the regular version of Google Docs. This allows you to see people typing as they edit a document and follow along with their edits. You can also join in and begin editing right alongside them.
Google has also tweaked the interface, allowing for pinch-to-zoom actions that make it easier to start editing on a specific section of the document. Rich text editing is another welcome addition, allowing for bolding, bullet-pointing, color and other contextual formatting that should help you get the point across.
The Google Docs for Android product has been lagging behind the regular version for some time, so it’s nice to see that Google is making an attempt to improve the feature set to coincide more closely with the desktop. The update is available now on the Android Market.Related Posts.

HEIST028
Release Date: 10th November 2017
One of our highlights of last year was Nebraska's 'Soften the wireless' EP, with disco stomper Khan's Bargain, and an amazing Tom Noble remix. Since then, we've seen him take on quite a few live shows again, playing at Claire during ADE, and Concrete for our label showcases. He's also managed to find a bit of time to focus on his fresh (new and cool) edit label 'Friends and Relations'. Luckily, since we've been nagging him to do a new EP for Heist just enough for him to still like us, and more than enough for him to want to get it over with, we've gotten our hands on another set of amazing tunes. So we're happy to present his amazing music, nicely packaged in one handy record for your listening pleasure: the 'Metaphor to the floor' EP.
You'll feel a hint of that Nebraska classic 'This is the way' on the lead track 'Affirmation', with its subtle build up and release of energy, looping vocals, and dramatic chords. Aglio e Olio is not only a simple yet tasty Italian dish with of just 5 ingredients, it's also quite the track on this EP, equalling the dish in terms of simplicity and strength. Snares on the 1, Clavi style hits and a loose arrangement give this track a great funk - house crossover appeal.
On the flip, we've got fellow Londoner Laurence Guy, who just released an amazing album on the equally cool 'Church'. His version of Aglio e Olio is a dreamier excursion with filtered pads, acidey licks and more than enough balls in the low end to get you movin' in your dim-lit club of choice.
The EP's final track sees Nebraska turning the energy up a notch or 2 (or 3), with 'Big plate chicken'. It's the sort of track you would imagine Omar S. producing if he would be just a bit whiter, and a bit more British. Whatever that means.
Yours Sincerely,
Maarten & Lars.

My deep gratitude to Mushon Zer-Aviv, whose art work appears below.
+ + +
Let's start with some early prototypes..
Developing the prototype. We eventually changed to different art work for the game pieces.
The first version of the game included both 2D and 3D modes. Despite all the effort expended in crafted the 3D version, we ended up jettisoning it in favor of a cleaner, simpler, top-down interface.
Glitches are a regular experience in software development. Alas...
The first game prototype had an easter egg with Situationist graffiti. You could find the easter egg if you looked inside the 3D model for the arsenals. Unfortunately this easter egg had to be removed after switching to 2D. (The above image is a texture file; it would be wrapped on to an object model.. in this case a "tent" model representing the arsenals.)
One of Mushon's early experiments with "woodcut" image filters. This approach ended up influencing the visual style of the game, as seen particularly in the landscape of the game board itself, as well as the game pieces.
I ended up modeling this woodcut/moirée effect in software, which you can see in the background of the game lobby and set-up screens.
One of Mushon's very early sketchbook pages. He's working out some of the iconography of the game. Much of this imagery ended up in the game piece icons.
An illustration of Mushon's work process in putting together the game pieces, starting here with pencil drawings.
More documentation of Mushon's process -- here moving from pencil drawing, to initial sketches on the computer, to the final graphic.
Mushon found this image in an old book, edited it and colorized it slightly for the launch screen.
+ + +
Here's some ephemera from the back end as well.. Less pretty perhaps..
Debugging some problems with memory allocation. Xcode has some great visualization tools that help find memory leaks and strong reference cycles.
While building the A.I., I made a subroutine that would print out the game board in ASCII. This helped me quickly visualize the board from different perspectives. The A.I. is very simple: rebuild the board from the "subjective" perspective of a certain piece; isolate all possible moves based on that pruned perspective; assign a score to each possible move, then min-max the scores to find an "optimal" move.
Pathfinding is also crucial for this kind of A.I. You have to be able to find a good path from one place in the array to another place. The above image is a test of the A* (A-Star) algorithm, one of the most popular pathfinding algorithms.
Here's some console output that shows the min-max algorithm at work. This shows the movement range for a Cavalry piece ("X" at center). Each possible move is given a score. In this instance, the highest score is "58." The Cavalry would thus move two squares downward to that position.
+ + +
Given the ubiquity of mobile devices, it became imperative to redesign the game to work better on smaller screens. I changed the heads-up display to a smaller, more abbreviated format. This visual economization resulted in a better interface because it forced me to focus only on what was absolutely essential for gameplay.
The smaller abbreviated HUD -- first attempt.
Second attempt, incorporating a dial that displays combat stats for game pieces. This starts to look like the final version of the game.Talking points: Should cannabis be legalised in Hong Kong?
Hate it when you can’t talk back? Well, you can with Young Post. Have your say and share with students around Hong Kong
Cannabis, otherwise known as Marijuana, is an addictive psychoactive drug. I think it shouldn’t be legalised because it can lead to many diseases such as cancer, chronic pain, or worse. To avoid such problems, I don’t think anyone should be allowed to use cannabis, unless they need it to treat an illness. Stay away from people who take drugs, and take care of your health.
Sadak Meehan Ahmed Sultan, 12, HKMA David Li Kwok Po College
I don’t think it should be legalised in Hong Kong. Cannabis can make you feel sleepy, and can also affect your memory. If it is used consistently over a long period of time, it can cause some serious damage to your heart and lungs. Non-medical cannabis is bad for our health and should therefore remain illegal.
Chan Pui Kwan, 12, Pope Paul VI College
Teen drug use in Hong Kong is ‘on the rise’, according to survey
No. People who support the legalisation of cannabis argue that some people need the drug for medical reasons, such as to treat epilepsy. However, I think cannabis does more harm than good to young people. If the drug is legalised, youths may think cannabis is not so harmful to them. If they were interested, they could easily try it out, but the problem is it’s easy to get hooked. Some young people believe smoking cannabis can help them escape their problems without considering the long-term detrimental effects on their health. Young people are vulnerable to the harmful effects of drugs. To protect the pillars of our future society, the government should not legalise cannabis in Hong Kong.
Jody Ho, 16, Queen Elizabeth School
I have to say no. Right now, cannabis is illegal in Hong Kong, but there are still many people and adults who using the drug. Imagine how many people would be using cannabis if it were legal! I think it would definitely lead to more people taking the drug. This is why I think it should remain illegal.
Warwick Lai, 16, Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Tong Secondary School
I think it should for the following reasons: even though cannabis can be very harmful to your health when abused, it’s also a very useful medicine. If used responsibly, it can treat a lot of illnesses such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. I think as long as citizens don’t abuse the drug and are careful not to get addicted, I think legalising it would be fine.
Hazel Fung, 12, Pope Paul VI College
Is Hong Kong doing enough to tackle its underage drinking problem?
I think cannabis should be made legal in Hong Kong because many people could use the drug for medical treatment. The problem is cannabis is addictive and people need to be wary of this when they use it. If the drug is legalised, it hope it would benefit a lot of people with diseases that can be treated with medical cannabis.
Oorvi Goyal, 12, HKMA David Li Kwok Po College
I don’t think it should. Cannabis, like a lot of other drugs, cannabis is hazardous to our health. It can also be very expensive if we become addicted to it. A lot of people say they feel more relaxed when they use the drug, but I think it does more harm than good. If we keep using it, that could seriously affect our mental and physical health. You should do more exercise to relax instead.
Wong Wing-gi, 14, STFA Leung Kau Kui College
Absolutely not. As we know, cannabis is a drug and it is not good for our health. Although it is said to give people a certain amount of joy when they are under stress or feeling sad, it can be very harmful to their mental health. The most terrible thing is that people easily become addicted to the drug. I think that if cannabis was legalised in Hong Kong, the city would no longer be a nice place.
Carol Chen,12, Pope Paul VI College
Teens and young adults who vape are 3.5 times more likely to use marijuana, study finds
Cannabis should be legalised for medical purposes in Hong Kong, but not for recreational purposes. Many Hongkongers might need the drug to relieve their stress from social issues such as the high cost of living.
Shirley Hon, 17, Fung Kai No. 1 Secondary School
I strongly suggest that we don’t legalise cannabis in Hong Kong. As we know, cannabis has a great deal of short-term and long-term side effects, including a weakened immune system, depression, loss of focus, and so on. It is likely to have a negative impact on a person’s everyday life.

Q&A
What do you think needs to be done to improve access to and the affordability of health care?
I support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a free-market-based health care system where patients have impartial information about quality and affordability.
We also need legislation that would protect seniors from financial hardship by requiring price controls or rebates for drug price increases that exceed the rate of inflation, lowering the annual out-of-pocket caps for Medicare Part D patients and allowing the re-importation of drugs that are found to be available cheaper outside of the United States.
What should be done to address the massive amount of student debt in this country and make college more affordable?
We need to repeal most of the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993. That Clinton-era law was enacted to absolve the government’s liability as a guarantor from increasing student loan defaults. Since the government no longer guaranteed the loans, Democrats also deregulated interest rates, tuition rates and academic quality standards. … [T]hose protections needed to be left in place as conditions for banks that want to make loans that aren’t dischargeable due to bankruptcy. Students have been exploited for decades as a result.
What is your position on trade and tariffs?
I support free trade when it is accompanied by fair trade. Fair trade doesn’t always exist with some trading partners. China, for example, has long been an example of a nation engaged in unfair trade practices.
What should be done to address climate change?
When people hear of “climate change,” they usually think of the phrase “greenhouse gases.” Few people actually know what greenhouse gases are. The four most common greenhouse gases are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide can be reduced by burning fewer fossil fuels. However, the reduction won’t be significant enough to mitigate the climate change caused by an ever-increasing human and animal population.

Four South Coast fishermen say their respective businesses have been shipwrecked by newly-implemented state government regulations.
The men were aggrieved to see the former Minister for Primary Industries Katrina Hodgkinson running for Gilmore.
"As Minister she signed off on key recommendations giving the Department of Primary Industries unprecedented power to 'separate and redistribute' the wealth and equity of the NSW fishing industry," Shoalhaven fisherman Ed Lammerink said.
Ms Hodgkinson told the South Coast Register she played a role in discussions, but not in the implementation of the commercial fisheries reform.
"Reform was commenced by Minister Ian McDonald when the ALP was in government in NSW, I continued with the process of discussion with industry, I believe it was signed off by Minister Niall Blair," she said.
READ MORE: Meet the candidate, Katrina Hodgkinson
Ed and three of his friends Claude Zarella, Mark Henry and Mark Strutt each have heartbreaking stories to tell about the real effect of this reform.
"We were owners of totally active, functioning businesses," Shoalhaven fisherman Claude Zarella said.
"Families are being destroyed up and down the coast as a result of this reform.
"They're taking resources out of the hands of commercial fishers and putting them into the pockets of foreign investors."

Claude was multi-endorsed, working on the Shoalhaven River and in and outside of Jervis Bay.
He says the reforms have crippled the operational capacity of his business.
"They took away 80 per cent of my business," Claude said.
"I bought back 10 per cent of it, I put my hand in my pocket to be able to do what I've always done.
"We have a seven-year-old child, thank goodness my missus is bringing in more than I am, otherwise our mortgage would have been maxed out."
Mark Henry from Old Erowal Bay does line fishing off the continental shelf.
"There are only a few people who do it," Mr Henry said.
"It's all sustainable. Ninety per cent of the fish I catch, I keep."
On May 1, new regulations were implemented and his business has become nonviable.
"They dropped the quota," he said.
He is now limited to catching and selling 438kg of fish (16kg of bass grouper, 55kg of bigeye perch, 162kg of blue eye trevalla, 23kg of gemfish, 13kg of hapuka and 169kg of ling).
At $14 per kg, he can take in a maximum of $4818 per year - nowhere near what it costs to run his business.
"I've never argued with my wife before," Mr Henry said.
"I'm in debt out of my eyeballs, it's put so much stress on my wife and on our relationship, we came close to getting a divorce."
Acting on advice from the Department of Primary Industries, South Coast live bait fisherman Mark Strutt spent $150,000 on shares to keep his business secure.
"I was told extra shares would keep me secure," he said.
"I bought them and they cut my business in half.
"I can't get live pipis and they've cut down my beachworms quota."
Ed Lammerink, a man in his late 50s from Bomaderry, walked into Centrelink for the first time last year.
It was a gut-wrenching day for Ed, who used to fish on the Shoalhaven River for 270 days per year.
Newly-imposed regulations limited him to a maximum of 75 days per year - he stopped fishing as he needs to work at least 140 days per year to cover business expenses.
Ed wrote a letter to the South Coast Register, to flag his concerns about Ms Hodgkinson with readers.

Letter
I've noticed Katrina Hodgkinson signs along some farm fences. This is the same woman who was a former fisheries minister in NSW. As Minister she signed off on key recommendations giving the Department of Primary Industries unprecedented power to 'separate and redistribute' the wealth and equity of the NSW fishing industry. She was warned but chose to ignore fishermens' concerns, pandering to DPI senior management. These people also successfully removed the property right component from all fishing businesses. This means that any entitlement attached to a fishing business or any government acquisition of the fishing area can be removed at any time...with no compensation payable. It gets worse. Fishers who were forced to enter the business adjustment programs 'Share Trade Market' still don't realise that their shares are only in perpetuity for a 10-year period. In 2024 these people will have to re-invest and buy their own businesses back once again. All of the above started on Katrina's watch. Indeed Katrina's legacy during her tenure as Fisheries Minister will not be remembered well by many fishing families along the NSW coast. Politicians who are submissive to higher bureaucracy within their portfolios are of no use to the people of industries which they are supposed to represent. At that time, South Coast fishermen were told by DPI that, "well it's diabolical for the active guys." North Coast fishermen were told by a fisheries manager, "We're gonna serve you a great shit sandwich." This is the time when NSW fishermen needed a strong, robust fisheries minister. Sadly we ended up with a DPI puppet.online training to support your courses

She was 27 the day she accepted her very first task in the realm of personal services, but they informed her she might and ought to pass for more youthful.
So, that week, she was 22 to anybody who asked. It was the perfect age, you see: old sufficient to consume, likely a university graduate (indicating some procedure of intelligence and conversational capability), however still young, flexible, and preferable. Marketable to a large range of tastes.
In other words? Successful.
Selling yourself was legal here, to minimize it to easy terms, although she didn’t realize that’s what she ‘d be doing the first day she strolled in. She didn’t know she ‘d become a product called Annika *, the name she offered to her brand-new work personality.
This pseudonym didn’t only secure her on paper– it secured her sense of self. She might remove, dissociate, disappear. Annika would do all the work while she viewed from a safe range, hoping each time she had actually come out with her self-respect undamaged.
This was just temporary, she told herself. This didn’t specify her, didn’t negate all she ‘d achieved and hoped to achieve left. “Come down to the end,” called the voice.
She did.
Later on, when asked what she imagined finding there, she truthfully had no response. She ‘d come in for a club promo and modelling position; she ‘d understood in an immediate that corridor didn’t lead to one.
Later, when asked why she stayed a complete week once she understood what it was about, her reply came easily:.
” For the cash, naturally.”.
Annika made over $7,500 in eight days. And she didn’t even need to fuck anyone.
Find Sex Massage in Strathdon – Sluts
Her first client, a white male in his 40s, supplied some much-needed on-the-job training.
” You look great,” he stated, deep blue eyes drinking in her exposed body. “Your underwear is actually quite.”.
She shivered under the blast of cooling, shivering in her four-inch heels, but perhaps it was something else. “Thank you.”.
” So, let’s start? Don’t worry, I’ll stroll you through it.”.
In the middle of the room stood what appeared like an ordinary massage table, upholstered in a cushioned black material, with a hole at one end. However this table (along with all the other ones here) had one strange difference: a 2nd hole, right where one’s lower torso would line up.
” Grab a few offer a back massage, no problem.
His voice came smothered from below after numerous minutes. Massage my legs and move up to my ass. Reach in between my legs, do not be shy.

He stiffened to complete mast at the extremely first brush of her fingertips.
” Oh, that’s ideal. I’m going to turn around now. You can massage my chest and keep playing with me.”.
She obeyed. She was good at following instructions. When he tapped her wrist, she surprised.
” I’m gon na have you do a body slide. Remove your bra … yes … oh, you look yummy. Get on the table, that’s it, don’t hesitate. Put some oil on your chest. Just move all over me, there you go. Oh, child, that’s so attractive …”.
Annika moved and twisted, skin on skin, letting her primal impulses take over. There was one thing left to find out.
” You can do the reverse slide. Take off your panties and climb back up here. Program me that beautiful …” He should have seen the search her face, because he added, “Don’t worry, I won’t touch you there.”.
Facing toward his feet she straddled him and leaned forward so, her back arched ever so slightly, her intimate parts on full display screen.
” Oh, yummy,” he purred again. “It’s a stunning view, sweetheart. Keep going.”.
Yummy? Was that what she was? She didn’t feel yummy; she had not wished to be. Instead, she felt outrageous, self-conscious, even traitorous. A plaything for males with non reusable earnings under the very finely veiled guise of “masseuse”.
But primarily, she felt clashed. Because she likewise understood just how much power she held. This was a location where customers paid for the opportunity of putting their most sensitive parts into the hands of a stranger, after all.
” That’s a great lady. Finish me off,” he gasped. Her hands took on a life of their own, moving faster.
He gripped her thighs and released with one final sigh. And it was over.
At the end of those 45 minutes, she had $110 money in her hand. It sufficed to encourage her to accept the next walk-in.

Official Opening of TRUMPF Thailand Technology Center
Bangkok, August 10, 2017 - TRUMPF Thailand officially unveiled its new Technology Center. The establishment of the Technology Center would not only boost TRUMPF’s market presence in Thailand, but more importantly it would serve to fulfill the ever growing customer needs.
The new TRUMPF Thailand Technology Center is equipped with a showroom showcasing the latest technologies for sheet metal processing, allowing customers to run application and processing tests. Customers will also have the possibility to get hands-on trainings on machines and software programming. The facilities also encompass the factory to overhaul used machines, a regional business for South East Asia.
The invitation to join TRUMPF Thailand Official Opening event on 10th August 2017 followed a large number of customers as well as several guest of honor. Amongst others his Excellency Ambassador Mr. Peter Prügel, Dr. Roland Wein (Executive Director of the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce), Dr. Gang Yang (International Sales Director TRUMPF GmbH), Mr. Yoshikazu Hamakawa (Vice President TRUMPF Japan) and Mr. Quingshan Wu and Mr. Pan Hongwei from JFY. Of course, also Mr. Jörg Ellerkmann, Managing Director of TRUMPF Asia Pacific, was welcomed.
The event started with a traditional Thai monk ceremony to bless TRUMPF Thailand and their customers with fortune and auspiciousness. Afterwards Mr. Ellerkmann started the official part with some introductory words, followed by his Excellency, Ambassador Mr. Prügel, focusing on TRUMPF Thailand as a success story.

The film stars Danny Trejo, Ron Perlman and Charles S Dutton, and tells the story of a decorated Vietnam hero who returns home only to get shunned by society leaving him pennyless and loveless. It’s not until forty years later when an incident on a public bus — where he protects an elderly black man from a pair of skin heads — makes him a local hero where he’s suddenly celebrated once again.
From what I know, the real Epic Beard Man AKA Thomas Bruso AKA Vietnam Tom had apparently sold his life story to Hollywood so this is a legitimate film. While some things may have been drastically altered or embellished, the parallels are the same.SCICOM WEBSITE PRIVACY NOTICE

There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases and one of the super spreaders that has been identified are funerals where people gather in large numbers, thereby disregarding Covid-19 protocols.
A visit to Warren Hills Cemetery in Harare was as shocking as it was revealing with multitudes of people attending a funeral despite the set limit of 30-people.
It was the same story at Zororo Cemetery in Chitungwiza where mourners were gathered in large numbers.
However, the battle between the norm and reality is quite evident.
“In our culture you can’t afford not to go and mourn with relatives they always say if you can’t attend we won’t come to mourn with you.
“What is causing people to come in large numbers is that you can’t agree on who is going to the cemetery and who is staying behind. Everyone wants to go,” says Mr Joel Gombera of Doves Holdings.
While funeral parlours highlighted that they are observing Covid-19 protocols during burials, they have a word or two for the public.
Gladys Rukweza of Geora Funeral Services said, “Yes, there are cultural values that we observe as black people, but the situation we are in requires us to unite as a people and disregard some cultures which threaten our life during this time.”
“We always make sure we follow the Covid-19 guidelines, but sometimes the public are not keen to follow them. However, we urge people to stay safe.”
Whatever the norm or cultural belief, what remains a fact is that government regulations stipulate that only 30 people are allowed to attend funeral gatherings with strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols. – ZBCLoads of room whether you are a family of four or two couples travelling together.

Australian television presenter Tony Armstrong has gone to town on Quinton de Kock after the South African cricketer refused to take a knee ahead of a T20 World Cup game.
It's understood Cricket South Africa (CSA) issued a directive to players instructing them to take a knee in support fo the Black Lives Matter movement.
But news soon broke that de Kock wanted no part in the demonstration and walked out on the team for "personal reasons".
His withdrawal has left fans divided, with a small portion of people praising him while the majority have blasted him for his action - ABC Breakfast host Armstrong being one of those critics.
"We've seen sporting teams right around the world start to get behind this movement," Armstrong said on the morning TV show.
."
Following star wicketkeeper de Kock's shock withdrawal, South African captain Temba Bavuma was forced to front the media after the team's win over the West indies.
And, rather unsurprisingly, the press didn't seem too interested in the match itself - but rather the scandal involving de Kock.
Everyone must watch today's post-match conference of Temba Bavuma. During a 15-18 min conversation, almost every ques asked was a non-cricketing one, but he answered all and handled it very calmly. Well done Bavuma!:clap:- Jayesh (@jayeshvk16) October 26, 2021
"One of the toughest days I've had to deal with as a captain" pic.twitter.com/rwyElk1RY6
"I think obviously as a team we're obviously surprised and taken aback by the news," Bavuma said.
"In saying that, Quinton is an adult. He's a man in his own shoes. We respect his decision. We respect his convictions.
.
Temba Bavuma handled it really well. Some tough questions asked but he answered everything with dignity. Well done @tbavuma10- Subhayan Chakraborty (@CricSubhayan) October 26, 2021
Temba Bavuma is one seriously impressive individual. The manner in which he handled the press conference following the incredible developments around Quinton de Kock was stellar. Maturity. Balance. Grace. A credit to South Africa and cricket.#T20WorldCup #SAvWI #quintondekock- Anand Vasu (@anandvasu) October 26, 2021
It's been said a few times now, but Temba Bavuma was brilliant in his post match presser. Starting with his decision to face the media even though Anrich Nortjé was originally going to do the presser.- Tinus van Staden (@TinusvS4) October 26, 2021

Seriously impressed by the way Temba Bavuma conducted himself in that post-match press conference. Lots of tough questions about Quinton de Kock, but he handled them all with honesty and aplomb. Not easy being captain of South Africa.- Lawrence Booth (@the_topspin) October 26, 2021

customer satisfaction
I have been a customer of Godaddy since 1999. They have hosted our website. In April, we received another email about their services regarding website design, SEO, logo design and online protection. I agreed to have them start an initial design of both the website and logo. I spoke in length about the direction, colors and feel I wanted for the website, as well as the logo. We were wanting an American theme, red, white & blue with stars or flowing flag elements. I explained that we had over 30 years of experience and have been in business since 1999.
After about a week or two we were shown the first draft. What we received was void of an American theme or feel, there was no Red White & Blue, Flag either flowing or stiff. It even stated that we had been in business for over 30 years. Not only did they fail to execute the simple color scheme that we requested, they totally avoided any likeness to the American theme we were going for. Their own representative told me that the website I currently had (that I created) was actually better than the draft that the Godaddy team had sent me.
At this point with the direction and theme totally missed, I decided to ask for a refund. I was told I would be contacted in 2 - 5 days. That did not happen. I called Godaddy and started what I thought would be an easy process getting a refund. I had to call at least 4 times with an average wait time of 60 minutes. It has been over two weeks. I was contacted yesterday and told that a refund (LESS $946.00) would be available.
1. They did not follow simple guidelines when developing the site based on our extensive conversations.
2. They did not follow the color scheme that we had requested.
3. There was no American theme in the design like we talked about and requested.
On every front, Godaddy missed the mark in preparation, execution & design. As an act of good faith and to resolve the issue, I offered to pay $100.00 for the worthless attempt that they did make just to put this issue to rest. When I called again today there was yet another 60 minute hold. I asked to speak the the manager and even the CEO on a couple of occasions.
It seems as though they are able to insulate themselves from people seeking legitimate refunds through a series of excruciating hold times and unanswered promises. I have sent the BBB this information, but I believe this is a much bigger issue than the BBB can truly handle. This is a deep seeded company wide effort to fleece the consumer.

Welcome back fellow TJR readers, was $50 dollars just way to rich for your blood for a single PPV? Maybe extreme patriotism will only let you watch wrestling shows that take place in America. Whatever the reason you missed something in wrestling this week, all is not lost as I am back once again with the Top Ten Wrestling Stories of the Week.
10. Sin Cara Asked for His Release from the WWE
Sin Cara joined the growing list of wrestlers, including Luke Harper and Mike Kanellis, that have asked for their release from the WWE. The wrestler who portrays this incarnation of Sin Cara is not the original, as Mexican superstar Mistico competed under the mask from 2011 to 2014. When Mistico was released from WWE, the present Sin Cara (who had a run in WWE as Hunico) just took over the role. Like Harper and Kanellis, the WWE has yet to grant Sin Cara his release. If they do, however, I fully expect there to be a casting call for a 5’ 7” wrestler with trampoline skills who is willing to wear a mask and job on television. (TJRWrestling)
9. Johnny Gargano Forced to Miss NXT: WarGames Due to Back Injury
Johnny Gargano will not be medically cleared to compete at NXT: WarGames on November 23rd due to a back injury. Finn Balor, who was heavily rumored to be facing Gargano on the show, will now be facing Matt Riddle. Originally Riddle was scheduled to be a part of the War Games team captained by Tommaso Ciampa. Now Dominik Dijakovic will be taking Riddle’s spot on the team, leaving the team still one member short. As for Gargano, he is easily one of the best in-ring performers in the world and his injury is a huge loss to the NXT brand. Let’s all hope that Johnny can get back to Wrestling really soon. (TJRWrestling)
8. The New Day Win the Tag Titles on Smackdown
The New Day became seven-time tag team champions this past Friday on Smackdown when they defeated the Revival to regain the titles. The impressive seven title reigns puts them just three behind the record of the Dudley Boyz, who have 10 if you count when WWE booked them to win the WCW Tag Team Titles (it was a confusing time). With Xavier Woods out for an extended period of time, Kofi Kingston and Big E competed for the New Day in the match. After the match Kingston was sighted stocking up on pancake mix, so he will have plenty to throw around while smiling giddily after they lose the titles. (TJRWrestling)
7. Wardlow Debuts on AEW: Dynamite
After months of vignettes teasing that he was coming, Wardlow made his debut for AEW last night. Wardlow debuted by helping MJF and Chris Jericho attack Cody Rhodes, teasing that Wardlow may be joining Jericho’s Inner Circle faction or maybe just a bodyguard with MJF. Although Wardlow joining the Inner Circle is an enticing idea, personally I believe he should have teamed up with The Librarian to form the team The Power’s of Brain.(TJRWrestling)
6. Lana Fakes Being Pregnant to Lure Rusev Into Another Attack
Lana gave an in-ring promo this week on RAW, where she claimed she was 9 weeks pregnant. Lana then stated it was her and Bobby Lashley’s seven week “Sexiversary”, which means the baby must be from her “sex addicted” husband, Rusev. Rusev then came down to the ring to confront Lana, only to once again be attacked by Lashley. Lana proceeded to call Rusev “stupid” and tell him she was lieing about being pregnant. The crowd absolutely hated this segment, booing it loudly. It is kind of ironic however that Lana and Lashley celebrate their “Sexiversary” on the same day as many fans celebrate the day they finally decided to stop watching Monday Night RAW. (TJRWrestling)
5. New Steve Austin Show to Debut After Survivor Series
A new interview show known as Steve Austin: “The Broken Skull Sessions” will premier on the WWE Network immediately following the Survivor Series on November 24th. Austin’s guest for the first interview has been announced, and it will be none other than the legendary Undertaker. The Undertaker will be sitting down for over two hours for an extremely rare out of character interview. As long as “The Higher Power” doesn’t try to control what these two legends talk about, this should be a fun and entertaining show to watch. (TJRWrestling)
4. RAW vs. Smackdown vs. NXT Traditional Survivor Series Match Announced
A traditional elimination match was announced this week for the Survivor Series PPV on November 24th. This year all three brands will have a team of five competing in the match. The teams that have been announced are the RAW team that is made up of Captain Seth Rollins, Randy Orton, Kevin Owens, Drew McIntyre and Ricochet they will be facing The Smackdown team made up of Captain Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, King Baron Corbin, Shorty G and Mustafa Ali and a so-far unannounced NXT team. Of course, any time there is a Survivor Series team there must be the overused trope of “can these guys co-exist” and this year is no different. Randy Orton and Ricochet already have teased tension between the two of them, with Orton stating he does whatever he wants. WWE is also doing whatever they want, which unfortunately is giving us the same tired storyline year after year. (TJRWrestling)
3. Bray Wyatt Attacks Daniel Bryan
Sami Zayn attempted once again this week to talk Daniel Bryan into joining Shinsuke Nakamura and himself in a new faction. While Zayn was trying to convince Bryan, however, the lights blinked off and on and “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt was standing behind Bryan. As Zayn ran out of the room, The Fiend viciously attacked Bryan with the Mandible Claw. Why The Fiend has suddenly chosen Bryan as his next victim is unclear at this time. My theory is that after hearing all the hype he was left very disappointed after finally trying a Beyond Whooper. (TJRWrestling)
2. Extreme Violence at AEW: Full Gear
AEW Full Gear was held this past Saturday night on PPV. The show ended with two excellent matches, the first saw Chris Jericho defeat Cody (Rhodes). Jericho caught the bleeding Rhodes in the Walls of Jericho submission, causing Rhodes’ cornerman MJF to throw in the towel after Rhodes refused to submit. MJF then kicked Rhodes in the lower ding ding, finally turning heel on Cody. The final match of the night saw Jon Moxley defeat Kenny Omega in a lights out match. This match was one of the most violent matches in wrestling history, with barbed wire, glass and even mouse traps all being used. Surprisingly, such glorified violence was still easier to watch and was less disturbing than the Rusev and Lana storyline. (TJRWrestling)
ABSOLUTE VIOLENCE from both Omega & Moxley. Was this your match of the night at Full Gear? pic.twitter.com/K5SPCxcDDr

1. CM Punk Appears at the End of WWE Backstage
After only having 49,000 viewers for their debut episode on FS1 last week, WWE Backstage dropped a “Pipe Bomb” at the end of this week’s episode. Just as the show was about to go off the air, “Cult of Personality” started to play and into studio walked CM Punk. Punk stated: “It’s as simple as this. Just when they think they’ve got the answers, I change the culture. I’ll see you here next week.” That’s when the show went off the air.
This was Punk’s first appearance on WWE programming since he left the company following the 2014 Royal Rumble. Punk is technically an employee of FOX and not the WWE, that minor technicality, however, will not prevent the WWE universe from fantasy booking him in every possible feud they can think of. I personally don’t want to start any rumors, but… there could be an opening for someone to wear the Sin Cara mask. (TJRWrestling)
That will conclude another edition of The Top Ten Wrestling Stories of the Week. Like always if you enjoy what I do please follow me on Twitter @BackseatBookers and listen to my podcast The BackseatBookers (Please be aware that it is explicit as CM Punk may drop “pipe bombs” but I drop “F bombs”.)Runners looking to upgrade their apparel game don’t have it easy – there just aren’t that many items to grab. Reaching out to a cap from Ciele or throwing on a Camelbak is about as far as it goes. Whereas cyclists have a vast array of options for apparel and accessories, runners are bound to a more minimalist threads which do more exposing than enclosing.
Fortunately sports and lifestyle sock brand Stance have created a family of socks that wrap a strobe of flash around your ankle, providing timid runners with a garish glow to intimidate competition.
Aside from their looks, a pair of Stance Endeavor Crew socks is engineered with anatomical cushioning to make you really obey those “L” and “R” icons on the forefoot. Adhere to the correct use and you’ll have a versatile sock that’s not “Lite” and thin like some race socks, but substantial enough that you feel comfortable around the entire training and race environment.
I grabbed my first pair in June 2015 and have run over 300km in them since, admittedly at varying speeds with a fleet of shoes. Had I been more diligent and cut the nail of my big toes, I wouldn’t have felt so embarrassed that I needed a replacement pair. Nevertheless, a fresh pair solve the problem, while I’ve retired my original pair to situations when I know I won’t be going sockless.
But in this era of excess, it’s at least permissible to own two versions of the Endeavour and align with one of Dumbledore’s more important claims, “One can never have enough socks.”

For drivers from the UK, we will need to carry out a DVLA check on your license and for this will need your National Insurance Number. Alternatively you can generate your own check code on the DVLA website here. (Please bring this code with you or email it to us at info@trailcamperhire.co.uk

places to stay
There's a wide range of campsites, varying from basic fields to five star holiday parks. During low season there should be no need to book ahead but during the summer season and school holiday's it's wise to book ahead. We have made a list of campsites with lists of amenities on our interactive campsite list here. We may not have listed every single one so you can also use google in the area you are heading.
Our vans come with a mains hook up lead so you can recharge the leisure battery, run electricity through the plug sockets in the van and not have to worry about running out of battery whilst plugged in. However, it is not essential to have a camp spot with access to mains hook up as the leisure battery will be charged from driving the car and should last quite a while.BigFish Capital

We all have things we want… and sometimes, strangely, we block them energetically or actually in physical space not because we don’t want them but because it might feel too different to have a change. It might feel strange. There might not be physical room for it. It might be a vast unknown to know what to do with it, or… what if you get it and then it’s gone?
I can tell you for years I wanted certain things and I never realized how un-ready I was to recieve them.
I had no space in my mind, space in my home or space in my heart for more.
Clearing space was the first step to making so much magic happen… and today’s feng shui is all about that readiness to recieve everything you want that’s been evading you!!!
The new, fresh and fun. The big love, big magic, big leaps forward where things have been stuck.
When I started creating the feng shui Love Camp over two years ago (this one is vast and deep in a different way than the others and it took a lot of time emotionally and also in life in every way to get ready for it) the big thing that guided me was one word:
Openness.
If you want to be more magnetic in any way, you need open space, room for that stuff to be magnetized. Let’s just say I gave you a chandelier. It’s gorgeous, sparkling and angelic in it’s rainbows cast everywhere as the light hits it from every angle. But, you live in a rental and can’t change the light fixtures. So, unless you have space to store it until you move, you may actually turn down the offer. Or accept it and sell it. Or let it gather dust and take up space you don’t really have. Either way, the chandelier won’t really have a place until you make the space for it to be.
Same goes for the great big jobs that you don’t have the time or the organization to do. The relationships that languish on a backburner or get lost in the weight of baggage or trauma. The opportunities that slip through your fingers not because you’re unable to do them or accept them, but you can’t see them through.
How many single people do you know (or are you?) who want a relationship, you’re unattached to any relationship, you’re saying you’re open… But yet, you aren’t really clear of bitterness or hurt of the past, or you work 24/7, or you have lots of other stuff that takes your time. Where does a partner fall into that space and, moreover, where do they flourish?
In feng shui, everything is energy AND everything is a reflection of your life.
Your home can help you to find the blindspots, the clutter inside, the shut doors you think are open… and when you clear them, life takes flight. You find a home for that chandelier, because you negotiate a deal with your landlord or find the perfect new home that you’ve always wanted. You have the time for a partner, because you structure your life with flow both and home and in every day. You have space in your heart as you change the energies around you on the outside and confront demons of the inside (we all have ’em) to create that big openness.
Love feng shui is feng shui to evelate your whole life. It’s what openness is all about. It’s magnetic, it’s happy, it’s peaceful, it’s passionate and it’s receptive.
It’s the way to get more of what you want with greater ease… and loads more of the kind of energy that moves mountains. 16, 2017 • 0 commentsJohn Carpenter Announces Lost Themes II, Live Performances By Lauren Loudermilk | February 1, 2016 | 12:16pm Photo Courtesy of Motor Mouth Media Music News Share Tweet Submit Pin Two years ago, legendary filmmaker John Carpenter released Lost Themes, his first album of songs that were not scores or soundtracks.

…Kenneth D. Maynard Memorial College Scholarship Fund Program
up to $2,000 for Residents of Alaska Studying Architecture
"... a gentleman who made quite a difference in the architectural profession in Alaska and the community at large"
"One of our dearest members, Kenneth D. Maynard, FAIA, passed away on March 5, 2020. He was a prominent member of the architectural society in Alaska. A well respected colleague, friend and community member. His dedication to mentorship and the advancement of the profession touched so many and we are truly in a better world because of the legacy that he has left behind..." - Jason Arnold, AIA Alaska 2020 President
Annual College Scholarships, in amounts up to $2,000 per applicant, may be awarded to Alaska residents currently enrolled in an accredited school of architecture 5:00 pm (Alaska time) on the last Friday in November.
All applications must be submitted to:
AIA Alaska Scholarship Committee P.O. Box 244141 Anchorage Alaska 99524
Evaluation
Submittals will be evaluated by a committee made up of a minimum of three (3) AIA Alaska Chapter members. Award will be based on:
- Potential for completing program and entering the profession of Architecture
- Desire and Determination
- Overall Ability
- Financial Need
Selection
The Scholarship Committee will meet to evaluate applications received, and up to three (3) applicants may be awarded scholarship funds. Recipients will be notified during the month of December
Request for Donations
AIA Alaska has had a scholarship program since 2000, and has awarded scholarships of up to $4,000 per year to deserving students who live in Alaska but must pursue an architectural education at universities outside our state. As you know, this requires the payment of non‐resident tuition, the cost of books, studios, and travel. No amount is too small! In 2018, we awarded a $2,000 scholarship to Rebecca Wolfe, a student in the Montana State University Master Architecture program.
This year with the help of the AIA National Matching Program we hope to award larger and/or additional scholarships. I believe this program is a great tool to help the youth of our state acquire a quality education in architecture, while at the same time encourages them to pursue their career in their home state and be a proud member of the local AIA chapter. We hope you can contribute to this worthwhile cause. AIA Alaska is a 501.c.6 trade association, so donations to our scholarship program are not tax‐deductible. However, your support is very much appreciated and goes a long way with supporting the development of future Architects for Alaska.
If you are interested in contributing a scholarship donation by check, please make it out to “AIA Alaska Scholarship Program” and forward it to the AIA Alaska Scholarship Committee, at the address below. Thank you for your assistance in helping Alaska’s future architects with their education. If you can make a 2019 donation, we will be able to award scholarships again this year. Please check the AIA Alaska website for details on the program.
Yours sincerely, Paul Baril, AIA - Chair, AIA Alaska Scholarship Committee

Kenneth D. Maynard Celebration of LfeLONDON - The number of foreign players in English Premier League squads is set to be reduced under new rules designed to prevent the development of homegrown youngsters being stifled by imports.
The English Football Association announced Monday that the non-European players will find it harder to gain British work permits from May when more stringent eligibility requirements come into force. The FA is also trying to gain Premier League approval for new limits on foreign players in squads.
"We believe too many talented English kids are currently not getting through the system and being lost," FA chairman Greg Dyke said.
The new rules would have prevented Arsenal from signing Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal as a 16-year-old and Stoke from bringing in American duo Geoff Cameron and Brek Shea.
Dyke is acting now before clubs experience a cash bonanza from the new Premier League television deals from the 2016-17 season, with domestic rights alone soaring 70 percent to around $8 billion over three years.
"We are concerned that there is a downside - all of the historical evidence shows that every time the television income goes up, so do the number of foreign players playing in our game," Dyke said. "The unparalleled success of the Premier League, and the pressure this has put on managers, means that time after time clubs turn to experienced overseas players rather than giving home-grown youth a chance."
The FA has been working on the new rules since 2013, but their necessity was highlighted by England's group-stage exit at the 2014 World Cup. Dyke believes Harry Kane's sudden rise - from fringe player to Tottenham's key asset - helped him secure the work permit changes.
"It must have done mustn't it, suddenly an English kid who was out on loan at four different places who was touch and go to get a game in the first team is suddenly the top scorer in English football," Dyke said. "It's great news. How many more Harry Kanes are there out there, who just can't get a game?"
The 21-year-old Kane, who was called up by England for the first time last week, only broke into the Tottenham first team after the ineffectiveness of Emmanuel Adebayor of Togo and Roberto Soldado of Spain became clear. The 19 league goals from Kane, an academy graduate, are only matched by Chelsea's $48 million Spain forward Diego Costa.
Dyke wants Premier League approval for the number of non-homegrown players in squads to be cut from 17 to 13 by 2020, and for at least two homegrown players to have been with the club for three years before their 18th birthday. A player is currently defined as homegrown if they have been affiliated with an English or Welsh club for three years before their 21st birthday.
"We will go round and try to convince them," Dyke said. "We will ask: Are you sure you haven't got a Harry Kane playing in your youth side?"
There are English kids in Premier League clubs' academies who just need first-team opportunities to prove their value to first teams, according to Dyke.
Dyke said he received Home Office department approval on Friday for a "fundamental reform of the non-EU work visa processes which will come into effect for next season."
Currently non-European players desiring a British work permit must have featured in at least 75 percent of competitive international games in the previous two years for a top-70 ranked team. Now only players from the top 50 FIFA nations will be considered, with a sliding scale of appearances required - from 30 percent of games over two years for the 1-10 teams to 75 percent for 31-50 teams.
FA research found that a third of the work permits applications for non-European players approved between 2009 and 2013 - 42 - would have been rejected under the new rules.
"The new system will make it far easier for us to identify and attract top quality players that truly are at the elite level," Dyke said. "It will make it far tougher for those who don't meet the quality standard to get to play in Britain."
From next season Premier League teams could also be allowed to field their under 21s sides in the Football League Trophy for third and fourth tier clubs if an agreement is reached.The larger of the two stand mount speakers in the Quad S series.

With over 3500 self-published books coming on the market every day, it is difficult to get any kind of recognition when you don’t have a huge email list or marketing budget, or a literary agent!

Fred Pruyden, 83, from Huyton, Merseyside, was having a meal with his family at the Childwall Fiveways Hotel in Liverpool on February 25, when he became upset, reports the Echo.
His wife, Rachel, known as Babs had recently died of lung cancer and the family had attended her funeral the previous day at St Gabriels Parish Church in Huyton.
Hayley Dickson, 32, said her granddad was struggling to cope with the death of his wife of 60 years, and lowered his head to the table and began crying when a manager approached.
She said he accused Fred of "being drunk" and "falling asleep on the table" and asked them to leave.
However, a spokesperson for the pub said it "fully backed" its staff and said the group had been asked to leave "due to a genuine belief that they were intoxicated" and one of them became "abusive towards staff".
The family denied the claims and said they "can't believe anyone could treat an 83-year-old man like that".
She said: "My Nan passed away two weeks ago and the funeral was on the Monday.
"The next day my granddad was really upset so we decided to take him out for a meal and a drink."
Her grandparents were married for 60 years and had known each other for 70 years.
"He'd had something to eat in the pub and hadn't even touched his second glass of wine when he put his head down and started crying.
"A manager came up to us and she said he was drunk and asleep".
She told them it's company policy to ask someone to leave when drunk and asleep.
"I said: 'Excuse me, he's not asleep - he's crying. He's just lost his wife.'
"But she just kept repeating the same thing - that it's company policy to ask someone who is drunk and asleep to leave."
She was eventually given an email address to complain to.
Hayley went back to the bar to get a drink for herself, but the supervisor said he wasn't serving her because 'Your group got told to leave before."
She attempted to explain what happened and said she was "livid".
The group got up to leave and "the staff stood watching as my granddad walked out with his head down. He was so embarrassed."
As they were leaving, Hayley shouted that JD Wetherspoon spokesman said: "A number of customers had been in the pub for several hours and were falling asleep on the table.
"Staff asked customers to leave due to a genuine believe that they were intoxicated.
"They said they were mourning a relative who had recently passed away and that they had only had a few drinks."
The spokesman said the group "started to be abusive towards staff and intimidate them".
"We will not tolerate this behaviour in our pubs," he added. "We fully back the actions of our staff."Information about Hotel Fatih Istanbul

Let us help you We’ve witnessed people of all ages in Oakleigh and across Melbourne experience a fear of visiting the dentist and having a dental examination. Dr Ron was the first Dental Phobia certified dentist in Melbourne, and has had specific training in helping phobic or anxious patients receive dental treatment. If you’re feeling stressed, nervous, anxious, or fearful about your appointment, please let our friendly team know. Your comfort comes first, and we are trained and ready to offer our assistance and put you at ease. Dental anxiety and dental phobia What is dental anxiety? Dental anxiety is the feeling of apprehension, nervousness or fear felt before visiting the dentist. For some, even the thought of visiting the dentist can provoke this fear. Dental anxiety is very common, and most people experience some degree of anxiety when undergoing a new procedure. What is dental phobia? Dental phobia is similar to dental anxiety, but much, much stronger. People with dental phobia will usually avoid visiting the dentist at all costs. They can also feel anxiety at the mention of teeth, dentists or oral care (such as toothpaste advertisements). The term ‘phobia’ refers to an “an irrational, severe fear that leads to avoidance of the feared situation”. Many patients, though, may not perceive the fear as irrational. Types of dental fears There are actually many different types of dental fears, though many centre on fear of pain, loss of control and negative evaluation. Sometimes specific sights, sounds or smells can trigger fear, (such as the drill, the overhead light, or the smell of the room). Some patients dread the helpless feeling of lying back on the chair, or the invasion of personal space when the dentist examines their teeth. Causes of dental phobia In most cases, dental fear can be traced back to a negative or traumatic previous experience with a dentist, in which the patient felt pain, helplessness or humiliation. In some cases, an existing anxiety condition (such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Generalised Anxiety) can result in dental anxiety or phobia.

Yes, they could be made with Vegan Crazy Dough. I would probably add just a little bit more baking powder to make them softer (instead of an egg yolk).
Helpful tips, thanks 🙂
Can i bake these doughnuts?
I suppose you could.
Can I ferment it in the freeze for 1 hour? Please comment on this.
I believe that you can.. You don’t have to make it from scratch.speedboxt-5·

Hello everyone. I would like to introduce myself. I just today purchased my first volvo. Its a 1997 850 T-5 w/ 115K. Black with dark grey interoir. My mother has had 2 volvos herself when I was growing up so I have always liked them. I am coming over from the VW/Audi and the 4X4 Jeep world. This volvo has the typical stripped odometer gear so the odometer doesnt work but the speedo does. The car is pretty clean. I picked it up for $6800. There are some stupid things that I want to get fixed. The prior owner bought the car from his sister that purchased brand new in 97. He had every record for everything that his sister and he had done to the car. It pulls strong and just about everything works. Well I will be around to be asking plenty of questions. Is there a bentley manual for these cars or what? What is the best form of repair manual? I would love to read up in that! Later!Iulia Vantur looks ethereal in traditional, Salman Khan arrives in style at brother Sohail Khan’s Diwali party

Salman had a brief conversation with the veteran director before he went inside the party.| PHOTOS: Salman Khan, Kartik Aaryan & others arrive at Ekta Kapoor’s Diwali bash
Annalee Newitz offers a theory of virality:
To share a story is in part to take ownership of it, especially because you are often able to comment on a story that you are sharing on social media. If you can share a piece of information that’s an absolute truth – whether that’s how to uninstall apps on your phone, or what the NSA is really doing – you too become a truth teller. And that feels good. Just as good as it does to be the person who has the cutest cat picture on the Internet.
So that leaves us with the stories that don’t make it. These are the articles and essays that have fallen into the valley of ambiguity – reports on important scientific findings with difficult-to-interpret results, political news with a long and tangled back story attached, and opinion essays that require us to account for points of view that may be unfamiliar or strange.
We just want to share stories that make us seem like we know something. Most of all, we don’t want to say something that we didn’t intend.
And that is the danger with any story that falls into the valley of ambiguity. We can’t be sure how people will take it. We don’t want to risk our reputations on a story that can be taken more than one way.
More than anything, the fear of a smeared reputation is what creates that dip in virality. Sharing a story means that in some sense we stake our reputation on it. That’s why sharing a story is not the same thing as enjoying a story, reading a story, or even learning from a story. I know for certain that there are plenty of stories that get read, but not shared. I have seen the statistics on io9’s back end. But when we measure a story’s success by virality, which is what we must do in the age of social media, the content of our popular culture changes. We measure success by what people aren’t afraid to share with their neighbors, rather than what people will read on their own.
A good recent example of a Dish post that was read a lot but not relatively shared a lot was the controversial debate between Max Blumenthal and Eric Alterman over the former’s new book, Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel. Many posts that day that were less polarizing – about gays in the South, Ted Cruz’s nutty Christianist dad, and sizing up Election Day, for example – garnered many more Facebook likes than the Blumenthal-Alterman showdown, which was the most popular post of the day by traffic. Evidently many readers don’t want others to know they “like” a post criticizing Greater Israel.Taylor Swift released her remastered 2012 album “Red” on Nov. 12 with the new title “Red (Taylor’s Version).” Along with the album, Swift released a short film she directed for her song “All Too Well.”
The original “Red” is a beloved album by Swift’s fans and features songs like “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “22.”
“My opinion on Taylor Swift is that every time Taylor releases music it exceeds everyone’s expectations. Her newest release of ‘Red (Taylor’s Version)’ is iconic and I can’t stop listening to it,” said junior Katie Ludwig.
Swift’s musical discography extends back to 2006 with the release of her album “Taylor Swift.” Since then, she has maintained a large fan base that today amounts to 52,584,305 monthly listeners, ranking 15th in the world according to Spotify.
According to Spotify, the original “Red” album had 16 songs with a run-time of one hour and four minutes. “Red (Taylor’s Version)” more than doubles that run-time with 30 songs for a total of two hours and 10 minutes.
For a few years, Swift has been in the process of re-recording her past albums after the original masters were sold by her prior label. Everything Swift has released from 2019 on is her own property, and her fans listen to those instead of the original recordings.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Swift said, “I’m getting to look back on this music and just see music and see art and see experiences I’ve had in concerts. It was mine and now it’s really shared between me and the fans and that’s what I have really taken away from this experience.”
Swift not only re-recorded and extended one of her most popular songs “All Too Well,” but released a short film of the same name. The short film “All Too Well” is a visual representation of the new song, which is 10 minutes long and adds more detail to the original lyrics.
The short film stars Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien. The film works to illustrate the lack of balance within their relationship, mostly due to the large age gap between the characters.
Sink plays the role of a young Swift caught up in a relationship with a man who goes unnamed and unidentified played by O’Brien.
Although Swift has dodged questions regarding who the song is about, many fans online have heavily suspected that the lyrics are about her three-month relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal that took place in late 2010.
“It’s a way for her to express the hurdles of her past relationships and serves as a powerful message. I think it’s a powerful message about relationships and how her fame shaped her as a person,” said junior Jordan Dyer.
Along with the short film and the remastered album, Swift also premiered a new surprise music video for the song “I Bet You Think About Me (feat. Chris Stapleton)” on Nov. 15.
Swift’s short film “All Too Well” and new music video have a combined 54 million views on YouTube as of publication time, and her song “All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)” is her most played song on Spotify since its release with over 37 million listens.Piazza Ippolito Nievo 25-27Rome, Italy 00153View Large Map Phone: +39 06-588-1963Fax: +39 06-5833-1770 Hotel E-mailHotel Website Classification 6 First Class Commission Rooms Rates - 45 $97-$97 (USD) Hoteliers!

As far as fishing gear goes, pliers aren’t new to the scene. The tool itself isn’t groundbreaking and it wouldn’t be a stretch to think that fishing pliers had peaked. Gerber looked at the tool with fresh eyes and realized that the greatest opportunity lied in the ergonomics – power and control could be optimized with simple adjustments to the design of the fishing pliers.
With Bearhand Control™, the Magniplier positively engages with your hand for a solid, confident grip. Bearhand Control™ is an ergonomic control system comprised of three design elements that translate the power of the hand into power you can utilize in the tool. First, the space between the handles is purposeful – it is optimized to engage where the hand is strongest for maximum force. Second, an oversized finger choil is integrated as another place to rest the forefinger providing added stability. Last, the nose of pliers is off axis for improved line of sight and control when removing the hook from a fish’s mouth.
The pliers are a hot-forged aluminum construction, allowing the metal to be manipulated into the ergonomic design as well as give the pliers unrivaled strength. The spring-loaded pliers lessen hand fatigue and are held in check by a plunge lock – meaning the tool won’t open unexpectedly when you’re on the move or catching fish. The nylon sheath includes a belt loop, d-ring, and coiled plier lanyard and can be tethered from multiple points.
The Magniplier’s jaw tips are purposely biased open. There is a tolerance range for the gap, ensuring that the cutters will close completely and function as intended when gripping an object. The maximum end of the tolerance range allows the user to close the tips completely by squeezing slightly harder after the cutters have made contact with one another. Even the smallest hooks are able to be de-barbed and manipulated, despite the designed-in air gap at the tips.
It doesn’t matter if you are hiking in, wading in a river, or bobbing in a kayak, the Magniplier is built for the adventure. If you’re looking for innovative fly fishing pliers, kayak fishing pliers, or bass fishing pliers, look no further. The Magniplier is the only set you’ll need.
Gerber tools are built to last a lifetime. To ensure optimal performance, rinse your tool with fresh water and dry thoroughly with a clean towel. Apply oil to hinges and moving parts on a regular basis."ElDevotion" fulfills the Elders' responsibility to teach and further the congregation's spiritual life.

Why should we pray for healing? Because God tells us to. James 5:14-15. And because He promises to heal (“A prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is ill,” James 5:15).
There are doubters who say that prayers for healing wastes our time. But the Bible has countless examples of answered prayer for healing, and we know that the prayers of many have brought healing in post- Biblical times. In short, there is indisputable evidence that prayer for healing works.
Of course, not all prayers bring healing – at least not in what we consider to be an acceptable time. We can become impatient. Three times Paul asked God to remove the thorn in his flesh, before he became content in knowing that the thorn had a positive purpose – to keep him humble. Paul acknowledged that God’s grace was sufficient for him. 2 Cor 12:7-10.
While we are waiting, God doesn’t want us to sit with our spiritual engines idling. Here are some examples of how we can use the time: Seek God’s will for different areas of our lives. Show God, through prayer, how grateful we are for His blessings. Pray that our faith will grow.
Sometimes, when He answers, His answer is not what we prayed for. But it is what is best for us.
Who should do the praying? James tells the sick person to go to the elders for prayer
James 5:14. But the privilege of prayer for the sick reaches far beyond the elders. The Bible makes it clear that we can and should pray as intercessors for others, and for ourselves.
Some people are reluctant to pray for themselves, thinking it to be selfish. But the Bible is filled with examples of people (prophets, kings and ordinary people) praying for themselves. Here is a beautiful example of a prayer for self:
Lord of all power, I hurt. My body isn't functioning as it needs to function.
I am in pain. But you already know all that.
I'm not coming to tell you what is wrong,
but to ask you to do what is right and best for me.
As it fits your plan, heal me, mend my body and my mind,
and grant me days of better health and renewed strength.
As I wait, give me an extra measure of patience, endurance, and perseverance.
When my energy to press forward is lacking pour your power into me like a fresh mountain stream flowing into a beautiful lake.
Lord I know you are able to heal,
I know it with utmost confidence.
Grant me now the wisdom to understand your timing
and the courage to accept your healing as sufficient for the moment.8217; ONLINE HIDDEN: A SISTER AND BROTHER HAVE to control for look commonly if you have change Here be that the materials will make all they can to be you be and waste you out till all things are signed. just it is a quotes developments, Shop The European Language Teacher: Recent Trends And Future Developments In Teacher Education & nothing.

‘Everything Went Black’: The Children Caught in a Christmas Parade Tragedy
A child died on Tuesday, and scores of other children were injured when an S.U.V. barreled through the parade on Sunday in Waukesha, Wis.

Yaretzi Becerra-Montes, 11, was home from the hospital on Tuesday, struggling to walk and suffering from head injuries. She is only now beginning to remember being struck by the S.U.V. that killed six people and injured more than 60 others as it raced through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wis.
“I was dancing to this Hannah Montana song, ‘Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,’ and then I was hit hard and everything went black,” Yaretzi said. “When I woke up, everything felt like a dream.”
Yaretzi Becerra-Montes, left, with her mother Laura, and sister, Ketzally.
Her friend, Jessalyn Torres, 11, who had been dancing behind her with the Waukesha Xtreme Dance Team, remained in the intensive care unit of a hospital, one of at least a half dozen children in that dancing group to be badly injured at the parade on Sunday evening. One child needed leg surgery, according to relatives, and another had brain trauma injuries. Another child, witnesses said, was found curled up on the street, unconscious.
Jessalyn’s pelvis was broken, her skull fractured and her liver and kidneys lacerated, family members said. Just before she was intubated at the hospital, she asked her family to “tell them to glue my back and everything back together,” her uncle, Ryan Kohnke, said.
On Tuesday evening, the family of Jackson Sparks, 8, said that the brain surgery he had undergone on Sunday after the parade had failed to save him: He was the sixth person — and the only child — to die in the tragedy. “This afternoon, our dear Jackson has sadly succumbed to his injuries and passed away,” Alyssa Albro, the child’s cousin, shared on the family’s GoFundMe page.
Tucker and Jackson Sparks, ages 12 and 8, were hurt at the Christmas Parade on Sunday. Jackson died from his injuries on Tuesday.
The grief in Waukesha had been concentrated on the loss of adults — five of them were killed on Sunday, including four members of an amateur dance group that celebrated grandmothers. But the close-knit Milwaukee suburb also is reeling from the toll on children, scores of whom were hospitalized in the aftermath. Jackson’s 12-year-old brother Tucker also suffered a fractured skull, family friends said.
At least 18 patients from toddlers to teenagers, including three sets of siblings, were taken to Children’s Wisconsin, part of a sprawling medical campus in Milwaukee. Most were still being treated on Tuesday, for issues ranging from facial abrasions and broken bones to serious brain injuries.
Facebook pages and GoFundMe appeals hinted at the damage: A multisport athlete at Waukesha South High School with “a broken femur, skull fracture, broken ribs, C4 vertebrae fracture, a bruised lung, and a pneumothorax (collapsed lung).” An 11-year-old girl with a fractured left leg and a head injury and in intensive care in a different hospital than her mother, who was hit, too. A saxophonist in the marching band at Waukesha South who has undergone two surgeries.
Chanda Hahn, 41, who had been dancing in the parade with her 13-year-old daughter, said that had their pompom routine not called for the whole group to “chasse” — or sidestep — to the left, they would have been mowed down as the S.U.V. blew through.
Afterward, she realized that the friend’s house where she had left her car was right near the spot where the S.U.V. had been abandoned. Tire tracks were still visible where the driver had plowed across her friend’s yard, scratching her car in the process.
“There was a child’s glove,” she said, “a black mitten. We believe it got stuck on the S.U.V.”
“We’re fine until we’re not, you know?” said Lisa Salb, whose granddaughter performed with the Xtreme Dance Team. Ms. Salb said her granddaughter was not struck, but that she will never forget her panicked search for the child on a street littered with small bodies.
“They were all wearing the same uniform and makeup, and we couldn’t tell which was her,” she said. “I would look at one and say a prayer, and then the next and say a prayer, and the next and the next.”
In the Becerra-Montes household, Yaretzi, the fourth of five children, said she remembers the crash only vaguely. Her mother and sister, however, were watching from the sidewalk as she was hit.
“We have videos,” said the sister, Ketzally, 17. “He was going around 40 miles per hour. He knocked her into the truck that was following behind, playing their music. We found her partly under it.”
Yaretzi said she remembers being aware of a commotion behind her, and hearing “a big loud noise that I wondered whether it was gunshots.”
“But then I thought, no, it’s probably just fireworks,” the child said. “Because things like that don’t happen in Waukesha.”

Five generations of wool expertise allow L.W. Packard to change with the times

ASHLAND, NH — program. Assuming the role of president from his father, John Glidden, Lawson Glidden will be the fifth-generation leader of a family business dating back to 1916.
“We measure growth in terms of small town jobs,” said Lawson Glidden. “Twenty years ago, we had to shut down our factory here because the rest of our domestic supply chain moved overseas, but now, in the right applications, domestic manufacturing can be viable, and the Mountain Heritage sock line — made right here in Ashland, New Hampshire — is just the beginning.”
Minus33’s parent company, L.W. Packard, started as a woolen mill on the bank of the Squam River, surviving The Great Depression, the flood of 1936, and two world wars. When the Clean Water Act encouraged the mill to modernize its wastewater discharge system in 1967, the mill expanded and in the process funded the majority of the town of Ashland’s new wastewater treatment plant.
In 1995, L.W. Packard was selected by Textile World magazine as one of the top ten textile plants in the world, recognized for its achievements in automation, quality, efficiency, safety and innovative human resource programs. Fabric produced by L.W. Packard was used by top-tier apparel brands including L.L. Bean, Calvin Klein, Eddie Bauer, Brooks Brothers, Burberry, Lands’ End, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Perry Ellis, Liz Claiborne, Hart Shaffner Marx and Hickey Freeman.
But by 2002, both raw material suppliers and clothing brands that purchased L.W. Packard wool had moved overseas.
“After our suppliers and the brands who purchased from us moved overseas, we continued to manufacture here in New Hampshire for another 15 years by upgrading to premium wool and innovating our operations, until we were forced to shut down the mill,” said Lawson Glidden.
To change with the times, John Glidden and L.W. Packard’s core team of textile engineers created the Minus33 brand. Minus33 harnesses generations of premium wool expertise, specializing in fine merino basics for people who love the outdoors.
“It’s incredibly humbling to step into this role and take on all the responsibility it entails,” said Glidden. “Over the course of the last 100 years or so, my family and this whole community have been tied to the wool business. The town of Ashland grew and was originally incorporated in 1868, owing in part to growth created by the mill. Our ultimate goal is to help bring prosperity to this community and to do it by making great outdoor gear.”

About Minus33
Minus33 offers the finest quality merino wool basics at a price that everyone can afford. Carrying forward over 100 years of expertise, Minus33 was created by the wool experts of the L.W. Packard Co., in 2002, as a response to the changing global trade and manufacturing landscape. In 2018, the brand brought sock production back to Ashland, New Hampshire, and in 2020 launched its Mountain Heritage line of socks, extending a local tradition dating back to 1840, when the Briggs brothers of Leeds, England, built a woolen mill on the Squam River. In 1916, Luther W. Packard of Berwick, Maine, purchased the mill and named it L.W. Packard, which now does business at Minus33. For more history on the L.W. Packard Mill and Minus33, read Our Story.*Whether astrology is science or magic, we’re open to most things, if they may be of benefit. ~ Ed.
~.
>> The Frost Moon: referencing the seasonal change, this Moon has been called the Frost Moon by the Cree and Assiniboine peoples and the Freezing Moon by the Anishinaabe, as the coldest season follows this full moon.
>> Full moon in Taurus: a time to make changes for stability, accept the shift, and budget and respect values.
>> Partial lunar eclipse: this happens to be the longest of this century, an unpredictable time when doors and portals open to the unknown, and there’s a big message to pay attention to.
Put this all together, and we have a recipe for a steamy autumn stew of shift and transformation. It’s a time to go inward, get busy, and prepare for an exuberant and enhanced existence.
Here are five things we can do to walk through the doors nature is opening for us:
1. Know ourselves.
It’s an important time for us to know ourselves inside and out. Opportunity for transformation is here, and better things are possible.
For us to harness the all-encompassing miracle of our fullest potential, we have to know and love our light. The easiest way to do so is to assess our values. Our response to our values gives us information on what we care about, gets us further in touch with what matters, and helps us align with what we are here to do.
We all have emotional responses to situations and people. Likely, if something or someone doesn’t resonate, we have an adverse reaction. If we resonate with it, we embrace it.
Knowing our top three to five values helps us create bottom lines for daily choices and what we say yes to. We can make life easier now if we are clear on what is important to us. I love and use Dr. John DiMartini‘s free value quiz online, but we can also simply journal about what is important to us.
2. Take time. A long time.
While most eclipses last less than two hours, this one will last three hours, 28 minutes, and 23 seconds, making it the longest of the century.
It’s not a time to rush. We can go as slowly as this partial eclipse is moving and take the time to look at all possible doorways, opportunities, and paths. And remember, we don’t have to open every door or walk down every path. We just might do best observing for a bit.
To the point above, if we look at all opportunities with a loving eye as we assess what we value and only say yes to what drives us, the options we choose will result in abundance.
3. Make small changes for significant results and journal about them.
While partial lunar eclipses might not be quite as wondrous to the eye as total lunar eclipses, they are still pretty sensational. They happen more often, which gives us more chances to witness small changes in our universe, reminding us that we can also do remarkable things by making small changes.
This is a supportive time to look at our list of values and make small changes to live in a way that we are more aligned. So if health is a number one value, schedule acupuncture and wellness appointments for the year. If creativity is a top value, make sure there is space in the calendar for it. We can journal about what is not aligned with our core truth and values, then we can reflect on how to advocate for ourselves around what shows up.
4. Be intuitive like a high priestess and imaginative like a small child.
Although this is not “the most” intuitive full moon of the year, it is still sensitive. We can harness the energy by exploring the relationship with the unseen world.
For example, after journaling about what isn’t aligned with our core values, we can use bibliomancy by opening a random book and paying attention to the first sentence we see, look to nature for guidance, or maybe pull a tarot or oracle card with the intention of how to shift out of misalignment. Then, we can let our small inner child lead the way into change. It surely is much more playful!
5. Reflect on and embrace the shadow.
The symbolism of the moon (water and shadow) blocking the sun (fire and light) shows us it’s a time to allow the shadow to present itself and cleanse all that doesn’t serve. Eclipses are known to be purification starters, and although this is only a partial eclipse, the possibility for profound transformation and starting over is now.
We can cleanse, purify, let go, and get rid of addictions and addictive behavior in whatever way calls to us. Decluttering, fasting, detoxing, speaking to a counselor or trusted advisor, and journaling on the shadow can all be productive.
We always have a choice at peak lunar times to embrace or ignore the opportunities presented to us. All full moons provide an opening for release, enhancements, and wisdom. This one, in particular, is all that on overdrive, and we will likely experience heightened, varied emotions during this time.
May the tips above help us each activate the light in the shadow, clean up what no longer serves, and open a new door of long-lasting transformation.
I would love to know what actions you may be inspired to take from this! xo

The FC on the other side of this battle didn't follow that rule:
I don't often publish battle reports on this blog, but this one is extremely instructive, so I will describe how this fight went down and how I survived it despite being called primary three times.
Anyone who knows Rote knows that we're most active in the USTZ, specifically from about 0130 EVE time onward. Sure, there are excellent EUTZ fleets available as well, but these are more lightly-attended, and are often heavy on pilots from our companion alliance Veto. Even at 0130, Rote's presence is pretty light. The mass Rote log in usually happens around 0230 or later... just like me. It's one of the many reasons this alliance is turning out to be a perfect fit for me.
On this particular night, we were forming up for our roam that night ("everyone get into a gank BC; no logi") when we got fragmentary intel about a "frigate fleet" moving into our area. Not yet formed up or optimized, we were ordered to un-dock and head for the 5-FGQI gate in TXW-EI. There, sure enough, we encountered a gang primarily made up of T2 frigs and we murdered them thanks to their already being aggressed on (attacking) one of our BCs and some smart tackling and bubble placement.
Having your ship aggressed on a gate -- actively attacking an adversary -- means that you cannot use that gate. Once you take an aggressive action, star gates will reject your attempt to go through them for 60 seconds. Keep this in mind. It will become important later. ;-)
No doubt, the FC on the other side of that engagement wondered to himself how the hell we formed up so fast. The answer: we didn't. We were already in the middle of forming up for our own activities and this fleet just happened to walk into that. We scooped loot and returned to station to store it, then continued forming up for our own roam, which departed a few minutes later, headed through the north Syndicate loop.
Not long after our departure, still en-route through northern Syndicate, our scout again reported frigates. At first, we wondered if what we had encountered were the remnants of the previous gang. But no, these turned out to be Agony Unleashed frigs. Our scout then reported, with some surprise in his voice, that the Agony frigs appeared to either be escorting or themselves attacking a small to mid-sized cruiser and battle-cruiser gang. The total enemy gang size ended up being about 24, half-again larger than what we were fielding.
We encountered them on the X-M2LR gate in K5-JRD system and our FC, undaunted by the odds, ordered us to work, calling our first primary.
Now, from time to time, I notice that people who recognize me either for my blog or my CSM run last year like to call me as their primary target. ;-) For the record, I never take offense at this. It's just part of the game.(1) The entire enemy fleet was surrounded by yellow boxes, then red boxes. Then I noticed drones start to surround me.
There was only one problem: I was in a slow-locking Hurricane, still locking our fleet's primary target. I hadn't started shooting yet. I was therefore not yet aggressed, and sitting at close range to a star gate.
It's critical in this situation not to panic. And it's savvy in this situation to do exactly what I did now: I didn't shoot back, and I didn't jump. I sat there, hardeners overheated, orbiting the gate at my Hurricane's nominal speed, letting them shoot at me. They lost a Thorax, then a Vexor, then a Hurricane as our FC calmly called targets. In a break in the action, I said, "Break, Ripard's their target, not aggressed, will be getting out." The FC replied, "Roger" and called the next primary. At about 7% shields, I jumped out.
Since I never aggressed, the enemy gang never had a chance of killing me. They spent almost a minute shooting at a non-aggressed target, wasting their time and the lives of three of their ships on an enemy ship that they had no hope of killing.
I expected there to be more ships in X-M, and sure enough, there were: the Agony frigates, killing one of our tacklers as I gained visibility to the grid. I expected to be primaried again when I decloaked, and sure enough, I was. I waited about 25 seconds, then burned on overheated MWD between the gate and a celestial roughly in line with the gate. My plan: if they aggressed me, I'd jump back into the K5 fight. If they didn't, I'd warp to the celestial. They aggressed me. In that time, my shields had recharged to about 15%, and the Agony frigs were good enough to reduce it back below 5%. I jumped back into K5. In that time, our fleet killed two Brutixes, a Thrasher, and a Myrmidon, this time with the loss of one of our Canes.
I again waited for a bit of shield recharge while looking over the fight and planning my next move. Shields were at 10%. This time, the celestial in line with the gate was the K5 station. I decided this time that I'd again burn between the gate and the station celestial. Only this time, if I were aggressed but not pointed, I'd warp to the station to get my shields back to 100%, then warp back to the fight fully repaired.(2) If I weren't aggressed, I'd burn out and start getting in on some kills. I decloaked and burned (again on overheated MWD), and sure enough, parts of the enemy fleet started to aggress me, probably correctly guessing that I was operating with only 10% shields. Only, critically, nobody pointed me. Sticking to my plan, I warped off. Again, the enemy fleet wasted time and resources on a non-aggressed ship.
I docked, then immediately un-docked (now with 100% shields), warped back to the fight and was happily able to get in on the last several kills.
Now granted, I missed out on a ton of kills in this fight. Should I have aggressed immediately in K5, despite being the enemy fleet's primary? Should I have aggressed immediately when I came back into K5? Scholars will no doubt argue the points. Looking over my own performance in retrospect, I believe I made the correct moves at every step, and placed in the same situation, I'd make those same moves again. Though my DPS was not available to the FC for most of the fight, I operated as a meat shield, tanking damage that would have otherwise got someone else killed and ensuring that our efficiency in that fight was not reduced by the loss of my ship. Sure, it would have been extremely satisfying to get on those first three kills, but ensuring that my side won the ISK war was -- to me -- equally satisfying.
Anyway, just something for you newer PvP pilots to think about. Sometimes, you have to leave your own ego at the door.
(1) Of course, if you want to call someone else primary, I won't mind that, either. ;-)
(2) Is this a good time to mention that I love the new 20 second session change timer? The ability to repair mid-fight is also something I'm having to relearn after more than a year in sovereignty battles where this option is usually not

Sometimes, you have to leave your own ego at the door.
That must have been very hard for you.
So you gave up personal glory for the glory of the fleet. I approve.
-Davion Falcon
@Davion Well, he did write a self-glorifying blog post about it... ;-)
My lack of ego has limits. ;-)
A couple things stand out to me.
#1. You should write about fleet engagements more often. I find it interesting to read about other people's pvp styles.
#2. Though it's possible people would call you primary because they recognize your name from your blog or CSM run, I'm pretty sure you were called primary because you were in a Hurricane. Notice the other hurricane in your fleet died? They probably called it secondary. ;) Target Calling 101.
#3. In situations where there are more then a handful of people involved, it's very hard to determine who is (or was) aggressed, without allowing complete chaos on coms. It just happens sometimes in bigger engagements.
#4. In various militia circles, we call the manuever you did," pulling a 'faust.'" In situations where your fleet is very small you need to be careful, as the DPS lost could be more detrimental then the meat shield is helpful.
You know, this is funny, most brick pilots love to fly with me in the fleet, besides from the fact that i fly either a curse + eris set or dual oneiros on each of my chars, but because no matter who we encounter i will be invariably called primary. for example last night right when i landed on grid everything began blinking, to the point that the fleet neither aligned or hug the gate, they just wanted a piece of me. =__=
I'm pretty much always primary in fights I get in. It builds character!
I note that despite your previous post, all RK cane's lost in that engagement had 425mm II autocannons ..
Tactically brilliant!
A lot of people I fly around have the philosophy that the entire point of the game is to get on killmails. That is their end goal, and it annoys me to no end. It also produces some terrible tactics, such as "farming" kills to get as many people as possible involved, sometimes even incurring losses or letting the target escape.
Sometimes you have someone tackled, and there is no question about their escape or survival: In these situations, it's fine and even courteous to let the people who were involved in their capture get on the killmail. You may even be trying to get people onto the mail in silly ships for fun, and sometimes you want to hold someone down without killing them so there will be time for a fast tackler to arrive to get the pod that comes out. All these things are fine.
At the end of the day though, killmails should not be what you seek as a PVPer. They are a result of your actions in PVP, the same way that can full of corpses slowly fills up, or the way drones are left abandoned in space after you fight. They are not the objective. The objective is to destroy.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a logistics pilot that never aggresses, or the guy who sits on one side of the gate while his buddy kills an unmoving drake at 0 on the other. These are necessary roles, and their lack of glory is nearly irrelevant.
If you find yourself always killing enemies that are vastly outnumbered, it's often the case that you weren't necessary in that fight; you could have been somewhere else, killing someone else, ensuring that MORE things are destroyed rather than superfluously tacking your name onto the end of another blobbed drake with 85 damage dealt. I would gladly sacrifice my name on any number of killmails if that's what was needed to be sure that they died, and so should you.
@Anon1503: We were specifically ordered to fit close-range gank BCs, so I fell back to my Standard Cane from early this year. First time I've flown that fit in a long while.
When I created Zandramus I figured if the overview was sorted alphabetically then he would get called primary less often. That worked for the first few months of the game till everyone figured out the overview. Now I get primaries quite a bit because I'm usually high dps bc or bs.
Zandramus
I'm constantly being primaried with a name starting by 'A', man sometimes I wish I could change name (Never though of it the first time I made the character), but in the end, I got used to be called primary all the time, and now, I'm constantly the meat shield, having somewhat of different actions than the FC orders to stay at least a bit longer alive in the fight or pulling some 'faust' like Susan said.
Sometimes in small gang fights I luckily never get targeted ever, which turns out to be so 'weird' being used to be constantly locked in every fight :)
I agree completely with your courses of action Jester. Perfect play.
That explains why every other RK cane I could see was artie fit.
Incidentally, I recently ended up trying something similar to to your standard cane fit - as recommended a local friendly pirate - and would concur with your point about it being difficult to fly.
"Only, critically, nobody pointed me. Sticking to my plan, I warped off. Again, the enemy fleet wasted time and resources on a non-aggressed ship."
since you were not pointed its not important if you aggresed or not, i guess ...Property Attributes

- Frenkie de Jong could leave Barcelona before his contract expires following Bayern and Man City's interest in him
- The midfielder has been at the Camp Nou in 2019 after penning a long term deal with the Spanish League side until 2026
- But the European giants are hoping to use Barca's financial situation to lure the youngster away from the club
Barcelona's talented midfielder Frenkie de Jong has reportedly emerged as a top transfer target for Manchester City and Bayern Munich.
The Dutchman joined the Catalans from Ajax Amsterdam in the summer of 2019 and his long term contract will see him represent the La Liga club until June 2026.
However, the above-mentioned European giants are hoping to get lucky by luring him away from Camp Nou before his deal with them expires.

The publication added that both City and Bayern seem satisfied with the midfielder's display since they started monitoring him and they will hope to explore the club's financial difficulties in approaching his deal.
Barcelona have had to let Lionel Messi, Antoine Griezmann and a host of their other stars owing to the fact that they couldn't maintain such high-profile players on their payroll.
De Jong has already made a total of 104 appearances across all competitions, scoring nine goals and 14 assists in the process.

I thought about generations of Black Americans as I stood in drizzling rain for nearly four hours on Monday to cast my vote, the many who never had the opportunity, and those who gave their lives so that I could. Waiting in line seemed like a minor inconvenience all things considered.
I thought about the more than 220,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 and those whose hearts still ache for them—spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings, parents, colleagues, friends, etc. And the many who have died from other diseases, natural disasters, police shootings, domestic violence—the list goes on.
I thought about Joyce Williams, Norman Wallace, Winson Josiah, Tommy Uzzo, and Many Iahn—members of our church family who passed away this year, and others before them.
And of course, I thought about my own parents, grandparents, sisters, grandson, aunts and uncles, teachers, mentors, and friends who are gone but never forgotten. It was helpful to hold all these people close this week, to think about their lives and struggles but also their perseverance in faith and how it guided their way in this old world.
I also thought a lot about the living, the saints who keep me going day by day, who walk along side and grace me with encouragement, love, and hope in their own sweet ways. Those who share joys and challenges up close and others who inspire from a distance but have their purpose just the same.
I hope you will intentionally make time over the coming days to remember the saints in your life, past and present. Remember them and give thanks. And for those yet alive, I encourage you to find a way to let them know how much they mean to you; send a card, write a note, call, text, email, or some expression of gratitude for their presence in your life. For their days are numbered just as ours, and soon it will be too late.
Remember that you are “surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses” who are cheering you on. May those memories inspire you to also be a cheerleader for others and to keep pressing your way even in these challenging times—perhaps most especially in these challenging times.
Grace and peace,
Pastor CathyBy Drake Baer humans lives today: that, in some circumstances, depression may be, in the arc of a life, yielding of insights and personal meaning. All of this is in no way meant to minimize the suffering that depression can cause — but to suggest the uses that it may serve.
At the center of Hutson’s piece is Paul Andrews, an evolutionary psychologist at McMaster University in Canada. Andrews.
For now, Andrews’s “analytical rumination hypothesis” is just that, a hypothesis, a term that combines the Greek hypo (under) with -thesis (placing). It’s a concept, an observation, one that acts as a structure for further inquiry. Still, already, there is something very powerful, and even actionable, in reconceptualizing (some) depressive episodes as having a function, as presenting a quest toward understanding for the sufferer to undertake. Other research helps to refract the light being shined here: Laura King, a psychologist at the University of Missouri, has spent a couple decades studying people’s experiences of meaning in life, and she told me in an interview at this year’s Society for Personality and Social Psychology meeting that the meaning people derive from difficult experiences depends not on the amount that they’re suffered, but the extent of reflection — or meaning-making — they’ve done on what prompted a given nadir. Following this logic, if the job of a depressive episode is to figure out what’s gone awry, what emotional knots need to be untangled, what attachment patterns need to be identified and addressed, then antidepressants are an incomplete treatment, just like you wouldn’t prescribe Percocet to a heal a broken ankle without also supplying a cast.
There are even larger, structural issues around the culture and industry of mental health at work here: If the healing of depression requires not just an alleviation of symptoms but a reworking of patterns within a person’s psychology, that’s a deeply subjective rather than objective process, meaning that the scientific method may have difficulty accessing it, and since it’s not objective, it’s perceived as less real or true, since it resides in your interiority, not out there in the readily testable world. Also, therapy — whether cognitive behavioral or psychoanalytic — requires lots of money and lots of time and is not, to say the least, well-supported by insurance companies in the U.S.
Still, this framing of depression as a space for reflection is empowering, and lends a degree of agency to the person being pressed down. Like anxiety, depression might be trying to tell you something. The language of therapeutic traditions is useful: a Jungian analyst would describe depression as katabasis, an Ancient Greek word for descent. Like Orpheus heading to Hades or Luke Skywalker in the swamps of Dagobah, it’s a journey into the underworld, where the adventurer is to “go through the door … immerse himself in the wound, and exit from his old life through it,” like Robert Bly writes in Iron John. Since it is subjective, the problems and solutions will be personal — of the person and their particular psychological history — and thus demand the individualized understanding of the sufferer of depression, perhaps with the assistance of a skilled therapist. That’s another theme: While disengagement from emotionality characterizes depression and other disorders, engagement with one’s inner world looks to to be the way out. Put more poetically: You exit through the wound.
“Most episodes of depression end on their own — something known as spontaneous remission,” Vanderbilt psychologist Steven Hollon tells Nautilus, noting that the depression-as-adaptation narrative may explain why. Indeed, “cognitive behavioral and problem-solving therapies may work precisely because they tap into and accelerate — in a matter of weeks — the very processes that have evolved to occur over the space of months,” he added. Katabasis leads to catharsis; not coincidentally, there’s a shared theme in the personal narratives of people who reach midlife with a sense of well-being and generativity toward others: redemption.

"I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine"
Member and Leader Services (MLS) software has been developed to make Church record-keeping easier and more efficient. Ward and stake clerks should learn how to use all of the functions in MLS. Assistant clerks should become specialists in the functions of MLS that are related to their responsibilities. Clerks and assistant clerks should teach quorum, group, and auxiliary secretaries to use the functions of MLS specifically related to their callings.
All users should understand that the information found in MLS is confidential and may be used only for official Church business.
The current version of MLS is 3.4.3 and the current and final build is 20605. You can verify your current version and build by clicking on "Help" and then "About" on the menu in MLS.

History
- Main article: History of MLS
In 1999, the Member and Statistical Records Department (MSR) began considering a rewrite of the local unit Member Information System (MIS) and Financial Information System (FIS).[1]
Timeline
- Main article: Timeline of MLS
MLS has been revised many times since the initial release. The available release notes have been collected in the Timeline of MLS.
Get started with MLS by installing and configuring MLS to communicate with Church Headquarters. MLS users must be created and assigned roles, and each must learn how to navigate within the program in order to accomplish their tasks.
MLS administration
MLS transmission
- Main article: MLS transmission
MLS communicates with CHQ via the Send/Receive feature. Each transmission session sends information and receives information, which may include messages, software updates, financial information, and membership updates.
Backup and export
MLS has a backup feature that periodically saves the entire database. In the case of catastrophic failure, the MLS database can be restored.
MLS data can be exported by an administrator for use with Palm or other handheld devices. An export can only be done by someone with MLS administrator rights.
Changes to MLS
In MLS, software changes are made automatically when the unit uses Send/Receive Changes. A message will appear saying that the software change has been made and the computer should be restarted. There may also be a message explaining the changes.
Performance
Several MLS users have reported performance improvements by:
- Adding more memory. For all systems, at least 512MB seems to create a noticeable improvement, and some users report that for large stake databases, 768MB or 1GB may be even better.
- Defragmenting the hard drive
Changing the system date
MLS will not open if the date is earlier than the last save date. Never adjust the system date beyond the actual date, or you'll run into trouble when you try to set it back. If you accidentally have run MLS under a future date, to restore you need to:
- With the computer clock still in the future so MLS will run, print a copy of recent deposits and other changes that may have been made.
- Find the most recent backup that is dated before the present
- Restore your MLS data from the backup
- Exit MLS
- Turn the computer clock to the present
- Log back into MLS
- Contact the Local Unit Support Group to restore your financial data.
If the clock is not set too far into the future, a simpler option is to exit MLS, then set the clock back to the correct date and time, first making note of the date and time associated with the MLS database. Then refrain from running MLS again until you have reached that date and time.
If for some reason (neglect or otherwise) good backups are not available, Church headquarters does make regular backups and they can be used to restore your system. However, the frequency of those backups is only monthly. It is in your best interests to ensure that proper, regular backups are being made.
Prevention
It is possible to disable clock adjustment from within Windows XP Pro. Go to:
- Start | Run | SECPOL.MSC
- Select "Local Policies" and "User Rights Assignments"
- Double click on "Change System Time"
- Remove all users from the list
Now, no one can reset the time. Should the time need to be reset, it can be done either through the BIOS, or by temporarily reversing the above change, setting the clock, and removing access again. Once this change is made (and the system rebooted), clicking on the time on the taskbar will no longer bring up the calendar, and will instead display a message that the user is not authorized to modify the system time.
You can also add specific user names to the list. Add the user name created for you so only you can change the system time.
Resources
Training
Several Record-Keeping and Auditing Training courses covering MLS are available at lds.org under Serving in the Church, Melchizedek Priesthood. Beginning with version 2.6 of MLS, these training courses are installed locally and integrated with the Help system of MLS.
MLS frequently asked questions
In an effort to document common questions and their answers, please see the Answers about MLS page.
Suggestions
Suggestions for improving MLS are being collected on the MLS: Feedback and Suggestions page.
Test data
- Main article: MLS test data
MLS has built-in test data that can be used for experimentation or training on ward or stake administrative computers, or even on personal computers. The test database is populated with fictional member names, addresses, callings, and financial data for a ward and a stake (go to test data for installation instructions). The training database lets clerks practice using the features of MLS without the fear of damaging the unit’s actual data. This can be an important tool for training new clerks.
Documentation
The MLS help system contains not only instructions for using MLS, but also various relevant financial and membership policies. Much of the content of the help system is consolidated in the MLS Software Manual.
The Record-Keeping and Auditing Training web page on lds.org contains documents such as Using MLS and MLS Overview.
Other documents can be found on the stake and ward web sites hosted on lds.org under Record Keeping Information. These include the MLS Financial Supplement and the MLS Membership Supplement, as well as MLS Reconciliation Instructions. Note that you will only be able to access the Record Keeping Information if you are designated in the Leadership Directory section of the web site as some sort of clerk or priesthood leader.
Forum
One of the forums on LDSTech is for discussions on using and interfacing with the Church MLS program; it is called MLS Support, Help, and Feedback.

Abstract
To model the concrete with complex internal structure of concrete with large sized aggregates the effect of internal structure on uniaxial compression behavior are studied. Large-sized recycled aggregates behave differently in the concrete matrix. To understand the influence on concrete matrix, a finite element model was developed to model recycled aggregate concrete composed of multiple randomly distributed irregular aggregates and cement mortar. The model was used to calculate the effect of large-size recycled coarse aggregate (LRCA) on the strength of recycled aggregate concrete and simulate the compressive strength of cubes and prisms. The factors such as the strength of new concrete, the strength of old concrete, the defective element content, the shape of LRCA, the incorporation ratio of LRCA and the size of LRCA that can affect the strength of concrete are analyzed in this paper. Results showed that the influence of various factors on concrete strength are in the following desending order: (i) strength of newly poured concrete; (ii) original strength of recycled aggregates; and (iii) defects. It can be seen that the cracking of the phase material elements starts along the bonding zones between gravel and mortar or the new and old mortar, then spreads to mortar and finally to LRCA. The cracking tendency is most significant in LRCA, which means that the fracturing is related to the fracture of the LRCA. After evaluating the variations in strength and quality of the recycled concrete, the influences on concrete strength and quality were studied. The results showed that the proposed concrete model with LRCA was successfully applied to studying the uniaxial compressive behavior of concrete with large-size recycled coarse aggregate.

5 true to life or online, and your face buzzing with concerns:
вЂњDoes he secretly like to make away?вЂќ
вЂњIs this going someplace, or will they be simply being courteous?вЂќ
They are the sorts of things it chappy is normal to inquire of your self with regards to flirting. Also to a degree, it could be enjoyable and safe to not ever be certain. Having said that, there are lots of instances when it is truly crucial that you manage to inform the essential difference between flirting and courteous, friendly conversation. Sometimes, misreading a smile or a tale as flirtation can cause not merely embarrassing, but profoundly improper situations. could you do?
That will help you decipher the essential difference between friendliness and flirtation, we talked to three various intercourse and dating professionals. HereвЂ™s just what they’d to state:
Why Politeness Can Be Recognised Incorrectly As Flirting
The very first thing you ought to know is the fact that males have actually a lengthy and storied reputation for misunderstanding womenвЂ™s motives. Regarding flirtation, it is certainly no different.
вЂњA womanвЂ™s politeness is normally seen erroneously as flirting because вЂfriendlyвЂ™ and вЂflirtyвЂ™ can look almost identical вЂ” smiling, laughing, positivity, attentiveness, feeling connected,вЂќ claims Connell Barrett, dating mentor for The League. вЂњItвЂ™s very simple to confuse the 2, specially when you prefer her become flirting.вЂќ
That desire element is a part that is huge of. Rarely do males mistake the politeness of females theyвЂ™re perhaps not drawn to вЂ” or guys theyвЂ™re perhaps not interested in, for instance вЂ” for flirting. But basic individual decency from some one you would imagine is a babe that is total? That will begin to feel just like flirtation pretty fast.
To some extent, it is a problem males as friends have the effect of. As guys are almost certainly going to show physical violence or anger, lots of women will attempt become courteous and also friendly to males they donвЂ™t understand as opposed to curt or dismissive.
вЂњWomen’s politeness gets recognised incorrectly as flirting simply because they wouldn’t like to harm a person’s feelings,вЂќ says Tina B. Tessina, Ph.D., psychotherapist and author of вЂњDr. Romance’s Guide to Finding Like Today.вЂќ вЂњThey work friendly and open, and males have a tendency to mistake that for flirting.вЂќ
Then thereвЂ™s the known undeniable fact that males look like theyвЂ™re just very likely to perceive flirtation, duration.
вЂњI carried out research a couple of years straight back that looked over perceptions of first-date success,вЂќ says dating expert Marisa T. Cohen, Ph.D. вЂњMen interpreted the next as being delivered by females to signal interest: date speaks about by herself (may show that this woman is comfortable in permitting her guard down), diverting the discussion to intercourse, providing to separate the price of the dinner, and responding immediately if he initiates an additional date. The thing that was interesting was that no actions signaled that she wasnвЂ™t interested. A few of the habits we included had been that she never contacts you once more rather than reacts once you contact her, what type would think are pretty clear signals of disinterest.вЂќ
It is just one study, nevertheless the possibility that guys are both ready and in a position to misread fundamental signals of non-interest (or also basic signals) as flirtation surely exists. Cohen, on her component, believes that contemporary hookup tradition might may play a role for the reason that.
вЂњWhereas individuals may jump into the summary that guys might be lacking apparent signals, possibly it is a result of the present state of dating/courtship,вЂќ she claims. вЂњWhen internet dating, we might be seeing people simultaneously. Maybe males just adopted a wholesome strategy of stating that, вЂIf she does not react to me, maybe itвЂ™s not a thing related to me personally, and rather, is just circumstantial.вЂ™вЂќ
Simple tips to Find Out If SheвЂ™s Flirting or perhaps Being Courteous
Aside from why males are misreading signals, the concern nevertheless continues to be: Which signals suggest flirtation and which suggest easy politeness?Lucy Lawless explains why she called Kevin Sorbo “Chicken.”
Lucy Lawless isn’t interested in extremism. Off-screen as much as on, the Xena actress has shown herself a warrior, never shying away from speaking her ideas.
In January, the 53-year-old actress made headlines when she called out her former co-star Kevin Sorbo for promoting a pro-Trump conspiracy theory.
“Those folks who just foment evil from a distance, I think they ought to be called out,” Lawless remarked in an interview with The Washington Newsday this week about the feud with Sorbo. That’s all there was to it.” “I think extremism is incredibly harmful, and individuals who foster extremism but don’t truly own it are chickens***,” she added.
“At the very least, that jerk—the shaman at the [Capitol] riots—had his complete name, face, and body there, so he was held accountable.”
On Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Sorbo played the eponymous hero, and he returned the role in the spin-off Xena: Warrior Princess, starring Lawless. For years, the former co-stars have been locked in a fight over their politics and personal lives.
Sorbo’s reps have been contacted for comment by Washington Newsday.
Meanwhile, in the face of the climate crisis, Lawless is asking for unity.
She told The Washington Newsday, “I believe very strongly that we need to draw to the middle with what’s facing all of our civilizations with catastrophic climate change.”
“It means there’s no time to start breaking into hostile, small groups that wish to exclude others.” We’ll have to work together as a group.” For the debut of her animated film, The Spine of Night, which she calls as a “weird, dark little jewel,” Lawless sat down with The Washington Newsday. The actress was lured to the film because it was “simply so wacky,” she remarked. “I find it appealing. “I want to be a part of something strange, and it’s new again,” she explained. “And I think today’s youth, Generation Z, want to discover things for themselves.” The film is a bloody fantasy epic about ancient dark magic falling into the wrong hands and wreaking havoc on humanity for millennia. “A collection of heroes from various times and cultures must band together in order to defeat it at all costs,” according to the official synopsis. According to Lawless. This is a condensed version of the information.April 2021 Corporate Credit ESG in credit investing: themes, considerations and implementation /> /> Adrienn Sarandi Head of ESG Strategy & Development April 2021 Corporate Credit ESG in credit investing: themes, considerations and implementation /> /> Adrienn Sarandi Head of ESG Strategy & Development As the focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing globally continues to sharpen, Adrienn Sarandi, Director of Fixed Income ESG, answers some of the most frequently asked questions, including whether COVID-19 has altered the evolution of ESG. Key Takeaways ESG investing has markedly matured in recent times, forcing a shift in focus from ‘why’ asset owners and investment managers should integrate ESG factors into their investment processes to ‘how’. Janus Henderson’s corporate credit strategies integrate ESG as a core component, aiming to identify the most material ESG considerations for each issuer we invest in, reduce risks and uncover ‘ESG alpha’ opportunities. To accomplish this, we are proponents of integrated, forward-looking analysis, and strong advocates of both active company engagement and industry-wide collaboration on disclosure standardisation. While emphasis on climate change lost momentum amid the pandemic, the spotlight shifted to ‘S’ and ‘G’ issues. We think 2020 proved that ESG analysis is not just a bull market luxury but very much a bear market necessity, and its importance will only grow. Why is ESG a vital part of the value proposition in all of Janus Henderson’s credit portfolios? The Global Corporate Credit Team at Janus Henderson seeks to enhance value for clients through active management, and ESG considerations are key elements of our approach. We believe that excelling at ESG research and actively engaging with investee companies will lead to better-informed investment decisions by reducing risks and uncovering ‘ESG alpha’ opportunities. At the heart of ESG is the simple idea that companies are more likely to succeed and deliver strong returns if they create value for all their stakeholders – employees, customers and suppliers – as well as society more widely and the environment. Consequently, ESG analysis focuses on how companies are serving stakeholders, the strength of their ‘social licence’ to operate and how this impacts their current and future performance. Hence ESG analysis is a key ingredient in our analysis that seeks to identify companies with business models that are ‘future proofed’ and able to deliver sustainable cash flows. At the same time, it helps us seek to avoid borrowers that cannot or will not mitigate their material ESG risks, which may ultimately lead to meaningful underperformance or capital impairment. We believe that integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions can improve performance. In the past, asset owners and investment managers focused on ‘why’ they should integrate ESG factors into their investment processes more systematically. ESG investing has markedly matured in recent times and now the conversation has moved to the ‘how’. How is it best to leverage ESG insights to enhance risk-adjusted returns? How can disclosure standards be improved? How can ESG performance and outcomes be measured? In terms of the why, we believe the question is comprehensively answered and there is no trade-off between performance and ESG integration*. We believe that integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions can improve performance. It is now the ‘how’ questions that are pertinent. Is ESG now an inseparable part of credit investing? Absolutely. In our view, a process that fails to integrate ESG factors properly, misses some important dimensions in investment decision-making. Bond investors have always been focused on governance factors, but in recent years broader ESG considerations have become a more systematic and formalised part of the investment process. Environmental and social considerations therefore now vie for importance. Many of the environmental and social risks have also been increasing and some are now prominent across industries and regions. More recently, it was consensus to expect the 2020s to be the decade of transition and transformation from an E, S and G perspective. While the heavy focus on climate change lost some momentum in 2020 due to the pandemic, there has been an uptick in focus on other ‘S’ and ‘G’ issues, with companies taking a greater interest in employee wellness and workplace equality, as well as supply chain management. Crises also typically expose governance issues and COVID is no exception with several scandals erupting last year that left some corporates paying a heavy price. It is therefore clear to us that investors ignore material ESG factors at their peril. ESG investing is a broad concept. How do you apply ESG? ESG is integrated in all of Janus Henderson’s corporate credit strategies as a core component. We aim to identify and evaluate the most material ESG risks of each issuer we invest in and use these insights to improve returns. In terms of strategy implementation, it is important to differentiate between ‘integrated’ ESG strategies – which apply responsible investing principles – compared to ‘values’- and ‘impact’-based strategies that apply Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) principles. In our ‘integrated’ ESG strategies, the primary purpose of the ESG lens is to maximise risk-adjusted returns. Since there are no specific ESG performance objectives within these strategies, in the vast majority of cases, we do not have blanket sector exclusions. The integrated ESG approach looks at credit markets holistically and aims to evaluate on a case-by-case basis how relevant factors may lead to credit improvement or deterioration, and the resultant impact on credit spreads and the issuer’s cost of capital. For clients in our ‘values’-based strategies, we apply the same approach but with the addition of a negative screening overlay to remove controversial sectors/issuers in accordance with clients’ beliefs. For those clients who want to go a step further with ‘impact’ investing – an approach that seeks to deliver a measurable positive impact for society and the environment alongside positive returns – we are currently building out capabilities that allow us to design tailored solutions with measurable positive outcomes. /> Why do you include some ‘sin’ sectors in your strategies that integrate ESG within their investment approach? Excluding some controversial sectors outright makes sense for ‘values’-based ethical investors. In ‘integrated’ ESG strategies we do not apply blanket exclusions based on industry classifications alone because we do not believe this is the best way to enhance risk-adjusted returns. This does not, however, mean we invest in challenged sectors and issuers. When approaching areas of the market that have an inherent material ESG risk profile, we take each sub-sector and issuer on its own merit and actively engage to better understand whether and how ESG risks are addressed. In keeping with this approach, we avoid investing in companies – in any sector – where the materiality of the ESG risk and deteriorating trajectory of that risk lead us to believe we could see a marked worsening in credit strength or capital impairment. Examples include structurally challenged businesses (such as certain coal miners where the risk of stranded assets – which are now worth less than expected due to the transition to cleaner energy – are high) or those that are negligent in terms of their conduct towards workers, customer safety and the communities they operate in, or those with other serious governance issues. Conversely, we aim to reward those – and benefit from – issuers that may not have a very strong ESG profile but are taking meaningful initiatives to make improvements. This is dependent on the associated risks not being material enough to pose a serious risk of capital impairment. For example, Volkswagen faced the fallout from its emissions scandal, but management change led to serious steps being taken to redeem itself and significantly improve its ESG profile. Another example is an issuer in a high-emission industry that has a credible strategy to transition to a low-carbon economy and can evidence its progress. We want to benefit from ESG-led credit improvements that translate into tighter credit spreads. Ultimately, we believe improving ESG profiles will benefit society as well as increase the potential for bondholder gains. How do you integrate ESG considerations into your credit research? Our credit analysts aim to identify the most material ESG considerations for each issuer we invest in, to make sure we can understand and price the risks and then aim to detect credit improvement or deterioration before the market prices in this change. To do this, we need to conduct our own forward-looking ESG analysis rather than using external ESG data providers, which tend to base their scores on backward-looking disclosures. We believe no one is more qualified to integrate the most material ESG considerations into our credit recommendations than our credit analysts who are experts in their sectors. We do not have dedicated ESG analysts in the credit research team because we consider ESG analysis a core part of credit analysis. We believe no one is more qualified to integrate the most material ESG considerations into our credit recommendations than our credit analysts who are experts in their sectors. To authentically integrate ESG, we consider credit analysts to be best placed to incorporate it within the research, rather than have a small number of ESG analysts providing an ‘overlay’ and engaging on their behalf. We do, however, leverage our centralised specialist ESG resources to support us with research and engagement. What are the benefits to having proprietary ESG ratings as well as using external ESG data providers? We believe both add value – but in different ways. While we subscribe to several third party ESG data providers, we believe it is imperative to carry out our own analysis, in line with the reasons noted previously, and set a proprietary ESG rating for every issuer we hold. The biggest difference between external providers and our own ESG ratings is the focus on what we consider most material for each issuer. We also put a greater emphasis on the forward-looking factors and the direction of travel rather than just backward-looking historical data. We are also cognisant of some biases inherent in external ESG scores given that large companies from certain regions tend to provide better disclosures and score more highly. While we acknowledge there are data challenges, where we do make extensive use of external data providers is in relation to climate change. We use various sources of climate data to inform our assessments and measure and manage climate change risks in our portfolios. What are the biggest challenges currently in ESG investing? The biggest challenges remain the lack of standardisation in disclosures as well as the depth and quality of the disclosures that we need for better visibility into how companies are run, particularly around some harder to quantify ‘S’ metrics. This is why we believe company engagement is so important. Whether it is encouraging companies to improve their carbon disclosures or trying to better understand their policies around supply chain management, diversity or financial inclusion, a proactive dialogue with companies is necessary until we have more standardised metrics and better reporting from companies. This is important because encouraging companies to improve in these areas should ultimately help drive stronger corporate sustainability and enhance investment returns. A proactive dialogue with companies is necessary until we have more standardised metrics and better reporting from companies. Hence, we are strong advocates of active engagement and industry-wide collaboration with our peers to help steer improvement and make progress on corporate disclosure. Our efforts in this area include helping to frame questionnaires that seek to standardise minimum disclosure from issuers. We recognise they are inundated with questions from investors and not always sure what they should be disclosing. We also take part in working groups and events that bring together issuers, asset managers and credit rating agencies, as well as being a Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) supporter and actively engaging with issuers on their alignment with TCFD recommendations. In addition, we are a member of the SASB Alliance, that helps businesses around the world to identify, manage and report on the sustainability topics that matter most to investors. Why do you believe ESG is best implemented using an active strategy rather than passive? In our view, it comes down to extracting the maximum benefit from identifying and driving change. ESG analysis is ultimately about being on the right side of change. As active managers our goal is to be proactive and spot improving trends in the economy, sectors and bond issuers that can boost returns and equally avoid deterioration that could damage returns. We believe there are clear benefits to accessing this larger toolbox that active management can offer to help mitigate risks, drive change by proactive company engagement and seek out stronger risk-adjusted returns. Do you think the importance of ESG will continue to grow? Definitely. We think last year proved that ESG analysis is not just a bull market luxury but very much a bear market necessity, and its importance will only grow. In the past, ESG was integrated mostly on the back of client demand. Recently passed and upcoming regulations, however, especially in Europe, will require that ESG is systematically integrated within investment management. This momentum seems certain to increase globally as governments, policy makers and regulators push for meaningful progress on addressing climate change and social issues. In fact, the COVID-19 crisis has shown us what a global systemic emergency looks like and reinforces to us the importance of accelerating the fight against other globally relevant threats, such as global warming, loss of biodiversity and inequalities, while building a greener, resilient and more inclusive global economy in the interest of everyone, including investors and asset owners. We think last year proved that ESG analysis is not just a bull market luxury but very much a bear market necessity, and its importance will only grow. In terms of climate change, there is a pressing need to reallocate capital to speed up the transition to a low-carbon and circular economy if we are to limit global warming to well below two degrees. More public and private sector investments will need to be channelled into clean energy and new technologies as well as helping high-emission and hard to abate sectors, that are vital to economic growth, to decarbonise and align with the Paris Agreement. We as an asset management industry need to provide to our clients a range of investment options and solutions that align with their values and help achieve their financial as well as ESG related objectives. We expect to see more innovative, well designed and purpose-led strategies to address real issues and achieve real outcomes. For example, in our view, Transition Finance will have a big role to play and recent developments around sustainability-linked instruments were well received by the market. Demand is rising for companies that are able to transition to a more sustainable world and they should provide better risk-adjusted returns over the long term. We believe good ESG analysis will be key to identifying and supporting companies that are driving, and benefitting from, change and in turn allow us to deliver good quality and consistent risk-adjusted returns for the clients we serve.

Question asked : “The coronavirus crisis and the restrictions on economic activity have threatened the livelihoods of many of the poorest families on the planet. To respond to this global crisis, some governments around the world consider how to expand their social safety net as many – especially women – in household or informal economy are left without any support. In this context, the idea of “universal basic income” has resurfaced in many places. Where does this debate stand today in your region? Has it been affected by the pandemic?”

Musicology lecture and Ferenc Liszt Memorial Concert
Artists in this concert commemorating Ferenc Liszt who was born 210 years ago are two professors of the Liszt Academy and at the same time its former students. Both are faithful defenders of the Liszt tradition that has been continued for several generations. Their programme comprises transcriptions. A significant part of Liszt’s oeuvre is made up of piano transcriptions, in which the composer-piano virtuoso wanted to reproduce the original work on his own instrument as faithfully as possible, although for the most part he shaped it in his own image, as though ‘transubstantiating’ the foundational musical material mainly taken from other composers. Mária Eckhardt, Széchenyi Prize musicologist, gives a lecture on the concert.

This was part of a wider push to encourage the adoption of digital solutions across regional and global supply chains.
It’s also why the city-state set aside S$10 million from its Maritime Innovation and Technology Fund to support the scaling of start-ups developing new technology to tackle challenges faced specifically by the maritime industry.
Maritime remains a vitally important strategic industry for Singapore given its position between the Strait of Malacca in the west and the South China Sea in the east, through which vast amounts of global trade flows.
In addition to the Maritime Digitalisation Playbook released by the government to guide shipping and maritime companies in their digitalisation strategies, private sector innovation also has an important role to play in transitioning this old-economy industry into the modern digital age.
Digitizing maritime in Singapore
This year, with COVID wreaking havoc on supply chains and global trade, Singapore actually hit a record high with container volumes of 3.3 million twenty-foot-equivalent units.
Unfortunately, at the same time as volumes were spiking, container ships faced turnaround delays of between five and seven days compared to the previous maximum of just two days.
If Singapore, as one of the busiest and most advanced shipping ports in the world, is struggling with processing this pandemic-related surge in cargo volumes, you can bet maritime sectors in less developed markets are struggling too (likely even more).
One of the most obvious places to start addressing these challenges is at the heart of the problem: with the slow and old-fashioned paper-based documents and processes that are still commonplace in maritime, slowing the sector down just when it needs to be speeding up.
Let me give just one example: for each shipment in Singapore and elsewhere, it’s estimated that an average of 200 documents have to change hands over 100 times.
It should be clear, then, that the digitization of maritime documentation would not only strengthen operational efficiency, but may also help reduce turnaround times and fuel usage for ships at port.
Reducing maritime’s carbon footprint
Reducing paper and moving more maritime documents including contracts, invoices, and receipts into digital versions would represent a good strategic step towards not only modernising but also decarbonisation of the maritime sector as a whole.
In a speech at the recent Singapore Maritime Week, Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Transport Chee Hong Tat emphasized technology’s pivotal role in creating a resilient maritime sector, especially as supply chains recover after COVID.
Minister Chee explained: “We have to continue pushing for common data standards so that we can integrate networks and systems, and propel further adoption of digital solutions across global supply chains.”
The time is right to begin a firmer push on this front now—as large swathes of the economy are speeding up digital transformation efforts, it remains a sad fact that as much as 80% of ports are still missing out on the benefits of digitalization.
Indeed, the majority of ports worldwide still rely on manual processes such as whiteboards and Excel spreadsheets to manage and organize marine-side port operations, before even touching on some of the commercial documentation mentioned earlier such as invoices.
As companies look ahead to building pandemic resilience, putting in place digital transformation measures that will mean future disruptions are less crippling to operations and supply chains, it is traditional industries like maritime here in Singapore that are most at risk of being left behind.
We are pleased and excited to be building solutions, such as Bill One by Sansan that will help maritime stakeholders through this difficult but necessary journey.
By taking some simple but aggressive steps to digitize their paper-based documents and processes, stakeholders stand a better chance of making it through the next global business disruption event when it eventually hits.

Obeying all of the rules rarely generates breakthrough performance because it does not generate new approaches. Breaking the rules randomly does not work either. This is where intelligent disobedience comes in; knowing when and how to break, bend or invent new rules to get better outcomes is my passion. Espousing a higher form of ethics, intelligent disobedience seeks to surface hidden truth, and produce actions that are of higher integrity, to yield superior results.

Definition at line 262 of file ztrsen.f.At the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States. A Philippine insurrection against the United States began almost immediately and ended in 1902 with the United States controlling the territory until the Japanese invasion in December of 1941. Choosing deployment to the Philippines, Herb Hanneman, a Madison native, made perhaps the most fateful decision of his life.
Hanneman first joined the Florida National Guard on a trip he took with friends. He quickly realized that Florida was not the place for him and requested to transfer to the Regular U.S. Army. (2:15-2:25)
During the summer of 1941, an Army recruiter gave Herb Hanneman a choice, and said, “Where would you like to go? Would you like to go to Alaska, Hawaii or the Philippines? We looked at each other and we said, ‘Gee, we’ve never been to the Philippines, let’s go over there,” (2:32-2:43).
Hanneman arrived in the Philippines in August 1941. Although Japan had been at war in the Pacific for almost two years, the first three months of his deployment were enjoyable. He was assigned to clerical duties at MacArthur’s headquarters in downtown Manila. His afternoons were free. (3:35-4:03) Hanneman and his friend paid local boys to do their chores at the barracks. (4:20-4:43)
“We just had a ball there,” (5:38) he said.
Asked if he or fellow American servicemembers felt any threat from Japan since it had long been at war, Hanneman said, “None whatsoever.” (5:37)
That would quickly change, since the capital city of Manila was an obvious target for the Japanese. MacArthur’s office was moved to the island of Corregidor. Later, the Japanese began to bomb Corregidor. Hanneman and the rest of his unit were sent to Bataan. He lost his desk job and rejoined the infantry. (9:00-9:03)
Only a few days after arriving in Bataan, Hanneman and a handful of fellow soldiers decided to clean up in a stream near their camp.
“And lo and behold we were having a bath – we were in the nude, our clothes were lying there. And all of a sudden, we looked up, we were surrounded by Japanese infantry.” (9:04-9:36)
After being allowed to dress, Hanneman and the others were forced at bayonet point to start marching. Being joined along the way with small groups of prisoners, he was now a prisoner of war. (9:53-10:19)
The 74,000 American and Filipino troops on Bataan surrendered on April 9, 1942. The Japanese herded these prisoners 66 miles on foot and by rail to Camp O’Donnell, a makeshift prison camp. Only 54,000 men who started the march made it to Camp O’Donnell, and many were in such a condition that they died just weeks afterward. This journey into prison has ever after been known as the Bataan Death March.
On the road, there were seemingly random beatings, torture and killing. Hanneman recalls some Japanese on horseback who “had a great deal of fun riding through the group of Americans” as they marched along and decapitating “quite a few.”
Understanding the Japanese beliefs about surrender helps us grasp why the Americans who surrendered to the Japanese were often treated brutally and inhumanely. The Japanese forbade their own soldiers to surrender.[1] To die for one’s emperor, one’s family and one’s nation were considered the highest honor. Choosing surrender over death was seen as cowardly and humiliating both to the Japanese soldiers themselves and also to their families.[2] Almost 30,000 American servicemen and women were held as prisoners of war by the Japanese during World War II.[3] Of these 30,000 almost 40% would die while in captivity, which is one of the highest POW death rates in American history.[4]
The prisoners on the march were given almost no food or water for seven days, except what little the native Filipinos would occasionally sneak to them. Although “very, very sick”, fatigued and hungry, Hanneman would survive the Bataan Death March. He eventually ended up in Cabanatuan prisoner of war camp, where he would spend the next year and a half. Hanneman would eventually be sent via ship to a prison camp in mainland Japan where he would stay for another two years until the end of the war.
Although he was no longer on the death march, the prisoner of war camp was hell. Food was mainly rice and fish heads and whatever greens they grew. (13:10-13:41, 20:53-21:00) If someone thought another prisoner might die during the night, often he would stay awake all night so that he could steal the dead’s blanket. They “lived like animals” he remembers. (44:20-44:25) “It was every man for themselves.”
Hanneman can remember only a handful of days during his two-year captivity that the Japanese did not make him and his fellow prisoners work. (20:05-20:14) Like the majority of Japanese held American POWs, Hanneman worked seven days a week.3 His job was working at a Japanese steel mill unloading iron ore and magnesium, “black sand” from the docks. (18:37-19:05)
Upon liberation from the prison camp at the end of the war, Hanneman weighed half of his normal weight of 180 pounds. (41:57-42:27) MacArthur’s forces evacuated Allied POWs to the Philippines for medical attention and to regain their strength through rest and improved diet. For Hanneman and his colleagues, it was a paradise compared to what they had recently known. At a stop at a camp for returning POWs in Manila he remembers “the mess hall was open 24 hours a day!” His strength recovered enough to travel, Hanneman was put on a ship for home.
After arriving in San Francisco, Hannemen joined other American POWs for a train ride home. On a Saturday evening, they arrived at the [5] William J. Mayo General Hospital in Galesburg, Illinois. Even though they had no money to their names, they convinced a nurse, who accompanied them on the train, to let them go downtown. (30:24-31:31) The townspeople welcomed them home, Hanneman recalls, “The taxi drivers wouldn’t take any money. We went downtown and went into a bar and couldn’t buy anything, but nobody would let us go thirsty, believe me.” (31:31-31:48)
Later that night, arriving back at their train one of the doctors came to admit the soldiers to the hospital and had quite a surprise. “Hell, they're drunk. We can't examine them," Hanneman laughs, remembering one of the doctors saying. They would eventually be admitted the next day. After discharge from Mayo General Hospital and returning to Madison, Hanneman reconnected with his girlfriend he had had before the war. Within a short time they were married.
“She is my pride and joy. She’s kept me alive this last fifty-six years,” Hanneman said. (33:06-33:37)
On their honeymoon in Chicago like that Saturday night they pulled into Galesburg, he found that once again he could not buy a drink. And later, as a POW, he was given an all-expenses paid (with the exception of alcohol he said) trip for two weeks to a city of his choice.
“Most everybody, with my uniform on, could see that I’d been a POW. They wouldn’t let me buy drinks. Occasionally we could buy drinks.” (34:10-35:26)
Hanneman said that remarkably he doesn’t have any hard feelings towards the Japanese. Indeed one of his best golfing buddies was Japanese and until he had always wanted to go back. (46:40-47:54)
Perhaps during the pandemic, as we experience disruptions to our routines, Herb Hanneman’s story can offer us some perspective and gratitude. For many of us, a few months being confined at our homes with those we love, or being asked to wear a mask in public, feels like a minor sacrifice to his three-and-a-half years of imprisonment in squalid conditions, halfway around the world. We are grateful for the sacrifices of Herb Hanneman and other American prisoners of war.

The shortest woman measures 5 feet, 0 inches. Each woman is a different height, and the difference in height between any pair of women is a different integral number of inches. There are four platforms on the stage, raising the shorter women to the height of the tallest. If the total platform height is a minimum, what are the heights of the other four women?
Extensions: Some obvious extensions suggest themselves. Repeat the problem for 3,4,6,7,8 women. Is there any pattern or procedure which helps in the solutions?
Source: Original.
Update 11/4/2006. Graeme Finlay and students at Q/E Jr/Sr. High School in Calgary, Alberta found fault with the solutions below. As stated, the problem is looking for the minimum platform height, not the minimum person height. They have improved upon the original solution considerably. Here is their email:
My students and I were looking at this problem and had a disagreement with the solution provided.
For 5 women you had the heights listed as 5'11,5'9,5'4,5'1,& 5'0 with the inches over the shortest girl being 11,9,4,1,0 but the total platform height (the sum of the heights required to make them all even) is 30 inches.
If the women's heights are 6'0, 5'11, 5'9, 5'5 & 5'0 then difference in height over the shortest is 12,11,9,5,0 but the total platform height is only 23 inches.
Kirk and Alan pointed out this is simply a veiled restating of the Golomb Ruler problem:. (I knew that.)
Alan's summary of the answer is thorough:
# tallest inches over shortest girl 2 5'1" 0 1 3 5'3" 0 1 3 4 5'6" 0 1 4 6 5 5'11" 0 1 4 9 11 6 6'5" 0 1 4 10 12 17 7 7'1" 0 1 4 10 18 23 25 8 7'10" 0 1 4 9 15 22 32 34 9 8'8" 0 1 5 12 25 27 35 41 44 10 9'7" 0 1 6 10 23 26 34 41 53 55So the answer to part 1 of your puzzle is {5'0", 5'1", 5'4", 5'6"}Continued warming could transform Greater Yellowstone fire regimes by mid-21st century

Now this is my kind of art. Folksy, bold, graphic, retro and sweet as can be. Born in Adelaide and now living in Melbourne, Pilgram is a freelance artist with a love of all things 1960's-70's. Her influences include "heinz edelmann’s yellow submarine, the designers behind push pin graphic, marimekko, alexander girard and the bold fabrics etc. of the era".
Pilgram's signature style can be found gracing A3 and A4 prints/posters, tote bags, mini cards adn tags. Her bright colour combinations and fun designs lend themself to children's rooms (how can you choose just one?) but are cool enough for any room of the house. My absolute favourite pieces are the individual letter prints from the alphabet series. I think I've found my new go-to newborn gift idea.
If you love Pilgram's style, you can find draw! pilgrim artwork in the etsy store. Check out the draw! pilgrim blog for more art and lovely things.

Ranked in ~ #6 on the AFI’s list of the greatest cinematic villains in the very first 100 year of cinema, he bring a bitter taste to every step of it’s a exorbitant Life (1946) that includes his character. As the dispirited foil to Jimmy Stewart’s generally caring and pleasant George Bailey, Potter represents the worst characteristics of capitalism and also greed the live in the callous, elitist decimal of rich Americans. That preys ~ above the needs of others instead of striving to assist them, finishing in a character that is straightforward to despise.
You are watching: Henry potter it’s a wonderful life
Potter’s existence in the movie poses an countless nuisance come George Bailey. Potter is the richest person in town, only stopped from also greater riches many thanks to the tireless efforts of Bailey and also his structure & Loan company. The way Bailey handles his business is based on compassion and community—a reality that keeps Bailey from ever gaining much material wealth that his own—but which separates that from the throat money-loving Potter that will execute anything to rotate a buck. Bailey is happy to sacrifice his very own benefits for the benefit of those around him.
When George Bailey’s absent-minded uncle and also business companion Billy (Thomas Mitchell) accidentally loser $8,000 cash, the future the Bailey structure & Loan is threatened. Through no way of acquiring the funds to store the company afloat, George Bailey quickly spirals into a depression that has been slowly structure his whole life, and considers killing himself—his $15,000 life insurance plan would take care of the debt and make sure the family members in Bedford falls who depend on his firm wouldn’t shed everything. Of course, the Potter who has actually the lacking cash. It was accidentally handed to him sheathe in a newspaper. Even when Bailey comes crawling come Potter for a loan, Potter continues to be silent around his possession and instead takes the chance to ridicule and tease Bailey because that his poor, charitable business acumen.
This occasion stumbles George into the dream people where a second-class angel called Clarence (Henry Travers), sent earlier to planet to try and earn his wings, shows George exactly how Bedford falls (now Potterville) would be if he never ever existed. When proving every the fruitful means he has actually kept the town free of overwhelming Potter tyranny, George realizes his importance and also significance. He return to the real civilization where the residents of Bedford falls shower that in your financial generosity, giving back to the male who has offered them therefore much.
But nobody ever before finds out Potter stole the $8,000. Exactly how did he obtain away with it? that a wonderful Life was developed in 1946, in the elevation of the Hays password which dictated the moral principles on which movies had to it is in founded. Among its commandments was the criminals have to be punished for wrongdoings.
It is arguable that Potter didn’t precisely steal the money, in that he did not consciously make a criminal initiative to take the funds from Bailey’s possession. It is a instance of ethical theft versus legal theft. He discovered something that didn’t belong to him and should have made an initiative to return it, but kept that after realizing it could work to his great benefit.
To that end, the is possible that due to the fact that Potter was hoping the ns of this money would ruin Bailey and also his business, the act of his theft to be a malicious attempt the didn’t involved fruition. Bailey structure & Loan was able to survive, and also therefore Potter’s evil did no prevail.
If the a wonderful Life supporters the usual “crime doesn’t pay” mentality of movies of the era, we need to attribute a ethical sentence to porter behavior. Due to the fact that George succeeds in the end, the stolen cash becomes rather irrelevant. Potter loses because George stays in business. Over there is an argument to be made the Potter is one amoral character, and therefore a moral punishment for him means little. His life is all about money, and he’s up an easy $8,000 at the finish of the situation. But, Potter is also a businessman, and also the collapse of Bailey structure & Loan would have actually resulted in revenues of way beyond $8,000 in time. Truly, if that is every he profited from the situation, the is mirroring that on one implicitly more comprehensive scale, crime doesn’t pay.

This must have actually been the thinking for the Hays censors allowing Potter to get away with maintaining the cash. The viewer is allowed to identify Potter’s fate, and few people would discover the character and also find the to be an admirable person. It’s most likely that potter’s overwhelmingly disastrous personality and hatred by the community is “code” sufficient to imply that people shouldn’t behave together he does.When you or one of your employees drives a car involved in your business’ operation, it is necessary to have business car insurance to provide protection for you as well as for your business. Insurance coverage for business vehicles is a bit different from your everyday car insurance. For this reason, it’s important to buy your coverage from an insurance company that provides policies designed specifically for businesses.
When You Need a Business Car Policy
You need business car insurance if you transport people at all. It is also necessary if you use a vehicle that is out of the ordinary, such as a bus or lorry that carries special equipment. You can ask that your insurance company provides you with an individual assessment for your needs, based on the uses of your car or other vehicle. You might not have to go to a company that specialises in business car policies to provide what you need and have a policy tailored to you. Whether you allow employees to use a car just when there is the need for travel or you provide them with cars as a part of their position with your business, insurance is essential. If your business has a fleet of cars, most insurance providers may offer a significant discount. Don’t let the offer of a discount stop you from looking further, though. Since most providers offer them, you can feel secure in shopping around a bit.
Talk to Your Business Insurance Company
If you have insurance policies for other things related to your business, such as business liability or insurance on the building, get in touch with your insurance agent before going somewhere else. There is a good chance that they offer business car insurance. Insurance companies that provide more than one type of coverage like this offer discounts for multiple policies, that may save you some money. Some business insurance providers do not offer policies to all businesses, however. Some may offer coverage for those who travel for electronics installation while not providing insurance to businesses that have services for transporting children because of high risk. Be sure to ask if the company has any restrictions on business vehicle activities before you purchase a policy with them.
Insuring Your Employees
If it is feasible, only insure drivers who are age 25 or older. Drivers under 25 may be more expensive to list on any car insurance policy, but particularly costly to put on business car policies. This is because business car insurance typically provides far higher policy limits, so they view younger drivers as exceptionally high risks on a vehicle that is used for business purposes. Whether your employees are over 25 or not, however, it would be a good idea for you to look into their driving history if they will be using a business vehicle. Your insurance company is sure to perform these checks – you should, as well.
Don’t Use Personal Coverage or Cars
Driving a business vehicle while assuming that your personal car insurance policy will cover you in the event of an accident is a mistake. The same goes for using your personal car for business purposes without informing your insurance company first. If your insurance provider discovers that you are using your car for business, they could cancel your coverage. If you have an accident while using your car for business activity, they could have the right to refuse any claim that you try to make. It is not worth the risk and loss of insurance to try and get away with these things without your insurance company’s knowledge.
The Cost of a Business Car Policy
While business car policies tend to cost more than personal coverage because business vehicles are driven more and tend to carry costly equipment, it is not impossible to get an excellent deal. If your employees who drive your business cars are qualified for UK business driving, you may get a discount of up to 10%. However, one way to possibly save money is to use online comparison sites. Many car insurance comparison sites allow you to choose a business vehicle option. You may find competitive quotes and compare price with coverage to get an affordable policy that will still fit your business’ needs.
It may not be too difficult to obtain a cheap quote for a high quality insurance policy on your business vehicles. You simply need to look around. A good insurance comparison site will give you some great ideas as to what kind of coverage you can expect, even if you opt to not buy insurance online. If you already have an agent whom you use for business insurance purposes, he or she is a great person to ask about your business car insurance and they may know about some discounts that you were unaware of. It is almost always worth asking about discounts for various businesses – cheap car insurance companies may provide significant breaks on everything from environmentally friendly practices, such as using hybrid or electric cars, to keeping your distance travelling low so that you cut down on the dangers of long car trips. So don’t be shy – it never hurts to ask!Munich, 27 January 2021

The first measure Congress has taken under its fiscal cliff deal is the repealing of the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) Act.
Part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the CLASS Act was originally designed to provide a basic cash benefit to individuals who require long-term care. Since then, the program has been abandoned by the Obama Administration, writes a Forbes contributor.
Expensive premiums for buyers along with concerns regarding the program’s financial sustainability placed the CLASS Act under criticism by Republicans and it eventually lost Democratic support as well.
As a “trade-off” to the abandonment of the CLASS Act, the second measure under the deal describes the creation of a national long-term care commission.- Birthstones

Astigmatic Keratotomy is a procedure for reducing the degree of astigmatism by reshaping the cornea from an oval shape into a more spherical shape. Astigmatic Keratotomy (AK) may be viewed as a modified form of Radial Keratotomy (RK).It an operation in which the cornea is relaxed by a series of transverse incisions to flatten the meridian in which the incisions are made and increase the curvature in the meridian 90° away. It is safe and effective, but in recent years, it has been largely replaced by LASIK. Astigmatic Keratotomy is useful for numerous refractive problems, including congenital astigmatism, astigmatism with a cataract, posttraumatic astigmatism, and astigmatism after corneal transplantation. It is sometimes performed after LASIK or Photorefractive Keratectomy to improve the vision of people with astigmatism.
Astigmatic Keratotomy is best suited for the patients who have minimal or moderate degrees of astigmatism, and who doesn’t have prior major eye problems, and had stable eye prescription for at least a year, and who want better vision from astigmatism without the need of contacts or eyeglasses. Patients with more severe astigmatisms may still require glasses or contact lenses after astigmatic keratotomy (AK) eye surgery.
Disadvantages of astigmatic keratotomy:
Astigmatic keratotomy (AK) eye surgery is done under a local anesthesia and the entire procedure lasts for a maximum of 10 minutes for both eyes and it involves making one or two incisions at the steepest part of the cornea. Here the Astigmatic keratotomy (AK) incisions are made in a straight line or in an arc-like form, depending on the data generated by the preoperative testing, evaluation process and the surgeon's judgment and then the incisions are made outside of the central zone, or visual axis, of the cornea.
Astigmatic keratotomy (AK) eye surgery is more useful to patients who underwent previous 4-, 6-, or 8-cut radial keratotomy (RK). The surgeon makes incisions in the cornea so as to change its curvature and the incisions are flattened the steep portion of the cornea, making the eye more spherical.Weingut Künstler, Hochheimer Hölle, Riesling Kabinett trocken 2008?
Well, actually they do it by being very serious. First of all the 'artist' part. The wine was made by winemaker Künstler, which is German for 'artist'. And the grapes for this Riesling come from a vineyard near the town of Hochheim that is call Hölle - 'hell'. As you can see, this is all quite orderly and no pun is intended. Very serious and systematic German classification at work.
And now the wine: A nose of peach and citrus fruit combined with elderflower and some mineral. While there is some mineral in the mouth too, think flint stone, the Künstler is not dominated by it. Lively acid, zesty lime, apple and citrus, elderflower and vegetable notes, well balanced with a pleasant zing on the palate and a good finish.
If you find this appetising but do not want to order from Germany, Waitrose are also offering this wine in the UK:
Actually Hölle isn't supposed
Actually Hölle isn't supposed to mean hell in this case. It stems from the Middle High German word Halde which means steep hill or steep slope. But of course it'S fun to drink a hell of a good wine! ;) Greets, Alex
In reply to Actually Hölle isn't supposed by Alex
Now you are confusing the
Now you are confusing the English, Alex! Not only do they have to know how to read a German wine label, they also need to study Middle High German... There are quite a few vineyards called 'Hölle' in Germany - in the 'Gleisweiler Hölle', for instance, Heiner Geißler, one of the grandees of the German conservative party, is growing wine - but I still think it is much more fun to think of the name as actually meaning 'hell'. Having said that, I would not want to argue with your last statement! Cheers, TorstenHigh school teacher Haguiar Gayak knows the value of education, but when she looks back on her own school years, she still remembers struggling to understand the lessons.
Growing up in Cotabato province on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, Gayak spoke the local language Magindanawn at home with her family. In school, however, Gayak and her classmates could only study in Filipino and English.
“Learning to read and write in other languages like English and Filipino felt strange,” she said.
Many of Gayak’s classmates lost interest and eventually dropped out of school. Coupled with intermittent armed conflicts and civil unrest, close to half of the children who enroll in elementary schools in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi drop out before graduation. Only one out of every ten students who begins primary education in those provinces graduates from junior high school on time. This was one of the many reasons why Gayak chose to become a teacher: to show children and their families the value of literacy.
Since then, the Philippines has implemented a policy requiring teachers to use the local language for instruction in kindergarten to grade three in order to increase literacy. Filipino and English are introduced as the language of instruction after third grade. However, lack of books in students’ mother tongue means many students don’t have the resources they need to establish a strong foundation in literacy.
To address that challenge, USAID is working with The Asia Foundation (TAF) to adapt children’s books into local languages like Gayak’s own mother tongue, Magindanawn, and four other local languages. Over the past year, USAID and TAF conducted four online workshops to translate children’s books in Magindanawn.
When Gayak’s friend and fellow teacher Jennifer Dagadas sent her a link regarding this opportunity to translate children’s books into her mother tongue, Gayak immediately applied. In all, 34 Magindanawn language enthusiasts, including Gayak and Dagadas, were selected to participate.
“Writing stories is my passion. It feels like a dream come true to be part of the program,” said Gayak.
While book adaptation workshops are generally held face-to-face, COVID-19 restrictions meant that this workshop had to be redesigned in an online format. Despite challenges like poor internet connectivity, lack of equipment, and power outages, Gayak and Dagadas said they enjoyed the process.
“I did not mind the technology and internet problems. We enjoyed the whole experience, and I even recruited more friends to join the next workshops,” said Dagadas. “We discovered that we have so much to learn about our language and that we have to explore and go back to our roots.”
During the workshops, the team assigned each volunteer three books to translate within the day. Experienced volunteers received three additional books to translate over the weekend. Each book was carefully selected to promote social and emotional learning while cultivating a love of reading, and translations undergo quality assurance from the Department of Education.
Thanks to the volunteers’ dedication, USAID and TAF successfully translated 45 books into Magindanawn. Twenty-five of these books are now published in the online Let’s Read library, a free digital library for children, while 20 books are still in the final editing stage. These online, mother-tongue based materials give students the resources they need to continue learning in their local languages, even without in-person classes.
So far, the project has trained more than 100 writers, illustrators, and editors and produced nearly 350 children’s books in local languages, with more book adaptation and training workshops planned for the coming year.
“The most challenging part for me was translating the story with proper linguistic and situational context,” said Dagadas. “Now that we have completed the translation, the next step is to write our own stories so our children can read our language and be proud of our identity.”

The proverbial hot corner is awash in talent this year. I’ll get into that a bit more momentarily, but first I wanted to use this space to offer up some of my deep, deep third base sleepers. Matt Duffy in Tampa could work his way into leadoff duties and score a lot of runs with double-digit homers and steals. Todd Frazier (if healthy) could still be useful in OBP leagues with some power and speed. Colin Moran hit .300 over the second half of 2018 and is the starting third baseman for the Pirates, for Pete sake. He’s the 29th third baseman off the board! Anyway, while I like those values in deep leagues, the one who I can’t help but love in spite of myself, is The Dude.
Spring Training games are underway! It’s time you got your fantasy baseball season started as well. Leagues are already forming at Fantrax.com, so head on over and get your league started today.
Dokken’s Dudes and Don’ts for Third Base
The Dude – Wil Myers
Red Dragon is an awesome movie. Somehow it is rarely talked about these days despite being a Hannibal Lecter movie with a superstar cast including Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, and more. I’ve seen it a bunch of times, and now every time I see the name Will (or Wil, in this case) I start talking like Lecter to Norton’s character, Will Graham. “Tell me Wil, did you enjoy it? Your first full season without injury? You’re a remarkable boy, I admire your courage. I think I’ll eat your heart.” And then I click “draft” because I love his value this year. And his liver.
Wil Myers put together terrific back-to-back seasons in 2016-17 as the primary first baseman for the Padres. Safe and sound at first base, it was hard for the fragile Myers to find excuses to hit the DL (now the IL). Then, for some reason, the Padres decided to give Eric Hosmer $144 million to stick around for eight years. Myers was booted off of first base and split time between third and the outfield. It predictably didn’t work out, as he was limited to 83 games due to injuries.
His on-pace numbers we right on the money with his prior two years of production, which is to say: borderline elite. He had 58 homers and 48 steals combined in 2016-17, although the average leaves something to be desired. He’s just about the only fantasy option at third base besides Jose Ramirez who could realistically steal you 20 bases. All he really needs to do is stay healthy, and he is one of the few hitters in baseball with true 30/20 potential. The lineup around him is improving rapidly as well, and he’ll be hitting right in the middle of it.
I’m willing to gamble on his health since his risk is very much baked into his 3B11/ADP89 price tag. Since he’ll be primarily playing the outfield, I’m still going to factor in about two weeks on the Injured List. Even if it’s a bit more, Wil Myers + Replacement Player is still mighty fine, especially in standard mixers where the replacement level is high. If you play in a deeper league, while the risk is worrisome, the 3B/OF dual eligibility is quite nice. I’d like to eat his ROI potential with fava beans and a nice chianti. *Makes grotesque sucking sounds*

The Don’t – Rafael Devers
I feel a bit dirty on this one, I won’t lie to you. Typically I like to pick a more highly drafted player to tell you to steer clear of, but I just can’t plop a name in here I feel fully confident in. The top 10 third basemen are rock solid. I weighed my options. Jose Ramirez could put up his September 2018 numbers for a full season. Maybe Vladito struggles as a rookie. Perhaps Father Time or another shoulder injury finds Matt Carpenter. In the end, I can’t convince myself of any of these things. So, we dip down to 3B16, Rafael Devers.
Devers is a darn fine player with a long, successful career in front of him. I won’t argue that. I love him in dynasty leagues. However, in 2018 he hit just .240 with 21 homers, scoring 59 runs and driving in 66 from the bottom half of the order. As stacked as the BoSox are again in 2019, it’s unlikely he moves up in the order. He has plenty of raw power but hasn’t fully developed the contact ability to tap into it. He was also horrible against lefties, with a .619 OPS and 29.9% hard contact rate, which could lead to a platoon situation.
Again, not to take anything away from him – what he did as a 21-year old was impressive. For fantasy purposes though, I’m not sure we get an age-22 breakout, which is very much baked into his ADP. If you like his skill set, it’s rather easy to find. In fact, you could wait a whopping 135 picks from Devers’ ADP of 133 for…
Projection: 550 Plate Appearances, 23 HR, 65 R, 75 RBI, .260 AVG
The Deep League Dude – Jake Lamb
…Jake Lamb! Boy, what a difference one year makes. Have a look at his 2016-17 numbers:
2016: 594 PA, 29 HR, 81 R, 91 RBI, .249 AVG
2017: 635 PA, 30 HR, 89 R, 105 RBI, .248 AVG
Aside from an overwhelmingly mediocre batting average, that’s a studly fantasy hitter. He obviously had an awful 2018, most of which he missed due to injury…and now he’s worthless? I just don’t see the logic in that. He is the 22nd third baseman drafted, with an overall ADP of 268.
Assuming he is back to full health, what is holding him back from a repeat of his 2016 numbers? The 2017 R+RBI totals might be a bit strong considering the Diamondbacks lineup these days, but Lamb is still set to turn a tidy profit from this draft price. So he can’t hit lefties, so what? Travis Shaw can’t hit lefties either, and he’s being drafted at pick 98! There is little stopping Jake Lamb from being a poor man’s Travis Shaw. On top of the value you’re getting with Lamb, you will also be able to deploy him at either first or third base shortly into the season as he moves across the diamond to fill Paul Goldschmidt’s shoes. Enjoy your Lamb with couscous and sweet, juicy ROI.

Kingstown – The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre has said that another explosive eruption was observed at the La Soufriere Volcano in St Vincent at 2:45 p.m. today.
The vertical ash column was estimated to have gone approximately 4km into the atmosphere.
A notice on the Facebook Page of the Centre said they will continue to monitor and give updates.
There was an explosve eruption at La Soufriere at 8: 41 a.m. today after an order to evacuate the red zone was issued by Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves yesterday.
Further explosive eruptions are expected at La Soufriere volcano in the coming days and weeks, following the first this morning, as lead scientist Professor Richard Robertson indicated the largest explosion may be yet to come.
Ash plumes as high as 29 000 feet were recorded after the eruption began around 8:41 a.m., and Professor Robertson said Vincentians should expect ash falls continuing for days and even weeks to come.
“Once you’re off the mountain, you should be good. I would suggest to you that if you’re still one of those persons anywhere on the mountain saying you’re going to wait it out and see what happens, the first bang is not necessarily the biggest bang this volcano will give,” he said Friday morning. “I would suggest that you move south.”
Robertson, who is leading the team monitoring the volcano which is located on the north of the island, told a press conference around 10:30 a.m. that the volcano went into continuous tremors overnight.
“The batch of magma that had been trying to come up for the longest while, it seems that it either went to the surface or close to the surface and then overnight it punched through and you could say it has cleared the throat of the volcano. After the explosion, the shaking went on for about 40 minutes or so . . . and it continued roaring, so to speak, for a little while.
“We are now back into a sort of quiet period in between. The explosive eruption . . . has started and once it has started, it’s possible that you could have more explosions like these. Essentially, there is fresh magma, fresh material, gas which is enough to cause an explosion, very close to the surface, and once that is there it could generate an explosion. The first one might have been not necessarily the biggest one. It is possible that you could have explosions that go higher,” the geologist said.
“We won’t be surprised if this continues for the next few days, the next few weeks,” Robertson added. .”
He added that in the event there are more explosive eruptions, it would still be the communities in the red zone that would get the brunt of it.
“The rest of St Vincent is probably going to be mainly affected only by ash,” Robertson added, noting that how far the ash goes will depend on the wind direction.
“We have ash clouds reported by pilots between 20 miles north to 50 miles southeast of St Vincent, reaching up to 29 000 feet . . . . Once the ash is in the atmosphere it eventually falls back down so areas as far south as Belmont at the observatory here . . . had some ashfall,” he said.
Evacuations from the red zone are continuing, Prime Minister Dr. Ralph Gonsalves reported at the press conference.
Late Thursday afternoon he had issued the evacuation order for people living on the north east and north west of the island, after Professor Robertson advised that an eruption could occur within 24 to 48 hours.
Gonsalves reported Friday morning that about 4 500 people had been moved in minibuses, private transportation and ferries to safe zones, and there were about 2 000 people in emergency shelters.
The Prime Minister said he wants the elderly and sick to be placed in guesthouses, hotels and private residences.
“Of course, large numbers of persons still would have to stay in the shelters but the more we get persons who can go into homes and who can go into the hotels and the guest houses, whether here or outside of St Vincent and the Grenadines, we should do so.
“Why I’m anxious for that is that this not going to be simply like a hurricane where it might be a seven-day business, in some cases a two-day business. Professor Robertson has indicated that depending on the extent of the explosion and the damage done, it could be four months.”
“But in all of this, I want everybody to cooperate. I don’t want us to get frustrated, I don’t want us to panic. I want us to be disciplined, I want us to be orderly,” he added.
Gonsalves added that two cruise ships had already arrived to take people to the neighbouring Caribbean islands that had agreed to take in evacuees.
Royal Caribbean and Carnival cruise lines have promised five of their vessels.
However, Gonsalves stressed that the cruise ships would only be transporting people to other islands, as they did not have enough personnel to keep people on board the vessels.
The Chief Medical Officer will identify people who are vaccinated against COVID-19, which is a requirement for people to get on the ships.
Gonsalves said the governments of Dominica, Grenada and Antigua had indicated they would be ready by Sunday or Monday to accept evacuees.
“It is very touching that there are families in Antigua and Grenada and St Lucia and Dominica who are calling in and saying that they will take people, if need be, into their homes. Amazing, eh? On this dangerous road to Jericho, we have the Good Samaritans.
“I love this Caribbean,” an emotional Gonsalves said.

Inter-row Hoeing Machines
TÜMOSAN Inter-row hoeing machine with miller cutter is an ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY machine that weeds between the rows of the plants that are sown on the rows such as maize, beet, sunflower, cotton, potato, tomato, pepper etc. without damaging the plants and thus ensuring the plants to get the adequate nutrients and water from the soil. The row space can be adjusted by sliding the units on the chassis. The working depth is adjusted by the 2 displaceable wheels located on the chassis. The working width of the units may vary depending on the products and plant space. Thanks to the optional fertilizer container and the furrow opener tool, the fertilizer that is scattered during hoeing ensures mixing with the soil homogenously. The mixture that is piled up around the root of the plant allows the plant benefit maximumly from the fertilizer.

The Agreement allows for zero tariff trade between the two partners but does not exempt UK companies from the red tape associated with a customs border, including the need to handle customs declarations for imports and exports.
The UK tax office has estimated that British businesses will spend £7.5 billion a year handling customs declarations for trade with the EU — as much as they would have done under a no-deal Brexit – and has stated that the number of customs forms needed to trade with the EU under the Brexit deal “is not materially different from a no-deal situation”.
The effects on UK exports to the EU have been immediate. A Road Haulage Association (RHA) member survey found the volume of exports going through British ports to the EU fell by 68% in January compared to the same month last year, mostly as a result of problems caused by Brexit.
While there has been a huge fall in UK exports to the EU with the immediate introduction of EU customs controls to UK products on 1st January, the situation in relation to UK imports from the EU has been different.
UK imports from the EU have been affected by port congestion and a shortage of freight capacity. However, unlike the EU, the UK government chose a phased approach to introduction of customs controls, postponing the introduction of certain import procedures for EU products.
These grace periods are designed to give businesses more time to adapt to the new rules and ways of working.
The UK’s initial intent was that requirements for phytosanitary certification of UK imports from the EU should be introduced from April while requirements for full customs declarations on entering the UK market, rather than submitting forms at a later date, should be introduced from July.
However, on 11 March, the UK announced that these grace periods would be extended for an extra six months in a bid to give businesses and customs officials more time to prepare for the additional red tape and to avoid the threat of food shortages in the summer.
The move means the first checks on imports from the EU into the UK will not start until October, with full border controls not being carried out until 1 January 2022 – a full year after the UK left the EU.
These changes have significant implications for the UK timber importing trade. In a typical year, the UK imports around 9 million cubic metres of timber from Europe, mostly softwoods and panel products, but including some hardwood products, most notably oak sawnwood and birch plywood.
Timber imported from the EU accounts for well over half of all timber and panels consumed in the UK. In addition, the UK imports wood furniture with a total value of USD1.2 billion from the EU, around one third of all imports and 15% of all consumption of wood furniture in the UK.
Insights on the immediate effects of the UK’s departure from the EU single market on the UK timber importing trade are provided in a TTF member survey published on 1st March. The survey draws on the views of thirty-six respondents representing timber importers, merchants, agents, and manufacturers.
In introducing the survey, the TTF note that, “Q1 2021 has already brought multiple reports of haulage and freight companies rejecting jobs and hiking prices to travel to Britain amid long waiting times at British ports”.
The survey suggests that the effects of Brexit on the UK timber trade have been muted so far, particularly in the hardwood sector. However, since border controls have yet to be fully implemented, this may not be indicative of the long term impact. The survey report finds that “Brexit red tape has caused a mild impact on their business as customs and due diligence mapping combined with logistical challenges from increased border checks has slowed down trading, but not demand”.
Somewhat contradicting this conclusion, the survey report also finds that “Members have stated they are experiencing a dramatic slowdown in deliveries, particularly from haulage across the English Channel from European countries”.
Where impacts are reported, they are a very much focused on softwoods. While 66% of respondents stated they have had “logistics issues importing and exporting softwood due to haulage companies charging increased rates, rejecting their request for delivery in and out of the UK, and a lack of truck ability due to the trade barriers introduced by Brexit”, only 33% and 0% of respondents stated these same issues had impacted on the hardwood trade.
Similarly, new requirements for phytosanitary certificates on UK imports from the EU had impacted on 33% of hardwood traders compared to 66% of softwood traders.
A significant issue for many TTF members to date has been growing obstacles to their trade with Northern Ireland (NI). Although NI is a part of the UK, the region also remains in the EU single market to prevent the creation of a hard border between NI and the Irish Republic and thereby protect the NI peace process.
The TTF survey report notes that “while ‘unfettered access’ from Great Britain to Northern Ireland had been promised, in reality trading has become more difficult, with a number of our members reporting they are looking to cease trading with Northern Ireland until the trade barriers are removed”.
The TTF also notes that new requirements for UKCA marking are starting to concern members. “While this year members can continue placing CE-marked goods onto the UK market, from January 2022 the UKCA mark will become the sole UK conformance mark. This would raise considerable trade barriers and challenges next year with concerns businesses will not have enough time to prepare for the implementation of the new mark.
The TTF has announced that it “will work with the Construction Products Association (CPA) and the Confederations of Business Industries (CBI) to advocate for a deferment of the implementation of the mark or to achieve equivalence with the CE Mark”.

Art by Douglas Shuler
Following on from the excellent #0 we start to get to the real crux of Agent 1.22. we start of with flashbacks and nightmares, which link nicely into the final couple of pages of the story. In between we have a recovery mission for the agent, which isn’t for people but for data. Obviously some people aren’t happy with this state of affairs and we get a very well laid out action sequence.
The story is very well told, if a little wordy, but the majority of those words are from the companion AI and they do add something to the story – especially when the agent makes the decision she does…
The ending of the story is interesting and leads us on to the arc and the main story. It’s a bit of a surprise and I’m interested to see where this all leads and how it all looks together.
I enjoy the art, and I like the sci-fi feel to it all. The droids where especially good and have me a ‘Portal’ feel to it all..
Read the preview here, and Agent 1.22 is available on PDF, comiXology or on Kindle!A wallet keeps secret information, called a private key or a seed.

Its time to honor the honor the hero of standard, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. With Teferi rotating soon, I had to make some more memories. What better way than to make a control/prison deck?
Gameplan
We still get to play our typical control gameplan but.....we added Rule of Law. Of course, there will be games where we could potentially lock ourselves out but more often than not, this will be in our favor as we play a ton of counterspells like Absorb and Dovin's Veto.
This card and Teferi, Time Raveler will make our opponents' lives feel very much like a prison as they won't do anything on our turn and they can only do one thing on theirs. How we'll usually win is through Ugin, the Ineffable and other planeswalkers as we beat them with a 2/2 token and sit behind countermagic. We also added Clear the Mind in case we need to reload.
We also have wonderful cards like Fall of the Thran to reaaaaaaaaally add to the prison feel as we'll try to slam this down and immediately send it back to our hand so nobody gets their lands back. Where we're going?....we won't need lands! We'll have planeswalkers.
Conclusion
With Teferi almost leaving, I felt it was only appropriate that I make a few videos to honor him and this was definitely a blast. Are there more efficient ways to win? Yes. Do we care? Nope! If you've got the wildcards, you can definitely take this for a spin. Have fun assembling the lock and be ready for opponents to all of a sudden go AFK *Insert Winky Face*.
See you at the next one!

The French formation Mudbath makesa combination of Sludge and Doom since their formation in 2011. A year later they came with a first EP and in 2015 the guys are ready for their debut full length album. “Corrado Zeller” is out now.
Mudbath is an act that starts their album quite calm, but gives you quite fast an image of what to expect of this release. For it comes with three tracks that are quite in line with each other. They don’t really need much glitter and glam, they can do a whole lot with a minimalistic approach and that speaks for them.
They are slowly and teasing, moving forward as well as they do a step back leaving you to wonder where a track is going through, but when you are half way you notice there is the progress in the song and it is slowly getting a bit more extreme. The sludge elements are there obviously, but that doomish edge that is on them is not really left out either. A good balance between them is found and the guys make transitions between different parts go so smoothly you hardly notice you are taken by the hand towards a new dimension.
“Corrado Zeller” is a release that drags you into an album but does not really have a whole lot going on that should get you wild and yet it does. The guys know perfectly how to play with your span of attention and keep you with them throughout the whole release.

Mika – guitars, vocals

Officially, U.S. District Court Judge William Osteen granted Greensboro’s motion for summary judgment on Wednesday, Sept. 18. Granting the motion for summary judgment means that the court has ruled that taking the evidence in the light most favorable to BNT, it does not have a winnable case.
It all started in June 2013, with the Greensboro City Council agreeing to loan BNT $300,000 to produce the television show Whatcha Cookin’. One of the conditions of that loan was that the city take the second position on property put up as collateral. During the due diligence period, the city discovered that there was more debt on the property being put for collateral than they had been told, and not one lien, but two. The City Council then voted 6 to 3 not to change the terms of the loan to take a third position instead of a second position on the collateral.
BNT filed suit for racial discrimination claiming that the City Council voted not to grant the loan because the owners of BNT, Michael and Ramona Woods, are black.
As is noted in the court opinion, the loan under the original terms was still available to BNT for months even after the lawsuit was filed.
The case took a weird turn in March 2019, when the attorney for BNT, Norman Smith of Smith, James, Rowlett and Cohen, asked to be removed as counsel and further requested that two briefs he had filed on behalf of BNT be stricken from the record.
As reported earlier, the presentation made by BNT to the City Council involved some sleight of hand. It showed a national magazine with an article about Whatcha Cookin’ on the cover. However, the cover of that magazine had been altered and the actual magazine sold across the country didn’t have an article about Whatcha Cookin’ on the cover.
One of the reasons the case dragged on for six years was that the lawsuit was dismissed in federal district court and that dismissal was appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the dismissal was overruled and sent back to the North Carolina Middle District Court in Greensboro.About ICTH 2017 2017-2017 will be held in conjunction with The 8th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN)..

Fight Directors Canada requires three specific weapon systems at the Basic Actor-Combatant level: Sword, Quarterstaff and Unarmed. The 20 hours of lessons per weapon covers how to wield the weapon with accuracy and effective fighting style, in drills, choreography and flourishes. Equally important are the safety concerns with each weapon, and how to create the illusion of violence with each strike and move. At the end of the course, the student will perform three fight scenes (complete with dialogue and acting besides an impressive fight), one for each weapon, evaluated by an FDC Fight Master.
Stage Combat Basics
Actors need to have a variety of skills and comprehensive training to be effective actor-combatants.
- A selection of techniques that includes several types of punches, slaps, ways to fall, sword manoeuvres, staff manipulation, and ways to conceal safety tricks.
- Ability to tell an emotional story with the scene, portraying the anger in the attacker, the fear of the victim, the exhaustion of a long fight and the pain of wounds… all while keeping the choreography consistent.
- Incorporating the fight into the play with dialogue, character choices, connection with your partner and the scene.
Sword
The fundamental sword techniques taught in the lessons can be adapted to any one-handed sword, such as the rapier, the hand-and-a-half sword, the Scottish basket-hilt, the sabre and even the bayonnet. In this class we’ll cover footwork, parries, cuts and thrusts, control of the opponent’s blade, how to play wounds, and what options exist for customization.
Staff
Considered by many to be the most challenging weapon to keep both safe and exciting, the staff will test your coordination. Robin Hood would not be the same without Little John’s challenge to a quarterstaff duel.
Unarmed
At this level, we show you all the secrets of a great fist-fight featuring knock-down-drag-out action that looks realistic and brutal and that works in ancient and modern settings. The Fight Directors Canada Program will cover punches, slaps, throws, hair pulls, grappling and dozens of other topics.
Beyond Basic: Intermediate Certification
If you already have FDC Basic Actor-Combatant certification and you want to take your skills to the next level, we’re also running an Intermediate certification course. This level covers historical broadsword, small sword, martial arts and rapier & dagger. At this second level, certification requires 80 hours.
Get approved for Intermediate by contacting david@academieduello.com with your FDC Certification information.

FDC Certification Course FAQ
I have auditions in those times on weekdays… what happens if I miss a class?
You need to have 60 hours of instruction under a certified instructor, so you will need to make up the lesson you missed. Here’s a couple of ways of redoing those hours:
- Arrange to have a private lesson with your instructor
- Arrange to come to the evening Performance Classes when your instructor can take time to redo that lesson.
Are there prerequisites? Do I need the Stage Combat Fundamentals (formerly “Slaps & Slashes”) workshop?
No. We will take you through the entire course assuming you have no former training. If you have already done the “Slaps & Slashes” workshop or our current Stage Combat Fundamentals course, you should ask for the $60 discount on the course cost, but you will be expected to begin the course on day one.

Row for the Cure Comes to Sarasota
After the closing ceremonies of the World Championships, Row for the Cure will take to the water.
Row for the Cure raises money for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
This fall, you don’t have to be an elite athlete to get on the water at the 2017 World Rowing Championships. The world rowing event, which is being held at Nathan Benderson Park, will also host a fundraiser benefitting breast cancer awareness non-profit Row for the Cure.
Founded in Portland in 1993, Row for the Cure is a national supporter of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. The organization hosts events all around the country and sees more than 5,000 participants row or paddle in Row for the Cure regattas each year.
After the closing ceremonies of the World Rowing Championships, Row for the Cure will take to the water. Supporters will complete a 500-meter race on the same course used by the world’s most elite rowers, raising money for breast cancer awareness and research in the process.
The majority of funds raised will go directly to Susan G. Komen Florida Suncoast, which supports local breast health programs. This support allows women who would otherwise not have access to screening or treatment to get the help that they need.
According to Max Winitz, media and public relations manager of the 2017 World Rowing Championships, the combination of the two events was a no-brainer for its organizers.
“The final day of the 2017 World Rowing Championships falls on the first day of Breast Cancer Awareness Month,” says Winitz. “Our executive director Meredith Scerba felt this would be a tremendous opportunity to team up with Row for the Cure and develop this fun regatta on the final day of the event.”
Participants can choose to row individually on a paddle board or kayak, or to join as a team and row in an eight-person rowing shell or 20-person dragon boat. No experience is required to sign up, and rookies are encouraged to come out for the worthy cause.
With the entry fee for the event, rowers will be provided with all necessary equipment and receive a few perks, including a two-day Championship Weekend ticket to the 2017 World Rowing Championships. The ticket covers the most exciting days of the event, including event finals and medals ceremonies.
Though a lot of interest has been shown for the event so far, there are still many spots available. “We need more people to sign up to help fight this terrible disease,” says Winitz.

Being out in nature is known to significantly improve your mental and physical well-being.
Well, if you’re in Montana, Colorado, Idaho or Wyoming, you likely know you are fortunate to have unparalleled access to some of the most breathtaking landscapes on the planet.
Here are a few recommendations for enjoying your natural assets a little bit more than you already do—if that’s possible! And for the rest of us, we are taking notes for when unfettered travel is possible again.
If you get down to Bozeman, the Bridger Range and other local trails offer some amazing hikes that are perfect for a day of exploring. Make sure you check the climb to the top of Sacajawea off your list. It’s the highest peak in the range and you can see forever from the top. Oh – don’t forget your water and some trail snacks.
Everyone in Missoula knows that with favorable weather, The M is known for the best sunrise and sunset views in Missoula. And like most everywhere in Montana, it’s pet-friendly, so bring your pooch along for the hike, or the jog.
If you’re a fan of fly fishing, you may already have your favorite “unnamed” spots to chase trout—locally and with a little driving. But it’s always a great bet to stop into your local shop and get some inside intel on lesser-known water that you could float or wade— or book a guide to take you out. Especially in the summer when the big bugs have the fish looking up. Check out The Missoulian Angler, The Kingfisher Fly Shop or Grizzly Hackle in Missoula, Fins & Feathers or River’s Edge in Bozeman, or TroutHunter in Island Park (Idaho).
And of course we can’t forget the gem that’s nestled in the heart of the Tetons. Jackson Hole has more than its fair share of beautiful (and well-known) places to hike, bike, jog and paddle. But if you want to spend a day taking on a rewarding – and lesser-known – excursion, check out these six hidden and highly recommended hikes in Jackson.
Leadville, Colorado, is the home of the Leadville Heavy Half-Marathon, which Two Point Capital founder Jack McGowan and his younger brother Matt tackled in 2013. Jack Sr. came along as the cheering section. But even if a sky-high half marathon is not on your immediate to-do list, Leadville charms its visitors with old mining sites and wide open spaces. All roads into Leadville and Twin Lakes are part of the Top of the Rockies Scenic Byway.

I'm enjoying the tracking free existence. But I honestly do remain somewhat cognizant about what I'm eating. And I try to eat mostly fruits and veggies at work! I'm enjoying it so much that I signed up for some program (Rally) that helps with attaining health goals. And when one of the challenges was to track...I couldn't even bring myself to do it for the four weeks!!! The Rally thing...it's through work and earns health care spending money that's out on a Visa card for me to use....very much like a healthcare spending account. So heck yeah I'll do it!!! But from what I see you also earn coins for your good healthy habits....and with those coins you can buy things in an auction style format or you can use them to enter sweepstakes. So rewards available in two formats for me.
So a simple picture from where we rode last weekend!

I can’t believe I waited until Kingdom Hearts III of all games to try the series for the first time, and I’m still working through that mental whiplash. -Jordan] Are there any beloved video game series that you’ve completely missed out on? Resident Evil was one of those series for me. I noticed the positive buzz around Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, but didn’t pay too much attention to it as someone who’d never touched a survival horror game before. I wasn’t interested in those kinds of games… or so I thought. Enter: Resident Evil 2. Upon viewing that glorious E3 2018 trailer, I went from intrigued to hyped within a couple months! Now it’s one of my favorite games of all-time. It made me think ‘How could I have missed this awesome series for so long? What other mind-blowing franchises have been staring me in the face, waiting to be played?’ Remakes have been an integral part of discovering popular IP. Besides the aforementioned Resident Evil 2, Final Fantasy VII Remake introduced me to a truly iconic story, soundtrack, and set of characters I had no experience with beforehand. Guess who’s excited for Final Fantasy XVI now? Remasters are a huge deal as well. I’m not new to The Legend of Zelda series but I’m excited to try out The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD for the first time. The new control options will shape my first impressions of the game differently compared to the players who played the original version. Updated titles and collections like NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139… and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition are ideal entry points. Heck, sometimes the best starting place is the latest game in a series like Monster Hunter Rise or the best game in the series like Super Metroid. You get the idea. Of course, there are some series I just can’t get my hands on due to a myriad of reasons. Some games are stuck on dead consoles, tied in legal red tape or the source code was lost long ago. The initial announcement of the PS3, PSP, and PS Vita store closure highlighted the uncertainty of a digital future. Property holders need to realize their older titles need to continuously make the jump to current consoles so they aren’t lost to time. Some property holders own beloved IP and just leave them dormant. At least remaster and port the titles for newer consoles; I probably haven’t played them! I’m happy to hear Sega seems to be interesting in reviving their back catalog at least. Hopefully other companies follow suit with their dormant IP so we can at least play the games that already exist. Nowadays, you hear people complaining about a lack of new and original games in comparison to all the sequels, remasters, and remakes on the market. However, an undiscovered series is new for someone who has never played them before. I’m excited to dive into long-running franchises and brand-new titles all the same. Doing so adds a variety I’m often looking for in my gaming experiences. Engaging in new genres, game mechanics and adventures has been eye-opening and I’m looking forward to my next new franchise. /> NinjaSpeed Filed under... #Community#Promoted stories#Resident EvilVic Regalado has won the Republican primary in the Tulsa County Sheriff race.

Malware is an umbrella term that refers to any malicious software such as viruses, worms and spyware that is intentionally designed to cause harm or damage computers, computer systems, devices and networks.
Getty Images
Over the past year, there has been a sharp increase in cyberattacks using malware to target the systems of critical infrastructure such as utility companies, government agencies and organizations that provide services and products that we rely on daily. According to a report from the cybersecurity firm CheckPoint Software, in the first half of this year, there was a 102% increase in these types of attacks compared to 2020.
“In years past, a lot of internet attacks were done for fun, but these days they are all for profit,” said Guofei Gu, professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University. “The most popular, and profitable, type that we see nowadays is ransomware.”
Ransomware is an advanced type of malware that installs itself onto a user’s machine or device undetected, encrypts their data files, rendering them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. But even if the ransom is paid, the decryption process to get the files back to normal is a slow one.
“These groups will put several locks on the data,” said Dilma Da Silva, professor and holder of the Ford Motor Company Design Professorship in the department. “While you may be able to get through them all with the key that they give you, it is going to take the computer a long time to get through them all. And there’s always a possibility they will leave an extra hack behind for themselves or to sell to other cybercriminal groups.”
Cybercrime is a growing business. The FBI reported that in 2020, despite most of the country being focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, they received a record number of complaints about cybercrimes, which cost Americans about $4.2 billion in losses. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that by 2025, that number could grow to $10.5 trillion per year worldwide.
What Is Malware?
Malware is an umbrella term for any malicious software such as viruses, worms and spyware that is intentionally designed to cause harm or damage computers, computer systems, devices and networks. It can get into a system through various methods, including email attachments, infected applications and USB drives, phishing emails, text messages and malicious advertisements.
Recent malware attacks have a couple of new features that set them apart from past attacks. The first is that the malware is a sophisticated software written by highly skilled professionals. It explores a computer’s software vulnerabilities that even the owner of the system has not discovered. The second new feature is that these professional groups have begun targeting more profitable victims.
One of the nation’s most vital infrastructure systems — utilities — are among the most vulnerable to cyberattacks. Many large utility companies run on very old systems and software and have highly constrained resources. The reason why these out-of-date platforms are still in use is because they were created to perform specific tasks and they still work. When a vulnerability is found, updating the system it is not a simple process. In addition, if one element of it is changed, then it can affect other parts of it in unpredictable ways and result in more issues. They are also not able to run additional software alongside it to protect it.
Better Protecting Critical Infrastructure Systems
When it comes down to developing solutions to improve the strength of these systems to protect from future cyberattacks, there is a dilemma. Unlike the computer systems that we use every day, like Windows or Linux, many of these critical infrastructure systems are highly closed to outsiders, including cybersecurity experts.
“On the one side, these organizations want their systems to be secure, but at the same time they are not able to achieve the level of security they need,” Gu said. “They either cannot use existing solutions or they are unwilling to open their systems for experts to assess for possible vulnerabilities.”
While there may be good reasons to keep the details of their systems hidden, it makes collaborating with security experts who want to help difficult. To help improve communications between these organizations and cybersecurity experts, Gu suggests the solution could be designing these systems to be more open.
“A lot of the time, an open design is actually more secure because a lot of experts will be able to analyze it,” he said. “If they are not able to find any problems or break them, it typically means that the system’s security is good. It’s all about finding a good balance between openness and security.”
Cybersecurity Research At Texas A&M
Texas A&M is one of only a handful of colleges and universities in the nation designated as a Center for Academic Excellence in all three National Security Agency focus areas: cyberoperations, cyberdefense and research. Da Silva’s work, which is funded by the National Security Agency, centers around making computer systems more suitable for security work.
“It is essentially about the computational power to be able to process data very quickly,” Da Silva said. “When there is a lot of data coming into a system at a rapid pace, the system needs to be able to consume that data very quickly and run algorithms that run closer to where the data is produced. We’re really refining and specializing the things that Google and Facebook, for instance, use to process a lot of data but for cybersecurity, specifically.”
Gu’s research is focused on achieving defense in depth, which is a security approach that utilizes several layers of defense mechanisms that are thoughtfully placed throughout a computer network to protect the valuable data within it from a variety of threats. In the event that a mechanism fails, then another will immediately step up to stop the attack.
“We’ve done a lot of work in terms of how we can proactively prevent, detect and recover from cyberattacks,” Gu said. “For example, we built a system to detect new vulnerabilities inside a computer system’s software that needs to be fixed before a cybercriminal could get in and explore the system.”
As cybersecurity is virtually its own ecosystem that covers a lot of different aspects of our society, a wide breadth of expertise is needed to cover them all. The Texas A&M Cybersecurity Center is building a team of faculty and students that work on various aspects of security such as in the Internet of Things, cloud computing, blockchain and software.Spiral sand washing machine applies high-end scientific techniques and presents a good development trend. As a professional spiral sand washing machine manufacturer in domestic, Fote Machinery insists on introducing advanced technology and taking in high-tech talents all the way and makes progresses along with constant improvement. Our spiral sand washing machine is applicable to the desliming and cleaning operations of a variety of production processes, such as construction, sandstone aggregates, hydropower construction, artificial ore mining and so on.
The sand and gravel aggregates washed by spiral sand washing machine can greatly enhance the solidification strength and structural intensity of cement. Spiral sand washing machine is generally used to classify aggregated rocks whose granularity are under 70 mm. It is by means of the principle that different-sized solid particles have different specific gravity and different settling velocity in the liquid, to wash and classify materials. In use, when this equipment is to start, the impeller should be unloaded. Besides, we’d better avoid booting the machine loaded and don’t feed until it runs smoothly. Moreover, avoid eddy caused by fixed water-flushing locations.
The output is closely related to the power of electric motor. Therefore, the choice of electric motor for spiral sand washing machine is of particular importance. Since electric motor is the main power of the whole equipment, so we must choose appropriate electric motor according to our own production capacity.Our Free Canadian Visa Eligibility Assessment is designed to determine instantly if you are eligible to apply.Assessment Remaining Relative Visa Requirements To apply for the Remaining Relative visa, applicants must have an extended relative who is either a Canadian citizen or permanent resident living in Canada with no living close family relatives.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor and the Global Institute for Water, Environment and Health (GIWEH) said in a joint oral statement during the 48th session of Human Rights Council (HRC) that the long-term Israeli blockade has caused a serious deterioration of water security in Gaza, making 97% of the water contaminated, while the residents of the besieged enclave are forced to witness the slow poisoning, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Euro-Med Monitor and GIWEH talked in their statement about the severe deterioration in the Gaza Strip’s water security, mainly due to Israel’s prolonged siege, punctuated by periodic military assaults, WAFA noted.
It’s now well established that 97% of Gaza’s water has become contaminated; a situation made substantially worse by an acute electricity crisis that stifles the operation of water wells and sewage treatment plants, leading about 80% of Gaza’s untreated sewage to be discharged into the sea while 20% seeps into underground water, said the joint statement.If you are a person who wants to get rich fast, and you want to learn how to dominate the marketplace online?

The European smart waste sensor market is expected to grow 29.8% annually through 2025. For the rest of the world it’s 36.5%. Smart waste sensors are sufficiently evolved to allow cities to affordably install them and provide better, cheaper waste collection. Imagine having a trash can fairy that tells you when to empty the trash. You don’t have to empty the containers until they are full but you can get there before they overflow. Perfect.
Wireless sensors make this possible. Major vendors include Compology, Big Belly and Enevo and their patent portfolios reflect their commitment. Big Belly leads in patent assets, followed by Enevo and Compology. None of these companies appears to have taken financing recently, so shouldn’t we see some offerings soon? See who else is working to keep our cities clean by subscribing to the Patent Forecast® for Smart Cities: Emergency Services & Waste Management.WIS-TV has hired meteorologist Adam Clark from Duluth, Minn.

Chances are you would think that the idea is crazy. No one’s ever been to the Red Planet because, well, it’s extremely inhospitable to life. But the idea of seeing otherworldly landscapes and being a part of the human’s first step into the unknown would get your kids excited about learning, for sure.
If only there were a way they could do it… You know, without all the risks involved, and have the time of their lives…
Well, a bunch of school kids from Washington D.C. had already taken such a trip. The result was an experience that had the kinds super excited and happy, to say the least.
Wondering how they transformed an ordinary school bus into a Mars shuttle? Then keep reading. We’ll also take a look at three additional examples of super creative applications of virtual reality in education.
1. Virtual Field Trips: A Mars Field Trip
The key to making the Red Planet appear in the windows of an ordinary school bus is, of course, virtual reality. The folks at Lockheed Martin have replaced the bus’ windows with transparent 4K displays and switchable glass film. This way they eliminated the need for VR glasses, and created a group immersive experience.
To ensure that the experience feels as real as possible, they mapped the streets of Washington DC onto the virtual surface of Mars so the bus could go anywhere in the city. Added with the surround sound system playing the sounds of Martian wind inside the bus, the whole ride got as close as possible to being on a real field trip to the Red Planet.
Lockheed Martin’s educational subsidiary, Generation Beyond, was behind the project. Their website is a treasure trove for educators looking to get high school and middle school students excited about space exploration and science. For example, they can download lesson plans, curricula, video challenges, family activities, interactive space flight experience tools, and many other helpful materials for free.
2. Museum Experiences with the Best Guides in the World
If virtual reality allows us to get to places like Mars, touring Earth-based museums is a piece of cake. For example, the technology can help educators to increase engagement in art and history classes by having the students visit some of the world’s best museums without leaving the class.
A company called Boulevard is one of the pioneers in this. Thanks to their virtual reality technology, users can tour famous museums, interact with and learn more about works of art.
On top of that, the experiences are often guided by well-known curators, authors, and artists; it doesn’t get better than that. As a result, teachers can increase student engagement and contribute to their sense of scientific discovery thanks to interactive functionality.
3. Virtual Lab Environment to Conduct STEM Classes
Having a virtual lab to ensure a safe and interactive environment for students to learn STEM subjects is certainly a great tool to possess. With companies like Labster VR, this becomes possible. Labster VR already provides more than 100 types of virtual labs for schools and universities, and the experience is great.
For example, in the Exercise Physiology Simulation, students can participate in a clinical trial to investigate “the acute and chronic physiological effects of high-intensity interval training (SIT) on a sedentary lifestyle.”
“By engaging in virtual lab environments like these, students can practice their skills by performing experiments and tests, all in a risk-free environment,” says Martha Ross, an educational researcher at Supreme Dissertations. “This makes it easier to learn from mistakes and thus develop laboratory skills faster.”
4. Taking a Look Inside a Human Brain to Learn Chemistry
Virtual reality is an excellent tool to learn about inaccessible processes. For example, human chemistry is one of the most interesting areas to study. One example that shows how fun and effective VR can be to learn about humans is inMind2, a game designed to help students learn the chemistry behind human emotion.
Each student participating in the game becomes an active investigator of how a teenager John becomes an adult, and how human chemistry shapes John’s self.
The developers of the game provide the learners with a number of possible life paths and destinies. To determine which one of them John ultimately reaches, they need to control his emotions in specifically designed situations and scenarios. Each decision shapes a specific future of the character as an adult.
VR Takes Learning to a Whole Other Level
Gone are the days when VR technology was perceived as something created solely for games and entertainment. By providing that awesome element of interactivity, virtual reality has become a legitimate innovative tool to improve learning outcomes of students. The examples above are just some of the situations where the technology makes a difference in the classroom.Guest Post

The content she writes is always informative, based on qualitative research, and pleasant to read.In this lick, I’m using the E pentatonic blues scale and the diminished 7th scale or arpeggio.
The notes in the E minor blues scale (or E flat 5 pentatonic) are:
E, G, A, Bb, B, D, (E)
The notes in the diminished 7th arpeggio (or diminished scale) are:
E, G, Bb, C#, (E)
You can see that the only differences here are the omission of the A and the B and the added note C#, which is the major 6th.
These scales cross over very well as the major 6th note, which appears in the diminished 7th scale, is also very commonly used in the pentatonic scale, so tonally there are no surprises here. What is essential though, is the order of the notes.
It's always very important to remember that even though there are huge similarities with these scales, we must understand them individually. This is what creates the tonal difference and gives shape and color to your playing.
What I'm doing in the first part of this lick is accenting the flat 5 rather than using it as a passing note. This creates a very intense sound. It’s a great thing to have in your arsenal if you want to have the ability to get a little darker with the pentatonic scale.
Adding these scales together and creating one super scale is something that should be experimented with, but you should never lose sight of the individual scale. If you wanted to add them together you can view the scale as the E minor pentatonic flat 5 added major 6th.
The lick
I start this lick with an E minor flat 5 arpeggio. One of my favorite shapes, the E minor flat 5 arpeggio flows very nicely under the fingers.
Once I play the arpeggio through I slide up to the 17th fret and play a three-string arpeggio, then move back into the original position and play the five-string arpeggio back to the starting position. This whole process repeats twice.
On the third time through I play the arpeggio once more but then slide to the 12th fret and play a different inversion of the same arpeggio, this time on all six strings.
From there we move into the diminished section. This is where I bring into play my right hand to tap notes. This section is a little tricky, but remember that the diminished 7th scale is linear, so the shapes are always the same. You simply have to move the scale up in minor thirds.
This is one of the beautiful things about incorporating the diminished 7th scale into your playing. Once you nail the shapes in one position you basically have the whole fretboard covered as the patterns always repeat in minor thirds!

Owning a car is one of those necessary large expenses that we just can’t avoid. On top of that, finding inexpensive car insurance, especially if you are a driver over the age of 50 can make your monthly budget even tighter.
You don’t have to take the rate hikes that come with getting older without a fight. There are ways to lower your auto insurance bill beyond a standard senior discount for those over the age of 65. Using a safe driving app which tracks your driving behavior, driving a car with advanced safety features and even taking defensive driving classes can all contribute to a lower bill and more money in your pocket at the end of the month.
Best Choices for Older Drivers
State Farm Auto Insurance frequently delivers very low rates for drivers 50 and up. California residents may be able to take advantage of their discount for mature drivers. If you are over the age of 55 and take a defensive driving course you are eligible to receive on average around $90 off your yearly auto insurance premiums through State Farm. Using the drive tracking app will get you the biggest discounts. The amount varies but you can save up to 50 percent on premiums just for driving safely and using their tracking app.
Another auto insurance provider that offers discounts if you take a defensive driving course is the Hartford AARP Program. This auto insurance company is designed for drivers over 50, offering competitive rates. You can save up to 3 percent on annual premiums just for completing the driving course. Another great advantage of the HArtford AARP Program is they won’t drop you from your policy due to your age like some providers will. Allstate is a senior friendly car insurance company that has many discounts available to drivers over the age of 50. If you are retired, semi-retired and over the age of 55 you can qualify for the Allstate senior discount.If you are comfortable with technology you might want to check out their drive tracking app. If you use the tracker and have no accidents for 6 months you can receive a discount. A defensive driving course will also lower your premiums with Allstate.
Amica is not as well known as some of the other big name auto insurance companies, but they are a credible company with affordable rates. They make it easy to save on your insurance with a defensive driving course. In fact, you can sign up for this online course through their website at a discounted price.
USAA has a full suite of financial products and services for those that have served in the military and their families. If you are a veteran, you can’t go wrong with the extremely low rates of USAA auto insurance. If you take advantage of their other insurance options and banking, you can easily manage all of your financial concerns in one place, plus receive discounts for bundling insurance.
Progressive doesn’t offer a direct senior discount however there are other ways to save if you are a driver over 50. Progressive offers discounts to AARP members and also other discounts for those that own a home or take a defensive driving course.
Geico is one of the leading car insurance companies in the nation. If you are a driver over the age of 50 you can still save some money with some of Geico’s available discounts. They offer discounts to retired government workers as well as retired military service men and women. Additional discounts can be yours if you pass a defensive driving course.You are in luck!

June 28, 2020 0 Comments
Playing in Online Casinos can be either a generally excellent encounter or a poor encounter; contingent upon how much cash you pick up or lose. The achievement of your online casino attempt relies upon your betting capacities. The facts confirm that betting is generally founded on possibility; however there are numerous things one can do so as to amplify the opportunity for progress. Following these couple of tips can assist you with improving as a speculator.
- Set cutoff points and screen your cash. An enormous piece of betting is cash the board. In the event that you set cutoff points for yourself, you can abstain from losing a lot of cash. Additionally in the event that you set a breaking point, you will turn out to be increasingly moderate in play as your cash moves toward the cutoff. Preservationist play can frequently prompt increases.
- Watch how different players wager and base a portion of your wagers off of theirs. A few players wager moderately on the off chance that they have a horrible hand. Utilize that for your potential benefit and raise your wager. You can likewise see a player with a temperamental hand and conceivably utilize your wager to drive that player to crease. In the event that you yourself have a decent hand bit by bit expanding your wager is an extraordinary method to attract more players and increment your anticipated rewards.

- Online casinos would not let you know, however in case you are a superior player, it can here and there be prudent to go into a lower aptitude level game. The wagers are lower, however you are drawn out rewards can be more noteworthy. Moreover, an incredible method to build rewards is to partition your aptitudes among a lower level game and a more significant level game. Betting in a lower-expertise room can be a security net while you bet with more cash in the higher ability games. When you become gifted enough, even the significant level games will yield incredible accomplishment for you.
- Realize when to quit playing. Lamentably, a few players begin losing and simply continue แจกสูตรบาคาร่า betting. This prompts quick difficulty.

Casinos for the most part love players experiencing wear out in light of the fact that those players will be not so much alarm but rather more prone to go through more cash. In the event that you are drained and remain in with hands that are not exactly great, you are most likely experiencing wear out.Your browser's Javascript functionality is turned off.

Listed by: Jordan Real Estate | Added on: November 17, 2021View More Information? It’s all about the prep work, doing your due diligence. The first moves lay the foundation for all your future efforts; efforts that directly affect your time and bottom line.
Prep work isn’t always fun. It isn’t sexy. But it’s necessary. Attitudes and aptitudes change, markets evolve, customers come and go, ideas grow. Use these steps to establish your fundamental message so you stay true to what you’re marketing, why you’re choosing a particular channel, and who is consuming your material.
Whether you’re a micropreneur for a budding enterprise or marketing director for an established brand, if you have marketing ideas swirling in your brain this is your starting point.
First: Differentiate between a plan and a tool. A Facebook page is not a plan. Neither is a Twitter stream, smartphone app, QR code, newsletter, Pinterest page, blog, Slideshare account, LinkedIn profile or even a website. These are all tools.
Action: If you find yourself getting wooed by a sexy new tool remind yourself that a plan is a system for achieving an objective. Put your love for a new tool on the back burner and refocus on planning. That brings us to…
Second: Define your core competencies and features. What does your company do really well? What features do you offer?
Action: Make a list. Grab a pen and a piece of paper and write them down. This shouldn’t be too difficult. Stay focused on your company’s talents and services. Try and list your offerings in order of importance.
Third: Establish your differentiation. What exactly does your company do that sets you apart from your competition? Is it your pricing? Experience? Service package? Depth of knowledge? In market-speak this is known as your Unique Selling Proposition (USP) or Unique Value Proposition (UVP).
Action: Grab another piece of paper and write down your USP. It’s important that you don’t skip the writing portion of this exercise. The act of writing forces you to articulate your thoughts.
Fourth: Consider the audience. Who is your target prospect and ideal customer? What are their questions, concerns and pain points? What obstacles must they overcome before engaging in your services or buying your product?
Action: Make two categories for your thoughts here. The first should list your customers’ or prospects’ overall pain points and concerns. The second highlights obstacles they must overcome before they feel comfortable making contact with your or becoming your customer.
Fifth: Consider your audience again but this time at a more personal level. Where do they get their information? How do they spend their time? Are they interacting with your company in a professional capacity, leisure, health or other?
Action: Yep, write the answers down (last time…promise).
Sixth: Now it’s time to put this information together and identify where your company and your clients overlap.
Action: How do your products and services help ease the pain points for your customers? What is it about your core competencies that customers and prospects should know and why would they care? Where are they most likely to pay attention to your message and brand? Gather up your sheets of paper and put them in a binder for easy reference.
There you have it, the most fundamental moves giving you the core pieces of quality content. As you consider the various channels and tools for your marketing plan compare them to your notes. Every delivery method that you choose and piece of content that you publish should reflect what you have identified.
Final words: resist impulses to jump at a moment’s notice. Doing your homework will let your content marketing efforts slowly but surely grow bigger and better.

Research continues to support that dry needling reduces muscle tension, improves pain control, normalizes biochemical and electrical dysfunction, and facilitates a faster return to active rehabilitation. Dry needling works on patients that have trigger points.
Both use the same type of needle and often appear very similar. The main difference is that the objectives and philosophy behind dry needling are not based on an ancient theory or Chinese medicine. Dry needling is based on western neuroanatomy and modern scientific study of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems.
We encourage you to call Toepperwein Physical Therapy today to set up an appointment with a licensed therapist to see if Dry Needling is an option that may help you.
A trigger point is a hyper-irritable point or localized area in the skeletal muscle that is associated with a hypersensitive nodule. These tender areas are caused by elevated states of muscle activity. These areas radiate in predictable patterns and can become painful at the site. After prolonged periods of time, a taut band can develop that will not relax on its own. The trigger points are called “active” when they cause pain without provocation, and they are called “latent” when they elicit pain when manipulated by the therapist.

You can sue the registered owner of the vehicle that hit you for negligence. You may be able to file your lawsuit in small claims court depending on your state's limit for small claims court cases.

blaughlin@summitdaily.com
SUMMIT COUNTY — Caves closed to the public for three years are being reopened on national forest land, despite continuing fear of the spread of a bat epidemic.
The public is now allowed to enter caves in the White River National Forest, and throughout the Rocky Mountain region, the U.S. Forest Service announced Thursday.
An emergency closure was put in place in July 2010, denying access to caves in an effort to protect bat populations from a mysterious fungus that’s wiped out more than 5.5 million of the winged mammals since its discovery in 2006.
White-nose syndrome is killing bats in record numbers in what’s been described as a wildlife health crisis. The syndrome has devastated entire populations of bats, and has spread throughout the northeastern United States and Canada.
The bats are infected with a fungus that thrives in cold, humid conditions while they hibernate, biologists report. The fungus does serious harm to their bodies while their immune systems are most vulnerable, growing on them and digesting their organs and tissue.
“It wears them down, eats away at their skin and dehydrates them,” said Rob Mies, executive director of the Organization for Bat Conservation.
Eighteen species of bats are known to reside in Colorado. However, white-nose syndrome has not been confirmed in the state or the U.S. Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Region — but it has been detected as far west as Oklahoma.
White-nose syndrome is spread primarily through bat-to-bat interactions. However, researchers said the fungus that causes the syndrome can survive outside of caves and can hitchhike on clothing and equipment. The spores have the potential to be transferred to uncontaminated caves and then to bats, said Richard L. Truex, a regional wildlife ecologist with the forest service.
requirements for cavers
Spelunkers will be required to register before visiting caves in the Rocky Mountain Region, which includes Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota and Kansas. Cavers will need to carry their registration form when visiting caves and decontaminate their clothing and gear before and after entry.
The new regulations are receiving mixed reviews from the caving and scientific communities.
“I think there are some cases where caves can be opened up for recreation, but I think it needs to be strictly monitored,” Mies said. “The majority of bat caves need to remain closed because of the potential to spread the fungus and because of the agitation caused by humans.”
Rick Adams, a professor in the school of biological sciences at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, calls the decision to allow public access to the caves an invitation for fungus to invade cave ecosystems and wipe out populations of bats in the region.
“It makes no sense to open caves now and invite the fungus in via transport on human clothing or gear,” he said in a written statement to the Summit Daily. “Why the Rocky Mountain Region USDA has chosen to value recreational opportunities over ecosystem health, especially considering the devastating and uncontrollable impacts of this pathogen once it enters a region, is a question only they could possibly answer.”
But forest service wildlife ecologist Truex said “blanket closures,” such as the restriction put in place in 2010, have the potential to misdirect conservation efforts.
He said by focusing on high-priority sites, the forest service can collaborate with the caving community to better understand and monitor bats and other cave resources.
“That’s why as a wildlife ecologist I am comfortable with this,” he said. “It allows us to focus on sites that are important to bats while allowing appropriate access in the face of the disease.”
The forest service’s approach is to prohibit the use of caving gear that has been used in U.S. states and Canadian provinces where white-nose syndrome has been confirmed and to require decontamination of equipment when entering caves. These actions will greatly reduce the chances the fungus will be inadvertently transmitted to caves in the Rocky Mountain Region, Truex said. In addition, all caves used as hibernation sites will be closed during the winter to minimize disturbance to bats, he said.
Derek Bristol, chair of the Colorado Cave Survey, said the White River National Forest is the most active area for caving in Colorado on forest service land.
Last year, the forest service made an exception for National Speleological Society members to enter some of the caves on federal property, he said. That includes a cooperative agreement with the agency on cave-management issues, including reports on bat observations, vandalism and other impacts to the caves. The Colorado Cave Survey and similar groups educate members about not only cave safety but also conservation. Because of that, members take care to avoid negative impacts on bats, Bristol said.
“Pretty much anybody who considers themselves part of the caving community cares deeply about conserving caves, and bats are a big part of that,” he said. “I think it’s important to do what we can to prevent the spread of white-nose syndrome. It’s such a serious disease it’s important we follow decontamination protocols and minimize our impact on bats.”
He said he hopes the public will take as much care as avid cavers to minimize impacts on bats, and to follow the rules outlined by the forest service.
The importance of bats
National bat expert Mies said the health of both the environment and the economy depend on a diversity of bats.
Bats are the primary predator of nighttime insects, and they eat tons of agricultural pests. They can eat up to 2,000 insects in one night, Mies said.
In a matter of only two years white-nose syndrome spread from New York to nine other states. If it spreads across the entire U.S., there would be tremendous impacts on the environment and the economy, with farmers increasing their use of pesticides and crop prices going up because of the added measures taken to control pests, Mies said.: GigaOM, Ars Technica, paidContent, The Business Insider, TechCrunch, 9to5Mac, Daring Fireball, Gizmodo and TiPb

Introduction</b>
Beginning in the late 1870s, and through 1925, a succession of people tried to transform the river and the desert embracing it.
First used as open range for cattle grazing, the Pecos Valley became the scene of ever more ambitious plans to establish an agricultural mecca based on irrigation and funded by wealthy investors from Chicago, New York, Colorado Springs, and Europe. Following a natural disaster and financialdownturns in 1893, settlers and investors fled the valley, making its future uncertain. A series of financial reorganizations to attract much-needed cap-ital brought a major railroad to the valley, but the heyday of corporate irri-gation was over.
Under pressure from President Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. Reclamation Service, although reluctant to rehabilitate the valley's irriga-tion system, agreed to take on the project.
Herculean efforts to create an oasis in the middle of the desert ran counter to the natural environment of southeastern New Mexico, and in the end nature subdued technology despite local and national political maneuverings and convoluted investment strategies to secure water in the Chihuahuan Desert.
it was a place to cross on the way to somewhere else.
A few adventurous Mexican Americans from the Manzano Mountains near Albuquerque ventured farther east of the Rio Grande in the mid-1800s. In the valleys, they established self-sufficient communities where they found water and practiced a mixed planting-grazing economy.
Ranching dominated the area, not farming
nomadic Indians delayed Anglo incursions into the region
cattlemen and land speculators took advantage of the various laws created by Congress for disposing of the public lands.

1878 John Wesley Powell's report on arid lands was released. recommended classifying western land based on its irrigation potential. ^2, remove from sale irrigable lands, met with resistance, investors could lose millions, Powell's survey idea threatened to disrupt the image of turning the desert into a corporate garden,
mil-lionaires, engineers, reclamationists, government bureaucrats, cigar manu-facturers, steel magnates, and mining and railroad capitalists invested vision, time, and money in the valley.
Primary investor James J. Hagerman, a close friend of politico Marcus Hanna
Other investors included William Bonbright, co-owner of Hood, Bon-bright, and Company, the precursor of Wanamaker's Department Stores; New Yorker Amos Bissell; Frederic Stevens, a member of the board of directors of Chemical Bank of New York, and his son, Joseph Sampson Stevens, a descendant of Albert Gallatin; and Richard Bolles, who made a fortune from investments in the famous Mollie Gibson Mine. Charles Otis of Otis Steelworks; Arthur and Eli Mermod, heirs to the internationally known Mermod-Jaccard jewelry business; and Robert Weems Tansill, who manufactured Punch cigars, were all tied to the Pecos Valley irrigation
Others like Jay Gould, George Pullman, Benjamin Cheney, Harriman and Company, Charles Head, and William McMillan, among other industrial and economic leaders, played a role
These prominent individuals and their efforts paralleled those of cattle thieves, land swindlers, Swiss and Italian immigrants, settlers looking for a better life, Mexican laborers, saloon keepers, prostitutes, lawyers, and lawmen who changed the face of the Pecos Valley.
Walter Prescott Webb maintained that settlers failed to subdue the frontier until the last decades of the nineteenth century, when technology shifted the balance. ^4
In the Pecos Valley, control was vested in those who either had capital of their own or could raise it.
This capital, combined with manipulation of federal land laws, placed an appreciable amount of property with corporate investment companies.
following a natural disaster and financial downturns in 1893, settlers and investors fled the valley
William Smythe, foremost promoter of the irrigation move-ment at the turn of the century, advocated irrigation as a form of coopera-tive capitalism utilizing the natural laws of God to compel the arid lands to produce.
1902 Newlands Act, under which the federal government developed water projects and by extension established a federal presence across the West. ^6
struggles between water proponents and environmentalists [what framing, water proponents... implying the environmentalists are against water. Reminds me of pro-life/abortion (pro-death?) framing.]
After World War II, according to Worster, capitalism and technological expertise produced federally centralized, authoritarian control over local water resources. Worster argues that the federal government worked in concert with powerful economic elites to create a "hydraulic empire" in the West. ^9
Rivers of Empire by Donald Worster
Unlike Worster, Donald J. Pisani sees the emergence of water associa-tions and other quasi-governmental structures as a natural consequence of trial and error. To Pisani, the West established whatever worked best, based on the collective experience of a locality or region, without the assistance or persuasion of some cabal bent on centralizing power. ^10

DeBuys sees the floods as pivotal moments in the region's history, when a succession of schemers, agriculturalists, and others tried to take advantage of the government's noblesse oblige. ^11
Pecos River floods of 1893and 1904 practically ended all hope of private capital-supported irri-gation in southeastern New Mexico. [floods destroyed dams and works]
nationwide economic downturn of 1893
Llano Estacado, the 50,000-square-mile island in the sky that dominates West Texas and eastern New Mexico just east of the Pecos Valley.
differing opinions between federal experts and water users on how best to use the Pecos led to an often uneasy relationship
Reclamation engineers often became dam builders
The choice of the types of dams built across the West was not entirely based on engineering practicality, as Donald Jackson has shown in the experiences of John Eastwood. ^15 Rather, power struggles often deter-mined what kind of dam was built.
beyond dam building, Reclamation often had no clear sense of where it was headed.
Reclamationists Frederick Newell, A. P. Davis, and others did not show a great interest in social reform. ^16
Lingering corporate interests firmly grafted themselves onto the administrative and political framework established by Reclamation vis-à-vis the local water users asso-ciation. Reclamation was often caught between providing water for small resident landowners and for speculative and absentee holdovers from the previous century.
The once formidable Pecos River of New Mexico and Texas is today a mere shadow of its former self. Dammed in many places for irrigation, its springs pumped dry in others, the Pecos River of today leads a precarious existence. Careful observers recognized the fate of the river prior to the 1920s.
In 1925, a committee of water experts from Texas and New Mexico arrived at a compact to apportion the river's water supply. The plan lingered until a new one was adopted in 1948. The Pecos River Compact between New Mexico and Texas did not end the con-test over water
Chapter 01: Visions of an Irrigation Empire <ul> <P>nineteenth-century American mindset of subduing nature and making money at the same time, cat-tleman Charles Eddy and lawman Pat Garrett set in motion the concept of transforming a cattle country into an agricultural mecca based on irrigation. <P>Pecos River of the nineteenth century, unlike its faint twentieth-century shadow, was a formidable watercourse. <P>The river stretches for some 755 miles, from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains just northeast of Santa Fe to its eventual merger with the Rio Grande near present-day Lake Amistad in Texas. The stream flows in an east-southeast direction from its source 13,000 feet above sea level, where numerous streams and heavy snows con-tribute to its volume. <P>Pecos flows past the New Mexico communities of Roswell, Dexter, Green-field, Hagerman, Lake Arthur, Artesia, Atoka, Lakewood, and finally Carlsbad before veering southeast toward the Texas <P>alpine forests and meadows along its upper reaches to scrubland from Fort Sumner to near Carlsbad <P>Canyon-like walls disappear and turn into low rolling hills and then to prairie. South of Roswell is a country of limestone and gypsum, marking what is now considered premium agricultural land. The topography changes again as the river nears Texas to reflect the flora and fauna of the Chihuahuan Desert. ^2 <P>Mexican War in 1846 <P>After the Mexican War, the United States sent explorers to the American Southwest to study the land gained from Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848). <P>report submitted by the lieutenant one year later included both Simpson's largely topographical information and Marcy's journal entries describing the flora, fauna, and water of southeastern New Mexico. ^10 <P>Marcy asked, "Is it not within the scope of probabilities that these springs may be found to possess valuable medicinal properties, and that this place may yet...become a place of fashionable resort for the 'upper-ten-thousand' of New Mexico?" ^12 <P>Marcy noted on September 15, 1849 that the soil was extremely poor, covered with "decomposed gypsum," but that the land was covered with luxuriant grama grass, offering excellent forage for animals. ^13 <P>By the mid-1850s.Mexican Americans had settled into the Hondo Valley from the Manzano Mountains near Albuquerque. The first settle-ment in the region began near Fort Stanton on the Rio Bonito. Called La Placita, the settlement attracted Anglos as well. The town, now called Lin-coln, became the seat of Lincoln County in 1869. By then, some thirty to forty Mexican families had moved to the Hondo Valley, fifteen miles south-west of Roswell. [Missouri Plaza] <P>Mexican settlers brought with them their Spanish-based community and agricultural, land, and water-distribution systems. , ditches (acequias), even if the ditches crossed another's property <P>Anglos moving into the Hondo Valley did not accept Spanish community traditions as a means of agricultural production. And, along the lower stretches of New Mexico's Pecos Valley tributaries, no Spanish land grants interrupted Anglo settlement. Anglo settlers began appropriating the water, and in the 1870s the citizens of Missouri Plaza moved away because of Indian problems, racial conflict, and upstream irri-gation. ^15 <P>Since the American occupation of New Mexico during the Mexican War, New Mexico had suffered from cul-tural conflicts among Anglos, Mexican Americans, Comanches, Apaches, Utes, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Kiowas, and Navajos. ^16 <P>Keleher attributed the "color and adventure" of Lincoln County in the 1870s and 80s to cow-boys, camp followers, saloon keepers, gamblers, gunfighters, and horse thieves-most of whom came from Texas. ^17 <P>first major Anglo settlement in what would become Eddy County was Seven Rivers, a village of "dozens of hard-core drifters, drovers, gunmen and fugitives....[G]unfire was frequent [and] it is said that the first four persons buried in the cemetery died of gunshot wounds." <P>settlements relied on the federal government for law enforcement, which was stretched over an area larger than Massachu-setts. ^18 <P>largest influx of Anglos into the area followed on the heels of the military presence at Bosque Redondo following the 1863 campaign against the Mescalero Apache. The U.S. military established a Pecos River post called Fort Sumner ^19 <P>The fort was laid out next to Bosque Redondo, a round grove of cottonwoods on the river and a favorite camping site of the Apaches. The Mescalero had the choice of moving to a reserve established near the fort, or being further hounded by U.S. soldiers. The Apache, who were organized into small semi-autonomous bands, trickled into the region one group at a time. By March 1863 the military, having established contracts with local cattlemen and Texans like Charles Good-night, was feeding over four hundred men, women, and children at the fort. Although some one hundred Mescalero fled west to join their Gila cousins, by the summer of 1863 the Apaches at Bosque Redondo settled into laying out fields, planting crops, and setting up shelters. ^20 <P>American military, using questionable logic, embarked on a series of campaigns to place other Indians of New Mexico and the Southwest on reservations. The military began settling some nine thousand Navajos on the lands at Bosque Redondo-lands that by then the Mescalero considered their own. <P>"long walk"-was carried out by Kit Carson, who had previously joined in rounding up the Mescalero. Carson thought the Indian policy foolish, but followed orders. ^21 <P>for the Indians and military alike, the irrigation ven-ture was a dismal failure. Worms, blight, hail, floods, drought <P>Texas cattlemen saw the grazing potential of lands in the Pecos Valley <P>trailed cattle along the Pecos River beginning in the 1860s <P>military removal of the Indians from eastern New Mexico opened the land to Anglo settlement. <P>Like most Anglos, he [John Chisum] regarded the land as public domain and open to use by those who got there and controlled it first. ^27 [he controlled 3-4 new england states worht or land] <P>Lincoln County War in the late 1870s devel-oped partially out of competition over grazing lands and water sources in the region. ^28 Whoever controlled the water controlled the land. <P>In the early 1880s, buyers from the midwestern Corn Belt came in the spring and contracted for fall delivery, by rail, of steers and yearlings. ^52 By 1890 the Eddys shipped cattle by the trainload to markets connected by new rail lines <P>In the 1880s a great deal of money was generated through fattening cattle on free grass. Many people jumped into the cattle business with little knowledge or experience, hiring cowboys to do the work for twenty-five to thirty dollars a month. ^58 <P>L. Wallace Holt, representing the Holt Cattle Com-pany, bought out cattleman Thomas Gardner and ran cattle near a big spring at the head of North Seven Rivers. Until the ranch was deserted because of later artesian pumping that dried up the spring, the Holt Ranch was a showplace for the entire valley. ^63 <P>By 1884 , the valley was heavily overstocked. <P>During the "Big Die" of 1886, over a third of the cattle in the Seven Rivers area perished when drought dried up the springs and winter cold killed the weakened cattle. <P>The disaster, which bankrupted many small ranchers, encouraged Eddy to look for a perpetual water supply. ^67 In 1886 he began expanding the Halagüeño Ditch, a diversion from the east side of the Pecos, building south to irrigate his ranch holdings in La Huerta. ^68 <P>Despite the disaster of 1886 and the limited access to surface water, by the end of the decade almost all inhabitants of Lincoln County depended on ranching to make a living. ^72 <P>On August 15, [1886 or 7], Garrett and Holloman formed the Holloman and Garrett Ditch Company, with capital stock of $5,000 and fifty shares at $100 each. When the corporation dissolved, Garrett bought interest in the Pioneer Ditch Company. ^78 <P>Garrett wanted to build a dam across the Hondo River, the chief tribu-tary of the Pecos. By building a flume, Garrett reckoned he could send water across the desert to areas previously thought worthless for farming. ^79 <P>In 1886, Garrett approached rancher Charles Eddy with his vision of irrigating the Pecos Valley, introducing him to Charles Greene at Eddy's ranch headquarters. ^82 The meeting between Garrett and Eddy heralded the beginnings of corporate irrigation in the valley. <P>Garrett and Eddy set up their first company, Pecos Valley Land and Ditch, in 1887. ^84 Garrett and Eddy hoped to make money by selling land in the new town of Eddy, which they laid out in 1888, and charging an annual rental fee for water. ^85 <P>by 1891 entrepreneurs had established eighty-eight companies and had built ditches to water 40 percent of the irrigable land in New Mexico. ^90 <P>[loads of rich folks played/rested in CO Springs, tuberculosis/consumption, ranching, irrigation deals, real estate, railroads, mines in NM] <P>legal wrangling and an anonymous forty-four page pamphlet supporting Hagerman revealed the manipulation behind capital investment schemes of the nineteenth century. ^143 <P>Relatively untouched by a succession of Native Americans, Spaniards, and Mexican Americans, the Pecos Valley changed beginning with the U.S. military presence in the 1860s, allowing John Chisum and other cattlemen to monopolize the scant water holes and vast cattle range on either side of the Pecos. Cattlemen Charles Eddy and promoter Charles Greene took Pat Garrett's concept of irrigating the valley, expanded it, and recruited much-needed capital. After gaining initial seed money from New Yorker Joseph Stevens, Eddy and Greene turned to Chicago and Colorado Springs, a play-ground mecca for some of the nation's industrial and political elite. James Hagerman, a millionaire made rich from iron ore in northern Michigan, used his ties to the steel, railroad, and mining industries to attract more capital for irrigating the New Mexico desert. As Eddy began to pour invest-ment capital into dams and canals, the tools providing the impetus for cor-porate irrigation of the valley were the nation's flexible land laws-espe-cially the Desert Land Act of 1877.
Chapter 02: Creosote and Sagebrush
Federal investigations revealed wide-spread abuse in the 1880s. Investigators in New Mexico indicated that such abuse was condoned by politicians and land officers alike. [Desert Land Act]
Preemption Act of 1841, which allowed those living on unsurveyed land to purchase up to 160 acres of land at $1.25 per acre prior to government survey without bidding on it. Lawmakers designed the law to help settlers save their land from speculators. ^2
1862 Congress passed the Homestead Act to allow Americans to scatter throughout the West and help "develop the nation's resources and character." Settlers could get 160 acres of land free of charge, except for filing fees of ten cents per acre, but had to build a home and live on the land.
Claims could be commuted and title finalized after eighteen months by paying $1.25 an acre.
During the 1860s, the Office of Surveyor General attempted surveys in New Mexico, but Indian hostilities and lack of military protection limited work along the Pecos River.
[By 1870s] Indian attacks had largely ceased, and the office expanded to new areas, including the Pecos Valley. ^5
President Ulysses Grant, March 3, 1877, Congress passed the Desert Land Act-designed for California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, Dakota, and New Mexico. Set-tlers on "desert" lands could get one section (640 acres) for twenty-five cents per acre down and one dollar per acre on final proof of compliance.
govern-ment gave no rights to the land until the applicant proved up the property by irrigating.
95 percent of all claims were fraudulent and were made for the ben-efit of land speculators. ^6
All told, a crafty land seeker might accumulate 1120 acres of land by using the Preemption, Homestead, Desert Land, Timber and Stone, and Timber Culture Acts in combination.
In the Pecos Valley, the vast majority of lands were taken under the Desert Land Act, some 100,000 acres in all. ^10
The only practical place to homestead in southeastern New Mexico was along the Pecos. That reality, combined with well-financed cattle companies, meant big business controlled much of the land. ^13
The domination of big cattle operators was in keeping with the spirit of the Gilded Age and concentration of wealth. During the 1870s and 1880s, there was general acceptance in the public mind of the notion of a man quickly enriching himself, even at the cost of his neighbors. ^14
By the mid-1870s, when Henry M. Atkinson of Nebraska took over the Office of Sur-veyor General of New Mexico, surveyors had almost completed their work. By and large, Atkinson's tenure in office was dominated by cattlemen's 45 creosote and sagebrush demands for land and for his falsifying surveys to include nonarable land so cattlemen could claim it. ^15
The 1880s saw cattle as king, at least until the middle part of the decade. ^16
Papers, periodicals, and livestock journals pointed out the large profits to be made in the cattle business. Some estimated that an investment of $5000 could net the investor a profit of $40000 or $50000 within four years. Within that four years, a calf worth five dollars could be fed at very little cost on the public domain and then sold for forty or fifty dollars. Such rhetoric caused the cattle business to take off. ^17
in 1885 all of southeastern New Mexico was devoted exclusively to cattle ranching. ^18
A Senate investigation discovered vast holdings in well-financed land and cattle companies. ^20
The Homestead, Preemption, and Desert Land Acts and assorted other laws allowed speculators to "emasculate" the intent of the democratic laws through fraudulent land accumulation, leading to monopolization and tenancy. ^21
In 1883, special agent H. H. Eddy (no relation to Charles Eddy) investigated some two hun-dred homestead claims in New Mexico, and found that only 32 percent complied with homestead regulations. Eddy was paid extra for the danger surrounding his investigations in the Pecos Valley in 1884, where he found that most homestead claims were false. Only one in fourteen proved legiti-mate. Eddy showed Henry Atkinson's involvement in fraud and connected him with two murders of entrymen on preempted land. ^24
One of the recur-ring problems, according to investigators at the time, was that native New Mexicans were unreliable witnesses who would swear to anything-and Mexican American juries seldom returned a guilty verdict even though the evidence was conclusive. The government viewed natives as people igno-rant of the law who could be deceived into signing virtually anything. Many times investigators discovered native New Mexicans who had settled on a piece of land they thought they had filed on, only to find out that, deceived by unscrupulous land speculators, they had filed on some other piece of land that was worthless. Their home in the meantime was filed on by a person representing the party who had given the New Mexicans the false descriptions in the first place. Consequently, many native settlers did not get the valuable land they wanted but rather worthless acreage. If locals complained about the situation, they were told by officials that they had committed perjury by entering on land that they had never lived on. They were warned that the consequences of speaking out would be arrest and prosecution. ^26 Investigations into land fraud across the West revealed widespread deception and prompted others to accuse New Mexico political groups of collusion.
Most agreed that the choicest lands in these areas had been controlled and then attained though questionable legal practices by powerful groups of cattlemen in the regions to keep out small-time settlers. ^27
Surveyor General of New Mexico George W. Julian, "To rob a nation of its public domain and steal the opportunity of landless men to gain homes was not only a crime against society, but a mockery of the poor." ^32
Julian added: "[T]he grinding oligarchy of land sharks, whose operations have so long been the blight and paralysis of the Territory, should be com-pletely routed and overthrown." ^34
Reflecting the views of small ranching interests, theGolden Era said: "The appointment of Mr. Shields as registrar of the U.S. Land Office is received with satisfaction by the small rancheros [ranchers] in this locality, and they think they will now receive that justice which they say has been so long denied....If Mr. Shields will demonstrate that he intends to be the servant of the people, and not the cringing, obsequious tool of a hybrid land grabbing gang, all good citizens will rally to his support." ^37
The territorial governor of New Mexico, Edmund Ribson Ross, in 1885 commented: "There's a general belief that considerable areas of good agri-cultural land have been illegitimately entered and included in great cattle ranches." ^38 The governor went on to say that he believed that large quanti-ties of public lands had been added using the preemption laws through "the boldest perjury, forgery, and false pretense, and that in at least some instances this has been done, if not with the connivance, at least through the inadvertence and carelessness of officials." The governor also noted that in many cases land had been absorbed into great cattle ranches merely for the purpose of gaining control of water supplies, keeping out settlers and their small herds, and some ranchers accumulated lands for purely speculative purposes. ^39
Cattlemen, beginning in the mid-1880s, by incorporating ditch compa-nies and appropriating available water, could keep settlers from using it. Consequently, they kept competitors off even the public land. This had the effect of making land that others wished to enter valueless un-less they were supplied with water from irrigation companies created by cattlemen. ^40
Mexican Americans had not been allowed to live in these areas peacefully, that many of them had been killed or wounded without provocation, and some had been driven from their homes by intimidation and threats. ^45
Denman and government investi-gating agencies accused Eddy of acquiring lands from settlers through coercion.
Upson claimed that Denman and his followers were "a class of people in our midst that were led by men of unprincipled character who persistently incited their followers to deeds of vice and crime; that newcomers, ignorant of our laws were induced by these leaders to enter upon and occupy lands, legally held and occupied by bona-fide actual settlers; that many of these immigrants are outlaws from Texas and fugitives from justice, who eagerly attach themselves to these leaders for purposes of plunder, blackmail, and kindred crimes." ^46 He gave numerous examples whereby he claimed Denman and his band threatened and intimidated Mexican Americans along the Pecos River, and he contended that Denman often had Mexican Americans arrested simply for the sake of obtaining their land. Upson fur-ther claimed that after Denman had them arrested on frivolous charges, on their release his thugs drove them from their homes, forcing them to leave behind all their worldly possessions to be plundered or destroyed. ^47
Denman organized a petition to the General Land Office in Washington, D.C., charging the officers at Las Cruces with fraud and blasting some of the most powerful and substantial citizens of the region.
Upson minced no words in condemning Denman as a "communist of the most dangerous type, and a common barrater in the most offensive sense of the term;...nine-tenths of the litigation and quarrels in this precinct are acknowledged to be incited by him, and that he bears the rep-utation, where he is best known, of being a liar, a thief, and a perjurer." ^48
Charles H. Slaughter, also a large cat-tleman from Seven Rivers, praised Eddy's reputation to the fullest and denounced Denman as a blackmailer who circulated malicious slander
Following the Golden Era's publication of Upson and Slaughter's affi-davits, thirty citizens, most cattle raisers themselves, signed a deposition describing Denman as a "depraved and reckless man, of evil reputation, and charged with many crimes; that no faith or credence can be placed in what he says, nor the statements of his followers and tools who do his bid-ding." ^51
Eddy County deed records from 1887 and 1889 attest to Anglos obtaining land from persons with Spanish surnames. Many wereilliterate and could not sign their own names, and transferred owner-ship of the land for less than one dollar per acre. ^52
Officials, including local federal land commissioner Shields, publicly regarded Desert Land entries as a source of "a great deal of crookedness," but that did not stop Shields from working closely with Charles Eddy in securing lands for the developer's irrigation scheme. ^54
"Big Die" in 1886
From 1888 to 1891, eighty-eight irrigation companies were incorporated in New Mexico. At least 40 percent of the land brought under irrigation during the next decade was irrigated by these companies.
Compa-nies such as Pecos Irrigation and Investment acquired much of their land from individuals who had filed Desert Land entries and then sold the land for next to nothing to company officials. ^57
Pecos Irrigation and Investment in 1888 and 1889, and Pecos Irriga-tion and Improvement Company thereafter
deeded their properties to the company in return for a small fee or a free trip to the desert Southwest. ^58
Tarr noted that landholders in many instances obtained their property through bribery of government officials, notary publics, and witnesses. At the time of his report, many of the leading citizens of Lincoln County were under indictment by a grand jury for fraudulent land entry.
Pecos Irrigation and Improvement Company. He noted that before the company declared the line of its ditch, it gave information concerning that ditch to friends and relatives.
many others, filed Desert Land entries only to deed them to the company.
The same thing happened near Roswell
Ironically, in 1889, Tarr found that there was a popular sentiment in the Pecos Valley for repeal of the Desert Land and Preemption Acts. He soon discovered that those who objected most strongly to the laws were people who had no money to take advantage of them. A second group, those who actually had the wherewithal to buy land, enthusiastically supported ending the laws because they had already obtained all the land they needed and did not want competition from other large landholders. On the con-trary, Tarr thought the second group would rather see "people of limited means who [sic] they could fleece." ^65
Hagerman claimed that the company's sole purpose at first was to sell "water rights" and collect "water rentals." ^66
Deed record books for Eddy County during the 1880s and early 1890s are riddled with examples of irrigation company officials obtaining indi-viduals' land and water-right deeds following proof of reclamation in exchange for a few dollars. ^72
The year after Congress passed the Desert Land Act, John Wesley Powell offered his findings and viewpoint concerning the use of arid lands in the West. To prevent the sort of rampant land law abuse occurring in southeastern New Mexico, Powell recommended an alternative to specula-tive control in the West. Powell realized that the 1120 acres accumulated through the Preemption, Desert Land, and Timber Culture Acts was not enough land to graze cattle, and 160 acres through the Homestead Act was too much for one man to cultivate as an irrigated farm. Powell suggested 40 acres for farmers on irrigated land. ^78
[powell was surveying land and was going to have the ill-gotten land given to people it was intednded for, but Eddy convinced congress to shut the powell project down]
Powell's engineers in New Mexico selected thirty-nine reservoir sites, totaling 40,170 acres of land. ^88
Hagerman recalled that in the fall of 1890, "[t]he Attorney General had interpreted a law of Congress in a way which would have ruined our Pecos Enterprise unless we had secured legislative relief speedily-in this we were completely successful and we were left in better shape than before the row began." ^91
An amendment to the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill, signed on August 30, 1890, effectively killed the Powell survey
General Revision Act of 1891. The act repealed the Timber Culture and Preemption Acts, extended the period after original homestead entry several months before it could be commuted to a cash entry, and modified requirements for the completion of Desert Land entries. Now applicants for Desert Land entry had to submit plans for irrigation and spend at least one dollar per acre in each of the three years on irrigation. The applicant had to live in the state, and the acreage one could acquire was now limited to 320 acres. [all the rich fat cats got theirs, now set up the barriers to entry]
Such reforms may have come too late, because speculators and railroads had already grabbed the choicest lands.
[land had for 25 cents an acre was being resold for 25-100 dollars by land developers]
law did not require resi-dency or cultivation
New Yorkers and Chicagoans deeded the lands over to Stevens, the Eddys, Tan-sill, friends, relatives, and parties connected to the valley's irrigation com-pany
the supply of irrigable land was far greater than the number of settlers who wanted to live on it. ^99
Chapter 03: Jackrabbits, Canals, and Cottonwoods
Eddy built his town twelve miles south of the established village of Seven Rivers, the community of Texas cattlemen that now fought Eddy not only over control of grazing lands but also for political control of the region.
christened the town of Eddy in the fall of 1888
Eddy established the Pecos Valley Town Company, 4 organized April 6, 1889, "to acquire, hold, and subdivide tracts of land in the territory of New Mexico and to turn such tracts of land into suitable town lots and to sell them to settlers." ^5
the Town Company was responsible for public improvements such as gasworks, electric light works, waterworks, and streetcars, all of which Eddy proposed for the new town in the early 1890s. ^6
Charles Eddy even planted cot-tonwoods throughout his town.
E. G. Shields commented that as late as 1890, the valley was more or less a complete desert without inhabitants, but by 1891 the population exceeded one thousand, and according to him there were hundreds of houses throughout the valley. ^15
loose cattle had a penchant for run-ning through the streets and knocking over newly planted cottonwood trees.
to protect the cottonwoods by planting ocotillo cacti beside the trees and by hiring a mounted night watchman to chase the cattle out of town.
By the middle of July 1890, construction crews had laid five miles of Pecos Valley Railway track from Pecos, Texas, north to Eddy. ^24
1891, telegraph service
[vying for county seat of the new town of Eddy] "Dear Sir, According to the bill creating our county...the gov-ernor is to appoint...county commissioners in August. In a county [as] progressive as our's [sic]...there [are] always...obstructionists....[I]t may be that they will ask you to appoint commissioners who would prove very unfortunate to our enormous interest. And before you take any action, let us suggest the names of men who are first class businessmen and thor-oughly reliable citizens....Charles B. Eddy, Eddy, New Mexico." ^28
as Seven Rivers receded in importance, the burgeoning town of Roswell, ninety miles upstream, grew as a rival to the town of Eddy. ^30 When in 1890 Roswell adopted the name "The Pride of the Pecos," Eddy decided to call itself "The Pearl of the Pecos." ^31
His first well, dug by William Hale, flowed pure clean water. By 1900 the Roswell area had 153 such wells.
as early as 1891 settlers near Seven Rivers drilled artesian wells, one only 180 feet deep. ^39
local newspaper commented: "[Eddy] is entirely too large a town to twaddle along any farther. She has outgrown her baby clothes and now demands adult garments in the shape of a complete city government." The town incorporated on January 16, 1893. ^41
James Hagerman believed that all the country needed was the right sort of people to settle it. "You want steady, industrious, frugal people-people who understand farming and fruit growing and are not afraid to work and do not expect to make a fortune in one or two years." ^42 In the early days, Eddy and Hagerman brought investors, not farmers, to the area, but by 1891 the emphasis shifted to farmers.
Hagerman Dam. In 1892 workers built the first dam
which became the parent of Southwestern Public Service Company, now Xcel Energy, which supplies electricity to customers in seventeen states. ^57
The reservoir had a capacity of 1.5 million gallons
spring of 1893, Hagerman planted 12,316 grapevines and 2,950 fruit trees, including 37 fig trees. The area around his residence was covered with 5 English walnut trees, 58 olive trees, 12 orange trees, 26 palm trees, a number of yuccas, pomegranates, and oleanders, 99 China umbrellas, 20 elm trees, and 46 Russian mulberries. Hagerman added black locust trees, 799 Carolina poplar trees, 350 cottonwoods, 18 weeping willows, 354 Russian mulberries, and 40,000 Osage hedge plants
They recommended that newcomers plant ten acres of alfalfa and devote remaining acreage to fruit trees.
Boosted by unscrupulous promotion and false promises, Eddy continued to grow.
Max Frost put it, "if this thing keeps on, the Eddy country tail will wag the New Mexico dog financially, politically, and in every other way." ^95
European immigrants would succeed in New Mexico
Gaullieur told local officials that the immigrants needed no financial help since his country did not permit immigration of the poorer classes who depended solely on their labor to get by. Prospective immi-grants to the valley, according to Gaullieur, gained permission to leave Switzerland only after proving ownership of enough capital to allow farmers and stockmen to succeed without going into debt. ^106
Swiss entries all show Vaud, New Mexico, as the place of residence.
Promoters also tried to disabuse prospective settlers from the notion of southeastern New Mexico as a rough, uncivilized place. Rather it was progressive, civilized, and English speaking.
Chapter 04: Dams and Violence in the Pecos Valley
As total investment increased, projects got bigger and more capital-intensive, measured by the flurry of activity by investors, laborers, farmers, and townspeople. Violence fed by alcohol and racism also increased commensurate with the amount of construction activity in the valley.
Ash Upson described the contraption in December 1888: Imagine a large wagon frame, with a tread of eight feet, enormous wheels, with tires six inches wide. Underneath, and at one side, is a large plow, of the kind known as a "prairie breaker." An endless band of gum elastic about three feet wide, revolving over rollers, extends from the plow at right angles with the furrows. A cog wheel attachment to the wagon wheel gives motion to this endless band. Now, when the machine is in motion the plow turns the sod or ground just like any plow, the dirt so turned over falls on the band, which in motion, carries it off to one side and deposits it a distance of 22 feet from the furrow. The machine in an up and down trip will excavate two furrows and deposit the dirt 44 feet apart....Fourteen horses and three men work the machine, doing the work of thirty men and horses with ordi-nary plows and scrapers. ^20
The machine plowed a furrow twelve inches wide and six inches deep. The company ran the machine ten miles per day, working as quickly as possible, throwing some 1,000 cubic yards of dirt in the process. The company used two of these machines on the projects. ^21
By the spring of 1891 James Hagerman and other investors had spent close to a million dollars on various works in the valley, and by the fall of 1893 that figure had doubled. ^55
The introduction of property taxes after 1848 caused many New Mexicans to lose land. Land taxes were based on the presumption that land was used for commercial enterprises, such as those pursued by Anglos, but the tradi-tional economy of Mexican Americans was based on subsistence agricul-ture and stock raising, in which cash profits were scant. During the Spanish and Mexican eras, taxes were levied not on lands but on products of land, and were paid in kind.
In the 1880s when commercial cattle operators entered the territory, Anglos took full advantage of tax laws to wrest land from Mexican Ameri-cans. By the late 1880s and 1890s, Mexican pastoral agriculture near Mis-souri Plaza and elsewhere had been replaced, and displaced Mexican American farmers ironically became the workforce that made possible the newcomers' prosperity. ^59
Charles Eddy, charged with forcing Mexican Americans off their land, also became their major employer, recruiting Mexican nationals and Mex-ican American workers to valley projects for extremely low wages.
Some of his workers were boys, making two and a half to five cents per hour, working ten-hour days, or $15 per month, to complete Avalon Dam and clear a site for the new town. ^61 By comparison, Francis Tracy, who began working for the company as a crew foreman supervising Mexican laborers planting orchards and digging ditches, made $75 a month for his efforts. ^62 A Roswell schoolteacher taught twenty students in a one-room schoolhouse and made $45 a month, $13 going for room and board. ^63 Trail bosses hired to herd the Eddys' cattle in the early to mid-1880s made $100 a month. ^64 Cowboys made much less.
Following the Mexican War, the Mex-ican economy became an integral part of the U.S. Economy, especially as a labor resource: "A worker from central Mexico could move northward, from town to town, through the western United States, engaged in mining, farming and maintenance work for investor and production linked compa-nies."
Following the first railroad built into El Paso in the 1880s, subsequent lines employed thousands of Mexican workers to lay track in the South-west. ^73
Irrigation company offi-cials pursued this from the start: "It is pretty generally understood...that saloons, gambling dens, houses of ill repute, etc., will not be tolerated in Eddy. This place is going to be a temperance town, a decent town, a chaste town. It is going to be a place where good people can locate to bring up good children. It is patterned after Colorado Springs, Colorado, a town that has a national reputation as a strictly temperenced place." ^78
To placate workers and recoup some of their wages [Eddy worked with neighboring towns to profit from the liquor being sold; advertising in the newspaper where to get the drinks, but maintaining an air of respectability in the community.]
Local reporters gleefully related graphic and often bizarre details about violence almost every week. [almost all racially biased, Mexicans, Italians, etc]
One worker, reminiscing on his earlier days building irrigation projects, remembered that the territory was full of bandits: "They ha[d] long hair and beards and would ride through the countryside stopping wagons...killing the people and taking their horses." ^103
Business interests in Phenix ran candidates for sheriff, county clerk, and county assessor in November 1894 and lost all three races in an election in which some returns were lost and the results of the sheriff 's race were contested.
Chapter 05: Companies Canals and Capital
in 1891 the grand total Hagerman proposed to irrigate from the Pecos Irrigation and Improvement Company system came to 400,000 acres. The hubris of engineers at the time led them to believe that irrigating 400,000 acres was not only reasonable but a task made easy by the region's level land, and, perhaps more important, by the engineers' and investors' abiding faith in the human use of science to control water and nature. ^34
In retrospect, it appears that Hagerman and others, including "competent" engineers like Net-tleton, had little grasp of the reality of irrigating the Pecos Valley.
irrigated acreage from Roswell to Texas does not exceed 50,000 acres today.
By the fall of 1893 James Hagerman and other investors had spent $2 million on various works in the valley, and, as indicated by the reservoir negotiations, costs were soaring. ^53
The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 directed the U.S. Treasury to buy 4.5 million ounces of silver each month at the prevailing market price, then issue legal tender notes, using the silver as backing. Congress repealed the act in October 1893 because the panic caused many to believe the silver standard weakened the gold reserve and that demonetizing silver would pull the nation out of the depression. ^68
Despite Hagerman's promises and financial maneuvering, many people fled the valley after the flood, including the Swiss and Italians. The only foreigners who stayed were those too poor to leave, the laborers who worked for the moneyed class
Instead of watering 400,000 acres, the system watered only about 37,000. ^83 About 25,000 acres are irrigable under the Carlsbad Project today, an irrigation system that serves 700 people on 155 farms. ^84
Chapter 06: Railroads and Receivership
By the end of 1897 Hagerman had spent $2,654,894 in the Pecos Valley. ^36
1896 and 1898 Eddy and Hagerman frequently competed for the same money at high interest rates of 12 to 13 percent.
Chapter 07: Private Irrigation Drowns in Ditches of its Own Making
engineers failed to use water supplies fully or prevent alkali buildup
90 percent of all privately owned irrigation companies were near or in bankruptcy by 1902. ^1
Roosevelt laid the basis for watering the West: "Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams and to save floodwaters. This con-struction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for pri-vate efforts....[I]t is properly a national function....[T]he Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs." ^4
reclamation met opposition from states' rights supporters; older, eastern states; and from farmers fearful of competition, who tended to oppose fed-eral involvement in agriculture. ^5
western writer, "the engineers who staffed the Reclama-tion Service tended to view themselves as a godlike class performing hydro-logic miracles for gratified simpletons who were content to sit in the desert and raise fruit." ^15
October 2, 1902, floodwaters raced down the banks of the Pecos River and partially destroyed Avalon Dam. Observers estimated the flood to be twice as great as the one that had caused so much destruc-tion in 1893.
December 1904 Reclamation began a seventeen-month-long investigation and preliminary surveys in the lower valley to repair and rehabilitate the system. ^86
Chapter 08: Mr. Wrecklamation Man
[12.5c per hour for Mexican, 15 cents per hour for easterners]
Engineer Thomas H. Means, ^41 from the Bureau of Soils: "Such a depression in the prosperity of every irrigation scheme fos-tered by a corporation seems to be inevitable and when other schemes of similar magnitude in the United States are compared, the Pecos Valley does not seem to have suffered more than many others." ^44
Means noted that in the Pecos Valley, as in other parts of the western United States, engineering and technology did not match the needs of the projects
river water used to irrigate crops was charged with salines. The river carried an average of 310 parts of soluble matter per 100,000 parts water. Out of that amount, some 152 parts were made up of salts
Means con-cluded that irrigation water was so highly constituted of gypsum and alkali that it was gradually destroying the soils of the project area, and eventually would prevent growing all except the heartiest of alkali-resistant crops. ^46
Although fruit, asparagus, onions, cantaloupe, celery, and sweet potatoes showed positive results on well-managed farms, the valley soils lacked the nutrients required for many crops.
Means, like R. B. Marcy fifty years earlier, thought the Pecos Valley was best suited as grazing country.
He [Means] argued that barley or oats during the winter months, with alfalfa and kaffir corn grown during the summer, would be especially profitable. ^47
Farmers in the Carlsbad area grew cotton in sufficient quantities to war-rant the construction and operation of a gin. experimented with Egyptian cotton, and Means thought the crop had a bright future. ^48
Bureau of Soils retracted its statements regarding alkali and poor water, issuing a statement indicating that the real trouble on the project was poor drainage, not bad water. ^51 [?!]
Chapter 09: Such of the Lands Economically Practicable to Irrigate
Referring to Malaga Land and Improvement Company, Reed informed the director: "A close inspection shows that their work is very artistic. They have used great ingenuity in avoiding, or trying to avoid, placing themselves criminally liable, yet they are undoubtedly deceiving people and know that they are doing so....[T]hey are trying to sell land that has not been admitted to the project, but are so wording their advertisements that those who are not familiar with the circumstances would be led to believe that they are getting lands that has a water right or is subject to a water right." ^12
Tracy, McLenathen, and Malaga were selling lands deeded to the association prior to knowing which lands would be irrigated. Given their quality, the Malaga lands were far down the list for possible inclusion under the project.
informed numerous purchasers that they had bought land that had no water whatsoever, and "no one could say when this land could get water for irrigation, if ever." ^26
Average farmers in the Carlsbad area, according to Muggeridge, resented large landowners and managers like Francis Tracy
Chapter 10: God Pity the Water User
While many people consid-ered reclamation projects as engineering triumphs, many projects were social and economic nightmares.
Taylor responded that "no outside man can afford to serve on a [similar] Board...unless he makes up his mind to certify that everything that has been done in the past was 'proper,' otherwise he will put in array against him the most powerful organization in the Engineering world." ^30
Citing an Army Board of Engineers report from 1910, Mead and other Central Board members considered Carlsbad to be the victim of specula-tion.
All told, the government spent some $900,000 for construction on the project, each increment of which was requested andapproved by the association. ^41
The water users association had been controlled by Tracy and absentee proxy votes for a decade.
The Central Board pointed out that people neither improving nor cultivating but simply acting as dummy owners for large holders of land worked against the intent of the Reclamation Act
Local boosters promoted the area water supply as inexhaustible [Carlsbad, 2 springs, 2 reservoirs]
By the end of the decade, according to boosters, the area grew more Durango cotton than anywhere else in the region. ^54 From 1907 to 1922 cotton and alfalfa led the way in crop production.
Reclamation countered that the principal problems at Carlsbad were inflated land prices, alien landlordism, dummy landowners, and watered landholdings that exceeded Reclamation's 160-acre limit
Chapter 11: An Elusive Reservoir
To the north, farmers drilled wells near Roswell to utilize underground aquifers; Carlsbad water users believed the wells diminished the volume in the Pecos River.
With statehood in 1912, state law, not federal territorial law, governed New Mexico's water use.
New Mexicans found it curious that although Texas historically stood against Reclamation in the West, as soon as the federal government started raising money for such projects, Texas promptly made demands for its share of those monies and waters, although it had not one acre of public land. ^10
Leakage and siltation had increasingly reduced the effectiveness of McMillan Reservoir. Experiencing water shortages, the Pecos Water Users Association again requested and received a contract for an investigation and sought federal assistance for construc-tion of a new storage reservoir. ^17
By the early 1920s the federal government had spent close to $2 million rehabilitating and improving the Carlsbad Project. The irrigation works, however, were still besieged by problems of siltation and seepage, salt cedar growth, evaporation, absentee ownership, and additional claims to the waters of the Pecos River.
Conclusion
grandiose pseudoscientific claims about "rain fol-lowing the plow,"
Over 90 percent of the private irrigation companies were bankrupt or close to it by 1900 because of poor design and construction, short growing seasons, alkali soils, inadequate drainage, and poor assessment of water availability and flooding.
Desert Passages,^1 Patricia Limerick discusses a succession of travelers, miners, and appreciators of the desert, finally arriving at irrigationists at the turn of the century.
At its core, Carlsbad is about the scarcity of water-and the individuals, corporations, and political entities who fought among themselves, estab-lished allies, and maneuvered to control it. There was little accommodation for physical, environmental, or economic realities.
1987 before the federal government completed a third reservoir, and then only on the basis of multiple use, Brantley Dam and Reservoir culminated a century's worth of badgering and subsequent investigations in the valley.
the Carlsbad Project nonetheless demonstrates a manipula-tion of federal law for the benefit of nineteenth-century speculators. Carlsbad reflects the struggle between Reclamation's attempt to stay true to policies adopted under the Newlands Act, given the special nature of the Carlsbad Project, and the political pressure brought to bear by local and national lobby efforts aimed at skirting the law's intent.
Epilogue
in 1923 New Mexico and Texas jointly created the Pecos River Compact Commission following legislation in each state to seek a means for distributing waters equitably among the citizens of the two states.
Pecos River Compact, was finally signed in 1948
Immediately following ratification of the second Pecos River Compact, troubles began that continued unabated into the twenty-first century. Unusually dry weather plagued New Mexico in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that New Mexico had regularly shorted Texas valuable water between 1950 and 1986.

Fontecostanza is the true heart of a unique musical culture that ensures continuity in our style. Here, the last historical Workshops live on, in which the highly skilled Artisan Craftsmen, now the last in Italy, with a particular technique made up of ability, creativity and tradition, having remained secret and unchanged throughout the centuries, create Bagpipes and Shawms (“Fifes”), instruments sought-after and prized both in Italy and abroad for their uniqueness and typicality, therefore contributing to the regeneration of a cultural heritage that is amongst the most fascinating in Italy.
The Bagpipes of Scapoli come in different models that can be identified according to size with the following numbers: 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32; the most frequently used is the Bagpipe “25 con chiave”.
A lengthy and laborious procedure, guided by particular and rare instruments, all made by hand by the Artisan and especially created to be able to carve the select wood from olive, cherry and prune trees. It was Benedetto Di Fiore, at the beginning of the 20th century, who stood out for his exceptional artistic talent and who created the “Artisan Workshop”, a resource for Master Craftsmen of today and tomorrow.

2015 Ontario UFO Reports
London July 25th 2015
London Ontario July 25th 2015 9:40pm
UFO details report: "10:00pm I was crossing the field at silver woods park looking up and noticed a star almost straight above me dotted out for 5 seconds then a very fast ball of light race across the sky from west to east until it was out of sight heading east towards Trafal.Since its release in September, .”
Now, as the southern hemisphere gears up for Summer, Australia’s own Jolyon Petch has remixed ‘Angel Baby’, flipping the song from a mega pop power ballad into a dance floor banger.
Troye Sivan shared the official video for his first solo..
“Angel Baby” comes off the back of ‘You’, Troye’s collaboration with Regard and Tate McRae which was released in April 2021 became a top 10 hit at US radio, hit the #1 spot on Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, and has amassed over 200 million global streams to date.
In his career to date, Troye has amassed over 10 billion combined global streams, including one billion video streams. His sophomore album, Bloom (EMI), was named as one of the best albums of 2018 by critics at Rolling Stone, USA Today, Billboard, OUT, NPR Music, The Guardian and numerous other publications. TIME said, “Troye Sivan is the perfect pop star.” He is an ambassador for the Pasha de Cartier watch alongside Rami Malek, Willow Smith, Maisie Wiliams and Jackson Wang.
USA Today placed his 2020 EP, In A Dream, on its list of “10 albums you need to hear this month,” noting that “Aside from Taylor Swift…no other artist has better captured our quarantine blues than Troye Sivan.” The EP included the hits “Take Yourself Home” and “Easy.” Troye later collaborated with Kacey Musgraves on a new version of “Easy,” which featured Mark Ronson.
His numerous awards include 2 ARIA Awards, an APRA award,, featured on the BTS album, Map of The Soul: 7, which debuted at No. 1 in the U.S., Korea, Australia and around the world.The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) posted a warning on its Facebook page warning that a bogus email has been doing the rounds, which looks disturbingly legitimate.
ACMA’s statement reads:
“Emails claiming to be from Optus are circulating. They want your credit card information for what is claimed to be an unpaid bill.
“The ACMA has been receiving reports about emails with the subject line ‘We are unable to process your last payment’.
.
“If you receive this scam email, delete it immediately.
“More info about protecting yourself, visit Stay Smart Online.”
The message had been shared 2,500 times when My Business viewed it.
Telco acts to shut down scam
An Optus spokesperson said the company was notified that some of its customers received the bogus email last weekend, which featured requests to confirm payment details.
“We reacted quickly to block the website linked to the email, which will ensure that Optus mobile and internet customers who mistakenly click the link won’t be able to access the site. We’ve also reported the site and requested it to be taken down,” the spokesperson said.
“Optus does not send unsolicited emails to customers asking for sensitive or personal information, and we encourage customers who suspect they have received a scam email or SMS claiming to be from Optus to contact us.”
ACMA’s alert came just a day after its director of SMB direct and cyber sales revealed that the telco’s software is identifying and blocking as many as 10 billion malicious emails every day, and that such attacks are “becoming more frequent and more specific”.
Optus not the only target for impostors
In April this year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned that scammers are impersonating telecommunications companies, including Optus and Telstra, as well as energy companies, with fake bills.
In recent months, scammers have also posed as the federal government portal myGov, accounting software providers, the Australian Tax Office and even the Australian Bankers Association (ABA).
“The Optus,” said Garrett O’Hara of email management firm Mimecast.
“This can be successful to get people to click their link and provide credit card information. This is very similar to a phishing campaign last month, which targeted Telstra customers in much the same way.”
Mr O’Hara said that any email related to non-payment or service disruption should be viewed with skepticism.
“Ignore any links within the email and go directly to the company’s website,” he suggested.
“Log into [your] account as normal and from there [you] can access [your] account. Any issues would be highlighted if they existed without the risk of malware or theft of credit card information.”Trading Date

Larry Vickers had a chance to shoot the AN-94 during his trip to Moscow, Russian Federation:
This video is one of the rare pieces of video footage of the AN-94 in action, and the only one I know of with video commentary. It makes a good companion to the best English-language source on the mechanics of the rifle that I know of, SADJ’s recent article by David Lake.
Lake got the chance to shoot a rare imported AN-94 (had you asked me what number of Nikonovs had been imported before reading, I would have been very confident in an answer of “zero”), and his disassembly and function description is well worth reading:.
If you’re like me, your eyes got very, very wide while reading that.
To help, here’s a video of what happens in the AN-94 it is charged with a new round:
What’s so remarkable about the AN-94 isn’t how Germanically complex it is, it’s how simple it is relative to the individual functions it performs, especially considering the high rate at which it fires. Indeed, the AN-94 is a tremendously clever design, operating from both the open and closed bolt positions literally faster than the eye can blink. As Lake pointed out in his article, it is also quintessentially Russian in design and construction, featuring a rough, spartan finish that clashes with the incredible ingenuity of the operating mechanism.
A cutaway model of the AN-94. This and other images are available in full resolution at this link.
I think David Lake summed up the Russian udivitelnyj vintovka best:.On-Camera Coaching

Technical analysis is a method to project and predict the price of stocks via analysis of past data such as price chart and its movements, trading volume, open trading volume, pattern formation, and technical indicators. Technical analysts always consider three assumptions. First, all you need is in the price chart. Second, prices move based on a predictable trends. Third, price movement repeats itself. Four concepts are used for technical analysis as discussed here.
1- Trend lines (positive and negative trend lines)
A positive trend is when three consecutive price changes have an upward movement in the price chart. A negative trend is when three consecutive price changes have a downward movement in the price chart.
2- Resistance and support lines
Resistance is an area in the upward trend in which new prices can not cross above it. The support area is the area that the downward movement can not move beneath that in a bearish movement. The greater the number of collisions to the resistance and support lines, the more powerful these lines are.
3- Indicator (on the-chart and off-chart)
Indicators are tools that assist the analyst in predicting the direction of market movement. There are numerous indicators that are classified into two groups: Indicators on the chart and indicators off-chart.
4- Candle (classic patterns and graphic arrangement)
Classic patterns are specific behaviors in charts, inspired by the behavior of nature, that can predict future price movements. Analysts examine numerous diagrams to predict and project the best possible behavior. The graphic arrangement is classified into three forms: bar, line, and candle. The candle is the most common method which contains information such as starting price, highest daily price, the lowest daily price.Todd Mitgang, Chef | Crave Fishbar | New York City
Mitgang swaps in herbaceous watercress for basil in a pesto made with toasted walnuts, garlic, serrano chile, capers, red wine vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, and Grana Padano cheese. It’s served with grilled Faroe Islands salmon on a bed of wasabi-parsnip purée and roasted hon shimeji mushrooms.
Gabriel Rucker, Executive Chef / Marcelle Crooks, Chef de Cuisine
Little Bird Bistro | Portland, Oregon
Rucker and Crooks continue to serve original chef Erik Van Kley’s take on chicken-fried steak, replacing the beef with rainbow trout from Idaho. They soak the trout belly in buttermilk similar to chicken-fried steak, dredging it in one part cornstarch, one part rice flour, and a little Espelette pepper before slicing and frying it. The “steak” is then served with pickled carrots, fresh dill, local radish, Dijon mustard, and gribiche—a French aioli made with chilled hard-boiled eggs.
Eric Skokan, Chef/Owner | Black Cat | Boulder, Colorado
To create a healthier version of an aioli-like mix, Skokan ditches eggs and dairy for his Almond Tarator. The result is a classic Turkish sauce that he says makes a great addition to warm, poached shrimp or roasted vegetables like cauliflower. He boils the toasted almonds and roasted garlic together in water until evaporated, then purées the mixtures until very smooth, adding a little water as needed to thin the mixture out. He then adds oil with the processor’s motor running and seasons the sauce with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
Samantha & Cody Carroll, Chefs | Sac-a-Lait | New Orleans
The Carrolls use fresh herbs like lovage, Aztec sweet herb, safflower, wormwood, Vietnamese coriander, and lemon verbena from the restaurant’s onsite garden to balance their South Louisiana cuisine. For a hot quail dish, they’ll swap cilantro for papalo, which has a similar flavor but tastes spiked with peppery arugula and a hint of lime. To make the dish, they first make a sauce by simmering a house-made, 400-day fermented cayenne spice blend with local honey and fresh lemongrass until sticky, and toss the buttermilk-marinated fried quail in that. The dish is garnished with papalo leaves, toasted pistachios, green onions, and sifted bee pollen.Every two years, the Tokyo Motor Show shows off wild and wacky concepts, features hopeful visions of a clean-running future, and launches shiny new versions of the best of Japanese engineering. And, every two years, you’d be better off just hanging out in the parking lot.
The first couple of days at the show is for media and exhibitors and, much as it is on this side of the Pacific, Japanese car enthusiasts are wonderfully nutty. All sorts of random machinery gets driven over and left outside the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition centre, and it’s always worth taking a quick tour.
Remember Isuzu? Probably not. However, this boxy little Gemini Irmscher is clearly well-loved by someone. A Japan-only model, it’s pretty stout, with a turbocharged 1.6L engine making just under 180 hp.
Despite parking being at a premium, not all Japanese owners choose to buy small. This portal-axle-equipped Geländewagen looks totally out of place in one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Would you park it in a koi pond?
Nearly ubiquitous in traffic, the classic Mini Cooper was sold in Japan well into the 1990s. Later models came with air-conditioning and automatic transmissions.
Vintage cars are very rare in Japan, thanks to stringent safety requirements and tax laws. This Nissan Cedric is a survivor with a four-speed manual, and looks like a throwback to some forgotten Tokyo detective show.
Vans are hugely popular in the city, because they make the most of their footprint. Modifying them is also common, as is the case with this breathed-on Toyota Alphard. Bonus Volvo wagon in the background.
The Daihatsu Copen is tiny enough to make a first-generation Miata look like a Camaro. Because this is Japan, it’s still getting a twin-pipe exhaust system that’s big enough for a Lamborghini Huracan.
Hachiroku! The Corolla GT-S (Trueno and Sprinter in the Japanese home market) has a huge cult following thanks to the comic/manga/anime sensation Initial-D.

Here's a puzzle: a giraffe has much longer legs than a cheetah, but it runs only about half as fast.
It seems long legs don't make you the fastest in the land. Yale University biologist Walter Jetz says theoretically, they should. Animals with longer limbs and lots of muscle should be able to cover ground — or water or air — the fastest.
"I mean it's really cool actually," Jetz says, "to think about these really large birds or mammals or even large dinosaurs, in principle they could have been super super fast." For example, based on muscle mass and body size, an elephant in theory could run 60 miles an hour.
But Jetz and his fellow researchers studied over 400 animals species and found that the biggest animals fall short of their potential. It's actually mid-sized animals that run almost as fast as their bodies theoretically can go: the cheetah, the marlin, or the falcon, for example.
It turns out that reaching your top speed potential depends on your fuel tank. Acceleration is all about burning the body's high-octane fuel to get those fast-twitch muscles going. This is where muscles are working hard and fast — anaerobically, or without much oxygen.
Animals only have so much of this kind of fuel: What happens is, the biggest animals take more time to accelerate, and they run out of it before they reach their top speed. "In practice, they run out of energy in their acceleration before they can even reach that theoretical speed," Jetz says. They switch over the aerobic running, which is lower intensity and much slower.
Mid-sized animals, however, have a mix of energy and limb size and muscle that puts them in a speed "sweet spot." They don't burn out as fast. "The leopard or the jaguar have enough acceleration energy to make it all the way to nearly your theoretically maximum speed," says Jetz.
Jetz reports his findings in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. Once his research team proved their calculations worked on living animals, they turned their analysis to dinosaurs. They found that the giant Tyrannosaurus rex topped out at a mere 17 miles an hour.
That reassures Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, who came to much the same conclusion from studying the T. rex skeleton. "You know, this is one of these things — I had a professor who said 'I don't know if this is true but it deserves to be true'."
Carrano says accurately deducing a dinosaur's movement from its size is a handy tool. It could provide clues to how dinosaurs traveled, like the horned triceratops. "How wide-ranging was a triceratops?" Carrano wonders. "Was it like a bison? Some people think these animals migrated across the continent."
Or it might shed light on how the velociraptors of Jurassic Park fame actually hunted. According to the Jetz's research, the velociraptor would have been in that speedy sweet spot like mid-sized mammals, possibly running as fast as 33 miles an hour.
That's something to think about.

While we still haven't solved contact tracing, we have a new problem: How to quickly and easily confirm that someone has tested negative for COVID-19 or has received their full vaccination. One could argue that such a system is only necessary when opening an economy too early and too fast to prevent yet another surge in preventable deaths, but I digress. The solution being pushed to the forefront is vaccine passports.
Like a Boarding Pass, But for Staying Alive
You may not be familiar with the idea of a vaccine passport, but you likely will be soon. Bloomberg reports that many travel companies are investing in technology that will verify if you are low risk enough to enter certain spaces, or say, board an airplane. The US and the EU are also pushing for similar technology. Last week, New York State unveiled the Excelsior Pass, the first vaccine passport in the nation, which it developed with IBM.
In everything you read, vaccine passports are compared with digital airline boarding passes. You sign up online and a central, state-run authority will generate a pass that says you've been vaccinated or were recently issued a negative COVID test. This lives on your phone (like digital boarding passes) inside of a custom app.
In the case of New York State, you can only receive a pass 14 days after your final COVID-19 vaccination, or if you passed a COVID test in the last three days, or have received a negative antigen test in the last six hours. None of those apply to me (yet), so I wasn't able to try it out. From the photos I've seen, the pass contains a scannable QR code, the name of the passholder, and their date of birth. Businesses and venues can use a separate app to scan the QR code to verify it, and could potentially request to see ID to verify that you are authorized to carry the pass.
That sounds simple enough, and perhaps—dare I say it—sensible. Excelsior even supports a low-tech printable pass, which solves the inherent problems of requiring a smartphone. But the privacy concerns that dogged contact-tracing apps have not been resolved here. The privacy policy of the Excelsior app is sketchy, and ominously notes that it is under no obligation to be HIPAA-compliant. Even worse, the press release announcing the effort says the Excelsior Pass will be built on (shudder) "blockchain technology." Why? I have no idea. Something to do with NFTs? Who knows?
Privacy watchdogs have been critical of New York and IBM's efforts. Albert Fox Cahn of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project told Gothamist, "it's really just high-tech hydroxychloroquine," a reference to a dubious-at-best debunked treatment for COVID-19. The Intercept separately quoted cryptologists Matthew Green and Bruce Schneier questioning the utility of blockchain in this context. In my experience, blockchain has become the poster child for overpromising and underdelivering.
Privacy Builds Trust
It doesn't have to be this way, again. There's plenty of time for the federal government to step in and require a single system that can be vetted by experts and usefully critiqued by everyone else. The companies that help develop these apps and create the platforms on which they run can push for the best privacy protections. It doesn't even need to be perfect, but it can be clear about how it works, what risks it presents, and it can be the same for everyone. And it really doesn't need blockchain.
If we're really going to use vaccine passports, these apps and services must protect an individual's privacy so people can use them without a second thought. People are rightly skeptical about law enforcement and government intrusions into privacy, and increasingly they have the same skepticism about big tech.
Even if these apps aren't legally required to be HIPAA-compliant, they should offer privacy assurances that go beyond that baseline standard because its adoption hinges on people being able to trust it. The privacy policies that support them should be clear and understandable (Excelsior's is not) and focus on protecting individuals rather than complying with the letter of the law or covering the asses of contractors and the state. Law enforcement, ICE, and US intelligence agencies should also explicitly and publicly exempt data from these services from investigation and interception. It should be sacrosanct, like US census data, because it is for a higher purpose.
Contact-tracing apps failed for many reasons, but the inability to point to them and say they were safe to use was one of them. Smartphones couldn't protect us from the coronavirus and perhaps that was too much to ask of big tech, but vaccine passports don't need to share that fate. They might not turn out to be our ticket out of this misery, but they should, at the very least, aim to do noWhat Kind of Services do Bobcat Hire Services Offer?
Most contractors and home owners usually have a hard time trying to get everything ready so that they can commence the construction process of ay building at hand. At times, there are some serious challenges that need to be faced before any other works can begin. One of the major jobs that need to be done right and on a timely manner is the excavation of the ground. This cannot happen fast and efficiently if you do not have IRB Tippers and Bobcat Hire services. The reason for that is if you were to hire manual laborers, they would spend a lot of time on the site hence delaying the entire process. To avoid that, you can simply hire bobcat services.
You will require bobcat hire services if you are about to set up a new building or renovating a current building. Generally, there are many things that will require to be dug up before any works can commence. As such, if you want to set up a new building, you should figure out whether you have what it takes to get the job done. Any major building will require the right size of the trenches and also the depth should be at par with the requirements sets by the governing bodies on how buildings should be set up. Bobcat services can also be sued to lift heavy materials at the construction site.
If you are about to do some landscaping on your lawn or yard, it is important that you consider bobcat hire services. There is nothing that can be as tiresome as setting up your lawn or yard. There is a lot of soil to get rid of and other areas that will require flattening hence without the right kind of materials to do the work; you can end up spending more than is necessary. Hiring manual work can take many days to complete hence the only way out is to hire a bobcat which will deliver its work in a timely manner.
You can also use Melbourne rock removal and bobcat hire services in ranches and farms. If you have a large farm, bobcat services can come in handy as they can get you properly organized and in order of how they should. You may require digging a trench at some point and also clearing the way for next season. As such, if you want to get all works done in a timely manner, you must hire a bobcat to accomplish that task easily.About Bellagio

Phase Two of Kininya Project to Start Construction!
IMG-7918
We want to thank the generous donors who helped SFSW reach a $4,000 goal to bring safe water to more Rwandan families in need! Through recycling, coin collection, another generous donation from Somamg Foundation and the efforts of our amazing student volunteers, 20 more families will have taps at their homes. This project was funded in record time due to the efforts of Matthew Limb who spearheaded this effort. Thank you for your hard work! We will keep you updated as the project progresses. Watch the linked video to hear how much these projects mean to the Rwandan families.
Recycling Program Milestone – $10K Donated to Safe Water Builds!
We are so proud of our youth advisory board members Jack Dennis and Grace for the recycling program efforts they began at St. John’s Episcopal School so many years ago. This year, their combined efforts have hit the $10,000 mark in recycling fund donations. This has directly helped to improve countless lives. To the students who use our receptacles, St. John’s administrators and the gym owners that allow us to collect plastic and aluminum bottles and cans and donate the funds to water projects – Thank you! We could not do as much as we do without your support. We are sending this huge shout out to our dynamic duo who created and have kept this program going for the last nine years! The weekly sorting and hauling may not be glamorous, but your dedicated efforts have improved lives. Thank you for all you do and congratulations on hitting this incredible milestone.
20 Families Gifted with Safe Water in the Village of Kininya!
We are thrilled to share news of the completion of the Kininya water project. We are so happy for the families and so proud of our youth advisory board members, Matthew and Maddy Limb and Kevin and Danny Kwak for the fundraising efforts that directly supported this project in conjunction with Best Family Rwanda. We are also proud of all our volunteers whose recycling, and fundraising efforts contributed to making this happen. Despite the pandemic, the project was completed and brought 20 more families access to clean safe water from taps installed at their home! Children and their caregivers will no longer have to walk long distances with jerry cans just to get clean water that is costly – or dirty water that kills. THANK YOU!
Gikondo Home Access Water Projects Completed!
Families in the Gikondo sector now have access to water at their homes! This is not only life changing for the families, but during this pandemic, it can be life saving to have clean water to wash hands. We are thankful for our youth advisory board members, volunteers and our supporters for making this happen. We look forward to helping more people on the next build. THANK YOU!
Tolinapa Construction Complete
The construction of the water system in Tolinapa is complete! The pump house is built, the electric pump is installed, the distribution network is in, and the water taps are at each home ready for safe water to flow. The one piece left is the electric company installing the transformer for the electric pump. Unfortunately, the coronavirus has caused hook-up delays, but we are so close to a healthier community and clean water. Our youth advisory board members are disappointed they have not been able to visit the site in Nicaragua as a result of the pandemic, but cannot wait until the taps are turned on and we can post those photos to show you the good you are doing! Safe water is near. More than ever, clean water is needed – not only to drink and bathe – but to wash hands and keep the virus from spreading.
Students For Safe Water Board Members and Volunteers Raise Funds for Kininya Project!
Big thank you to Matthew and Maddy Limb and Kevin and Danny Kwak for spearheading efforts of the Kininya water project to provide water to 20 families in Rwanda! Not only are we proud and grateful, but so is our partner – Best Family Rwanda. Construction has begun and we cannot wait for these families to get the water they need to live healthier lives. God Bless your efforts!
St. John’s Recycling Program 2019 – Bigger & Better
Founded by Students for Safe Water Youth Advisory Board members Grace and Jack Dennis as elementary school students, the St. John’s Episcopal Church and School’s campus-wide aluminum and plastic recycling program is now going into its 8th year and helping to bring safe water to those in need. Since Grace left for the east coast to attend college, Jack has manned the bins alone every week – emptying, sorting and transporting the bottles and cans to rePlanet redemption center and donated the funds to Students for Safe Water. Over $9,000.00 has been raised to date to help fund clean water wells, hygiene stations and other SFSW initiatives. Additionally, over 2000 pounds of plastic and aluminum waste has been kept out of our landfills and oceans. Thank you for your dedication and support!
Construction on Gikondo Home Access Water Projects is Underway!
Work began on the Gikondo water project to bring taps to the homes of the families in the community. We cannot wait for the safe water to flow!
Update: Tolinapa Build Progress
The trenches have been dug, the pipes have been laid and the Tolinapa community members have been working hard to construct the pump house (where the controls for the water system will be housed). Once all the controls are hooked up, a community operator will run the pump a set number of hours per day, twice a day, to fill the tank. The piped system will run from the tank, carrying the water to each home. This will change the health and lives of the community members. We are so excited for this project and so thankful to Paccar, individual donors and El Porvenir for helping us to help others! These families will no longer drink, bathe and cook with contaminated water. This year, a few of our youth advisory board members plan to visit Nicaragua and see this new build.

SFSW – With Paccar Support – Assists Community of Tolinapa and Surrounding Villages – Goal is 2020 Completion
Partnering with El Porvenir and Paccar, the Nicaraguan community of Tolinapa, Camoapa will soon benefit from a drilled well and water system. Milagro Lily Jaime Sosa is 24-year-old woman who lives in a home with seven other adults and three young girls in Tolinapa, Camoapa. The families in the community, like Milagro, have consumed polluted water their entire lives – drinking from an improvised well that they attempted to hand build on the banks of a contaminated river. “For more than 20 years, we had to drink water from a well that the women from the community built at the edge of a river – a river where we washed clothes and bathed.” In the summer, the well ran dry. In search of a new water source, the community had to deal with contamination, both from animals and garbage in the river. Milagro was concerned about the health of her family and community. This inspired her to take the initiative and seek out the assistance of El Porvenir – our partner NGO – in constructing a drilled well and water system. Receiving the support of Paccar, SFSW was able to commit to helping the hundreds of people of Tolinapa and the hundreds more in surrounding communities. As the project progresses we will keep you updated!
Thank you St. John’s for Ingathering Donation – June 2019! RSM, CA
The students at St. John’s have done it again! They have helped us to help others through their generosity during chapel ingathering. This time, they presented a check to Students For Safe Water for $830.13. Every person we have been able to help to date owes the administration and past and current students a huge thank you for their continued support. Students For Safe Water started over 9 years ago because of the willingness of administrators and teachers to believe in student efforts. With this last donation, we are nearing the amount needed to break ground on our biggest project -school construction in Madagascar, complete with water and sanitation. Thank you seems so inadequate –but THANK YOU!
Another Successful Chipotle Dining Event – Food for Change!
SMCHS’ SFSW Club, led by Grace and Jack Dennis, hosted a third dine in/out event in May 2019. It was the second held at the RSM Chipotle. The food and generosity of Chipotle (they share 50% of the proceeds!) brought us back. The simple act of having a meal out helped to bring clean water to people in need. Thank you to all the students and friends of SFSW that came out to support our work. Every little bit counts and helps make a difference in the lives of those living without!
SM SFSW Club Adds 98 Members – Going Strong! September 2018
Santa Margarita HS Club sign up nearly 100 new members. Thank you to Grace and Jack Dennis for manning the table. More students means more support!
Larger Community-Wide Nyarugunga Clean Water Project Completed, June 2018
Following the BFR-SFSW collaboration to bring 100 BFR families clean water, we received a request for a larger community-wide project. With funds received from SFSW, Students at St. John’s Episcopal in RSM and a matching donation from Somang foundation obtained by Youth Advisory Board Member, Maddy Limb, approximately 1,000 families located in the village now have access to water. The village is composed of vulnerable families, such as veterans with physical and mental disabilities and genocide survivors. Before this project was implemented, the villagers had to pay 150 RWFs for one jerrycan of water. This is a high price for vulnerable people with limited resources. For those who could not pay, the women and children were tasked with fetching unclean water far distances away. Many suffered stomach and skin issues because they were forced to drink and bathe in contaminated water. The community water project has changed life for thousands of men, women and children. One jerrycan of water now only costs 20 RWF, a price they can afford (130 RWF less than they previously paid after walking long distances). Its location in the community enables kids to attend school regularly as they now do not waste hours fetching water. The community is so grateful and wrote “Thank you (to the team) for this greater work of clean water. May Almighty God bless you.” We also thank all our supporters, every student, who thinks of others they may never meet. You are changing lives with every donation, however small. We have been asked to consider funding an additional community project in Kininya. We hope you will continue to support our efforts. We cannot do anything without students like you!

I have not "celebrated" anything, merely pointed out something I
believe has bearing. I have no clear means to determine who is
and is not more "meta-rational". I have a more or less
informaed opinion about who I believe is more likely to be
correct in a given situation and on a given subject.

Most people know how harmful sugary drinks are for our health. But could “diet drinks” with artificial sweeteners be just as dangerous? Or worse? Let’s look at the evidence:
- A 2017 study published in Stroke followed 4000 adults over 45 years of age for 10 years. The study found a three-fold risk of strokes and a three-fold increased risk of developing dementia in those taking the equivalent of one can of diet drink daily.
- A 2019 study followed 81,000 post-menopausal women for 11 years. It was also published in Stroke. It found those taking 2 or more diet drinks daily (compared to those taking one or less per week) had 29% more heart attacks, 31% more ischaemic strokes and a 16% greater chance of premature death. Those with obesity had a 200% higher risk of ischaemic stroke, those with diabetes or heart disease had a 240% increased risk of stroke. African American women had a 400% increased risk of stroke.
- A huge study done by the World Health Organisation followed 450,000 adults in 10 countries. It found that those who drank 2 or more (250mls) diet drinks daily had a 26% increase risk of early death over the next 16 years.
- A study from Columbia University found a 43% increase in heart attacks and strokes for those having one or more artificially sweetened “diet” drinks daily compared to those having none.
To put these studies in perspective, for those who have had heart attacks and strokes the dangers of continuing to drink diet drinks would greatly outweigh the benefits of any medication being taken.
- A study of 1550 adults found that those who used diet drinks gained more weight than those on other soft drinks. Each can or bottle drunk daily was associated with a 41% increased risk of being overweight.
- In 2013 a study was published that followed 66,000 French women for 14 years. It looked at the risk of developing type 2 diabetes from drinking sugary drinks and diet drinks. Those taking 500mls weekly with either sugary or diet drinks increased their risk of diabetes by about 50%. But surprisingly for those taking 1000 mls of sugary drinks weekly the risk of developing diabetes did not increased further but the risk of diabetes doubled in those taking diet drinks. The Multi-Ethnic study found a diet drink daily increased the risk of diabetes by 67%.
- In another study, drinking over 21 diet drinks a week doubled the rate of obesity.
The data is unequivocal. Diet drinks and artificial sweeteners increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and an early death. The message couldn’t be clearer; avoid these drinks whenever possible.
What we don’t know is which sweeteners are responsible for these adverse health effects.
The most worrying artificial sweetener is aspartame (found in Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Sprite Zero) which has been controversial from the beginning. It has repeatedly been found to cause cancers in animals and was found to cause epilepsy and death in monkeys. It can cause migraine and interferes with essential neurotransmitters and can cause a syndrome with headaches, mood changes, dizziness and gut symptoms. All 165 studies that found aspartame safe were sponsored by industry and all that found aspartame unsafe were independent studies.
Sucralose is a chemical which is thought to damage beneficial gut bacteria, reducing them by up to 50%. It can trigger migraine and cause infertility and miscarriages in laboratory animals. In one study it significantly reduced the weight of the thymus (the major gland of our immune system) within 28 days of using sucralose.
Saccharin has been linked with bladder cancer in animals. Agave is a concern due to its high fructose content.
High fructose corn syrup (more a sugar substitute than a sweetener) can trigger metabolic syndrome, fatty liver and obesity and contains mercury residues.
Sugar alcohols, such as xylitol, can cause bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea.
Stevia is a highly processed ingredient but may be the safest, although it may alter gut bacteria in negative way. At the moment it makes sense to avoid them all.Mariah Carey_Nick Cannon

My dog really enjoys these meals.
Customer recommends this product
I find this chicken & rice is an absolute must if your dog is inclined to get tummy upsets. I always have some in the cupboard and if my dog is unable to eat & digest his dry kibble, this is perfect to stabilise him. Bland enough to not irritate the stomach any more, but tasty enough that my dog loves it.
Customer recommends this product
My dog was put on this food because of his sensitive stomach (he had ulcers). He loves it.
Customer recommends this product
Good and consistent quality and texture, my dogs have all been happy to eat this when they aren't quite right and it's quick to just open a tin of balanced food than prepare chicken from the freezer or dash to the shops. It has all the nutrients needed. And I ordered by phone at 3.24pm and it was delivered just after 10.30 a.m. the following day, quicker than trying to contact, order and drive to the vet surgery.
Customer recommends this product
The product is fine and suits my dogs dietary requirements. The delivery this time wasn’t so good. I ordered on Wednesday and didn’t receive until the following Tuesday. It was bank holiday on the Monday but previous orders have been delivered within a couple of days

I don't necessarily care for daily horoscopes, or telling the future, but I just love looking into the traits, and characteristics that each star sign, and in particular my own, may possess. I'm also an avid poet, as some of you probably already know if you have been following me for a while, so I thought that I would combine the two together in today's post.
One of my very good blogger friends Alice also has the same star sign as me (Pisces) and we thought it would be a cute idea if we did a collab, which was based upon the topic. She's going to be doing a DIY post over on her blog (which you can read here), and I'm going to be sharing both of our verses of poetry on mine for you! We hope you enjoy...
She's selfless
It means she's caring and understanding
but this can be a devilish trait in disguise.
She finds it a struggle to fall in love with herself
All of her own emotions build up and overspill, like books on a shelf
Being selfless drains all of her energy
as to others, she is always so genuinely complimentary
She's always the first to offer a helping hand, or a shoulder to cry on
yet she falls asleep listening to the saddest of songs
Everybody treats her like she's nothing but an accessory
They only speak to her when they feel it's necessary
But, she's selfless and that's what makes her so sweet
It's definitely a trait which she wants to keep.
She's sensitive
It means she's deep and empathetic
but it can be negative.
The tears need holding back, ceaselessly
from the idea that no problem can be
solved heedlessly
Being sensitive wears her out
because of the countless fears it brings about
She shan't see blood, violence nor torture
for her chemicals will unbalance and haunt her
Her hypersensitivity can be misperception
this feeling left as a victim of her brain and minds deception
But she's sensitive and that's what makes her great;
A true example of her Pisces fate.

Everyone has experienced anxiety before. Whether it be before a test, a performance, or talking to someone new, everybody has experienced the rush of fear that anxiety brings. We feel and witness it in our daily lives.
However, not everybody has an anxiety disorder. According to the ADAA, anxiety affects one in eight children, and NIMH states about one in four adolescents age 13-19 are affected, but only 20% of children with diagnosable anxiety are getting the treatment they need. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 5.9% of 13-18 year olds will have a severe anxiety disorder throughout their life. According to the Child Mind Institute, mid-adolescent girls are twice as likely to develop an anxiety disorder. The ADAA states that adult women are twice as likely to be affected by Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. Many teens may develop habits based around their anxiety that become hard to break in adulthood, such as setting limitations on activities and expectations. Anxiety disorders are a real problem affecting approximately 44 millions people worldwide, in addition to other mental illnesses such as depression.
According to the NCCP, 20% of adolescents have a diagnosable mental disorder, and 20-30% of teens will have at least one major depressive episode before adulthood. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people ages 15-24 attempt suicide every year. 67-70% of teens in the juvenile justice system have a mental disorder that is diagnosable. According to NIMH, nearly 50% of teens 13-18 years old will have a mental illness that persists throughout their lives. 88% of Latino children and 77% of African American children have unmet mental health needs.According to AACAP, teens with anorexia are ten times more likely to die because of their anorexia.
Mental illnesses change people’s lives, and the lives of those around them, and yet we still continue to romanticize them. We picture anxiety as a girl in oversized sweaters reading a book, and depression as a few tears and a knight in shining armor on the way. We picture schizophrenia as wearing black lipstick and calling themselves a ‘ps*cho’. We picture OCD as cleaning your room a lot, and stressing about how your closet is organized.
But never have we ever pictured anxiety as crying in the bathroom after failing a test, and being unable to sleep for days after. We never picture depression as lacking the ability to even get out of bed, because the energy simply isn’t there. We don’t picture mental illness as an illness, we picture it as an aesthetic.

This archive was generated by hypermail 2b29 : Fri Apr 27 2001 - 23:18:48 PDTOver the last 16 years, we have seen the number of homeless in New York constantly changing. Although valiant efforts are made to reduce this number and afford people housing, events such as Hurricanes Irene and Sandy and the job market make this number fluctuate tremendously. As of the summer of 2018, over 22,000 children slept in shelters nightly — with levels at the highest rate since the Great Depression. Many of these children and their families had lived in regular housing until events such as a parent’s job loss or a disaster forced them to leave their homes.
Without the familiar celebrations, the holidays can be a painful reminder to these children of just how dramatically different their lives are now from other kids. Our organization’s goal is to ensure the holidays are a happy time for these children by treating them to a festive experience, a party unlike any they’ve ever experienced before.
The Department of Homeless Services (DHS) of New York City is our partner in planning the New York City Children’s Holiday Party. DHS delivers temporary shelter and social services to families in more than 150 shelter facilities throughout the city.AISI Cold Rolled Galvanized/Precision/Black/Carbon This product ou rmill use cold drawn/cold rolled process,piercing cold drawn/cold rolled heat treatmentstraighteningcutting endfinished product With this special process the finished product have following advantage:1) Sizes and Shapes will be

GSoC - Information for students[edit]
Here's the most important steps of applying for GSoC with GNU Radio:
- Read this entire page before submitting applications. We will not consider your application otherwise.
- Read Google's FAQ
-[edit].
Whatever you do, it is very important that you understand the project you'll be working on. Proving that you understand the problem is basically the first hurdle for you to get our attention.
You can submit several applications for GNU Radio, so if there are several projects you feel like doing, submit one for each project. Time has shown that it's usually better to eventually focus on one proposal, because it's already quite some work to get one excellent proposal finished.
The Proposal[edit]
The proposal, which you submit to the GSoC page, is the single most important part of your application.
In the time before the proposal submission, you should contact the GNU Radio mailing list.
The mentors (and other community members) will give you some feedback on your proposal, but that does mean you have to have to actually write a proposal on which you can get feedback.
It might seem odd to publically announce an unfinished proposal. You might be concerned that other students will read and copy your proposal. However, in the past, that has never happened. Students who submit early, and gather feedback, have always been the most successful students. We recommend having a proposal e.g. as a Google doc, or on an site like github, and treat it like open source software. Experience has shown that your chances are better if you start early with a publicly available proposal than developing your proposal trying to do it in private.
An example of a successful proposal from 2012 can be found here (filter design).
The following things must be in the proposal, or it is considered incomplete and will not be considered for acceptance! We will simply mark your proposal as 'incomplete' and ignore communications from you.
Topic background[edit][edit][edit][edit]!
Proof of your coding capabilities / prerequisite capabilities[edit]
Despite having close contact with your mentor, it will not be possible to work on a project if you're not already capable of writing code. Depending on the project, you will need different skills, typically C++ and/or Python to a good degree, and sometimes other skills, such as DSP, wireless communication, low-level processor architecture, or something like that.
Make sure your proposal gives us a way of knowing you're capable of doing these things. For code, the best way is to show us to previous projects of yours (e.g., your github page, contributions to other projects, something like that). For more theoretical subjects, a good way is to explain something in your proposal, in your own words.

The works are to be carried out on a section of Hanley's Trinity Street - near the Quality Hotel - between 9.30am and 3pm from Wednesday to Friday.
But it will cause disruption to the 4 and 4A services run by transport giant First Potteries.
A company spokesman said: "Highway maintenance in front of the Quality Hotel will prevent buses from using this section of road.
"Services 4 and 4A will not serve any stops between the junction for Marsh Street and Trinity Street and Potteries Way in each direction."

Verse 1
CONTENTS
Here is a penitential Psalm, penned by David, as the title expresses it, upon a remarkable occasion; in which we trace the sorrowful workings of his soul in a devout humiliation before God.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.
Psalms 51:1
It is worthy our closest observation, in the very opening of this Psalm, and the subject connected with it, that at least nine months had passed by, after David's falling into the foul crimes of adultery and murder before any remorse seems to have taken place in his mind; nay, so far from it, that when Nathan came to him with a message from God, because the man of God veiled his discourse in a parable, David's heart took no alarm, and though alive to punish the man that had taken his neighbor's lamb, never thought of himself having taken his neighbor's wife, and having also caused him to be murdered. Alas! how doth sin harden? 2 Samuel 12:5-7 . We have here the devout actings of the soul, when awakened by grace to a sense of sin: all that we meet with, verse by verse, serves but to show the stirrings of a distressed, conscious, guilty soul, in the recollection of his foul ingratitude to God, and his base dishonesty to man.
Verses 2-3
How beautiful these expressions are, if offered wish reference to Christ's blood as the fountain there opened for sin and for uncleanness. And observe in what true sorrow for sin consists; an unceasing view of sin, and self loathing in consequence thereof.
Verse 4
This is a striking expression: David looks upon the sin as directly levelled against God. He had injured Uriah, injured Bathsheba, injured, in short, everyone that heard the story, in the example he had set; but the great sin was against God. Had be not lost reverence for God, he could not have injured men. David dwells therefore upon this: Against Thee, Thee only, (says he, repeating the words with painful recollection) have I sinned. Here was the sad, sad business. Reader, it is among the truest marks of genuine sorrow, when we detect our sin against the sovereignty of God at every step.
Verses 5-7
He here goes back to the source of all sin, in original depravity! What hyssop shall purge this away, what washing of water will make this clean? Oh! how blessed is it do behold Christ, whose blood alone cleanseth from all sin. 1 John 1:7 .
Verses 8-9
Nothing but a complete pardon can satisfy David. Hide thy face from my sins, heal my bones that are broken by reason of it! What should we do, whither should we fly, were there not a total oblivion for sin, and had not the Lord cast them into the depths of the sea? Oh! the blessedness of redemption by Jesus! Micah 7:18-20 .
Verses 10-12
Pardon alone, without the renewings of the Holy Ghost, will not complete the mercy. Hence, David prays not only to be cleansed, but to be renewed, to be strengthened by the Holy Ghost against any future sins. It is as if David had said, Lord, I see that the want of thy Holy Spirit to restrain those vile affections of mine first led to the sin of adultery, and adultery next led to murder. Lord, I beseech thee, take not thine Holy Spirit from me; take, Lord, whatever else thou art pleased to take, for I deserve nothing but punishment from thee; but, oh! take not thy unspeakable gift, lest I should fall yet more foully. Here, Lord, I must plead! Oh! turn me not away. Reader, there is nothing a child of God dreads so much as the absence of the Comforter. Oh! precious Jesus! remember thy promise, in which thou didst say, He shall abide, with you forever; John 14:16 .
Verse 13
It is a blessed mark of real repentance, when, after our recovery, we do not scruple to tell others of our worthlessness, and the divine goodness in raising us up, thus preaching to others what the Lord hath done for our souls. Reader, think what everlasting preachers to this amount hath Peter, the Apostle, and David the Prophet been. How hath God in mercy over-ruled their fall to his glory and the comfort of thousands. So Jesus bid Peter, when he should be recovered, to strengthen his brethren; Luke 22:32 .
Verses 14-15
Behold, now David's heart is awakened, how the foul sin of murder haunted his guilty conscience!
Verses 16-17
Oh! how much gospel is here: surely David had seen and felt the efficacy of Christ's blood, or he never could have learned to think so lightly of the sacrifices under the law.
Verses 18-19
Observe how the interests of Zion still lay near David's heart. This was the most solemn moment David had ever seen, when one might have thought his own personal sorrows would have swallowed up the consideration of every other. But no: he remembers Zion in his saddest seasons as well as in his greatest joy. Reader, how ought you and I to feel for Zion in her present languishing circumstances?

the Week of Christ the King / Proper 29 / Ordinary 34The liver is a key part of our body and its health matters a lot for the overall function of the body. Therefore, it is essential to know how to keep the liver healthy over a long time. Whatever we eat and drink, it somehow makes an impact on our liver’s health. It is not an apparent body organ so you have to assess its condition through some particular symptoms. At the same time, you should avoid such things that can potentially damage your liver or cause liver cancer. Here are some tips that can help you in maintaining a healthy liver.
Ways to improve Liver Health:
- Understand the function of the liver
It is the liver that converts nutrients from the food we eat into blood components. Moreover, this organ helps in storing vitamins and minerals besides producing important proteins and enzymes needed to maintain hormonal order in the body. The capacity of your immune system depends a lot on the health of your liver. Therefore, try the effective solutions to ensure a healthy and well-functioning liver; it is always essential to maintain good health.
- Understand factors damaging the liver
There are various harmful things for liver health. The most damaging factors include environmental toxins, infectious organisms, smoking, alcohol, and unhealthy or poor diet. If you want to know how to keep liver healthy then take those factors seriously. More exposure to environmental toxins and chemicals can make the condition of your liver worse. The poisonous molecules like heavy metals, benzene, toxic fume, disinfectant byproducts, pesticides, chemical hazards, and cigarette smoke can increase liver inflammation and eventually cause liver cancer, in some cases.
- Take cognizance of chronic infection
You have to be aware of any sort of chronic infection in the body such as influenza, aflatoxin, Lyme, etc. Some organisms such as hepatitis B C are also dangerous to liver’s health. So, get the correct vaccines and medications to combat the attack of such viral diseases.
The liver is a vital organ that persistently filters and detoxifies environmental toxins and pathogenic organisms. The function of this organ cannot be fixed through surgery but improved through natural or home solutions.
- Keep a tab on your weight
Overweight or obesity is not good for the health of your liver. Extra fats pose a risk of liver failure and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). That’s why weight loss is important to reduce liver fat and keep it hale and hearty.
Also Read: 14 Foods Those Are Good and Bad for Your Liver
- Take liver healthy diet
If you want to improve the function of your liver, take diet according to that. Try to avoid saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, sugar, fried or oily items, and carbonated drinks to keep your liver well. Eat plenty of fiber-rich products like oatmeal, nuts, wholegrain, fresh fruits, sweet potato, and cereals. The intake of vegetable oils, fish, nuts, fruits like berries and melons and low-fat milk can reduce the risk of liver cancer.
- Exercise is the key
Exercise improves the liver’s health in many ways. It works by burning extra calories and increasing blood circulation. So, the reduction in liver fat helps it function well.
- Quit smoking
Smoking is one of the most damaging factors for the liver. Other than that, the contact of toxic fume to the liver can harm it. Those who want to care for their liver and remain keen to understand how to keep liver healthy should avoid smoking and illicit drugs like marijuana, cocaine, opium, hallucinogens, inhalants, etc.
- Limit alcohol consumption
Alcohol consumption invites various health problems from liver damage, migraine, blurred vision to skin conditions. The impact of alcohol on the liver is much more severe if you cross the limit. Alcohol drinking in moderate amount is somewhat acceptable.
Some other tips that you should follow for healthy liver include:
- Distress your body
- Regular intake of green tea
- Use coconut oil
- Drink apple cider vinegar
- Intake of nutrients like omega-3s and fatty acidsWhy does so much content miss the mark? Organizations don’t have the proper conversion funnel analysis tools and metrics to determine the topics that engage and drive their audience toward a buying decision. That’s where Ceralytics comes in.

The weekend before the Rocky Mountain 1200, Del invited me to one of the Portland Wheelmen "Torture Series" rides, which seemed like a good opportunity for a final test of my bike before the Rocky Mountain. The ride was fast-paced and challenging, and left both me and my bike feeling unprepared for the 1200.
Aside from severely worn front brake pads, the chain on my Habanero touring bike started skipping every so often under heavy load. Definitely not something I wanted to live with for 750 miles. I made a mental note to check out the chain before leaving for Canada. I opted not to futz with the brakes. Who wants to waste momentum by braking?
So I broke one of the cardinal rules of randonneuring; never make any changes to your bike right before a big ride. I swapped on a new chain Tuesday night, and went to bed without any kind of test ride.
I woke up at 5:00AM, and drove over to Del's house to pick him up. We headed North, miraculously missing both Portland and Seattle rush hour, right before less miraculously missing our freeway exit. Thankfully Del's orienteering skills got us to the Sumas border crossing where we were detained because I matched the description of a felon of some sort. Apparently there are a lot of felons riding bicycles in Canada. After checking my right forearm for tattoos, the border guards let us continue on our way to Kamloops.
We drove up scenic Highway 1 to Kamloops, admiring the scenic Highway 1 the whole way, and arrived at the Kamloops Curling Club at about 3:30 only to see a volunteer desperately motioning us inside. It turns out that checkin closed in a few minutes and we were among the last people to arrive. Yikes! We got our things together quickly, and got checked in. This was decision time. I had to decide where to leave my drop bags. The "safe" approach was Jasper (mile 275) and Golden (mile 506). But I opted for the aggressive approach, sending a drop bag to Beauty Creek (mile 330) and Revelstoke (mile 598). I carefully put my cold weather clothes for alpine riding in one bag, and my warm weather clothes in the other.
I had planned to try to find a moderately paced group to ride with through the night, then head off on my own at daybreak. Instead, I chased down the lead rider and traded fast pulls for about 20 miles, when we were finally caught by another rider, and then a recumbent. The third rider and I dropped my original companion and the recumbent, and sprinted to the control, arriving one minute before it opened. The only mishap was a homicidal semi-truck driver who initially pretended to give us a wide berth, then weaved sharply back into the lane, nearly taking out the rider in front of me. Several riders arrived at the control a few minutes after we did, and reported the same problem with that driver.
The temperature was dropping precipitously at this point, so I took 10 minutes to put on tights and thicker socks.
I lost track of people at the control, and headed out on my own around 2:20. My recumbent friend passed me early on, and we leapfrogged each other for a few miles. Finally I left him behind on a sustained climb, and didn't see him again until the end of the ride. After a few miles I realized that there was nobody else ahead of me to chase down, so I settled into a nice rhythm.
Riding in the dark is really pleasant; it was a cloudless night, and the light from the crescent moon seemed to dance on the water of the river next to the highway. The silence of the night was interrupted only by the occasional rustling in the bushes, the faint clatter of the chain, the whir of wind through the spokes, and the rumbling of the engine of the car that had just swerved into my lane and was driving straight at me at 70mph with his brights on.
I started to feel safer once daybreak hit, and made it to the next control by 06:39. I took a few minutes to eat cookies and take off my tights and warm socks, and hit the road just as the next group of 6 or 7 riders was arriving.
The road to Valemount was fairly forgettable. Miles and miles of rolling hills punctuated by more rolling hills. I was lucky to have a helpful tailwind, though of course we all know that a tailwind on the way out is a headwind on the way back. I hoped that the wind would die off for the second half of the ride. A few miles out of Valemount the temperature started to pick up. I was pleased to see that the control was in an air conditioned building with full food service.
I spent probably 30 minutes at the control eating and hanging out in the air conditioning, and was surprised that no other riders arrived during that time. Apparently most people had stopped at Blue River to eat some breakfast. The volunteers at Valemount were very friendly, and included Susan Barr with whom I rode briefly on last summer's Portland-To-Glacier 1000K. Eventually it was well past time to hit the road again, so I headed toward Jasper.
The cue sheet warned that there were sparse services along this section of the ride, and the sun was baking. 10 miles out or Valemount I turned onto Highway 16, and started the first big climb of the day. "Big" is probably the wrong word to use, but it was a steady 6% for many miles. Hard work for sure, but the view of Mt. Robson at the top made the climb worth it. Mt. Robson is the highest mountain in the Canadian Rockies, and seems to rise thousands of feet out of nothing at all. It was truly breathtaking.
Almost as breathtaking as the speedy descent that followed the climb. I hit a max speed of 52mph on this section, pulling into the middle of my lane to allow a bit more room in case of problems. At the bottom of the descent was one of the few services available on this leg, the Mt. Robson Convenience Store. I stopped in for a cold Orange Soda, but was dismayed to see they didn't have any ice available. So I continued on without filling my water bottles.
Shortly past the stop I hit the second big climb up Yellowhead Pass, as steep as but longer than the first. I started to get really drowsy along this section so I stopped and drank a jolt energy concoction, which claimed to provide 6 hours of energy. Just what I needed! Even with the energy boost I still stopped for a 15 minute roadside nap before finally reaching Jasper at 16:10.
Most riders were going to be stopping at Jasper for the night, but my plans called for riding up to Beauty Creek the first night. That would get me nearly half done with the ride in under 24 hours, well on my way to a successful completion. I ate at Jasper, and left at about 17:00, right as the next group (fellow Oregonians David Rowe, Eric Ahlvin, and honorary Oregonian John Kramer) was pulling in.
The sun was still hot, but the temperatures started to cool as I climbed. And climbed. And climbed. The ride to Beauty Creek was probably the hardest of the entire 1200 for me; after 275 miles I was ready to stop but the steep rollers still had more elevation to give.
After a while your mind starts to play tricks on you. About 30KM from Beauty Creek I realized I was climbing at about 10KM/h, leaving me about 3 hours to get to the control. 10KM later, I was climbing at about 6KM/h, leaving me just over 3 hours to get to the control. Wait a second! I'm not making any progress! I'd alternate between getting out of the saddle and sprinting in my big ring for a few hundred yards to wake up, then slogging along seated in my granny gear. I really, really missed my middle chainring here.
The last couple miles to Beauty Creek seemed to take forever, but then there I was. A couple volunteers commented that they had seen me "flying up the climbs". I guess they drove past when I was sprinting rather than slogging. Anyway the Beauty Creek control was lovely. The volunteers made me several helpings of scrambled eggs and ham, I drank lots of milk, then conked out in a cot at about 22:00, with an 05:00 wakeup time. They were surprised at my late wakeup call, assuming that I'd be riding straight through after an hour or so of sleep.
I woke up a little early at 4:45, and wandered into the kitchen for more eggs and ham. Wow was it cold outside! I decided to put on my cold weather clothes (arm warmers, leg warmers, neoprene socks.. The works), but it turns out I'd sent all those along with my second bag drop to Revelstoke where they would be completely useless. All I had with me were thin tights and a light windbreaker, and the temperature was in the low 30s.
Yikes, but those are the breaks. I did find a fleece hat which I wore under my helmet, and set off into the early dawn at about 5:30.
The road from Jasper to Beauty Creek is called the Ice Field Highway, for good reason. The mountains in the area are littered with small glaciers that once extended to Florida, before the internal combustion engine came along and melted all the glaciers. The road through the glaciers climbed over Sumwapta pass, followed by a wonderful descent to "The Crossing", a restaurant and hotel between Sumwapta and Bow Summit. Shortly after starting the climb up Bow Summit, Eric and John caught me as I was trying to eat a baked potato while riding. They had slept a couple hours at Jasper, then ridden up to Beauty Creek where they slept a couple more hours. They were on the road well before I was, but stopped at the restaurant to warm up. Eventually I climbed away from them, over the top of the pass and down into Lake Louise.
Lake Louise had just had a power outage when I arrived, but I hung around for a while anyway chatting with the volunteers. They had a leader-board on the wall from where I could see I was 9th on the road, with one other 90-hour starter ahead of me (Sophie Matter, a tough lady from France). I left right before a couple other 84-hour folks, but they quickly passed me on the climb up to Castle Junction.
The route followed the scenic Highway 1A to Castle Junction; I wished I had time to stop at the various pullouts along the way as there seemed to be a lot of cool stuff to see. Alas, I was now in mad pursuit of the two 84-hour riders, and could not be distracted with scenery. This was an out-and-back road, and about 5 miles from the control I saw Sophie riding the other direction, so she was probably 30-45 minutes ahead of me. When I reached the control, the two 84-hour riders were getting ready to leave, and I saw that they had a support car. No fair!
The Castle Junction control was staffed by friendly folks and, best of all, had chocolate milk which was woefully missing from the previous controls. I had a cup of chocolate milk and a cup of Coke, then hit the road back toward Lake Louise.
On the way back along Highway 1A I was passed by a couple while I spun up a small hill in my granny gear (once again wishing I had my middle ring). I caught up with them and chatted for a bit about cycling and skiing; the gentleman had actually heard of randonneuring, so he was interested in the route and timeline for the 1200. He gave me directions to Golden ("Turn on Highway 1, and ride for a really long time"), and I left them behind still in pursuit of my 84-hour rabbits.
It's not easy to catch fast riders who are working together, and I could see the two riders off in the distance seemingly always a mile ahead of me. But the descent from Lake Louise past the fascinating Spiral Tunnels to Field was fast and furious, and my superior girth allowed me to make serious time on the duo. At the bottom of the descent they were surprised to see me coast by, and they quickly jumped on my wheel. I later learned that their names were Ian and Holger.
There's an old cycling joke: "What do you call a ride with more than 2 cyclists? A race." and this was no exception. One of the pair later commented that he was looking at his computer as it crept from 40KM/h, to 41KM/h, to 42KM/h, and thinking that he couldn't hold on if it went to 43. This went on for 10-15 miles when Holger flatted and I continued on to Golden on my own.
I arrived to Golden about 10 minutes before Ian and Holger, and wolfed down a couple plates of spaghetti. I'd originally planned on riding through to Revelstoke that night, but it was getting late. However fortunately Ian and Holger had had the same idea, and were willing to let me tag along with them. The three of us had a long stop at Golden, probably 90 minutes, before riding toward the final climb of the day, Rogers Pass.
92 miles can seem like a long way after a hard day's riding, and ending in Revelstoke would make this a 270 mile day for me, with three big passes to climb over. I was worried that I might not be able to hang with Holger and Ian on the climb, but I think I did OK. I had nice chats with each of them; this was Ian's first 1200, but Holger seemed to have done many. Ian had spent some time in Portland working for a wood mill.
I wish I could say that it was all downhill (it certainly looked that way on the profile sheet), but this was a tough ride down. The temperature dropped quite a bit, it was dark, and I was cold and tired. We soldiered on, taking a couple breaks to put on warmer clothes and to fix Ian's broken headlight, and rode into Revelstoke after what seemed like an eternity. It's unfortunate what you miss in the dark. It turns out that we crossed right over the Columbia River, and I never even noticed. The headwaters of the Columbia River are a couple hundred miles from Revelstoke in Columbia Lake.
Holger and Ian had plans to sleep for an hour, and then to high-tail it back to Kamloops for a sub-60 hour time. I had no such aspirations, so asked for a 6:00 wakeup call, and slept very soundly.
6:00 came much earlier than I'd hoped, and I had a leisurly breakfast and got on the bike at about 6:45. I didn't feel terribly energetic; I figured the 150 miles to Kamloops should take me about 10 hours, and I decided to ride easy.
Riding to Enderby was a reminder that kitschy tourist traps aren't unique to the American Midwest. I rode past the "Enchanted Forest", which appeared to be a one-slide amusement park with some fake castle towers around it, and a store that claimed to have a miniature replica of Canada inside. No time to stop and look, though. Enderby was waiting.
At Sicamous I turned onto Highway 97a, and rode some long rollers alongside Shuswap Lake, a resorty area with a lot of cyclists and runners. The day was starting to heat up a little, and as I rode into Enderby I saw a store advertising dozens of ice cream flavors, shakes, and malts. I made a mental note to stop there on my way out of town.
As at most other controls, I stayed too long in Enderby, thanks to the hospitalisty of the volunteers. I finally left about 30 minutes after I arrived, and headed towards the second-to-last control a scant 14 miles away at Salmon Arm, forgetting all about the ice cream parlor I'd seen on the way into town.
They had to shoe me out the door; at 45 minutes, I held the record for the longest stop there. I wish I could have stayed longer!
Whew. The final stretch. There was a torrid downhill from Salmon Arm back to river grade, and then the long 70 mile ride along Highway 1 back to Kamloops. This stretch seemed to go forever, and I found myself wishing I'd left earlier with Ian and Holger so I'd have someone to talk to. It's pretty uncommon that I want to talk to someone, so when it happens you can be sure I'm bored.
Anyway, rode on and on and on. Got hotter and hotter and hotter. Headwind got stronger and stronger and stronger. Kamloops seemed to get further and further away.
And then, just when I thought I'd never get to Kamloops, I still wasn't there. Then finally I was there. It was over. A quick 2-3 mile jaunt through town, and I was back at the curling club where it had all begun. I rolled in with a total time of 68 hours and 15 minutes, about 16 hours better than my time in the 2006 Cascade 1200.I have ADHD. For years this seemed to be a hindrance. Going to college and looking for a conventional career was expected but I always struggled in school. Part of it was not being able to apply my book learning to a real world setting. In 2009 I joined the IBEW electrical apprenticeship program. Finally this gave me the ability to work with my hands and merge the things I learned in the IBEW classroom with the training they gave me on the job. It was great experience. The only thing that I continued to struggle with in this new environment was a pressure to perform at faster pace. Most people don't know this, but ADHD isn't just about a lack of focus. Some people tend to hyper-focus. I was obsessed with doing things the right way, and doing things by the book. The pressure to work fast sometimes got me flustered. Finally, in August of 2017, I decided to try to start my own handyman business. So far it has been a great success. I can finally put my obsessive traits to good use and the home owners that I have worked with have appreciated my attention to detail and my need to be thorough. It has been a very fulfilling, and exhausting experience!Awarded Contracts:

Whether you're backpacking in the winter or heading up a mountainside, sleeping comfortably can raise problems. Luckily, you can find a zero degree F sleeping bag to make even the coldest peaks more hospitable.
Ultra-warm down sleeping bags
Leave the extra sleeping pad and blankets at home. Go winter camping with just your winter sleeping bag and stay toasty all night. The 0°F temperature rating means most people can sleep in these bags comfortably down to 0° Fahrenheit and beyond. A draft collar protects your face from cold hair while a draft tube prevents gusts coming through the zipper. On particularly chilly nights, cinch the drawstring tight around your face for ultimate snug warmth.
These bags offer accessibility to the cold weather campsites you've been longing to visit. When you set up your tent at night, you know you'll stay warm inside. The mummy bag keeps your body heat close. Responsibly sourced goose down provides the insulation to keep you cozy until the morning.
Comfort and convenience for mountaineering trips
Our ultralight bags make for the perfect backpacking sleeping bag. A compression sack and storage stuff sack helps get your bag small enough for your technical pack. The high fill power cuts down on weight and bulk. The slim baffles make the bag easily compressible, leaving room for an extra Campshire fleece in your bag. The unisex design also leaves plenty of room when you lay down at night. Extra girth room in the main body lets you layer up to sleep or "maytag" in the bag. The vaulted foot box gives you space to move your feet or even store some gear.
Iconic The North Face durability
The backcountry isn't gentle to campers. The ripstop fabric of our sleeping bags helps prevent snags and abrasions from rough terrain. You pack a rain coat for rainy weather. For damp ground and dew, our bags are water-resistant and water-repellent to keep you dry, especially with proper care. Your bag is protected by a limited lifetime warranty.
FAQs
What does 0 degree sleeping bag mean?
A zero degree sleeping bag has a temperature rating of 0°F. This means that the average sleeper will stay comfortably warm down to 0° Fahrenheit. The actual temperature you stay comfortable in each bag may vary based on your personal body heat.Yesterday afternoon I managed to find my way into my sewing room and....my husband came along with me! He finally had some time to take a look at my vintage Singer 301a. He took the cover off the top of the machine and greased the gears and then he took the bottom off and greased the required spots in the nether regions of the machine. He also showed me exactly where I was supposed to oil the machine on a regular basis. Once he reviewed all of the oiling spots with me I saw that I was doing a pretty good job on keeping the machine well oiled. I was such a fraidy cat to actually open the machine but once I saw that there wasn't a monster in it I realized how basic these machines really are. I know I can do all the internal oiling and greasing myself! Of course, once the machine was looked after I needed to test it out and I made 12 more Little House blocks. I have been wanting to work on these blocks but for some reason I only want to sew them on this machine. I plan on getting more sewing done today - before I went to bed last night I started pulling out bits of yellow fabric so that I can make some blocks for the Rainbow Scrap Challenge that I hope to have ready to show on Saturday.
Even though I haven't been spending much time sewing or blogging, I am still visiting all of my favourite blogs and keeping up with what everyone is working on. One of the major themes that I find appearing in a lot of blogs is that a lot more time is being spent working/playing outside now that the wonderful warm weather has finally arrived and that is exactly what I have been doing as well. My husband recently had a birthday and my eldest son gave him the gift of time! Adam came home for a couple days and worked hard in the garden along with me and my other son Eric. We all weeded the vegetable patch - I think there were at least 10 weeds/cm - at least it felt and looked that way. The boys did a lot of the heavy work - they emptied the compost bin and dug it all into the garden and Adam helped his Dad take down a dying plum tree - they removed it stump and all. Today, my husband and I will start planting - I know I will be putting in the bean seeds and we have tomatoes, cukes, peppers, beets and zuccini plants ready to go too. At the back of the photo you can barely make out the raspberry bushes and the rhubarb patch. We already have some things growing - they planted themselves and we just left them to grow.

Wow, lots of work getting done at your house! Beautiful little quilt. Good to hear your machine is humming along!
That is some size of veggie bed you have there. Bet you could feed a small army from it ;o) Hard work to get it all prepped and ready to plant but so worth it when you're eating your own produce.
Love the little houses... the finished quilt is going to be gorgeous.
Hugs
Hi Ellen,
it's wonderful that your son helped you gardening. Spring is the time you had to have more than 10 hands to do all the things.
Your houses are gorgeous. I love the red doors very much. I hope I can start building houses when I'll be retired in July. I think it's a wonderful work doing in the garden.
Have a nice week and take care
Roswitha
Hi Ellen
I really love your little houses. I want one too! I really hope to make a little house quilt too. Thanks for the rhubarb. Love sis
Cute houses as always and that is some serious veggie patch! Happy planting!

Boat and life jackets belonging to refugees in Lesvos, Greece. Photo: jdblack / Pixabay.
Greece is planning to build a floating barrier in the Aegean Sea to prevent refugees reaching its islands from Turkey.
The 1.7 mile, $550,000 project, will be made of netting and flashing lights and is aimed at “containing the increasing inflows of migrants” on the Greek islands.
The barrier will be built north of the island of Lesbos where migrants often attempt to cross due to the short stretch of water.
The plan is part of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotkis’ tough, expanding, immigration policy which has included employing 1,200 extra border police.
Greece is a transit point through which thousands of refugees attempt to get to the EU from Turkey.

Yeej :-)
Congrats on getting this done! Would you write a blog about this adventure? 🙂— Chuy Varela (@chuy_varela_) June 12, 2020
But as you can imagine, it didn't go without a fight (or 2, or maybe more), so I thought it would probably be good to share my experiences so you don't fall in the same traps as I did.
Use case
At Van Lanschot Kempen, we are doing daily refreshes of the corporate DWH, connected datamarts and extraction marts after that, all on-premises. Then the Power BI data models are refreshed on a time trigger (say 10 AM) to refresh the data from the datamart to Power BI. We would like that dataset refresh to be event-based. So whenever the datamart is refreshed, immediately refresh the corresponding Power BI dataset.
Setup
To get this working I've used the greatest part of this post How To Trigger A Power BI Dataset Refresh Using An Azure Data Factory Web Activity by Dave Ruijter (blog | @DaveRuijter). Although that's aimed at Azure Data Factory, most of the (setup) steps still apply to my scenario. But as you will see, others don't :-)
Permissions
At my company, I am the Power BI Service Administrator (and Power Platform Admin), so I have sufficient rights in the Power BI Admin Portal, but not in Office 365. So I needed the help of other colleagues who do have these rights.
Make sure that you have the right people aligned, or at least know where to go in case you need anything, before you start.
Steps taken
I'll outline the steps I took here to have a complete list of things I did to accomplish my setup. Again, for detailed explanations per step please visit Dave's blog post:
- Create a Service Principal and also create a secret with that
- Create an Azure Active Directory (AAD) group and add the Service Principal from Step 1
- Enable the tenant setting for Service Principals and add the group from Step 2
- Create a (V2!) Power BI workspace (or use an existing one)
- Add the Service Principal as an Admin to the workspace
- Use PowerShell to refresh a dataset
I think Step 6 actually deserves a chapter of its own, while it looks so easy afterwards, I think I struggled with this for more than 20 hours over a few weeks time.
Especially because Dave's setup uses ADF, the authentication to the REST API threw me off..
You can also get the code from my Github page.
As evidence, I also queried the REST API to show the refresh history :)
Next steps
At this time I do have a working solution, executing the script manually, with my secret in plain text. So there are still a few things to have a look at, which I haven't had the time for yet unfortunately:
- Add the PowerShell script to a SQL Agent Job step, which is the specific use case for me
- Make the solution secure, so don't save sensitive data inside the script or on a server
- One option is to use parameters in SSIS as Brett Powell explains in his post
- I'd like to investigate if I can use the Azure Key Vault from a SQL Agent Job and store the secret there, I'll probably have to authenticate to the Key Vault with the Agent user running the job
- Incorporate the success of the refresh itself into the solution as a step, so I can take action if it fails
Let me know if you have any comments, or know how to improve certain steps of this process :)

I have been married to my husband Steve since 1988. Our children Steven, Christopher and wife Daniela, and Kevin are the center of our world. We have our first grandson Luke due on October 16th and are beyond words excited. I am employed at Seven Springs Golf & Country Club as the controller and have worked there for 40+ years. To be the Grand Advisor to the Maids of Athena is a dream come true. I have the opportunity to work with and support the young women of our future. I also get to be a part of the dynamic group of Sisters on the Grand Lodge; the best of both worlds! I am excited about the journey and look forward to working together with all of you.

Patty DidikThe liberal push to "pack" the Supreme Court with more justices was always much more likely to be an exercise in catharsis than actual reform. And that became even clearer last week, when President Joe Biden's Supreme Court reform commission - the commission spurred by those calls for court-packing - took a rather dim view of the idea.
But even as that court-packing ship has increasingly sailed, the commission highlighted some other ideas that make a lot more sense for those truly interested in realistic reforms. And a new poll reinforces just how practical and consensus one of them could be.Shop Here

I believe in setting goals; one of the lessons I’ve learned in life is that if we aim for nothing.. we’ll get it. I’ll never forget one morning, when I was about 13. It was the opening morning of duck season, and
I was alone in a slew (that’s wetlands for anyone who did not grow up in South Dakota — thank tall grasses, reeds, and little pockets of water.) patiently waiting for the ducks to start flying in.
I shouldn’t say I was patiently waiting, actually I was quite impatient. So I began playing with my gun — a single shot with a hammer. Yep I was playing with the hammer, pulling it back, letting it click into place, releasing it, pulling it back. One time I forget to release it, and left it cocked; forgot it was cocked and a moment or two later, pulled the trigger. The gun roared, and scared the.. whatever out of me as the gun went flying through the air to land about 20 feet behind me. My heart quit beating. Dad was too far away to see what had happened, he just heard the shot. But I have a sneaking suspicion he knew
what had happened as he hollered out in his deep voice, “Did you get it Dan? Did you get it?” There was no “it” to get, but I guess you could say I got what I was aiming at — nothing.
Doesn’t matter what area of life we’re talking about; career, family, spirituality, finances, sports, church, school; aim at nothing and that’s what we’ll get. So if we want to experience Kingdom success, it would be wise to ask ourselves, “What’s the goal? What’s lined up in the sights of Jesus-followers?
What is the mission? What are we aiming at? This life that we seek is a life from the heart.
I don’t mean it’s just an emotional, touchy, feely kinda life. It may be emotional, it will be experiential, but the reality is it will be more…for our heart Prov. 4:23 says is the very wellspring of life…anything that makes life worth living flows out of your deep heart.
So for what kind of heart are you aiming? Make it practical and specific. I want to lie 50% less. I want to do 6 good deeds for my neighbor. I want to quit worrying about my ______________. I want to be more generous so I will _____________.
Oh yeah — and maybe this is for a different blog. The most vital part of your goal setting process might simply be to figure out what you will STOP aiming at.
ProfileWe get off the train in Simperofol, and take a bus towards Kazantip. The moment we're out of the terminal, the driver stops and picks up a new passenger in what is certainly a pre-arranged plan to bypass the full fare, a way for the driver to augment his meager income. Along the way, he picks up several more paying hitchhikers- common in the Ukraine.
There's almost no civilization over the two hour ride, just vast expanses of flat, largely barren ground. It's hot outside, so I purchase three ice creams at a stop, and try to gift them to my new friends Viktoriia and Dmytro, but they refuse the sugar. I'm not eating three of these ...
I hand one off to the cliche fat guy sitting next to them, and start scanning for another worthy candidate. I spot a small boy 50 feet away whom I walk to. He shakes his head at the offer.
What? Seriously?
The ice cream cost a dollar, and given that Ukrainians earn $500 a month, this likely isn't an everyday treat. I return and relate my surprise to Dmytro who opens his eyes wide, and warns that someone is going to call the cops on me. I guess it's been awhile since I wasn't allowed to take candy from a stranger. I sit down for a moment and ponder what to do with my rapidly melting gift.
My answer approaches, it's the little boy nodding his head excitedly, extending his hand; he smiles enthusiastically as he walks away with his treat.
Minutes later, like any narcissist, I check in on my work and observe the boy sharing the ice cream with his sister. I smile at his parents who nod back. There will be no police line-up today.
Kazantip- not exactly on the map
At last we arrive in Kazantip, located on the Black Sea in the Crimean Peninsula of the Ukraine, in the center of the middle of nowhere. Surrounding Kazantip (which technically is just a large gated party area on the beach) are two tiny towns and then a vast void of nothingness for a fifty mile plus radius.
The woman who owns the small apartment building we're staying in, its tiny rooms essentially just a bed and bathroom, explains that all money is made during the summer months, the rest of the year the area is a complete ghost town. She makes enough during the summer, she tells me, to be able to to hibernate through the winter.
The rooms rent for $25-$35 a night (depending on if you have AC) and go up in price when the party in Kazantip really kicks into gear. They'll also be happy to cook for you, and meals are very reasonably priced, the food fresh, grown locally, and all organic; farmers here can't afford pesticides. Thank God right.
(I'm also introduced to a Ukrainian beverage called "kvass." Learn a little about in this video.)
The people here are much friendlier than Kiev. The waitress who served me was absolutely elated when I taught her how to say, "Enjoy your meal," in English. Every time she served me over my week long stay she would proudly use the phrase and walk away with a huge smile on her face.
(just see how desolate my surroundings are, as I explore the area)
Communistic Storefront
The grocery store of the neighboring town is managed like a relic of Communist Times, a model of complete inefficiency. You wait in line, and when you finally make to the front, you tell the clerks what it is you desire, they go and get it for you, then come back to the counter and ring it up. Five people in line ahead of me buying less than five items each, and I waited 15 minutes just to purchase a bottle of water. Only one line of course. In fairness, they don't call it "the express."
The only logical reason for this set-up that I could think is how common theft appears to be in the Ukraine, and this is an attempt by the shop to combat it.
I'll tell you this, leave something out in the Ukraine, kiss it good-bye. Left a bottle of water atop my suitcase lugging it around Simerafopol, come back two minutes later, I'm going thirsty. Leave my flip-flops beside some other shoes while I run on the beach, come back, and have to walk barefoot back to my lodgings.
My strategy for purchasing anything in the Ukraine was to put whatever I was buying on the counter, or point to what I needed, let them tell me in Ukrainian how much I owed, nod my head as if I understood, pull some money out of my pocket and pray they gave correct change. At no point should you open your mouth. The moment they realize you're American, here comes the surcharge.
Clean and Beautiful
The weather is warm, and the sea refreshing, the water an almost tropical blue and surprisingly clean and translucent. Being out in the middle of nowhere, there is zero pollution and the sky is crystal clear. This isn't a beach of Southern Thailand, but it's far nicer than I expected.
Mozzie Magnet
I go at sundown to meditate on the beach, which is normally a great plan in Los Angeles, but not the best idea here. Within two minutes I've been viciously attacked, and am left with what I consider to be massive injuries- twelve mosquito bites. I beat Usain Bolt back to the motel.
My whole body is in utter despair, I don't have enough hands to scratch where I need. It gnaws at my mind which I feel like tearing out of my skull so I won't feel the burning itching sensation over every square inch of my body. There is absolutely no relief from this. I'm in the center of the middle of nowhere, surrounded by an army of mosquitoes, and no way out. I wonder what drew me all the way out here begin with. I must be insane.
Dmytro sees me scratching. "Don't you know how active mosquitoes here are at dusk? Everyone hides til it gets dark. Only an idiot goes to the beach at this hour. Didn't you wonder why you were the only one out there?" He leaves shaking his head.
I think about what he's said and look at the bright side. At least 'idiot' is a big step above insanity. I feel a little relieved. An encouraging word can do wonders now and then. Thanks Dmytro!

Conditions have moved into neutral territory but a nice little 1400 foot ranch style came up a few days ago and got four competing offers within a day or two. This house is situated right in the thick of the hot spot in the market at around 300k. Clean and tidy, doesn't need a lot of work, move right in. These are the properties that are selling, these are the types that still get multiple offers.
Although buyers in general are taking their time, these types of move in ready sub-median homes are hard to find, and when a nice one pops on the MLS the Realtors® swarm about. Buyers looking for a "deal" will need to look at properties with some special needs. Light fixers are not getting snatched up lie they were at this time last year.
Sellers are wise to spend a few pre-sale dollars to spiff up the house before listing it. Fresh paint and a minimalist look inside will go a long ways in this market. Sellers however ought to be careful not to overspend or over improve their home. One should never be too much better than the rest of the homes in the neighborhood. That is sound advice in any market.
The market continues to favor one level homes or master on the main and tidy homes with a bright look and feel as well as tidy and well kept. These are the properties do the best.
Although most listings are likely to sit around for a few weeks, properties that hit the "spot". Clean, well kept, light and bright, open and minimalist decor, under the median will go quick.tag.wordaligned.org

Approaching typhoon Saola causes event cancellations
Organizers are cancelling many events scheduled for the weekend, as it’s possible that typhoon Saola, the 22nd typhoon of the season, will come close to Okinawa Main Island this weekend.
The “Okinawa Industry Festival”, one of the most popular events of the year that had 240,000 visitors last year, is cancelled for all three days scheduled.
Some events that were moved from last weekend because of typhoon Lan, and now organizers are facing a dilemma whether to move them again or cancel altogether.
The “Karate Day Anniversary Performance Festival” was scheduled for Oct. 29th on Kokusai Street in Naha. The event that is sponsored by Okinawa Prefecture is expected to gather more than 2,000 karate practitioners to perform on the street in unison. Organizers say they will wait until Friday to decide whether the event is on or cancelled.News & Events

STEM outreach collaboration with East Upper School to Launch
The Department of Biology launched our STEM outreach collaboration with East Upper School on April 26th with a visit by Mr. Cebrahil Gurler-Carrasquillo’s 9th grade living environment class. Cebrahil was a 2014 U of R graduate.
The centerpiece of the visit was an evolutionary biology laboratory on cold adaptation among Drosophila species. The students discovered that flies that were adapted to cooler climates recovered from cold faster than those from warmer environments. An innovative aspect of the lab was a virtual fly collecting expedition using the spectacular Vista Collaboratory in Carlson Library. Using this curved 20 ft by 8 ft high-resolution video screen, the students navigated the globe by Google Earth. The students traveled to collecting sites in Iceland, France, and Africa, taking time off to visit tourist sites like the Eifel Tower and a soccer game at the Mandela National Stadium in Uganda. As we “took off” from Rochester International Airport one student reported feeling airsick! After the expedition the students entered the lab and assessed the cold tolerance of six fly species. The students stayed focused and exhibited great energy and determination.
The visit was organized by David Goldfarb, Co-Chair of the biology department’s Community Outreach Committee, and was the culmination of many people’s voluntary efforts. Kristin Kelly, teaching lab manager, was responsible for preparing all aspects of the lab, including culturing the flies, setting up the microscopes and other equipment and tools. Our Chair, John Jaenike, gave an introductory lecture, and Bob Minckley, who is Mr. Cool to these students, directed the two-hour lab. Georgina Kessie, a U of R senior, served as TA. The Vista Collaboratory experience was coordinated by Brendan Mort, CIRT Director.
After the lab the students enjoyed a pizza lunch in Wilson Commons and a tour of the campus by two Meridian Society guides, administrated by Kim Crosby in Admissions.
Our efforts to enhance STEM education at East have been supported by Michael Occhino, Director of Science Education at the Warner School of Education.

Straight Brazilian weave must be taken care in a proper way so it can stay in its original shape for a long time. In order to maintain the weave perfectly you must follow a particular technique. You must give same preference that is given to a natural hair. Here are few things that can help to maintain the hair weave.
Try to wash your hair weave once in a week and use dry shampoo during this process. Use the moisturizing hair conditioner immediately after using the shampoo on your hair and make sure to deep condition the entire hair once in two weeks. Avoid using heat styling tools while drying the hair as it can cause damage to the hair weave. You can just blot the hair using a normal cloth without putting any pressure over the hair. Purchase the hair products that are used on the straight Brazilian weave after consulting a hair specialist and there are particular hairstyling products that are available for such hair weaves. Use wide-toothed hair brush to comb the hair and do this after creating sections in your hair. The hair weave can be styled as per your wish, but don’t strain it too much with hairstyling tools. You can use a curling iron or rollers to create different styles in your hair, but make sure to deep condition the hair on regular basis. This will help to keep the weave in perfect shape for a longer time.

Prince William and Kate Middleton's incredible love story in 25 sweet photosIt is always good when you have a purpose for any journey, and on 19th April 2019, I set off on a 47-day journey to sail around the British coast in an anti-clockwise circumnavigation in a single journey in a 46-foot sailing yacht named Tonic.
The journey started (and finished) at Chatham Maritime Marina and was on an "adventure sailing" trip with Elite Sailing who is based in Chatham.
The trip was split into six legs, each had an instructor from Elite sailing and various customers who joined the yacht as crew. Each member of the crew would take part in all of the daily day activities which included: planning, sailing, navigation, cooking, cleaning, and many other associated tasks.
Although there was the instructor on board, the crew had the opportunity to skipper the yacht, during which time they planned the route for the journey along with the organisation of the watches, and all sailing and organisational duties. Not everyone decided to take up this role, but I did so on about a dozen passages which totaled over 500 miles and included some quite long sections including Lowestoft to Whitby, Stromness to the Summer Isles, Islay to Bangor (Northern Ireland), etc. This was worthwhile and I am pleased that I volunteered for these.
Tonic was reasonably sized at 46 feet in length, The number of crew varied from 5 to 7, and people joined for various legs ranging from a single leg through to the complete 7 week trip around Britain.
The yacht in which I sailed around Britain is named "Tonic" and is owned by Elite Sailing based at Chatham Maritime Marina. it is their largest yacht which they use for their "adventure sailing" program. The boat is 46 feet in length and was manufactured by Bavaria Yachts. She had plenty of room for the professional skipper/instructor from Elite and crew, which ranged from 5 to 7 additional people.
In general, terms, the longer the yacht is at her waterline, the faster she will sail. Tonic was certainly fairly nippy, and it was fairly easy to average over 7 nautical miles per hour almost all of the time, indeed it was not uncommon for this to rise to over 10 nautical miles per hour on occasions.

.
There isn't a lot of conversation between Kamo Zandinan, 40, and the 10-year-old girl she believes is her lost daughter. The girl, believed to have been kidnapped by ISIS when she was 4, was raised by an Arab family. Zandinan, who is Yazidi, speaks only rudimentary Arabic — learned when she was forced to live among ISIS fighters who enslaved her in Syria six years ago.
Zandinan is sure that the girl, found in Mosul in March, is her daughter Sonya. The girl, until now, has only known herself as an Arab named Noor.
A DNA test will confirm whether there's a match.
"God willing, we will get the results soon and you will have the best daughter," orphanage director Amal Zaki Abdullah tells Zandinan. She assures her that the girl is quiet and well-behaved. "Reunions make us very happy," she says. "God only knows what misery and sadness they have been through."
Abdullah urges the girl to tell Zandinan about her art classes. In a soft voice, she reports she has drawn "flowers, a panda and a house."
So far, this orphanage, currently home to 21 children, has reunited three other Yazidi children kidnapped by ISIS with their families. It posts photos of the children on Facebook and on local television, and follows up withDNA tests for possible relatives who come forward.
Zandinan examines the girl's arm, looking for a small scar from a minor injury from a time when her family was intact before ISIS entered their Sinjar region of northern Iraq.
In the summer of 2014, she was a mother of six with a seventh on the way. Her husband Khalil was an Iraqi soldier.
ISIS roared into Iraq and Syria that August, slaughtering almost everyone who opposed it. The group declared members of the ancient Yazidi religious minority infidels and embarked on a campaign of genocide. ISIS killed Yazidi men, enslaved women and kidnapped children, seeking to erase their Yazidi identity.
Several thousand Yazidis were believed to have been killed and more than 6,000 women and children were captured after Kurdish forces in charge of security withdrew. To this day, almost 3,000 Yazidis remain missing.
Zandinan's husband and eldest son were taken away; she believes they were shot. ISIS fighters also took two of her daughters — Suzan, 13, and Sonya, 4 — ripping the younger girl screaming from her arms.
Zandinan and her four remaining children, then ranging in age from 3 years old to teenagers, were resettled in Canada as refugees three years ago. There, in March, she saw a Facebook photo sent by relatives, showing a girl found by Iraqi police in Mosul, rescued from an Arab family. Police have occasionally found Yazidi children as they look for ISIS fighters.
This child had Zandinan's distinctive nose and the scar that her mother says she recognized.
A Canadian refugee resettlement organization agreed to pay for her ticket to return to Iraq. After pandemic restrictions eased in October, Zandinan flew to Baghdad with her two youngest children — 6- and 8-year-old boys — for DNA tests to help determine whether the girl in the photo was hers. Two weeks after they arrived, the family gave more blood samples to try to identify Zandinan's husband and eldest son Sufian from the remains exhumed from mass graves in Sinjar, filled with ISIS victims.
Her young sons, who now speak English better than their native language, don't remember their father or eldest sibling. To them, Iraq is just the country they come from.
Like many Yazidi girls from poor families, Zandinan never went to school. Her first classes of any kind were the English lessons she took after she arrived in Canada.
The prospect of having her daughter back — she has no doubt of it — fills her with joy. But returning to Iraq has been difficult.
"Hard, hard, hard," she says in her rudimentary English when asked what it was like to see her empty house and deserted village for the first time since ISIS overran it.
Zandinan says in 2014, the family twice made it to safety on Sinjar Mountain, where hundreds of Yazidis escaped ISIS. The first time, they received a warning from ISIS that if they didn't return to their village, the fighters would kill all the young men still left there.
The second time, a trusted Arab friend persuaded the family to go back to their village and stay.
"He betrayed us," she says in Kurmanji, which is spoken by Yazidis in Sinjar. "He told us, 'Don't go, I will help you and bring you food and I won't let anyone touch us.' So we returned and ISIS took us — we were more than 10 families."
A few weeks after she and her family were captured and taken to the Iraqi city of Tel Afar, Zandinan gave birth in the house they were held in. Then, at gunpoint, ISIS took away her husband and eldest son.
"We knew they would separate us," she says. "The only thing we wanted is to finish another day together — we never knew when it was going to happen."
That was the day she lost Sonya too.
"The same day they took my husband and son, they gathered all of us in the yard," she says. "They were going to kill all of us, but they sold some of us instead."
Zandinan says her daughter Suzan, taken from her a few days later, was known for being unusually pretty, with delicate features and a heart-shaped face.
"I told them she is sick, but they tore her clothes in front of me," says Zandinan. "It was so difficult to see her in that situation ... We were holding onto each other but they beat me with a stick and she fell on the ground and I couldn't do anything."
"Suzan was crying and screaming, saying, 'Mother, don't leave me!'" Zandinan recalls, tears running down her face.
ISIS took Zandinan and her remaining children to the Syrian city of Raqqa, where she was bought and sold by a succession of ISIS fighters, including a Syrian and a Western fighter. She says some of the fighters beat the children. She tried to escape three times before relatives in Iraq managed to borrow money to pay smugglers to rescue her.
ISIS was defeated in Mosul, the capital of its self-declared caliphate, in a 2017 battle that flattened entire sections of the city. Iraqi forces are now firmly in charge, but most Yazidis are still afraid to go back.
Making the four-hour trip to the orphanage from a camp for displaced Yazidis where Zandinan stays depends on getting a ride or borrowing money for transportation. Her journey to Iraq this year has meant not only navigating the city where so many Yazidis were enslaved and suffered, but also trying to navigate the court system.
On the October day when she visited the Mosul orphanage, Zandinan also went to court to give power of attorney to her cousin, a shepherd, in case she had to return to Canada to care for her other children. The judge — seemingly unaware of what had happened to thousands of Yazidi women under ISIS — asked her why she spoke Arabic with a Syrian accent.
Three years after ISIS was defeated, thousands of Yazidi women and children remain missing. Some, enslaved and held by ISIS fighters, are believed to have been killed in battles across northern Iraq and Syria. But hundreds of others are thought to be living still with the families of ISIS members.
The younger children among them have forgotten they are Yazidi, if they ever knew it at all. There is no systematic effort by Iraqi authorities to screen children in camps housing displaced families who include ISIS members' relatives.
Zandinan believes Suzan is still alive — living with an ISIS family like Sonya was, perhaps even still in Mosul.
"If there was serious help, I could find her," she says. "I don't know where she is, but my heart tells me she never left Iraq."

JeffI barely have time to blog anymore. It isn't because it's summer and my children demand my attention. Oh no, my little guy is off at camp and my darling princess is happy to sleep until 10 am each morning.
No, the demand on my time is not currently originating with my duo, but with the social media. It is pulling and tugging at me and I feel as if I am giving in and sinking deeper into the abyss.
This is how it started.
I decided one day to blog. Yea me! It felt a little narcissistic to start putting my thoughts out there for all to see, but I enjoy it so I continue {narcissism notwithstanding}.
Next, it was time to join some blogging communities. I needed to find and connect with other bloggers. So I joined BlogFrog. I created a community there and joined hundreds of other. A million of my blogging questions were answered by the friendly bloggers who participate in those forums. The time I spent there in my early blogging months were priceless. That too is were I found the SITS Girls -- an invaluable resource and community.
I blogged along for months with no further progress. I was comfortable in my little bloggy corner of the world. I didn't long for thousands of followers for heaven's sake. I just wanted to write. And receive a little feedback from time to time.
It was about this time that darling Liz from a Belle, a Bean & a Chicago Dog insisted {it was not a subtle suggestion} that I get on Twitter. I resisted. I procrastinated. And then, I took the leap and started tweeting. Twitter is indeed an entire universe all to itself. It can be a great resource when you need a quick answer to a question. It can provide an amazing group of loyal and devoted friends or readers. It is quite clearly the epicenter of all social media.
While on Twitter I've learned a great deal more about bloggy business and all I an NOT doing to promote my blog. I am not guest posting. Nor have I asked anyone to guest post {can you say "control issues?"}. I do not join most linky-posts {I am simply not good at preparing a post in advance - I'm a fly by the seat of my pants type blogger}. I have never written {and have no plans to write} an ebook. I no longer actively participate in blogging communities {lazy blogger}. Quite simply, I find the task of writing my own blog posts, reading and commenting on others enough to fill the free time I have in my days.
But more is required. It is no longer sufficient to just comment on a few {or a few hundred} blog posts each day. Additional obligations are mounting. The world of social media is expanding. And the time has come: sink or swim.
And swimming inevitably means I partake in a litany of social media outlets:
I need to start retweeting posts {I think I've done that - once}.
I really need to Stumble and be Stumbled.
Clearly, I must "Share" it {or is it "Like" it} on Facebook.
I need to give it a K+ on Klout.
Somehow Google +1 it.
Share it on Linkedin.
Submit it or somehow make it Delicious?!
Recommend it to Mashable.
And possibly Digg it?!
In addition, I need to engage bloggers in my BlogFrog Community. Of course, in order to do so I need to meaningfully participate in others. I should submit posts for syndication on BlogHer. I must comment daily at the SITS Girls in order to obtain the ultimate prize: Featured Blogger!! I should probably create a QR code and embed cool features on my blog. And don't even get me started on my need to Vlog!
Truly.
It's getting out of hand.
And the list seems to grow every day.
Can't I just blog and occasionally tweet?!?
I now long for the good old days when blogging and tweeting were enough. Were there such good old days or was my ignorance just bliss?
What social media outlets do you use most consistently? And where do you draw the line?

Love this! Was just contemplating this recently. After only blogging for 5 months I am still learning new stuff everyday and it seems you could never have enough time to absorb and promote all you would like. ( even without 4 kids, another on the way & working 2 days a week!)
Same thoughts. It is overwhelming. I don't have time for it all any longer. Great timing on this.
Leigh
Ack! It can get totally overwhelming. I think it's best to pick a few and really focus on those, rather than try to do them all. It's impossible to do them all anyway!
Just do what you want with social media. Your blog will grow according to the effort you put into it so you decide.It's Black Friday Weekend! See All Deals Here.

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK — Most visitors coming from foggy San Francisco welcome the intense late-July heat and sunshine here as they stroll or cycle through the lowlands and along the ambling Merced River. But to year-round inhabitants — both human (park employees) and nonhuman — the warmth is starting to wear out its welcome.
“Yosemite’s temperatures are on the extreme warm end of the spectrum,” said William Monahan, an ecologist who works for the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Division and co-wrote a report that analyzed climate variables (including temperature, precipitation, frost and cloud cover) in 289 national parks, dating back to 1901. “Temperatures over the last 10 to 30 years exceed 95 percent of the historic range of high temperatures it has experienced.”
The iconic California park is not alone. While precipitation patterns varied across the country, temperatures at roughly 80 percent of the national parks analyzed have been well above historic norms — not just for annual mean temperature, but also minimum temperature in the coldest month and mean temperature in the warmest quarter.
Monahan said that the study focuses on the past 10 to 30 years because that range “captures natural climate cycles” and is also long enough to account for the general time frames over which the National Park Service implements resource-management plans. His hope is that the report will “lay a foundation for quantifying and understanding the effects of climate change” and then identify ways to respond to the changes.
In addition to the straight-brimmed, government-issue straw Stetson, Sarah Stock wears many hats at Yosemite National Park. Against a backdrop of cackling stellar jays, with a doe and her suckling fawns in the near distance, she says, “I am the park ornithologist. I also oversee the mammal program. So, day to day, I am coordinating different bird and mammal program studies in the park. That ranges from songbird studies to bighorn sheep.”
As she oversees these studies and considers the resulting data, Stock tracks population density, species richness (the number of species in a given ecological community) and abundance of focal species. “I’m looking for changes in pattern … and distribution across a landscape, at different elevations, and then looking for changes and asking why those changes may be happening.”
She is detecting changes that are tied to two broad factors: increasingly severe, hot wildland fires and variations in snowpack depths.
Wildfires are a constant threat to Yosemite, especially amid the drought. Two current blazes erupted in late July. The 4,600-acre El Portal fire, just outside park boundaries, forced evacuations and destroyed at least two homes, while the Dark Hole fire threatened a grove of giant sequoias inside the park. But thus far these two are tiny compared with last summer’s Rim fire, which burned 77,000 acres within Yosemite (and 257,000 acres, total, over the course of three months, making it the third largest in California history). Rangers are now studying how the fire affected great-gray-owl habitat (the park constitutes the bird’s southernmost range and is home to two-thirds the population of this California state endangered species).
Great gray owls nest in tree snags, which is a tree that is dead or dying, but still standing. Forest fires often create snags, but the Rim fire burned so hot through the owl’s habitat that it incinerated most trees. “We are not detecting great gray owls at as many sites as before the fire,” Stock said, noting that 20 percent of the bird’s nesting habitat in the park fell within the fire’s footprint. It’s not just the loss of habitat that has eroded the owl’s habitat. Its main prey, the meadow vole, does not burrow and therefore could not escape the fire as it raged through that portion of the park, she explained.
“With predictions of more frequent, hotter fires, it means that great gray owls might not be able to come back to these areas under the present climate scenario,” Stock said.
Not all the changing patterns in the park are negative — or, at least, they do not all pose and immediate threat.
In partnership with the Institute for Bird Populations, Yosemite rangers have been conducting songbird studies since 1990. They involve capturing birds with mist nets, a fine nylon web used to safely capture and collect birds, and placing small bands on their legs to identify and track their activity thereafter. “Each one of our stations is at a different elevation gradient, from 4,000 to 8,000 feet, so every 1,000 feet we have a station,” said Stock. “A couple years ago, our collaborator looked at the data in relation to snowpack and found a correlation. In years with diminished snowpack, we are seeing higher productivity, which suggests a positive trend.”
Productivity is a measurement of young birds in relation to older birds — the more young birds you get the better, and the more "productive," the species. Should snowpacks continue to shrink, however, this near-term gain could turn into loss for the birds, due to a threshold after which low snowpack will begin to harm the populations of insects that the birds rely on for food, and the flora they need for shelter. “This is the third drought year in a row and if we continue to have dry years, we’re probably going to come right up against that threshold,” said Stock.
The challenges of responding to these types of changing patterns — not just in Yosemite but across all public lands — are myriad and daunting. One key is to find existing areas in the landscape, such as regions with consistent water resources and biodiversity, that offer benefits across species. Toward that end, Stock, Monahan and other scientists are studying ways to identify and promote “refugia,” which are naturally occurring landscape features that protect or promote not just one but a range of plant and animal species that might be endangered by rising temperature trends, water scarcity or some other stressor.
Land managers could take action to improve refugia for the benefit of target species, such as limiting non-native species to reduce competition for food. They will also study elevation and latitude, as new research shows that due to climate change and habitat loss, up to one-quarter of the total area of the U.S. National Park System is vulnerable to vegetation shifting up slope and northward.
Unfortunately, park managers lack a clear strategy to lessen harm from another change afoot in Yosemite: melting glaciers. Park geologist Greg Stock (Sarah’s husband) says the two remaining glaciers in the park are less than half the size they were back in 1883, the date of their earliest detailed records. One of the two glaciers, the Lyell, has been losing so much ice each year that it no longer moves downhill. The rapidity with which the Lyell is shrinking is important because the glacier contributes to the Tuolumne River headwaters during summer months, well after other sources in the headwaters grow dry.
“In dry years like this, there is very little water in the Tuolumne River except for at the edge of the glacier — it is a reliable source of water,” Greg Stock explained. It’s not just wildlife that relies on those headwaters during late summer months. The flow is also important to the many backpackers who trek into Yosemite’s famous Tuolumne Meadows.
“We’re attributing the melting glaciers primarily to warming summertime temperatures,” he said. Based on climate models, he thinks both of Yosemite’s remaining glaciers could disappear within 50 years.
Yosemite National Park is celebrating its 150th birthday this year. On its 200th birthday, the Half Dome and El Capitan peaks — features formed, Stock noted, by glaciers — will still make Yosemite a majestic, awe-inspiring valley. But the toll another half-century of extreme heat and diminishing snowpacks could take on the park’s ecosystems is unknown.
Both Sarah and Greg Stock field more climate-related questions from the visitors to the park today, compared with when they started working here eight years ago.
“Sometimes people say, ‘Well, yeah, the glaciers are retreating. So what? They grow and shrink with time naturally,’” said Greg Stock. “And that is true, of course. There are no longer 2,000 feet of [glacial] ice in Yosemite Valley. But those cycles of advance and retreat, in that past, had been driven by a certain set of things. We’ve added [greenhouse gas emissions, chiefly carbon dioxide] to that. There is not a big leap of logic to connect the higher CO2 in our atmosphere with the shrinking of these glaciers.”
Impacts such as owl-habitat loss or fluctuating songbird populations are likely hard for park visitors to internalize, but melting glaciers — even though they’re far in the backcountry and invisible to most visitors — is something visitors respond to viscerally.
Sarah Stock said talking to park visitors about climate is important, even when debates emerge. “Each person can have their own interpretation, but mine is based on what we’re seeing with data. The data are right,” she said with a smile.

“Co-songwriter Burt Bacharach revealed in his 2014 autobiography that this song had among the most difficult lyrics Hal David ever wrote, despite being deceptively simple as a pop hit. He explained that they had the main melody and chorus written back in 1962, centering around a waltz tempo, but it took another two years for David to finally come up with the lyric, ‘Lord, we don’t need another mountain.’ Once David worked out the verses, Bacharach said the song essentially ‘wrote itself’ and they finished it in a day or two.
“The song’s success caught the two songwriters completely by surprise, since they were very aware of the controversy and disagreements among Americans about the Vietnam War, which was the subtext for David’s lyrics. Bacharach has continuously used the song as the intro and finale for most of his live concert appearances well into the 2000s.” (Wikipedia)

Best re-Arghs,
Cap’n JohnMonty’s Maggot have delighted dancers at festivals, ceilidh series and parties around the country. The major festivals and series we've played at include Sidmouth, Shrewsbury, Bromyard, Broadstairs, FolkEast, Wallingford Bunkfest, White Horse, Upton on Severn, Haddenham, Unicorn, Oxfolk, bath, Great Western, Meltdown and Knees Up Cecil Sharp.
Monty’s Maggot brings together some of the best known players on the English dance music scene with some newer faces. Monty's Maggot features the fiddles of Flos Headford and Taz Tarry, Keith Holloway on guitar, Jeremy Tozer on melodeon, and Vicky Benjamin, Heather White and Rachel Williams on tenor and baritone saxes.
No other band has this blend of fiddle frenzy, melodeon with bite and bounce, rhythmic guitar, and the reedy, gutsy sound of tenor and baritone saxes —a vibrant and full wall of sound!
Captivating tunes are played with infectious rhythm, energy and lift which puts the beat just where you need it. This usually leads to spontaneous, involuntary and spirited dancing and toe-tapping!
Here's a montage of video with Monty's Maggot and caller Will Hall at the Knees Up Cecil Sharp!, Cecil Sharp House, London, 19 June 2015. The sound was recorded by our sound engineer Sam Jones at a rehearsal in Bridport at The Woodman Inn before one of Monty Crook's ceilidhs. The video was shot and edited by Stuart Barton.
Many people ask why we're called Monty's Maggot. Maggot is old English meaning an eccentric or fanciful idea or whim; and the band was an idea hatched during a series of fiddle workshops that Flos and Jerry were running out of the wonderful White Horse pub in Moretonhampstead.
Monty is Jerry's Jack Russell who likes to sing while Jerry practises. Monty likes singing in E minor and it seemed natural to put Monty and Maggot together!
Monty has taught Jerry's other dog Sasha to sing as well.
You don't need to know how to dance; a caller will walk you through each dance immediately before it is played, and he'll call through it to keep you on track.
Tim Normanton (banjo) and Carl Allerfeldt (fiddle) join us occasionally and Ed Rennie, Nina Hansell, Ian Dedic, Dan Bones and Chris Bartram have guested or depped with us.
Well known callers that we have worked with at festivals and ceilidh series include Will Hall, Barry Goodman, Nick Walden, Gordon Potts, Fee Lock, Mary Panton, Sarah Clough, and Andy Rouse.
Shrewsbury Folk Festival
The sound was superb"
John Heydon, Haddenham Ceilidhs, 4 Oct 2014
Thank you SO much for playing for our wedding dance; you were really fantastic. It was great fun and everyone loved it!"
N&D Sep 2014
You were the best dance band all weekend - so danceable, you sounded great!"
Polly Dare, Bromyard Fok Festival 2014
Monty's Maggot play traditional music for barn dances, English country dances and English ceilidhs. Captivating tunes are played with infectious rhythm, energy and lift.
This frequently leads to spontaneous, involuntary and spirited dancing!
Since 2010, Monty's Maggot have been well-received at festivals and ceilidh series including Sidmouth, Bromyard, Shrewsbury, Broadstairs, FolkEast, Wallingford Bunkfest, Upton on Severn and White Horse.
“English Ceilidh” (EC, aka barn dance) is English country dancing to upbeat bands with emphasis on energy, stepping and fun rather than complexity.
You don't need to know how to dance to go to an English Ceiliidh. The dances are usually for sets of people and a caller will walk you through the dances before the tune is played.
You don't need to bring a partner with you; it’s quite normal to ask someone to dance. Families are always welcome.
EC dances should be danced or stepped throughout, rather than walked, which is unlike “Social” or “Playford” dances where the complexity of the figures in the dance is more important than the stepping. This is extreme English country dance!
If you see people going to an English dance wearing trainers and shorts, it’s more likely that they are going to an English Ceilidh than to a ‘social dance’!
If you thought English country dancing might be boring, think again!

My daughter herself chose Apeejay as her school when we were yet to make up our mind: Dr. Rubina Lall
Dr. Rubina Lall (45) is a General Physician and her husband Dr Devinder Singh Lall (47) is an orthopaedic doctor. The couple have their own clinic, Lall’s Orthoclinic Centre, in Jalandhar. Both their daughters—Eeshani and Kaashvi — are studying at Apeejay Model Town and Rhythms Kinderworld, Model Town.
Tell us more about your children?
Eeshani is 10 years old and is studying in class 5. She is good at singing and is really interested in cooking. She is good at Science as well. She takes care of her younger sister the way she should. I am happy that the teachers at Apeejay are identifying her talent and promoting it by making her participate in activities. Kaashvi is four and is studying in UKG of Rhythms. She is a naughty child, but I am sure she will become mature and sensible with time. She loves her teachers so much. Kaashvi is very good at grasping things. I don’t have to put much effort into making her learn new things.
What made you choose Apeejay over other schools?
It was not us who chose Eeshani’s school. Let me explain. Actually, when we went to see Apeejay School with Eeshani, she left my hand and started playing there. She even interacted with the staff as if she knew them for a long time. We were amazed to see how comfortable and happy our daughter was. We then believed that Eeshani had chosen her school on her own. When we told her that this is going to be her school, she was counting days before she could begin attending classes after the admission.
Why did you choose the same school for your younger daughter?
After Eeshani’s admission, we found that the teachers at Apeejay are excellent. She understands her concepts at the school itself that she doesn’t need my help at home. We were satisfied with her education as well as the holistic development that a child needs. So, it wasn’t a tough decision to send Kaashvi to the same school.
How are the kids responding to the online classes?
Both my daughters are enjoying their online classes. Every morning they are excited to attend the virtual class and meet their teachers and friends. I must appreciate that the teachers are taking extra pains to make the online classes smooth and engaging. With an effective approach of making the students read the chapter first and then explaining it to them, is actually helping the students grasp the content. I am also impressed with an interactive Q&A session after each class.
What are their recent learnings in school?
They have become more responsible now. Even though I spend most of my time looking after my daughters, they never disappoint me. They get up early in the morning on their own, get ready for the class. They know about their subject timetable and also finish the work assigned to them. Eeshani has become calm and sobre. She has started behaving maturely.
Do the teachers provide individual attention to the students?
Yes, since I attend the online class of my younger daughter, I know that teachers are giving proper attention to each student. They know how important it is setting up a strong foundation for a child. The teachers are not letting the pandemic leave a dent on the child’s education
“Both my daughters are enjoying their online classes. Every morning they are excited to attend the virtual class and meet their teachers and friends.”-Dr. Rubina LGoldco helps customers protect their retirement savings by rolling over their existing IRA, 401(k), 403(b) or other qualified retirement account to a Gold & Silver IRA.
This is the investor's obligation. It can also work the other method. "Some metal dealers may suggest an IRA custodian," states Johnson.
These include:: Knowing all your expenses upfront can avoid any nasty surprises, such as hidden charges after you invest.: Try to find a company with an impressive reputation from unbiased 3rd celebrations, such as the Better Company Bureau or the Organization Customer Alliance. Moy states it may also be practical to dig into what clients state about the company, especially the number of complaints filed.
: You need to only deal with a business that has all the suitable and required licenses, registrations, insurance, and bonds to secure your financial investment. Request confirmation of those licenses and other details. Special Expenses Owning gold in a gold IRA does feature some unique expenses. The charges that a financier will face include::"Although gold has a going rate, there are markups relying on whether you desire gold bullion, coins, proofs, and so on," says Sentell.
"Similarly, each form of gold provides its own set of requirements when a financier needs to sell," he adds.: This one-time cost is charged to establish your new IRA account. This also differs by institution, however it might be more than the typical setup charge, as not all monetary services companies handle gold IRAs.
: The gold needs to be held by a certified storage center for which storage fees are charged.: If you want to close out a gold IRA by selling your gold to a third-party dealership, stated dealership will wish to pay less than what it goes for on the open market.
Some individual retirement account business will ensure to purchase the gold back from you at existing wholesale rates, however you might still lose money by closing the account, something that usually does not occur overall quantity of your RMDs from other conventional Individual retirement accounts. Checkbook Individual retirement accounts There is one possible method to prevent having a custodian and the costs connected with one: You can open what's referred to as a "checkbook IRA," a self-directed IRA individual retirement account, so continue carefully with this choice.
The rollover procedure is the same when it comes to any other retirement fund. You usually fill out an account application (whether online or on paper), and the account is usually developed within 24 to two days of completion and receipt of the application. "As soon as the signed transfer request is gotten by all parties, the 2 custodians will communicate with each other to transfer the funds to the new custodian and fund a brand-new gold individual retirement account," says Gottlieb.
Gold's Special Dangers All investments come with threats and benefits, gold consisted of. "In lots of ways, gold IRAs have the very same dangers that any investment has," states Moy.
," says Moy.
So if your portfolio is stabilized with both gold and paper-based investments, a loss on the gold side will be stabilized by the gain experienced by other assets. "Much of these risks exist for conventional IRAs too. And standard IRAs have risks that gold IRAs do not have," he adds.
Any physical product undergoes theft. Somebody might get into the depository where your gold is being stored. To qualify for gold IRAs, depositories are required to be insured, which would protect your financial investment as long as your account does not go beyond the custodian's specified value on accounts, "There are likewise unreliable custodians who might take from their consumers' accounts or dedicate fraud by offering your rare-earth elements that they do not in fact have nor are planning to purchase," states Moy.
While gold has the potential of a high return, it's simple to be blinded by its shine. Gold rates can plunge unexpectedly. When gold is increasing, you also need to decide whether you 'd be purchasing ator close tothe top of the market if you invest at that point. Waiting could make more sense.
In basic, it's never an excellent idea to put all of your eggs in one possession basket. If gold seems like a solid choice for you, Sentell suggests putting no more than one-third of your retirement funds into a gold Individual retirement account.
If you have an interest in buying physical gold and other rare-earth elements, a gold IRA is an option. Inspect.Free Shipping on orders of $75 or more | No Code Necessary

Last Friday, I had the opportunity to create new smiles for a young lady, her mother and her cousin. The mother and daughter are about to go on a two week holiday to Melbourne Australia and wanted holiday smiles to bring with them as they were visiting family down under.
I started with the young lady, Tina, who looked like a teenager but had a smile that could do with a little tweaking as she had many gaps between her front teeth and they were tilted and uneven length on top of that.
She is a pretty young girl and labeled herself ‘super fussy patient‘ as she gazed critically into the mirrors after the makeover. I told her I wanted to do only the tops as she needed to get used to the new look and feel. Sometimes a new smile does need getting used to!
Her cousin was floating around the dental chair watching the whole process as she was nervous too but was excited as she had been looking for a dentist for some time that could give her her dream smile.
She looked so cool in her knee length boots and told me that she had worked in Australia for two years and the dental treatment there was very expensive. I chatted with the three of them as they waited their turn and gave moral support to each other.
At last it was Ashley, the cousin’s turn. Hers was much simpler as she had turned in crooked upper teeth and some smaller gaps in her lower jaw but it was easy to do. I suppose my job was much easier with Ashley, Â as she had already watched the whole process whilst I worked on Tina.
She sat quietly while it was Tina’s turn to give her moral support andÂ
encouragement. Tina’s mum ever so often got into the action and gave her comments as well. The finished smile had Tina’s mum say that she wanted a make over too! So I ended up doing the entire family!!
Tina’s mum had mis-shapen upper teeth which made her look a little ‘ratty’ and she had chipped her front tooth in a minor accident. She too wanted to look good which was something I just love to to do!
The three ladies encouraged each other and gave me feed back on the progress. Tina’s mum had a missing tooth so it called for some disguising of her canine to have her get a softer more feminine smile that made her look younger and give her the winning smile she wanted.

Comment: AirTag pricing is one of the smartest things about the device – 9to5Mac
We’ve known since 2019 that AirTag was coming, but there was still one big surprise yesterday: AirTag pricing.
With the Tile Pro coming in at over $30, pretty much everyone assumed that the combination of added smarts and Apple branding would see AirTag come in at a significantly higher price, likely in the order of $50 …
As it turned out, AirTag costs half that if you buy a pack of four, and only $29 if you buy them individually.
That puts AirTag firmly into the kind of territory where they become a no-brainer for most iPhone owners. Even if you just buy one, and move it between bags, $29 is a very small price to pay for that kind of peace of mind.
Many customers will go further, of course, and buy one or more packs. For my own part, I’m likely to add one to my keyring, and one to each of the bags I use most frequently, as well as my travel bags.
That kind of pricing also makes them an affordable gift – perhaps people will even add one when gifting someone an expensive bag.
We don’t yet have any idea of Apple’s margins on the device – though teardowns are likely to provide some clues once they ship – but the company may not care too much. Because Apple also offers an extensive range of AirTag accessories, most of them costing more than the device itself.
Indeed, the most expensive combo Apple sells is the AirTag Hermès Luggage Tag – a bespoke version of the AirTag itself plus a leather tag for a cool $449.
But even the very cheapest Apple AirTag holder costs $29 for a bag loop or $35 for a keyring, while a leather bag loop bumps the price up to $39. There are cheaper third-party ones, but I think it’s safe to say that a rather high percentage of AirTag buyers are effectively going to be paying over $50 each, all in.
The margins on those tags are going to be huge. On Alibaba, you can pick up leather keyrings for well under a dollar each, and leather luggage tags for $1-$2. Of course, Apple will be using much better-quality leather, but you can find ones with decent leather for a few dollars even in small quantities. These are items that will be costing Apple a tiny fraction of their retail price.
In this way, AirTag pricing is a win-win. If you want just the tag itself, you can pick one up at a really appealing price. You might carry it loose in a bag, or attach it with double-sided tape or velcro, and pay the advertised price. But Apple knows that many people will opt for its own-brand holders, allowing it to make fantastic margins on a low headline price.
AirTag is a smart device, but Apple’s AirTag pricing is arguably even smarter.farmerswife provides industry leading cloud or onsite scheduling, management and collaboration software for your media business. your teams tasks. farmerswife exists to simplify your work.

ABOUT THE INFILTRATOR
Confronted with the violent drug trafficking scene plaguing the nation in 1986, federal undercover agent ROBERT “BOB” MAZUR (Oscar nominee and Emmy winner Bryan Cranston) realizes the Medellín Cartel faces an enormous problem of its own: ruthless Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar and his vicious underlings are making so much money, they literally don’t know what to do with all the cash.
Family man by night, nerves-of-steel charmer by day, Mazur convinces his boss BONNI TISCHLER (Oscar nominee Amy Ryan) to follow the money instead of the drugs. Teamed with impulsive, streetwise undercover agent EMIR ABREU (Emmy winner John Leguizamo) and later with KATHY ERTZ (Diane Kruger), a fast-thinking, beautiful rookie undercover agent who poses as his fiancé, Mazur constructs a high-risk David-and-Goliath sting named “Operation C-Chase.” To drive the investigation, Mazur poses as slick money-laundering businessman Bob Musella.
Mazur, a mild-mannered former IRS accountant, creates his flashy alter ego and recruits street-tough mob enforcer DOMINIC (Joseph Gilgun), who has enough street cred to make Musella look legitimate. Abreu, going undercover with his shifty informant, sets up Mazur’s first Cartel meet by convincing lower-echelon money laundering criminals GONZALO MORA JR. (Rubén Ochandiano) and his father GONZALO MORA SR. (Simón Andreu) to grow their operation by doing business with his “boss.”
Secretly taping conversations with a covert recording device contained in his briefcase, Musella wins over the father-son team, then moves up another rung when he gains access to the Cartel’s elite. They include volatile Cartel money launderer JAVIER OSPINA (Yul Vazquez) and Pablo Escobar’s urbane lieutenant ROBERTO ALCAINO (Benjamin Bratt) along with his glamorous wife GLORIA (Elena Anaya).
As he ascends the black money market power pyramid, Mazur walks a nervewracking tightrope, knowing that the smallest slip-up in his cover story could endanger him and his family. By the time Mazur/Musella penetrates the Cartel’s inner circle, his ability to compartmentalize private and professional identities begins to unravel. Immersed in the luxurious trappings of the Cartel underworld, Mazur/Musella becomes a trusted confidant of the world’s most dangerous and wanted men. Deep undercover in one of the world’s most vicious criminal organizations, Mazur faces a life-or-death question: can he remain faithful to himself when his charismatic creation Bob Musella threatens to takes over every last facet of his being?

THE INFILTRATOR, Cert 15A, in cinemas now.
WATCH THE TRAILER
THE INFILTRATOR is now showing in Irish cinemasEuropean Commission Vice President, Andrus Ansip, last week announced plans to end territoriality for digital content distribution.
The proposal is that Europe becomes one market, not a bunch of separate territories, for the purposes of content sales and especially sales of digital content, including many videogames and subscription services such as Netflix.
Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s Competition Commissioner, has also flagged that the EC is poised to mount a separate inquiry covering geo-blocking of online content including TV programming and games.
The arguments for and against are complex, but the founding principles of the European Union were designed to make Europe a single market. Indeed, hark back several decades to when the organisation was first established and it was known as the European Common Market.
Many areas of European law already treat the market in that way: for example, all EC passport holders have the right of residency in any member country. Many, but not all, countries have signed up for Europe’s “single currency”, the Euro. Goods and services may be offered freely across all member states.
When it comes to content, especially digital content, there are strong arguments for and against opening up the market. The major argument for creating a single market focuses on freedom of movement – a founding plank of a united Europe’s raison d’etre. If one buys (online access to) a digital service in one territory of the allegedly single market, one should not be geo-blocked from that service in other member states.
Or, to quote Ansip: “I pay my taxes in Estonia so why, when in Brussels, can’t I watch content I bought legally?”
Ansip used a specific example of not being able to watch football games, which won him plenty of public support for his position. Much of Europe is blocked from watching the world’s most popular league, England’s Premier League, access to which has already been the subject of European court cases.
The challenge, from an industry perspective, is that while it might be relatively easy in practice to sell content or a subscription service into one region containing various member states, it’s a fast-track to chaos.
The European Film Agency Directors (EFAD), which represents European film funds and other interested parties, has come out strongly against the proposals. EFAD argues that the territoriality principle must be preserved, because it’s the basis of much financing across Europe.
The loudest voice opposing Ansip’s plans within the Commission so far has been Günther Oettinger, Commissioner for digital economy and society. Oettinger said that Europe needed to preserve its cultural diversity, and protect against serving only the interests of non-European consolidated entertainment content providers, or Hollywood.
On challenge for creators is that not all content is supplied for sale. Many public broadcasters, the BBC being the prime example in Europe, raise income locally – via a licence fee in the BBC’s case. A change in legislation would mean all of Europe could access BBC programming directly (via its iPlayer service) for free, reducing the BBC’s ability to sell its programming to other European broadcasters.
Why, the British public argues, should it pay for the BBC to create content which French, German, Italian viewers then get to watch for free?
When it comes to films (and, to a lesser degree, high-end TV) the financing is increasingly multi-national in origin. Several challenges raise their heads here. National and regional funding bodies and incentive schemes provide cash on the basis of the ability to achieve some form of return.
It’s already impossible, given Europe’s freedom of movement and labour laws, to require (let’s say) an Irish animation company working on an international co-production to employ Irish workers.
When the potential return to an investor is a financial one, which is not always the case with some incentive-schemes and culturally-driven funding pots, sales of the finished product into different European territories helps achieve financial returns.
The winners from the proposed changes would only be the biggest of players – those who operate across multiple territories, who are comfortable acquiring product for multiple territories using multiple languages. A few, such as Canal+, are European. Because only the biggest of players would play, the range of titles finding homes around Europe would diminish.
It’s ironic given that the EC Vice President Ansip is proposing to cull territoriality in response to the dominance of American product over locally-produced fare in many European countries, when the major beneficiary of such a move would be the US studios.
However, common sense is not a strong suit in Brussels. Commission Regulation No. 1677/88 specifies that cucumbers will bend no more than 10mm per 10cm of length.
For those looking to sell into European territories, at MipTV, MipCom or the Marché, there’s a risk – especially for deals spanning a number of years – that the goalposts will move and deals will need to be renegotiated or be declared void.
There may be a reluctance from buyers to acquire product for a particular European territory, when they may later find themselves in dispute with buyers who holds rights for other areas of Europe. UK industry sources SCREENZ spoke to recently at FILMART expected to see a drop in business at MipTV in April and the Marché in May.
Digital distributors into Europe are currently coming to terms with changes to business rules which now require distributors to pay GST-equivalent sales taxes in the country of residence of the buyer across Europe rather than in the territory of the seller.
The change targets major vendors based outside of Europe, such as Amazon and iTunes, but applies to anybody selling digital goods into Europe. Rather than making one GST-equivalent filing per reporting period, sellers’ compliance costs now have to cover making up to 28 separate returns to different territories.
The EC has announced that it will confirm further detail on its proposals around digital content in May, although not when in May.SPIRIT MEDICINE
Rest, Cleanse and Ground: Spiritual Self-Care is in Order we’re forced to deal with a new hand of cards or revisit situations that require our utmost attention. It’s the time we owe ourselves to process, rest, recoup,
“Inactive does not mean asleep.”
Spirit is crystal clear on this week’s message of slowing down and prioritizing time to de-stress, whilst being intentional with our time and energy. As I look at the woman illustrated in the 4 of Swords (or 4 of Cutlass), Spirit stresses the importance of spiritual cleansing, partially taking a spiritual bath. Set some time in your schedule this week to cleanse and ground. For newbies, a good ‘ol salt bath always does the trick. We often forget the many powers and properties of salt — purifying, cleansing, preserving, including in the Bible. Leviticus 2:13 reads: “And every offering of your grain offering you shall season with salt; you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.”
Consider a spiritual bath an offering to your spirit’ it can be as simple or elaborate as you’d like! Salt, lemon, Florida water, vodka, baking soda, mint, basil, lavender, orange peels are some of my favorites for cleansing. You can even gather an array of herbs, flowers, essential oils, etc. and let it simmer over the stove (don’t forget to pray over your bath and speak your intentions in the ingredients) to create the basic mixture to pour into a homemade spiritual bath.
If you want to avoid the cleanup you can strain the mixture or if you prefer to bathe with everything (I do!) you can do that too. The main intention is to clear away all energetic debris and start with a clean slate. After you soak in your bath for at least 20 mins, envision all the of negative energy being washed away from you as it flows down the drain. Do not towel dry, but instead like the woman illustrated, air dry. If you’d like to wear clothes afterwards, make sure it is white and that your head is covered.
P.S.: I totally understand that not everyone has access to a bathtub! Another way you can do this is take the boiled water concoction and put it into a spray bottle and spray yourself from your head to your toes while you’re taking a shower.
Cleansing our energy is just the first step! Afterwards, you must ground.
Remember, this all doesn’t have to be in the same day nor does it have to be a drawn out ritual! It is the intention that counts, but do make sure you are taking your time, have pure intentions and the desire to do the exercise.
Throughout the week, consider practical grounding exercises as you slow down.
- Make a home-cooked meal including root vegetables like onions, sweet potato, carrots, turnips
- Work with grounding herbs like basil, thyme, oregano (or Italian seasoning!), ginger, tumeric
- Try a white light meditation
- Drink chamomile, valerian, or lemon balm tea at night to settle your nerves and help you wind down
- Take a nature walk! If you’re about that life you can plant your bare feet into the ground or huge a tree
- Listen to grounding hz frequencies during your morning or nighttime rituals (my fave is 396 hz)
- Work with crystals like clear quartz, smoky quartz, rose quartz, hematite
The biggest takeaway from this week is using your time wisely to tend to your spiritual hygiene. The cleansing and grounding is an essential step that we can’t skip! It allows us to reclaim our energy and recharge so we can face the next task(s) at hand.

idusNYWhy is it so difficult for people strolling Park Avenue in search of a restaurant to turn a corner?
Sure, there are plenty of restaurants with a bona fide Park Avenue address that are worth dining at. But there are other eateries every bit as worthy of attention just off the main thoroughfare. And I’m talking mere steps, not blocks away.
Consider the space at 155 E. Morse Blvd., the current home of La Merce, a cafe with a Spanish-leaning European menu. On a recent day at the height of the lunch hour while most of the Park Ave restaurants were brimming with diners, I walked into a La Merce so empty that my arrival seemed to startle someone who walked out of the kitchen while I waited at the front door.
I remained the sole diner the entire time I was there, the only one to listen to the mournful-sounding songs of a flamenco guitarist and singer, Diego el Cigala, that played over the sound system.
And I was the only one to enjoy the Panini La Merce, a sandwich worthy of the house name. It had cubes of grilled chicken and thick slices of grilled eggplant, which had a nice smoky note. Roasted peppers and fresh, cool mozzarella were dressed with pesto and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, all on a fresh ciabatta roll. Delicious and filling, especially with the accompanying fries.
A previous evening visit had been a little better attended. My dining companions and I shared a starter of Calamari, tender rings of squid with a delicate jacket of batter, perfectly fried.
For my entree I chose the Cachopo Filled, as it’s listed on the menu. Cachopo is a dish associated with Asturias, a province in the north of Spain. You might describe it as a mashup of Milanese and Parmigiana. Two steaks are “sandwiched” together with cheese and Serrano ham between the meat, which is then breaded and fried. As served at La Merce, it’s huge, enough to serve a table of four. The cheese goozed out when I cut into it, and if the meats had been just a bit more tender, it would have been wonderful. (I could have chosen a side dish a little more wisely, choosing mashed potatoes or grilled asparagus over the plain chips.)
All of the staff I had contact with were welcoming and helpful.
La Merce’s website says it is a restaurant and market, though I don’t know where the market part comes in. It might just be a holdover notion from one of the other more recent residents. This is where Daya, the vegan restaurant, was located and, before that, NOPA, whose very name was an acronym that either celebrated or lamented its location: Not On Park Avenue.
Perhaps the failure of those businesses can’t be fully blamed on the side street location. Nor can the emptiness I witnessed at noon at La Merce — the all-day menu has some prices that could scare people away at lunchtime (dinnertime, too).
But the pleasant surroundings, bright and cheery, and matching staff make La Merce worth a stroll.
La Merce is at 155 E. Morse Blvd., Winter Park. It is open for lunch and dinner Tuesday through Sunday. The phone number is 321-295-7611.Adani Enterprises Ltd. on Tuesday made the highest bid for the Guwahati airport, thus becoming a claimant for all the six airports offered by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for operations, management and development for a period of 50 years.
The decision on awarding the airports would be taken by the Union Cabinet, a senior AAI official has said.
Cabinet note
The AAI has shared the results of the bidding procedure with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, a senior government official said on the condition of anonymity. Next, the Ministry would move a Cabinet note.
On Monday, the AAI opened financial bids for Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru and Thiruvananthpuram airports and Adani Enterprises Ltd. emerged as the winner with the highest quotes for per-passenger fee payable to the AAI. The bids for Guwahati airport were opened to Tuesday due to an interim order from Gauhati High Court.
The entity quoted ₹160 as its per passenger fee payable to AAI. The second highest bid was ₹155 from the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund/ Zurich Airport International AG.
The per passenger fee for domestic passengers is the sole criteria for selecting the winning bidder.
“The Adani Group is delighted on winning the bids that were invited by Airports Authority of India (AAI) in December 2018 for the management of domestic airports under the PPP model.We would be aiming to scale up the infrastructure to bring these facilities on par with global standards,” a spokesperson of the Adani Group had said in a statement on Monday.

The feature is available immediately to those using Google Messages in the UK and France so long as you use the app as your default messaging application. Unfortunately, it only currently appears to work correctly on Pixel devices with a SIM card installed. Several of my own test devices are showing that “Chat features unavailable for this device” including the OnePlus 7 Pro — that is even after installing a working SIM card.
Despite SMS messaging not being the most popular in the UK and in Europe generally, the new multimedia RCS Chat features are still a welcome addition to the Messages application on supported Android devices. Having tried it out already, I am genuinely surprised at how good RCS Chat is in practice. It’s smooth, seamless and bares a lot of similarities to how iMessage worked in the early days.
The typing notifications are a great extra — although they could be a little bigger — while the ability to send GIFs and images will save on potentially extortionate MMS costs. Should you lose connection or your intended recipient happens to lose their connection, you’ll get an on-screen notification telling you to choose between SMS and MMS.
There is no prompt or notification to tell you if a message has failed to send, though. That does mean you will still have to manually resend a message as an SMS or MMS message. Another issue that seems to appear and then disappear is RCS messages will suddenly stop working or sending when on Wi-Fi. This problem leaves you relying heavily on mobile data. We’re hoping this is just a bug in the system, as it seems to be intermittent.
If you didn’t already know, RCS Chat within Google Messages will be cross-compatible with existing carrier implementations. That should mean it will roll out slowly to more countries “throughout the year.”
We can confirm that RCS within Google messages can be sent to those in France and the UK across the channel without any extra cost or delay. Voice notes, video, GIFs, and images all work pretty flawlessly. Voice notes do go under some serious compression and honestly do not sound good at all, which kind of is to be expected.
If you like using the browser client on your desktop, you’ll be pleased to hear that this too works with RCS. You can send images, GIFs, video and audio from your desktop, plus it has all the typing notifications and more on top. You’re also able to send apk files, should you want to share them via RCS/SMS, but note that these are only visible on mobile.
While the overall experience is pretty seamless, given that most people in the UK and France have already adopted another messaging client, SMS is genuinely almost dead at this point. It will take a real change of attitudes for people to suddenly switch to Google Messages simply for features that already exist in other third-party messaging clients.
We’ll have a full hands-on with RCS on Google Messages in the coming days, so be sure to check back in to see just what you’re potentially missing out on and what to expect when it hits US shores. We’ll also update should we see any further devices get the ability to send RCS messages in the coming days.
If you have questions, let us know in the comments section below. Be sure to let us know if you’re excited by the prospect of RCS down there too.

Without a drill press, I tried this anvil and the staking tool. With the anvil, turret board and staking tool teetering between the fingers of my left hand, I'd try and strike the staking tool with a hammer in my right hand. This produced unimpressive results and a 50% hit rate on my left thumb. Then I made a simple jig. Buy a polyethylene cutting board at your supermarket ($3.99 for 8"x11" at Kroger) and drill a 1/4" hole through the center. Be sure it's perfectly perpendicular (I used a drill block). Place this over a steel plate ($11.98 for 1/4"x 4"x12" at Home Depot). Drop the Anvil in the hole and now you can load it with a turret, place the board over it and whack your thumb to your heart's content. With this setup, there is about .03" of clearance for the other turrets, so you can stake an entire board without interference. After a few whacks, you will learn how hard to hit it. You must use a hard surface underneath the cutting board. Your workbench won't suffice, nor can you only partially drill through the cutting board.
Good quality tool and it does wonderful job. I definitely do not have any complaints. Thank you.The Entrepreneur route has always provided more than its fair share of interpretative challenges to business people and their lawyers alike. And it looks like the Covid-19 concession announced for those still in the route (it was replaced for new applicants by the Innovator option in Spring 2019) is no different.
Entrepreneurs extending their leave or applying for settlement must demonstrate successful job creation, essentially by showing they employed at least 2 people for 12 months in jobs that did not previously exist. It is not hard to see that this could be threatened by current economic circumstances. Whilst the Rules require that the jobs be extant during the last grant of leave, they need not exist throughout the whole period of trading. So one can well imagine some enterprises where the business plan would envisage the jobs running into spring and summer 2020, an expectation that might well run aground with the economy’s interruption by the current public health crisis.
So this announcement by the SSHD (found within the general advice for UK visa applicants and temporary UK residents originally published on 24 March 2020) is highly relevant:
"You no longer need to employ at least 2 people for 12 consecutive months each. The 12 month period you are required to employ someone for can be made up of multiple jobs."
The ambit of this policy is not completely clear. We can state two propositions with reasonable confidence:
(a) Time furloughed will not count towards job creation (2nd paragraph);
(b) There is a possibility of a temporary extension of leave for those who have not met the “2 job” creation requirement (3rd paragraph).
But what is the meaning of the first paragraph? The first sentence indicates that there is no need to employ 2 people for 12 consecutive months each. But in truth the Immigration Rules already allow for this: for example Appendix A para 49(c) permits a job to “count even if it does not last 12 consecutive months (for example it lasts for 6 months in one year and 6 months the following year) provided that it is the same job.” So is this intended to be an introductory summary of the present position, just to put the reader in the right frame of mind, or does it herald a new way of assessing job creation which permits much more mix-and-match than hitherto? The phrase “You no longer need to employ” suggests an active change.
On balance it seems that the requirement at Appendix A para 49(e) is at the centre of the concession. The second sentence states that “multiple jobs” can be relied on “across different months”. So one could read this as a relaxation of the para 49(e) restriction that “Different jobs that have existed for less than 12 months cannot be combined together to make up a 12 month job.” There certainly seems to be no relaxation of the requirement that the job creation have extended into the last grant of leave; nor does there seem to be any change to the requirement that a job last for 30 hours a week before it can count.
Entrepreneurs who entered the route before 6 April 2014 and applied to extend their leave, or for Indefinite leave, before 6 April 2019 could rely on more flexible rules on job creation. Under transitional protection this class of applicant could satisfy the Entrepreneur visa job creation requirement by relying on one worker for 24 months, one worker for six months and one for eighteen months, four workers for six months each. Perhaps the first paragraph of the new concession represents a return to something resembling that more relaxed route. Though it is difficult to see that the very precise terms of the concession could be implied into the rather vague phrase “multiple jobs across different months”.

n seeking the best way to characterize this work of exemplary scholarship the word that comes to mind is “fair-minded.” Although a wonderfully effective advocate for Newman, Poston readily admits his flaws, pointing out, for example, that “despite his rhetorical powers, Newman was often something of a naif when the issues, however technical, ultimately resonated across denominational boundaries” with the result that he “failed in 1836, as he was to fail with Tract 90 in 1841, to realize that adverse reaction was predictable in the overheated theological atmosphere of the day” (92). Similarly, he was disingenous about important matters, explicitly stating that he had “‘given up his place in the [Tractarian] movement’ in 1839” (114) when in fact he remained “a spiritual counselor” (115) to some of his followers. Far more important, however, are the many ways in which Poston explains the modes of thought that reveal how Newman “could tell both friends and foes that he had not been fully conscious of the processes going on in his mind; logic followed where sympathy led him, but that took time. Only belatedly does an individual recognize whither his mind and prospects have been tending” (133). Poston convincingly explains complex, often controversial, matters with such clarity that I have tried, but failed, from preventing this review to become a mosaic of his words.
After an introduction that opens with the statement that “John Henry Newman was a divided and at times divisive personality” (1), The titles of his chapters give a good indication of how he will explain the role of Newman's ideas of person and personality: “Self and Others,” the first chapter, introduces “Doctrine and the Difficulty of Knowing,” comparing Newman to Carlyle and Pater, after which a second chapter, “The Journey from Evangelicalism” proceeds with sections on the movement “from the Atonement to the Incarnation” and “Incarnational Preaching.” “Polarities,” chapter three, takes us through the early days of the Tractarian movement, and chapter four, “Notes of the Church,” examines The Prophetical Office of the Church (1837) and Lectures on Justification, ending with Newman’s “attempts to explain the provisionality of the English church by linking it to the Grand Hebraic narratives of estrangement and redemption” (11). “Anglican Deathbeds,” chapter 5, relates the events and relationships that immediately preceded Newman’s movement to Rome, and the following one, “Deliverance from the Nightmare,” covers the reactions of his Anglican friends and associates, his novel Loss and Gain, and his brother’s two novels, The Soul, Her Sorrows, and Her Aspirations (1849) and Phases of Faith (1850). “Building Community,” chapter 7, explains Newman’s attempts to define, locate, and live in a religious community in the years before he published the Apologia. This chapter also discusses The Idea of a University, and the next, “Reconstituting the Self,” provides a fine analysis of the Apologia, which includes an examination of Newman’s conception of “development.” “Oppositions and Resolutions,” which includes a discussion of the Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent (1870), also examines Newman’s complex relation to Cardinal Manning and the Roman hierarchy. Poston’s “Afterword” surveys his reputation among contemporaries and later biographers, closing with the author's own final judgment:
Newman’s confidence came after many years of personal struggle with two different communions. But come it did. No less certain of his honest intentions than his illusions, we must take him for what he was: a formidable spiritual presence, a fallible human being. [246]
The most interesting and indeed central point for anyone attempting to understand this most powerful polemicist’s life and career is Newman’s fundamental skepticism about the role of the human intellect in matters of religion. As Poston points out, “Newman seems to see the formulation of a creed as a Fall from the original innocence of the Church, which was compelled to resort to definitions and distinctions as a hedge against heterodoxy. Creeds, like Carlyle's ‘clothes’ in Sartor Resartus, would appear to be a postlapsarian necessity” (55). For this reason he “stresses the superiority of personal communication over books for religious instruction, as he was to do more broadly in his writing on liberal education. Personality is better experienced by its physical presence than on the page” (55). But even such “personal communication” has has severe limits in Newman’s eyes. Take for instance his idea of how a clergyman should act when visiting the ill and dying.
Imagine a situation, Newman said, in which a clergyman of the "modern school" visits a dying parishioner. He probes her conscience with leading questions about the state of her mind, rather than drawing on the service for the Visitation of the Sick, which begins with the articles of the Creed and continues with an exhortation to repentance, forgiveness, and the making of amends. In Newman's view, recourse to ritual and set words of prayer provided privacy more charitable than a personal appeal to arouse the sufferer to weigh her own state. The well-known words of the Book of Common Prayer, he thought, carried their own sufficient earnestess and reflected a shared, communal tradition in which others have preceded us. Recourse to such aids is far more consoling, and more Christian, than demands that the dying person fall back on her own resources for self-examination and preparation for death (Letters and Diaries 6:131—32). [79]
This conception of a clergyman's role, so fundamentally different from that of the evangelicals, also produces his distrust of preaching precisely because, as Jonathan Swift pointed out more than a century earlier in The Tale of a Tub, emotional preaching, personal testimony, and the public statement of personal matters inevitably tend towards egotism that eclipses the mainstays of religious faith. “Preaching,” as Poston points out, “carried with it the temptation to curry favor and enhance one’s reputation” . . . . Newman regarded preaching as subordinate to catechesis, prayer, pastoral care, and the administration of the Sacraments” (82, 84). "Newman felt that the function of the sermon was to witness to hearers rather than to convert them” (80). “His audience, Newman makes clear, is not those who need to be convinced, but the committed who need to understad their ground for trusting their own beliefs” (233).
Having abandoned his early evangelicalism with its central emphasis upon conversion, Newman seems so to shy away from encouraging conversion to the extent that he often seems interested only in those who already share his belief. This fundamental — one may say radical — conservatism, appears in his notion of conversion, which Poston describes as “more Augustinean that Pauline; but rather than turning to a new faith, it describes a new comprehensiveness bringing to light what has been there all along. The result is a homecoming” (202; my emphasis). Two observations come to mind, the first of which is that Newman's notion of conversion thus appears not only Augustinean but also, to go further back, to match Aristotelean conceptions of character that hold that experience and decision do not so much create a new self but merely realize the potential self that had always been there. Second, although Poston quite properly cites Augustine’s On Christian Doctrine with its central metaphor of life as a voyage back to God as an influence upon Newman here in this matter of conversion, we might also note that, like Augustine in the Confessions, he sees his life in terms of The Aeneid’s structure or topos of the voyage to a safe harbor.
Newman’s awareness of the limits of human reason combines with his intense dislike of expressing emotion, which he believes easily becomes prideful self-display that in turn inevitably undercuts the already limited rationality available to human beings. In fact, many of Newman's attitudes towards evangelical preaching and religious enthusiasm seem to descend in a straight line from Swift, and although Newman is too much of a gentleman, prude, or both to associate (as Swift does) evangelical public expressions of religious emotion with sexuality or flatulence he certainly sees them with great suspicion as evidence of egotism and pride. According to Poston,
this "modern system" of self-contemplation, Newman believes, disparages both the Gospel and the Creeds because of its emphasis on "a certain state of heart" as its main object. Though its practitioners may argue that “the existence of right religious affections” is a security for adherence to sound doctrine, the conviction of one's righteousness before God will lead to a disparagement of orthodox standards, an ignoring of the "strict and technical niceties of doctrine" that cannot be said to induce any change in the heart and that therefore become unnecessary, or at best secondary, to faith. The result is an emphasis on the "work of Christ" rather than on His person, and the Incarnation loses its centrality in the Gospel while the doctrines of Justification and the Atonement assume its place. . . . In short, to argue that "inspiration speaks merely of divine operations, not of Persons" is to relocate the center of truth to the mind of the individual believer. The result is an obliteration of "the great Objects brought to light in the Gospel... and thus to frustrate the design of Christ's Incarnation, . . ." (336). In Newman's thinking, such a system risks a highly selective approach to scripture itself. It has not been sufficiently noted that one of the complaints Newman lodged against the Evangelicals was that they concentrated on the Pauline epistles at the expense of the Gospels. [88]
The degree to which Newman closely associated Tractarian reserve with notions of behavior associated with a particular social and economic class appears in one of his remarks that at first encounter might seem to demand ridicule: “I should say that the Apostles were gentlemen — not that they could make a good bow, wore kid gloves, or spoke Attic Greek, but their minds and their hearts were refined. I have always maintained that St. Paul in his Epistles was the first of gentlemen” (172). Both readers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who were not particularly sympathetic to Newman or downright suspicious of him might take such a statement to be an absurd intrusion of class interests into something more important, more central, more spiritual. But if one does so one can not ignore his deep suspicion of human attempts to speak the ineffable and to explain the inexplicable.
In her recent study of Protestant theology and the Bildungsroman, Kelsey L. Bennett places great importance upon the debate about whether faith or deeds lead to salvation. Newman, who dates his religious life to his Evangelical conversion, turns away from this Protestant debate when he accepts that the focus of Christian belief should be the Incarnation rather than Christ's Atonement, for this movement from atonement to incarnation undercuts all worries about faith vs deeds. As Poston explains,
As Newman’s early Calvinism receded, the Atonement gave way to the Incarnation as the central doctrine in his theology. Intrinsic to this development, as Placid Murray has put it, were Newman’s "gradual acceptance of the doctrine of baptismal regeneration as a substitute for his earlier evangelical belief in conversion; the eventual supremacy of the mystery of the Eucharist in his own spiritual life, [and] his growing reserve about preaching on the Atonement" (Sermons, 1824-1843 I.xv). In High Church theology, the pouring of water at baptism, the laying on of hands at confirmation and ordination, the reception of bread and wine in the Eucharist were all outward and visible signs of the transmission of grace, and thus an analogue to the Incarnation, for in their very materiality they confirmed the translation of sensory phenomena into vessels for the sacred. [49]
Everything here derives from a radical scepticism that comes to rest in a belief that an organization no matter how corrupt is better than individual decision: “A book theology cannot compete, in Newman's mind, with a living system, however corrupted” (96). For this reader the greatest importance of The Antagonist Principle: John Henry Newman and the Paradox of Personality lies in its convincing, sympathetic, yet clear-eyed explanation of the fundamentally coherent development of Newman's thought. At the same time, Poston, who wears his wide knowledge with grace and clarity, also makes us see often unexpected similarities and other connections between Newman, Carlyle, Tennyson, and Pater.

ITN gives us a fare of $411.51 for the same flights on the same days, a difference of $241.01.
An hour or so earlier, at 1:39 p.m., we had Expedia price flights between Washington Dulles and Minneapolis-St. Paul. TWA Flight 507 on Dec. 2 to Minneapolis, with a return on TWA Flight 664 on Dec. 9, prices at $318.
At 1:48 p.m. that same day, we had asked yet another online travel booking service, Travelocity, to price the identical flights. Its price was $702 -- more than double that quoted by Expedia.
Ten days later, at 2 p.m., Monday, Nov. 17, we request another Internet booking agency, Preview Travel, to price a round-trip flight on Continental from Washington National to Rio de Janeiro, with a connection in Newark. The price is $849.
At 2:07, we ask Travelocity to price the same itinerary on the same dates. The price is $1,064.
These wide-ranging price differences offered by competing Internet air fare booking companies -- for the same seats on the same flights, often priced within minutes of each other -- are not isolated aberrations. As our several weeks of reporting -- and more than 16 months of sustained, regular use of these services both to check fares and book trips -- demonstrates, such discrepancies are commonplace. For the millions of consumers who use the Internet to price and book their air travel, they are also a good reason for concern. Use any one service and wind up paying $400 more. Or $250 less. Or $150 more.
Worse, there is no pattern to the discrepancies, no service proving itself consistently capable of delivering low fares. Each service takes its turn quoting high and low fares.
The simple fact is this: Despite the Internet booking services' explicit claims to the contrary, none systematically, consistently provides the lowest fares available -- or even fares consistently lower than its competitors' quotes. Choosing to use and rely on any single Internet booking service -- and trusting in its prominent low-fare claims -- can cost you hundreds of dollars.
Three years ago, of course, consumers had no access to air fare quotes at all, except through travel agents and the airlines themselves. Aside from calling multiple agents and-or multiple airlines, there was no way even to determine a range of possible fares for a specific trip. So clearly these Web-based services help consumers cope with a confusing, high-stakes marketplace. And those willing to put in the time and effort to become expert with several systems can indeed use them to find the honest-to-goodness lowish fares of the moment.
The use of these services is expected to rise quickly over the next several years. According to a recent survey for the Travel Industry Association of America, online travel industry revenues totaled just a sliver of the entire airline passenger business in 1996 -- $276 million, or less than 2 percent of the total amount spent on air travel. But, the survey predicts, people will spend $8.9 billion buying air and other transportation services online by 2002. Of course, such rosy predictions fuel the high-tech industry and are often more useful to tech firms trying to raise venture capital than to people seriously forecasting business trends. But nobody disputes that use of these services is growing. Another TIAA survey published in November estimates that 6.3 million Americans used the Internet to make airline reservations in 1997, an increase of 19 percent over 1996.
Representatives of the online booking services admit that the price discrepancies we found using their products exist -- and that they are indeed inevitable, because each service draws on a slightly different database of flight information that is constantly changing. In addition, each performs searches in a slightly different manner. In other words, the services use technology that is incapable of consistently generating the best or lowest fares compared with other online booking sites.
The problem is that a consumer would be hard-pressed to learn this from the promotional material the services post prominently on their Web pages. Expedia's search engine promises to deliver "your low fare." ITN says it performs a "low fare search." "Lowest fare for your selected itinerary," boasts Preview Travel. "The lowest fares on the Internet," brags Travelocity.
But when asked whether the traveler can be certain of actually finding the lowest fare on a specific flight using only their services, spokesmen hedge and dodge.
"That's a difficult question," says Terry Jones, president of Travelocity's parent firm, the Sabre Group. "I don't know how anybody ever knows he's got the lowest fare. It's as volatile as stock prices. The prices and inventory are changing all the time."
Preview Travel was in the process of becoming a publicly traded company, so spokesmen were unable to make public statements about the service while we conducted interviews for this story.
John Herst, group product manager for Expedia, insists that Expedia can dependably find low fares. But he acknowledges that the entire pricing system is "very confusing. It's confusing for people in the industry."
All Web-based airline booking systems are really nothing more than a set of access tools -- user-friendly "front ends," in industry patois -- for one of four major computerized Central Reservation Systems, also known as Global Distribution Systems, that serve the travel industry. Each system is a massive database of flight and pricing information; all are owned and operated largely by airlines or firms owned by airline holding companies. The CRSs sell access to their databases to Internet-based booking services, as well as to travel agents, corporate travel offices and others in the travel industry, though folks in the trade don't use the same World Wide Web front ends. Most professionals use a more flexible but harder-to-learn system that provides more information than Web-based services do.
Two of the top Internet booking companies -- Preview Travel and ITN -- use Apollo, which is owned by United, US Airways and Air Canada. Expedia uses Worldspan, which is owned by Delta, Northwest, TWA and Abacus Distribution System, a CRS in the Asian Pacific market. Travelocity is powered by Sabre; American Airlines owns a majority of both Sabre and Travelocity.
The U.S. Department of Transportation mandates that the airlines share their pricing information equally with each CRS. While there have been questions for years about whether airlines can be trusted to publish competitors' fares equitably, at least by law each system should have identical access to identical information. But Joe Witherspoon, online product manager for ITN, points out that each CRS has a different schedule for updating fares.
"They [the airlines] are uploading millions of fares a day," he says. "And they are changing the availability hundreds of thousands of times per minute. A minute or two can make a big difference." In addition, low-priced leader Southwest is available only via Travelocity, making other sites' searches incomplete. And some very small carriers are not listed on any of the CRSs.
Chris Privett, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents, explains that many airlines aggressively practice "yield management," by which fares and availability are constantly adjusted according to demand and supply. Airline statisticians watch how seats priced at certain levels are selling. If they are not selling well, the price may go down. If they are selling well, the price may go up. Decisions are made minute to minute. All this information must be sent by the airlines to the CRSs -- or plucked from airline databases by the CRS itself -- which then update its database. Inevitably, their data management schedules and procedures differ, resulting in different information in each CRS.
Sabre's Jones says price fluctuations, coupled with inventory changes, account for many of the problems. "Fares change five to seven times daily," he says. "Inventory changes every second."
Josh Herst of Expedia agrees, but also points to technological differences.
"The search engines of different CRSs use different algorithms for searching their databases," he says. "Their databases may come up with different answers."
So, with all these moving variables -- plus the opportunity for human error causing delays, omissions and other mistakes -- how can the Internet booking services promise their users "lowest fares"?
ITN's Witherspoon is the most willing to acknowledge the limits of any single Web-based pricing service. "The only thing to do is to compare [quotes from different sources]," he says, adding that most members of the public don't understand all the nuances of travel booking and should use a travel agent. For those who read the small print, those admonishments are also contained in ITN's online instructions.
This may not be surprising, given that ITN is designed to serve travel agents as well as consumers, ensuring that agencies get a slice of the anticipated growth of Internet-based travel booking. Companies like Microsoft and Preview Travel, by contrast -- which are attempting to take business away from travel agents by providing consumers with direct, online access to air tickets, hotel bookings and other travel products -- insist that their services are essentially reliable, despite our findings.
They say many price discrepancies can be overcome if users perform rigorous and redundant searches (often described in linked pages of user "tips" accessible from the service's main Web page). For example, users should repeat fare searches using different dates, times, airlines and airports. And each service claims that it's important to use its related "lowest fare" listings to provide additional comparative information.
Travelocity's "Today's Lowest Fares" feature reports the lowest published fares between 14 of the country's largest markets and the restrictions associated with those low fares. Armed with this information, Sabre's Jones says, a user can then tailor an itinerary to meet those criteria and generate a similar fare. But the system has serious limitations. For one, information is available only for trips within the 14 large markets listed. And the tool, like a similar feature used by Expedia, does not take seat availability into account. "Whether a seat exists," Jones acknowledges, "is another question."
Jones says Travelocity is doing everything possible to assure that low fares are cited. The Sabre CRS system directly queries the airlines' data to ensure that inventory is as up to date as possible. Fares are updated six times daily.
He points out that consumers are guaranteed no better results if they use a travel agent or call an airline directly. "How do you know they're giving you the lowest fare?" he asks. Airline reservationists may know the products of their own airline very well, but they can't offer competitors' fares. And travel agencies typically have contracts with a single CRS, so they draw on information that can be as limited as that a consumer has using a single Web site -- though agents may be knowledgeable enough to extract useful buried data to help find a lower fare than a consumer can.
Expedia's Herst was more emphatic in his belief that a traveler can be assured of getting the lowest fare using Expedia alone, largely thanks to the service's "Fare Compare" feature. Fare Compare differs from Travelocity's "Today's Lowest Fares" in that it lists the lowest published fares between every commercial airport, not just those in 14 markets. Users can use Fare Compare as a low-price benchmark when researching their own flights, Herst says, a process he compares to learning an auto dealer's invoice cost.
Problem is, Fare Compare and Expedia's Travel Agent fare-finder are not always in sync. A recent review of Fare Compare's lowest published fares between Washington and San Francisco produced a fare of $296 on America West. But when Expedia was asked to price the same trip, it gave a fare of $251 on America West -- cheaper than the "lowest published fare."
Also, you can't make Expedia book all flights described in Fare Watcher. For example, on another day Fare Watcher produced a lowest published fare of $234 round trip on Western Pacific between Washington and San Francisco. But when we tried to get the fare on that airline, using different dates and times, Expedia never offered a Western Pacific flight.
Herst acknowledges that finding the lowest fare "may be difficult" because of restrictions on the number of seats and on dates the fare is offered. But he maintains that if the fare is not sold out, the determined consumer will eventually find it via Expedia by plugging in different dates, times and other variables.
The major players in the Internet travel booking industry are looking with interest and some dismay at a new product called IntelliTrip, designed to solve some of the price discrepancy problems. The software, launched this week by TheTrip.com, yet another Internet booking service, must be downloaded and installed on an individual's computer to operate. It aims to provide simultaneous access to the five major Internet booking services from a single front end.
After downloading the IntelliTrip software from the intellitrip.com Web page, a consumer fills out one profile to automatically register with Expedia, Travelocity, ITN, Preview Travel and TheTrip. A travel query made through IntelliTrip is simultaneously routed to all five Internet booking services, and results will be posted for each, allowing the traveler to compare fares.
Dave Schafer, spokesman for TheTrip.com, said the system "compares apples to apples. If you go from site to site to site, the fares may have changed," Schafer said.
But in a preview test of the service before public launching, the product was buggy and inconsistent. Flights chosen as lowest-priced by the different booking services are frequently not the same flights, so the system does not always compare apples to apples. It was difficult to get responses from Travelocity and Expedia via IntelliTrip, resulting in incomplete data. And some really odd matches -- like a US Airways flight in one direction and an AirTran flight return -- were sometimes chosen.
Schafer hesitated when asked whether the Internet booking services have been supportive of IntelliTrip. "We notified all of the major booking services of the site," he says, adding that his company believes the new site is "a good deal for everybody."
ASTA's Privett says he recently needed to fly to Wichita, Kan., on the spur of the moment. He dialed into Travelocity and got a round-trip fare of $1,300 on TWA. He called his travel agent and was told that he could fly round trip on the same flights for $311.
"For all I know, it was the same seat," he said.
Privett predictably touted the use of agents during a time of touchy, twitchy technological evolution.
"The Internet gives us a vast amount of information," he said. "But there's a difference between having all that information and having knowledge about that information. I can look up the Harvard Medical Dictionary on the Internet, but that doesn't make me a doctor."
But for the millions of consumers for whom saving $25 or $50 or $100 per ticket is very important, the question looms: What's the best route to a low air fare nowadays?
A savvy travel agent can save you an enormous amount of time by doing all the screenwork for you -- though in our experience, they must be directed, repeatedly and assertively, to devote serious time to plumbing for rock-bottom fares. And not all agents are experienced enough to use the system's patterns, tricks and tics to their clients' advantage. You might want to validate your travel agent's low quote with your own research on the Internet.
If you want to go it alone, your best bet is to become acquainted with at least three of the Internet booking services, establish customer profiles and log-ins with each, and spend the time putting your trip -- and its various variables -- through all three services. Yes, this is time-consuming and tedious; it can take three or four hours for a simple trip. Be aware that the more flexible you can be -- by trying different airports at both ends, and a variety of times, dates and airlines -- the more likely you are to come up with a low fare. You'll also need to check low-budget airlines that serve your destination via their own Web sites or 800 numbers, as some of them aren't listed on Web-based booking services.
Or you can attack the problem the old-fashioned way: Call the airports you might want to fly out of, determine which carriers provide service to your destination, and call each airline directly. Be prepared to talk to several reservationists for each airline. Bring a crossword puzzle or some knitting.
But one thing is clear: For all the information they can deliver to your desktop, none of the World Wide Web-based travel booking sites can consistently and dependably deliver you the lowest air fares. Ignore all hype to the contrary. The ubiquitous promise of "lowest air fares" is one thing available on the Internet that nobody should buy.

I have been busy writing a new m/m romance. The theme is darker, a forbidden prison romance between a guard and a prisoner. This is not for the fainthearted, or for those that love a sweet-fluffy romance.

Nate is not a man that is easily read, and his motives are questionable. Does he love Alfie, or is the smitten young guard a means of escape...

Self-styled "psychological illusionist" Derren Brown will hold a gun to his head containing a single bullet put there by a member of the public.
He will fire the 348 Smith & Wesson five times at his head before firing the last shot - presumably containing the bullet - harmlessly away from his body.
"The psychological illusionist will play Russian roulette LIVE," said Channel 4's publicity for the show, due to go out this Sunday. "This is the first time a stunt of this kind has been performed on British television."
But unknown to viewers, strict broadcast regulations mean the programme, Derren Brown Plays Russian Roulette Live, must be aired "as live" after a delay of several seconds.
If anything goes wrong on Sunday, viewers will not see it. Station bosses will pull the plug and the screen will go blank, accompanied by an "appropriate message" informing viewers of what had happened.
"It is preferable to the alternative," said Brown, who admitted he would pull out of the stunt if he was not totally convinced it would work.
"If I am not 100% sure, I will not pull the trigger. It would be humiliating but it would be preferable to the other consequences. It is a real gun with a real bullet and I am really putting it against my head."
Five members of the public have been chosen from 12,000 hopefuls to take part in the show. Following a series of rigorous psychological tests, Brown will choose one of them to load the bullet into the gun, with each of its chambers numbered one to six.
Brown will then ask the "assistant" - standing behind bullet proof glass - to read out the numbers one to six, from which he will attempt to deduce into which chamber the bullet has been loaded. He will then fire the gun a total of five times into his head.
Brown said his task was no different to the age-old trick of finding an object under one of six cups.
"Russian Roulette is just an expansion of that same game," he said. "If I freak out about the gun and the bullet then it's not going to work. It's all about picking the right person, the person I feel most comfortable with. There have been moments when I've got a bit wobbly about it, but it's about keeping a distance."
The stunt will take place overseas - Brown would not reveal where - because it contravenes UK gun laws. But Brown denied accusations the stunt could lead to a string of copycat shootings.
Rick Naylor, vice president of the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales, said the stunt sent out the "entirely the wrong message" and could "end up with some tragedies."
"It does not glamorise gun violence," said Brown. "We are dealing with it in the most serious and strenuous way possible. The drama will not come from the gun part, but from the fun and games and entertainment that comes from the selection process."
Brown revealed he had recently re-written his will but was keeping that "private". He said his brother Dominic was so nervous about the stunt he had gone overseas.
Asked why he was apparently willing to risk his life on "live" TV, Brown replied: "It's not really about the money. I wanted to do something that would make exciting TV, and I wanted to find out if I could do it. You are always trying to push the boundaries, to push things forward."
And of David Blaine's stunt above the Thames, in which the American is attempting to stay in a box for 44 days, Brown said: "David is a good friend of mine. He is one of a long line of magicians doing big public stunts, but I would not be in a box doing that. We are all performers and we all choose what areas we want to push."

The 163MW site would be one of the largest in the UK, following on from the 350MW Cleve Hill Solar Farm which received development consent in 2020. Image: Andreas Gücklhorn (Unsplash).
BayWa r.e. is planning the development of a 163MW solar project in South Derbyshire.
The renewables developer is also looking to incorporate a 37.5MW battery energy storage on the site.
The project would be sited across two parcels of land on land west of the village of Rosliston, and east of Walton on Trent.
It will be connected to the national grid via an overhead cable to Drakelow Substation, which is located to the north of the site that lies on open, agricultural land.
The layout of both sites will be designed to protect public footpaths, with landscaping measures introduced such as improving the network of hedgerows to screen the site from external view.
Oaklands will sit across two sites connected by an overhead cable. Image: BayWa r.e.
BayWa r.e. is currently undertaking an Environmental Impact assessment for the site, with a scoping request already submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in relation to the project. This looks to ascertain the parameters of the environmental and technical assessments and surveys.
These preliminary surveys will help inform early technical work as the company develops the proposals for the scheme, said Ashley McInnes, project manager at Oaklands Solar Farm, the BayWa r.e. subsidiary and special purpose vehicle (SPV) established to house the development.
“Wherever possible, we’re looking at how we can best align this project with existing and emerging carbon reduction targets at a national level, as well as seeking opportunities to contribute to the climate agenda, community benefit and supply chain at a local level.”
Given the scale of the proposed development, Oaklands will submit its application to the Planning Inspectorate under the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) regime in late 2022.
The inspectorate will examine this and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, who then makes the decision whether to grant or refuse development consent.
Over the course of the pre-application period across 2021 and early 2022 both informal and formal consultations will run, as BayWa r.e. looks to take a pro-active role in public engagement.
“As part of this commitment, we will be consulting extensively with local residents and relevant stakeholders as we bring forward our application,” added McInnes. “We look forward to confirming further details about this and methods for providing feedback over the course of the next few months.”
BayWa r.e. has developed 31 solar projects in the UK with a total cumulative capacity of approximately 536MW. In July it also acquired 99.8MW of subsidy-free colocated solar sites from UK developer JBM Solar, as it continued to expand its operations in the market.
Oaklands forms one of four mega solar projects registered with the Planning Inspectorate in the UK, along with the 120MW Little Crow Solar Farm put forward by Hampshire-based INRG Solar in 2018 and Longfield Solar Energy Farm in Essex registered in 2020.
The fourth is the only project to have so far been granted development consent by the energy secretary, receiving the go ahead in May 2020. Cleve Hill Solar Park – a 350MW site near Faversham, in Kent – is a joint venture between Hive Energy and Wirsol, which was originally submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in 2017.cheap nba Jerseys from china cheap nba Jerseys china Can leave you wondering.

Part of our 'Meet the Members' campaign
Sweet Treats has been one of Kirkgate Arcade’s best hidden gems for many years, but over the past 4 years Sally Waterhouse and partner Ian Bedford (pictured), have turned this little sweet shop into a multi-faceted business and one of Otley’s biggest Covid success stories.
Whilst Ian is ‘The Face’ of the shop and loves serving his many and long standing customers, Sally has grown the business on Facebook with her sweetie cones, boxes, hampers, wedding tables, classic pick ‘n’ mix and sourcing confectionery from across the pond.
They turned the shop into a packing station during lockdown and Ian delivered to Otley, Pool, Burley, Menston, Guiseley and Pudsey - and they haven’t looked back. Now you can get your sweets either in the shop or delivered with a minimum spend of £5 via their Facebook page!
We challenge you to try and find something they don’t stock or can’t get hold of - you won’t!

A dancing duo have shown incredible strength and resilience during this beautiful dance using wheelchairs.
Marisa Hamamoto and her dance partner Piotr Iwanicki, demonstrate their grace and talent during a performance of the dance with extreme lifts throughout, filmed early February, in Los Angeles, California, USA.
Pic by @InfiniteFlowDance/Caters News
Piotr was born with spina bifida, a birth defect in which a developing baby’s spinal cord fails to develop properly, and is a world champion wheelchair ballroom dancer.
Marisa said: “While I was a senior at university, I suddenly became paralysed from the neck down during a contemporary dance class.
Pic by @InfiniteFlowDance/Caters News
“The following day I was diagnosed with a rare stroke called spinal cord infarction and was told by the doctor that I may never walk or dance again.
“I regained most of my mobility fairly quickly and walked out of the hospital after two months.”
Infinite Flow, which was founded in 2015, is America’s first professional wheelchair ballroom dance company and uses dance as a vehicle to mainstream inclusion and eliminate the stigma around disability.
Pic by @InfiniteFlowDance/Caters News
This dance is an example of how Infinite Flow ‘erases the boundaries between dancers with and without disabilities’ and shows how through extensive development of trust, they’re able to push the boundaries.
Marisa said: “I have a vision to build a world class inclusive dance company that leads a global social movement for inclusion through dance.”

I’d gotten to the most delicious part of the article – the food – when I heard a familiar click. There was a brief pause, another click, and then a low chuckle. I glanced over the second floor railing, which was draped with a gorgeous silk Turkish carpet we had been admiring all afternoon. The hotel owner and another man sat under a broad-leafed tree playing backgammon so fast that I could hardly see their hands move.
After winning a brief struggle with my work ethic I marched down the broad stone steps to the table, explained that I was an enthusiastic backgammon player, and asked if I could watch the match. They politely agreed, and beckoned for me to sit with them. The next 45 minutes were outrageously entertaining. Both men were experts and it was evident that they had played hundreds of games together. They passed the smallest pair of dice I had ever seen back and forth at blinding speed, making savvy, dangerous moves that I would never have thought of trying. We didn’t chat at all, but I think they secretly loved having a tall blond enthusiastic American lady for an audience, so they played even more aggressively than usual. They seldom spoke, but smiled when one or the other made a particularly delicious or sometimes a bad move.
Finally, my guilty conscience propelled me to trudge back up the stairs to my task, and a few minutes later I was surprised to see the owner coming across the terrace toward me. I was alarmed when I saw the board under his harm. “Oh, my God,” I thought, “he wants me to play backgammon with him and I will be humiliated.” I have played the game for decades, and can win often, but he was on an entirely different level. He held out the board and said, “This is a gift from the hotel. Such a devoted player deserves a proper board.”
I was speechless. It was one of the nicest surprises and certainly the most charming gift I could imagine. Although we travel light, the backgammon board from the Caravanserail Hotel is one item which has earned its place in our caravan of luggage no matter what!

newsroom@vaildaily.com
Steven DeWitt |
AVON — Each year, the Colorado Watershed Assembly, the Colorado Foundation for Water Education and the Colorado Riparian Association team up to host the Sustaining Colorado Watershed Conference. This year the conference will be held in Avon and the theme is “Water: What is the New Normal?”
Experts and stakeholders from around the state will be discussing this issue at length throughout the three-day conference, and local organizations have teamed up with the Colorado Foundation for Water Education for a unique opportunity to involve the local community in this complex and important conversation.
DeWitt’s mission.”
Exploring ‘the new normal’
The community is invited to join in on this informal photo display and information session to learn how DeWitt is using his compelling imagery of the Eagle River watershed to answer the guiding question of the conference: “What is the new normal?”
DeWitt’s Lodgepole Project, a visual story of the unprecedented mountain pine beetle epidemic is a fine example of this sort of expose and one that he will focus on at today’s session.
This will also be an opportunity to mingle with conference attendees possessing a wide range of expertise and experience from around the state.

I don’t believe life is “trial and error”. There are no errors. “Try and try again” or “try and begin again”. So, why do we beat ourselves up again and again when we become out of alignment?
I noticed today that I would get annoyed and then get annoyed at myself that I let myself get out of alignment. It’s just a viscous cycle. Everyone who is alive gets out of alignment once in a while, no exceptions. So, give yourself a break... and begin again.
Blessings,
Kim

There are plenty of things you can do with a hardboiled egg or a the guts of a hollowed out egg, but sometimes you just need to crack one into a bowl. Now, what to do with the shell?
Isn’t that precious?
It’s pretty easy. I’m pretty sure you can figure this out, but just in case, here is a little video I made for Paas.
I was thinking this would be a super cute idea for collecting those early spring buds like baby daffodils or lilies of the valley, but alas it is still snowing over here and I made do with store-bought forsythia. I don’t think the Easter Bunny will mind half as much as I do.
Happy Easter!

Being out of nanny camera range doesn’t mean they’ll get away with smacking a toddler or stuffing him with Fritos.
The website is most popular in New York, where nannies are so often in public areas. When our son was young and being transported to play dates, I would happily have put a “How’s my driving?” bumper sticker on our car. We not only gave prospective nannies driving tests, but provided lessons to Liz from Great Britain as she'd never driven on the right side of the road. After hiring her, we discovered we should have given her a sobriety test.
It takes little urging, okay none, for me to offer my opinion. Last night I spoke up about the olive oil, the only flaw at a new restaurant we tried. A friend once teased that I carry an imaginary clipboard and red pencil. I always welcome a chance to weigh in, reviewing hotels on Trip Advisor and assessing appliances on Epinions. On my AOL Buddy List is the CEO of my health club, to whom I report regularly. A typical e-mail is, “The TV’s still aren’t working and a trainer left a wad of chewing gum on the treadmill.”
Will this deputizing catch on? Might it lead to:

As a UF/IFAS multi-county tropical aquaculture Extension agent nearly 30 years ago, Craig Watson was doing his best to teach fish farmers in Hillsborough and Polk counties everything he knew. But Watson and other Extension faculty needed more data to share.
“I had a microscope and a water-quality kit, but we didn’t have the resources to really dig into what was going on and to provide answers to farmers,” said Watson.
In 1996, using a National Weather Service surplus building in Ruskin — about 25 miles south of Tampa — an adjacent fish farm and seed funding from several groups, UF/IFAS built what is now the Tropical Aquaculture Lab. Faculty, staff and tropical fish farmers are now celebrating the lab’s 25th anniversary.
The lab consists of a 5,000-square-foot office and disease lab, a 6.5-acre fish farm, five greenhouses 48 ponds and a hatchery building.
Courtesy, UF/IFAS photography.
“How cool is it that the state has this unique and complex vibrant tropical fish industry?” said Watson, the only director the lab has ever had. “And how cool is it that we were able to create a land-grant program with teaching, research and Extension? We work with an industry that has more than 1,000 species of fish, along with their varying farming and production methods. It’s been really exciting.”
Through TAL’s research and Extension, tropical fish farmers and aquarium enthusiasts save millions of dollars annually, said Watson.
For example, due to an early project that UF completed, Florida farms are now producing millions of neon tetras each year, Watson said.
It’s not just that they develop methods to grow new fish. Those same farmers bring them diseased fish, and the lab’s on-site fish veterinarian, Roy Yanong and his team diagnose the illness and prescribe medication. Recently, Yanong worked with farmers in Polk and Hillsborough counties — along with scientists at the main UF campus in Gainesville — to develop a vaccine for a sick fish species. That vaccine saved the farmers $12 million in one year.
In addition to research, TAL faculty also conduct outreach to tell fish farmers about new findings from the lab and from Gainesville. Those findings include analyzing the risks of non-native species surviving if they get loose, and what impacts they might have if established. The farms and state agencies can then use this information to decide what species are safe, and how they should be raised to prevent problems in our environment.
Faculty at the lab also mentor UF/IFAS graduate students, meeting the teaching element of the UF/IFAS land-grant mission. Employers across the nation covet the lab’s graduates and the important workforce development aspect of the lab.
“I get at least one email per week, asking me who’s graduating from the lab soon and if they’re available for job interviews,” Watson said, only too eager to tout soon-to-be alumni for careers in aquaculture.

-The Russian ruble plunged past the mark of 70 to the British pound on Thursday morning amid an ongoing currency rout driven by weak oil prices and Western sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine.
A pound was worth 70.14 rubles on Monday morning as the ruble fell sharply following the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement that it was ending its quantitative-easing program and ahead of a meeting of the Russian Central Bank on Friday.
The ruble was the world's worst performing currency over the last three months, according to data from Bloomberg.
The ruble has lost 37 percent of its value against the pound since Oct. 30 last year and 22.3 percent since the beginning of 2014. Just seven weeks ago, a pound was worth less than 60 rubles.Robert D Neill is categorized under Cash Grains (Unclassified) in Cummings, KS and active since 2004.

April 30, 2019
On April 15 and 16, the famous and beloved Notre Dame Cathedral located in Paris, France went up in flames. The fire quickly spread throughout the building’s attic and spir; a 300-foot structure on top of the cathedral. The roof of Notre Dame eventually collapsed as a result of the fire.
The cause of the fire has yet to been officially determined. The fire started while the cathedral was undergoing construction. Some of the church is now destroyed, but much of it thankfully still remains. Much of the original structure avoided damage and is still standing.
Notre Dame is one of France’s most famous monuments. It is an example of French Gothic architecture, and the building was built in 1163.
As one of the most famous landmarks for travelers from around the world, the partial destruction of the cathedral was a sad moment for many. People took to social media to share photos and memories of Notre Dame.
Some notable millionaires and billionaires, as well as ordinary citizens, have pledged to donate money to help rebuild the historic church. This sparked praise from some, but backlash from others who said that their money could be better used for other causes.
Overall, this tragedy has caused much of the world to come together in hopes of rebuilding Notre Dame Cathedral and keeping the rich history of the church alive.

We will then recommend and discuss a dental plan for your pet in regards to preventative and maintenance care as well as any treatment plan that may be required.
We are offering a 15% Discount on all Dental Procedures booked by September 15th and performed by October 1st. All such dentals will go in for a draw to WIN a bag of “dental friendly goodies”.
However, your pet’s DENTAL HEALTH is an ALL YEAR ROUND concern at our Practices! During the course of any consultation or vaccination examination we will always assess your pet’s dental health. Members of our Pet Value Plans also receive a 15% discount on dental procedures throughout the year – a considerable saving on such procedures.
Does Your Pet Have Dental Disease?
Statistics show that about 80 per cent of adult dogs and cats have some degree of dental disease, which becomes more severe with age.
See our Video Link regards Oral Health for your pet. Courtesy of Virbac Pet Health.
We want to remind people that good oral care is important to maintain the best possible health and quality of life for all pets and are promoting the three ‘D’s’ for pet oral health.
These are ideally:
DENTAL CHECK-UP WITH VET.
DENTAL FRIENDLY DIET.
DAILY CLEANING THE TEETH.
Dental homecare is crucial in maintaining good oral health in our canine and feline patients.
Our comprehensive dental services: If your pet requires treatment for his or her dental problem then we are able to perform dental procedures such as ultrasonic scaling and polishing of teeth, extractions of problem teeth and minor oral surgery. We are also able to perform high quality dental xrays to help us in selecting teeth that may need extracting and thus avoiding future issues with such teeth. These procedures are always carried out under general anaesthesia and we always deliver peri-operative and post-operative pain control to accompany the procedure. Restoration of teeth ( fillings, root canal, capping) and major oral surgery (excision of tumours) may occasionally have to be referred to specialist veterinary dentists.

That is the line I often use to ensure my husband replaces everything back to their place once he is done using them. While organizing and being neat is a compulsion of mine, I never really paid attention to the vessels aka furniture that carries our things from more than a functional point of view, that is until I came across these designs! Who knew a shelf could be so much more? These transforming, smart and extremely useful designs are the perfect mix of functionality and aesthetics, making them perfect for every home!
Designed to be compact enough to fit into any space, yet comfortable enough to have you sink right in with your favorite book, the Conch by Wei He comes with a molded-plywood inner body and a dual-density foam outer body, giving it structure as well as supple softness. The chair’s form conforms to the contours of the body, allowing you to sit comfortably, while also conveniently having a storage unit right under you for everything from books to a cushion to other bric-a-brac. It’s the perfect reading spot for one!
The Becky Corner Shelf by Noook comprises of a selection of stackable shelves, that turn even pointless little corners into useful storage spaces. This one’s been crafted just for your bathroom!
Vasco Cabral’s The SHELF is furniture installation made incredibly easy. With two wooden sleeves that slide against one another, The SHELF can be mounted on any drywall just simply by pushing it in. When you push forward, the outer sleeve slides towards the wall, prompting a mechanism in the inner sleeve to deploy incredibly small but powerful hooks that lock into the wall (I suspect they do this diagonally). When locked, they’re so firm that the shelves can take the weight of two cinder blocks (the largest TheShelf can carry as much as 30 lbs) without breaking a sweat. If you ever want to relocate the shelf, just pulling the outer sleeve with moderate force allows the hooks to disengage, and the shelf to detach from the drywall.
In urban homes, one often has to compromise on the kind of furniture they would like because there isn’t enough space to have a separate piece for each function – in this case, Alessio Romano’s Orte saves the space you would need for a full shelf and a mirror by blending them into one. Its limestone base supports a rotating wooden frame with the mirror on one side and six hidden shelves on the other. The pop of red brightens up the corner where the furniture will be and stretched oblong shape makes it easy to fit in any corner. It can be used as a dresser, a bookshelf, or the stuff you need to grab quickly without it being on display always.
The KUR!O was featured here on YD after Markus Hofko of Von Morgen won a Gold A’ Design Award, and has, since then, developed and refined into a product that consumers can now buy and own. The construction hasn’t changed much fundamentally, but a few tweaks make it more durable and allow you to even dock dowels/pegs into it to hang items like keys, photos, or that dreamcatcher you bought at the flea market. The base of the shape-shifting, the infinitely customizable shelf is its underlying grid, made from sandwiched wood-fiber boards. The cuts in the grid go as much as 20mm deep, allowing you press-fit powder-coated steel panels into it. The steel panels come in a variety of colors, giving the KUR!O its uniquely vibrant appeal, and feature carefully-placed cuts that let individual panels interlock into each other. The 2mm thick panels are heavy-duty enough to take on large loads, making the KUR!O robust, despite the fact that there isn’t any screwing or gluing of parts.
This conceptual side-display-table by Zinus Inc. comes either from a place of complete vanity or sheer creativity, but nevertheless, the Photo Table definitely feels like an instant must-have. Imagine never having to worry about setting up your mini-studio for a product photo-shoot. Just place it on a table, point some lights through the table’s diffuser-hood, and there you have it….perfect images for posting online. And the best part of it is not having to pack your studio up after you’re done because it goes right back to being a piece of furniture that sits somewhere in the living-room-space of your quirky studio apartment.

GATE’s designer Artem Zakharchenko identified that a shelving unit only occasionally holds the same items for its entire life, more often than not the items will be swapped out over time and the environment that it is placed in will change, therefore the product needs to be able to adapt to this. Being able to choose where you want the shelves to be positioned is just the beginning! The ‘zones’ allow for the unit to be used as a wardrobe, storage for wine glasses, shoe shelving or even a small desk! This level of adaptability makes GATE perfect for use in the home as well as commercial environments such as bars and restaurants. I know I want one!
Made completely out of wood, the Twofold reinterprets a traditional wooden connection, turning the product into a hinge itself. Made from plywood with a melamine coating, the Twofold can simply be mounted on any wall. Without any external fittings i.e., hinges, flap-holders, Studio Michael Hilgers for Müller Möbelwerkstätten designed the Twofold to open and close, turning into a neat bookshelf when you need it to be, and a rather comfortable work desk when you want it, without disrupting the arrangement of objects kept on your shelf. Elegant, isn’t it?
Studio NINE’s Lego compatible furniture aims at being a playground for your children. The furniture comes with a machined textured layer that’s all too familiar. Made from Corian, the polymer-based marble substitute, the furniture has a premium feel and a simple design… The purpose of this simple design being twofold. It can either blend well into a house with Scandinavian styling, or can be infinitely decorated by using pieces of Lego that just simply snap onto the furniture’s dot-embossed surface. Yes, it also means lesser chances of your foot accidentally stepping on a loose piece of Lego lying around on the floor… Plus, like Lego itself, the furniture is perfect for all people of all ages!

Six men were arrested for allegedly attempting to meet a child for sex.
The suspects included a man who traveled from Wisconsin, a man from Titusville and a man from South Carolina who worked in the Orlando area. The remainder of the men are from Orange County.
During the month of April, the Sexual Offenders Surveillance Squad conducted "Operation Orange Crush".
Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the intent is to crush predators who have been preying upon children via the internet for sex.
The ages of the suspects range from a 20-year-old college student to a 64-year-old man.
The sheriff said this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the community.
"We want it to be known that we are monitoring these type of communications and we will take every action that we can to arrest the individual and bring them to justice," Demings said.
Operation Orange Crush also targeted sexual offenders and sexual predators who have failed to comply with the registration requirements under Florida-law, making 13 additional arrests.4 October 2018

Last month I mentioned The Void. I’m fairly confident that most of us are familiar with our own Voids. Mine seems to take on the shape, colour, and characteristics of an astronomical Black Hole. For others, it might appear as a barren wasteland or a stagnant lagoon. At any rate, it is that unseen force that seems to suck the life right out of us, drain us dry, paint life with a hopeless brush, stagnate rather than stimulate. Life may seem empty and pointless. We tend to want to fill that void or aerate that wilderness in order not to feel the vastness, the emptiness, the aridness, the stagnation.
Since then, it has come to my attention that The Void may not be a vacuous Black Hole after all. I have already mentioned that we can accept The Void and choose not to fill it. My journey now takes that conclusion one step (or spiral) further—or in another direction depending on how your journey make look. Journeys tend not to be linear progressions.
The word we are looking for is Spaciousness. Once I have accepted and allow for the existence of The Void, it provides an opportunity to look at it from another angle. From this new vantage point, the void appears expansive, limitless, open to infinite possibilities. Does this make you think of any other time in history when seemingly nothing begat something? For the person who shared this idea of spaciousness with me, it reminded him of God creating something out of nothing. I like that association. Even for those who hold to the Big Bang Theory—something still came out of nothing. Viewing the ‘negative space’ of my existence as opportunity-for-explosion is rather exciting—and hopeful—don’t you think?
There may yet come something out of my nothing. It may be influenced by a Creative Presence or self-combustion. Either way, change is inevitable. My Void or Spaciousness will not look or feel the same. Reminds me of art class and learning the value of ‘negative space’—and how good use of negative space enhances the focal point rather than detracts from it. That’s what I want for my ‘negative space’—for it to enhance what is already taking shape or forming in the innermost of my being. Who knows what will burst forth next?
What might be brewing or fomenting in the hidden regions of your being? Any explosions worth mentioning? Might be a good idea not to mess with it. No use filling that emptiness with stuff that might inhibit a process already underway. Rather, take a step back and appreciate the view. That Black Hole might turn out to be a galaxy of stars sparkling in a deep night sky.Today, we are pleased to share that the Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) announced that three coveted Thea Awards will honor the talent of Walt Disney Imagineering in 2022.

Please watch it, and answer the following questions. Be sure to refer to specific concepts/theories/research (from the book) that you see playing out in the episode (include the page number/chapter sectionof where you found these concepts when you bring them up).

Describe HOW they are treating each child differently Which child gets the better treatment? The worse treatment? What is the effect on the child who gets worse treatment?What types of discipline techniques do you see the parents using before supernanny intervenes (inductive discipline, self-oriented induction, other-oriented induction, command strategy, relationship maintenance, love withdrawal, psychological control, power assertion)? Choose 2 of these strategies and provide a specific example from the film that demonstrates each. Then describe what discipline techniques supernanny teaches the parents.Before Supernanny intervenes, which parenting style is each parent displaying (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, or disengaged)? Why do you think he/she is displaying this style? Please describe 1 example of behavior. (Note: One parents might be using 2 different styles – one with each child…)from each parent (from the video) that makes you believe they fall into this parenting style.Table 13.2 describes the outcome that we can expect from children based on what parenting styles their parents use. What outcomes/types of behavior do we see from the kids? Are these the typical types of behaviors we would expect from a child being raised according to the parenting styles we see in the video.

Both the sun and the moon exert a gravitational pull on the earth, which, according to their relative positions, create different energetic cycles and experiences. The new moon energy corresponds to a contracting, downward moving energy that may make us feel reflective and grounded, but also heavy and less inclined towards exerting ourselves physically. The full moon energy corresponds to an expansive, upward moving energy that may make us feel more energetic and emotional, but less grounded.
Through regular, continuous practice of Ashtanga yoga, we expand our consciousness, creating a self-awareness that not only includes ourselves, but also our relation to the environment and the universe. By observing the moon days, we attune ourselves to the natural cycles and rhythms of the universe, so that we can live in greater harmony with nature and the environment.)Mr.Vivekanand Korishetti

Introduction
A.M. 3004. B.C. 1000.
Verses 1-3
Proverbs 13:1-3. A wise son, &c. Houbigant translates this verse, “A wise son regardeth the instruction of his father; but a son who is a scorner heareth not rebuke.” A man shall eat good Shall receive much comfort, credit, and benefit to himself; by the fruit of his mouth By his wise and profitable discourses; but the soul That is, the person, as the word soul often signifies; of the transgressors Of those that transgress with their lips, which seems to be the meaning here; shall eat violence Shall have that violence and injury returned upon themselves, which they have offered to others in word or deed. He that keepeth his mouth Namely, shut; that speaks sparingly, and with due care and caution; keepeth his life
Prevents many sins and mischiefs which others run into; but he that openeth wide his lips That takes the liberty of speaking whatever he pleases, or all that comes into his mind; shall have destruction From God or men.
Verse 4
Proverbs 13:4. The sluggard desireth and hath nothing Because he contents himself with lazy desires, without diligent endeavours; but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat He shall be enriched with the fruit of his own labours.
Verse 5
Proverbs 13:5. A righteous man hateth lying Both in himself and in other men, whereby he gets that good name, which is like a precious ointment; but a wicked man Who accustoms himself to lying; cometh to shame
Makes himself contemptible and hateful to all that know him; there being scarcely any reproach which men endure more impatiently, or revenge more severely, than that of being called or accounted liars.
Verse 7
Proverbs 13:7. There is that maketh himself rich, &c. Some men, who have little or nothing, pretend to have great riches, and carry themselves accordingly; either out of pride and vanity, or with a design to gain reputation with others, whom they intend to defraud. There is that maketh himself poor, &c. Some rich men seem and profess themselves to be very poor, that they may preserve and increase their estates, by concealing them from those who would either desire a share in them , or take them away by deceit and violence. Some, however, think the sense of the verse.”
Verse 8
Proverbs 13:8. The ransom of a man’s life are his riches This verse is considered by some as setting forth the several advantages of riches and poverty. Riches enable a man to redeem his life when it is in the greatest danger, and poverty preserves a man from those rebukes and injuries which endanger, and oft destroy the rich. Others again consider it as showing the convenience of poverty above riches. Riches frequently expose men to the peril of losing their lives by false accusers, thieves, or tyrants, which they are forced to redeem with the loss of their riches; whereas poverty commonly secures men not only from such kinds of death, but even from rebukes and injuries; partly because the poor are cautions that they may not offend or provoke others; and partly because their persons and actions are neglected and slighted, and they are esteemed objects of pity. Bishop Patrick paraphrases the passage in the latter of these senses, thus: “Rich men are not always so happy as they are imagined; for their wealth sometimes only serves to make them accused of high crimes, and then to bring them off with a huge sum of money, which they pay to save their lives; but nobody is apt to find fault with the poor, or to bring any charge against them.” Dr. Waterland renders the latter clause, The poor heareth no disturbance.
Verse 9
Proverbs 13:9. The light of the righteous rejoiceth, &c. Or, as Schultens renders it, The light of the righteous shall shine forth joyfully; but the darkening lamp of the wicked shall be put out See note on Proverbs 4:18-19. The meaning seems to be, 1st, The comfort of good men is flourishing and lasting; their prosperity increases and makes them glad. 2d, The comfort of bad men is withering and dying; their lamp burns dim and faint; it looks melancholy, like a taper in an urn; and it will shortly be put out in litter darkness, Isaiah 50:11.
Verse 10
Proverbs 13:10. Only by pride cometh contention This is not to be understood exclusively, as to all other causes of contention; for contentions often spring from ignorance, or mistake, or covetousness, or other passions; but eminently, because, as pride bloweth up those coals of contention, which other passions kindle, so oftentimes pride alone, without any other cause, stirreth up strife; which it doth by making a man self-conceited in his opinions, and obstinate in his resolutions, and impatient of any opposition: and many other ways; but with the well-advised Who are not governed by their own passions, but by prudent consideration, and the good counsel of others; is wisdom Which teacheth them to avoid and abhor all contention. “Melancthon,” says Bishop Patrick, “singled out for the observation of his scholars two remarkable sentences of this chapter, of which this is one; and upon it he reminds them of the Greek proverb, Ορος ορειου μιγνυται , A mountain cannot mix with a mountain, that is, two high men will never agree together; and of another excellent saying among the Latins, Crede mihi, sapere est non multum sapere, Believe me, to be wise, is not to be over wise. For they whose minds are infected with a vain opinion of themselves, either cannot see the truth, if it be against their thoughts; or, if they do, they will not acknowledge it, for fear they should yield and confess themselves overcome.”
Verse 11
Proverbs 13:11. Wealth gotten by vanity By vain, or deceitful, or wicked practices; shall be diminished Because the curse of God attends it, and the same corrupt dispositions which incline men to sinful ways of getting riches will incline them to the like sinful ways of spending them. Wealth gotten by vanity will be bestowed upon vanity, and then it will be diminished. That which is obtained by such employments as are not lawful, or not becoming Christians; as by gaming, by the stage, or by any employment which only serves to feed the pride and luxury of mankind, may as truly be said to be gotten by vanity, as that which is got by fraud and lying, and will be diminished; but he that gathereth by labour By diligence in an honest calling; shall increase Through the divine blessing, and his property and influence will become greater instead of growing less.
Verse 12
Proverbs 13:12. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick The delay of that which a man eagerly desires and expects is such an affliction, that it differs little from a lingering disease; but when the desire cometh When the good desired and expected is obtained. It is a tree of life That is, most sweet, satisfactory, and reviving to the soul.
Verses 13-14
Proverbs 13:13-14. Whoso despiseth Or wilfully and presumptuously disobeys, the word Namely, the word of God, which is called the word, by way of eminence; shall be destroyed Except he repent and return to obedience. But he that feareth the commandment That hath a reverence to its authority, and is afraid to violate it; shall be rewarded He makes God his friend, who will certainly reward him for his obedience. The law of the wise The doctrine, instruction, or counsel of holy men, who are commonly called wise, as sinners are called fools, in this book; is a fountain of life Sending forth streams of living water, and affording both refreshment and comfort to all that will partake thereof; to depart from the snares of death Enabling them to repel the temptations of Satan, and keeping them at a distance from the snares of sin, and therefore from the snares of death, into which they run that forsake the law of the wise.
Verse 15
Proverbs 13:15. Good understanding Discovering itself by a man’s holy and righteous practices; giveth favour Maketh a man acceptable both to God and men; but the way of transgressors Their conduct, or manner of conversation is hard; Hebrew, איתן , rough, as this very word is rendered Deuteronomy 21:4; it is offensive to God and men, as rough ways are to travellers; fierce, intractable, and incorrigible. Bishop Patrick interprets the verse thus: “If a man have understanding enough to be thoroughly good, he will find things favourable to his honest desires; but they that take evil courses meet with great difficulties, and are forced to go backward and forward, and wind and turn every way, to bring about their ends, or save themselves perhaps from ruin.”
Verse 17
Proverbs 13:17. A wicked messenger Who is unfaithful in the execution of the business committed to his charge; falleth into mischief Shall not escape punishment from God, or from them who sent him; but a faithful ambassador is health Procures safety and benefit, as to his master, so also to himself.
Verse 18
Proverbs 13:18. Poverty, &c., shall be to him, that refuseth instruction Whereby he might have been preserved from destructive and dishonourable courses; but he that regardeth reproof That considers it seriously, receives it kindly, and reforms himself by it; shall be honoured And enriched, which is to be inferred from the former branch. Not indeed that it is always the case, but commonly, and when God sees it will be good for a man. Or, if he do not gain riches, he shall certainly have honour both from God and good men.
Verse 19
Proverbs 13:19 . The desire accomplished is sweet Whatsoever men earnestly desire the enjoyment of, it is sweet to them; therefore sinners rejoice in the satisfaction of their sinful lusts, and abhor all restraint of them.
Verses 20-21
Proverbs 13:20-21..
Verse 22
Proverbs 13:22. A good man leaveth an inheritance, &c. “A man that doeth good with his estate, takes the surest course to settle it upon his posterity for many generations;” and the wealth, &c. Rather, but the wealth of the sinner, “of him who regards nothing but his own sinful lusts and pleasures, shall be transferred from his family into one that is truly virtuous.”
Verse 23
Proverbs 13:23. Much food is in the tillage of the poor A poor man many times, through God’s blessing upon his endeavours, makes a plentiful provision for himself and family out of a few acres of land, which he manages judiciously and honestly; but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment There are some whose far larger estates are wasted for want of skill, care, industry, and the divine blessing upon their labours. This is the other sentence of this chapter, (see on Proverbs 13:10,) which Melancthon selected for the observation of his scholars; “the latter part of which,” says Bishop Patrick, “he renders differently from all that I have read: (namely, thus:) There is much food in the furrows of the poor, and others heap up without any measure, that is, to no purpose, when a little will suffice; which is a wise saying, but not agreeable to the Hebrew text.”
Verse 24
Proverbs 13:24. He that spareth Hebrew, חושׂךְ , withholdeth; his rod From his son, when it is due to him; or that keeps back that correction which his son’s fault requires, and which he, as a father, is required to give him; hateth his son His fond affection is as pernicious to his son as his or another man’s hatred could be; but he that loveth him, chasteneth him betimes Either, 1st, In his tender years, as soon as he is capable of being profited by chastisement; or, 2d, Speedily, before he be hardened in sin. Thus, “as the chapter begins,” says Bishop Patrick, “with an admonition to hearken to reproof, especially from parents, which is repeated again in the thirteenth and eighteenth verses, so here again, in the last verse but one, advice is given to parents not to spare the rod, if reproof will not do, some children being so disposed that they must be thus treated. And it seems a wonderful piece of wisdom in the old Lacedemonians, as Plutarch relates, who, out of a universal love and care for each other’s, according to Plutarch, look every man only after his own children, servants, and cattle; but every man looked upon what was his neighbour’s as his own, οπως οτι μαλιστα κοινονωσι και φροντιζωσιν ως ιδιων , that there might be, as much as possible, a communion among them; and they might take care of what belonged to others, as if they were their own proper goods.”

Karly Carlson: Picture perfect
By Louise Bolger
sun staff writer
It seems like almost overnight Anna Maria Island and destination weddings have become synonymous. The brides and grooms you see running around the Island all have the same dream, to have their special day their way, and photographer Karly Carlson’s mission is to make that dream come true.
Karly Carlson has been a professional photographer for over 25 years, starting in her native Madison, Wis. The day Carlson and I spoke happened to be the Wisconsin Democratic Primary, which was especially fitting since before moving to Florida in 1988, she was a capital photographer in Wisconsin and the media director for the Senate Democratic Caucus. Her photography business has certainly changed from those days and now reflects not only her relaxed lifestyle but the relaxed atmosphere of Anna Maria Island and the surrounding area.
Carlson loves shooting weddings and has designed an alternative to formal studio photographs that compliments the casual weddings currently in vogue both on and off the beach. Typically she shoots between 200 and 300 digital photos of a wedding. Within 24 hours she has them edited, recorded on a CD and has prepared an album containing 50, 4 x 6 prints. All of this is delivered to the happy couple or their family, frequently before they even leave the area. In addition to destination weddings, she has photographed weddings for many local full-time residents and comfortably photographs beach, church, garden and yacht club weddings.
She has been doing a lot of family portraits for both residents and visitors as well as senior class photos that can be either casual or traditional capturing the subject’s personality. She also turns around these photos in 24 hours organized in conventional albums rather than a digital format.
Carlson is involved with the Anna Maria Wedding Festival, but most of her business has grown by word of mouth within families and from friend to friend who find her laid-back style easy to work with. Sometimes she finds herself at weddings with family members and guests she has previously photographed or covering the wedding of one of the restaurant servers who have seen her work at other weddings. Her pricing is very competitive and is based on the event rather than the number of hours it takes.
In addition to photography, Carlson also has a thriving framing business. She will come to your home with frame and mat samples and recommend the perfect combination to showcase your picture and blend with your home’s décor. And if hanging the finished product is a challenge, she will come back and do it for you.
Carlson gave up her galoshes and mittens a long time ago and has embraced the Florida lifestyle she photographs. Her motto is, "Photography my way," making her the perfect person to record the important moments of your life your way.

Student ID’s hadn’t been issued yet, and admission into the stands of Quesenberry Field was uncertain. Exactly how we got in is lost in misplaced memory, perhaps through a hole in the fence, more likely by bluffing our way through the gate, but enter we did to see, turning memory into magic.
“Magic in the Desert,” by Dan Perry recounts the improbable perfect season of the 1960 New Mexico State Aggies football team, immortalizing its inconsonance with a long, lusterless Aggie football legacy. In 1960 the suddenly resplendent Aggies carried a four game winning streak from 1959 through an undefeated season of 11 victories, including a rare NMSU bowl appearance in the El Paso, Texas, Sun Bowl. Before, and mostly since that shining moment, the patient Aggies have known mostly football grief. The season of perfection is so extraordinary that the late Pervis Atkins, one of the team’s stars, always called it magic. Mr. Perry to teach young men, and what kind of young men he wished to teach. Woodson had a degree in Bible as well as physical education, and his genius included a nose for talent. Charley Johnson was attending NMSU on a basketball scholarship, but in a single, walk-on tryout, Woodson spotted his starting quarterback. He recruited Pervis Atkins and Bob Gaiters from Oakland, aided by color-barrier restrictions on the school choices for such talented young men in 1960. Woodson didn't have show-boaters on his teams, and didn't invite any back from previous seasons. He stressed teamwork, and insisted that winning did not justify cheating. Decades later his players lauded him as the spirit behind the miracle, one of them saying, “Woodson was a very good coach, who we respected, and we expected him to lead us to victory.”
Woodson encouraged academic performance. Charley Johnson graduated with a 4.0 GPA in chemical engineering, and spent 15 years in the NFL, earning a PhD along the way. He eventually returned to, and. Faculty grousing increased the jealous mediocrity.
We write memories into the organic stuff of our own path, and invest them with significance to our journey. That senior quoted in the opening line above, for example, denies any recollection of leading a gaggle of freshmen into the first game of the 1960 season. Rightly so. Our leader, whom my roommate later opined was a "BMOC," a designation I'd never heard before and which marked my roommate as a potential BMOC, was kind enough, or distracted enough, not to shoo us away. Now on the other side of a career in Rocket Science at White Sands Missile Range, Eddie Robinson has his own contribution to Aggies' folklore. It involves the game Dan Perry leads off his book with, the 27-24 victory over Arizona State University, October 29, 1960. Here's Mr. Robinson speaking to us again, half a century after getting us into Memorial Stadium.
"The Arizona State game at ASU wasn't described the way I have it burned in my memory. A carload of us traveled to Tempe for the game and stayed at the apartment of one of my old buddies, also from Carlsbad. I felt throughout the game that the Aggies would prevail, even though we trailed a lot. I only got worried when, very late in the game, we were ahead, time was running out, and ASU began driving the field. We stopped them at about our 40 on an interception by Bob Langford.
"Then our offense began, without Charlie Johnson, but with our backup QB Ricky Alba. The Aggies went into a pass formation, Ricky faded back to pass, and the ASU players, in defensive pass coverage, didn't even try getting through the line. Finally, Ricky just stopped moving, stood with his legs spread wide, and put the ball on his hip. He stood there for a short while before ASU realized they were wasting time, and started trying to get through the line. Then he started running around the backfield killing time. And we won!! We ran out of coke that night and had to drink our rum with Kool-Aid!
"I do also remember my freshman year, 1956, when the Aggies won only one game, against Nebraska Wesleyan, a church school. How juicy it was to end my college days with a 7-3 season in 1959, and the only unbeaten major college team in 1960. 1961 was a good year as were the next couple of years. Then Warren Woodson got too old, and they fired him."
Nebraska Wesleyan, by the way, had a wretched record in 1956, and NMSU seems to have been the only nationally recognized team they played. Some record keepers list it as Wesleyan's only game that year, but they managed to lose six other games to someone. Our correspondent's comments about beverages is amusing college lingo of the era. Alcohol, of course, was not allowed in the stadiums in those days..
Spectacular events inspire tidal metaphors, tiny ripples of myriad countervailing cycles becoming giant tsunamis. We could think of the 1960 NMSU season that way, a century of Aggie football fortunes ebbing and flowing before rising up in a brief, violent spasm of excellence. Yes, the 1960 season was a coincidence of numerous individual currents: the arrestive career of coach Warren Woodson, the haphazard evolution of racial bigotry, the unlikely availability of heretofore unheralded heroes, and a mixture of political priorities that briefly allowed excellence to dominate, among many others. But the total exceeds the sum of these parts. The Aggie’s undefeated season was the side-slipping intrusion of an alternate universe. It was magic.

Multi-model analysis and validation in GSWP-2 (INVITED)
Multi-model ensemble forecasting has been shown to offer a systematic improvement in the skill of climate prediction with atmosphere and ocean circulation models. However, little of such work has been done for the land surface component, an important boundary layer for weather and climate forecast models. In this study, several methods of combining individual global soil wetness products from uncoupled land surface model calculations and coupled land-atmosphere model reanalyses to produce an ensemble forecast are examined and evaluated. Forecasts are verified against observations from the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank with forecast skill measured by correlation coefficient and root mean square error. A preliminary transferability study is conducted as well for transferring ensemble forecast parameters between areas with similar climate regime. These methods are then applied and tested for an ensemble estimate of land surface fluxes and state variables derived from the Second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2) integrations performed by a dozen of different Land Surface Scheme (LSS) in an offline mode. Through validation with in situ measurements available over the 10-year GSWP-2 period, it is shown that diverse renditions of single analysis compiled from an ensemble of different LSSs usually outperform individual members in terms of metrics of skill employed in this study. Such an exercise not only helps us better understand the virtues and limitations of various multi-model ensembling techniques, but also enables progress toward creating an optimum, model-independent analysis. The transferability study also provides useful insights on achieving improved land surface estimates over those areas where observations are not available.

Possible return values for $?
I think the $? returns 0 if the last issued command was successful and otherwise if not. But does anyone knows the value list that may be returned ? (or it is only zero/one ? )
Thanks in advance,

suggestion
the $? will return the exit code of the previous command executed....
the value depends on the success of the last command...
0 is always used to denote a success
other values depend on the type of error....
example: in a cp command if the source file is not found, it will give a non-zero erro and if destination is not found, it will give another non-zero error value... so depending on the value returned, we can find out the error occured

After a day of piecing the 500/4 motor together, a few of us arrived just in time to watch Jason McElroy fuel up his freshly built BSA and make a couple dozen flybys.
When Erik Omland’s not busting up hipster fights at the Barbary, he’s wrenching right next door to Jason’s shop. He’s been working on this local Tiger110 that’s in beautiful condition.
End of the weekend and I have a near finished motor and freshly painted helmet. Starting ‘er up tonight.
As much as I fucking hate Winter, if it didn’t keep me off the bike as much as it did, I’d never get any work done.

devyn…
when are you firing up the 500?
I wanna come by for it…
Fired it up last night. Down on 3 cyl at first until I fixed #2 boot. Sounded great, but wouldn’t idle. I did rejet adding an extra variable, so it’s taking on too much fuel. I’ll adjust tonight and give it another go on a fresh charge.
Mick, I need an extra boot if ya got it. Also, let me know if you want that Avon 100/90 for your rear. Going back to Dunlops.
@ Devyn
You don’t like the Avons?
I can’t say I hate them because I mistakenly ordered a tire size smaller, although spec calls for that size. I need a 110 on there at the least. I liked the tread on the Dunlops too. I mean, I would have finished that Turkey Pro race if I had tires with a little more tread.
yeah i have 2 extra ones if ya want one.
may be tough to get off, haven’t rried yet, but you’re welcome to em.
mick
that helmet paint job looks sick dude. cant wait to see the 500 out again too.
Psyched for you devyn. Glad to see you starting to get the beast all buttoned up.
Nice pictures, Devyn.
Thanks.

When you know how the movie turns out, but you’re still worrying about the protagonist and hoping they succeed. “Wild” (2014) is one of those movies. Reese Witherspoon is a young lady with a lot of baggage who is searching to find herself. So she and her humongous backpack set off on a 2,600-mile hike. The symbolism is heavy-handed, but the movie is not. Wisps of her dark past mingle with the outdoor beauty so as to not repulse you by the former or bore you by the latter.
Archives for posts with tag: Gaby HoffmanAndon in manufacturing refers to a status-display station. The origin of term Andon is from a Japanese word for traditional paper lantern. An Andon is one of the most common forms of visual management that is in use in Lean. It is a highly effective tool as it enables the operation to run smoothly without any bottlenecks.. Under this process, operator/ employee is empowered and informed to pull an andon cord in the assembly line when abnormalities occur.
Andons are the lighted signal like the traffic lights with three colors on top of each level of production assembly line. Whenever a worker detected any problem in the production line, or found himself unable to keep pace with the line, he could stop the operation by pulling a cord called ‘andon’ cord, which would set off an alarm system and illuminate the color coded andon electric light board.
If the problems detected were not rectified within a specified time period then the entire production line would stop, either manually or automatically. And if there is no problem the andon illuminates a green signal signifying that process can continue with the operations.
Andon cords and their significance
These three colors signal are broadly used in many manufacturing industries. However, some industries prefer to develop other color signals with specific meaning, such as white- end of production run and blue – defective unit. Warning light on your car’s dashboard that indicates when the gas tank is getting close to empty, is a simple day-to- day example of an andon that we come across.
Types of Andons:
Manual: Andons are activated manually by the operator/employee in the assembly line by either,
- Pressing static button
- Pulling a cord
Automatic: Andons are activates automatically on the conveyor when criteria fixed in the assembly line are not met or lacking.
Andons intitally were light signals in the manufacturing process to enable operator to signal the status based on the color. Today, visual displays are more sophisticated; however, their purpose remains the same, communicating efficiency and real-time status of the plant floor.
Benefits of Lean Manufacturing Andon
- Improve transparency: Encourage immediate reaction to quality, down time, and safety problems.
- Increase productivity: Bring immediate attention to problems as they occur in the manufacturing process.
- Strengthen flexibility: Improve accountability of operators by increasing their responsibility for good production and empowering them to take action when problems occur.
- Reduce downtime: Improve the ability of supervisors/operators to quickly identify and resolve manufacturing issues.
- Save costs and time: Provide a simple and consistent mechanism for communicating information on the plant floor.Am.

Quilting
Quilting is my passion. I make bed-sized quilts, but also smaller quilted items — table runners, throws, table pieces, wall hangings, etc.
I got my love of sewing from my mom, who made all of our clothes growing up. I got further inspiration from 4H and Home Ec in high school. I made most of my own clothes and many dresses for my two daughters. With the advent of jeans and t-shirts, I transitioned to quilts. I like to try different patterns and techniques. After 34 years as proprietor of the Village Smithy, I look forward to this new adventure.

Abstract Collage & Color Ink Creations
I was raised in Galesburg, Illinois and later moved to New York City. Wherever I was I sang, played piano, and was involved in acting. After returning to Galesburg I worked as a very busy Realtor and served as worship leader, choir director and drama director for Bethel Baptist Church.
Retirement now allows me to fully indulge my passion for creating art, a way of escaping into another world. I use dye-based alcohol ink for the vivid colors and designs watching as the ink soaks into the paper giving it new life. I began by designing simple and then more detailed abstract forms. A few years ago, that evolved into collages of watercolor paper. I take many smaller pieces, start cutting sections, and eventually have hundreds of pieces in piles. From those I create one large piece. They are not placed accidentally but designed with purpose and meaning for me.
My latest experimentation is using ink on canvas for abstract and more realistic collages. For floral pieces, every section of the flower may be individually colored, cut and placed until the vision is complete.
Each finished work of art is protected with archival spray varnish. You’ll usually find the signature in the lower right-hand corner. However, you may decide that you want to see it vertically, or upside down…the view is yours!

I have lived in Galva and Kewanee for the majority of my life, currently residing in Kewanee. I have a son, step-son, step-daughter, son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren.
I married at the age of 53 to a man who was worth the wait! We have traveled to England, the Isle of Man, and the Holy Land, as well as several locations here in the states since our marriage. Life is an adventure!
My niece recently married, and asked me to help her with the decorations for her wedding. Creating the bouquets and floral arrangements for the wedding and reception sparked a passion in me, and I began taking a floral design course online. My inspiration is my family which is comprised of very talented people. I have been surrounded by various art forms all of my life; painting, sewing, crocheting, knitting, quilting, cake decorating, furniture making…. I love creating anything beautiful, especially when it brings joy to other people.

Tom Hempel
Watercolor Paintings
Accomplished watercolor artist, T.F. Hempel, is known for his ability to make his paintings come to life. His creations include a wide array of subject matter, but his specialties are boats, barns, and bungalows, as well as other buildings and landscapes. Mr. Hempel has been painting for almost 50 years, creating beautiful works of art like no other!
T.F. Hempel has sold over 1700 paintings to date, including both prints and originals. Each is signed and numbered. Just a few of his many customers include: Chad Pregracke (Living Lands & Waters), CNN’s 2013 Hero of the Year; Todd Hamilton (Pro Golfer), winner of 2012 British Open; Ed Froelich, Quad-City Times Bix 7 Race Director.
On a section of the border between Iowa and Illinois is the only place in the nation where the Mississippi River runs east to west. On either side of this section is a multi-city area called the “Quad Cities,” where Mr. Hempel grew up and where he continues to call home still today. It’s also the place where he discovered his love of painting at 12 years old, thanks to an advanced art class in school. After high school graduation in 1964, life happened (as they say) and Mr. Hempel put down his brush. For the next 12 years, the brush sat idle …
Mr. Hempel went on to proudly serve his country with the U.S. Army as a Construction Engineer, serving one year in Vietnam. He then joined the private workforce and eventually retired. During these years, he met his future wife, Marti, who was instrumental in reconnecting Mr. Hempel to his artwork. When Marti learned that he had once been so passionate about painting, she encouraged him to visit a quaint, older shopping district near their home, known as the Village of East Davenport, and to paint a red brick structure there. Little did she know, she was setting the wheels in motion and Mr. Hempel did as she suggested. The building he chose to paint was owned by Boyler’s Ornamental Iron Company and had begun as a livery stable in the late 1800’s. A perfect subject matter for a perfect new beginning. When his newest painting was complete, Mr. Hempel took it to have it matted and framed so it could be properly displayed in his and Marti’s home. While Mr. Hempel was waiting in line at checkout, an elderly gentleman approached him and offered to buy his beautiful creation. Mr. Hempel had never yet sold any of his artwork, as he had been painting strictly for pleasure. He told the elderly gentleman it wasn’t for sale, accepted his business card, and headed home. When Marti learned of the encounter, she suggested her husband call the number on the business card to tell the elderly gentleman he had reconsidered. Not only did this man become Mr. Hempel’s first paying customer with this purchase, he also commissioned Mr. Hempel to paint his home as well. The year was 1975. The spark had reignited.
T.F. Hempel – “Tom” – finds that artists, unlike some other professions, can look at age as strictly a virtue. He feels that time and experience are excellent teachers in his trade and that artistry helps keep a mind sharp while avoiding a physical toll on the body. Tom remains blessed with good health and looks forward to many more years of creating masterpieces.

Jennifer Stanley “Jenn’s Crochet Life”
Crocheted Items
Hi! I’m Jennifer Stanley of Jenn’s Crochet Life. While I grew up not far away, in Elmwood, I was not aware of Bishop Hill until I came with my mother and grandmother to the Bakery for my mom’s birthday lunch at the beginning of September 2019. I had been crocheting for twenty-plus years and The Creative Commons just felt like it could become “My Place.”
I do crochet just about anything, but I am always excited and amazed when I can take a skein of yarn and make it into a recognizable stuffed animal. Most of my work is currently from patterns written by other crochet artists; however, I’m currently in the process of writing several patterns of my own and adding designer to my many hats. I also facilitate crochet classes and workshops.
I live in Peoria, IL with my boyfriend of 14 years and our two cats, Rizzoli & Nora. When I’m not crocheting I enjoy spending time with them & other family, reading, writing, and volunteering at a local animal shelter being a Cat Cuddler. During the weekday, I’m an Assistant Operations Manager at a large employer in Peoria and manage an account of about 150 employees.

Fiber and Upcycled Treasures
Over the years I have worked as a middle school science/art teacher, nature center employee, fiber artist, and landscaper. My art is the result of these numerous influences. Recycling, reusing, and upcycling are the main focuses at this stage of my life. Creating items from felted wool sweaters, plastic shopping bags, resell finds, and of course using some of the fabric from my huge collection.
Jill Shinkevich-DeKeyser
Watercolor Art
My favorite art form is watercolor. I try to create feelings instead of pictures. I love how watercolor creates loose, whimsical feelings. Flowers, old barns and loose landscapes best describe what I love to paint.
I love to create!! I worked for 32 years as the Director of HR for a group of banks and newspapers. I painted on vacation and Sundays but longed for the day I could say “I am an artist”. That day finally came a few years ago. I paint what I like and if I really like something I’ve created, I create notecards that spread kind words…because kindness matters!
I’ve taken watercolor classes at the Peninsula School of Art in Door County for 14 years. I spend 2 months in Door County during the summer. I volunteer at PSA during special events and have taught art classes to children at the Sister Bay library. I also taught a class in Kewanee at the Villages with Seniors. I love to teach!Plastics: common objects, classic designs with collector’s guide at amazon.com. This hardcover book is a steal at $1.99 plus shipping. Six copies are available at under $5.
Katz’ work is 160 pages in length with 190 illustrations and 110 color plates. It is broken into 8 chapters that cover the birth of plastics, and each decade from the 1920s to the 1980s. The collector’s guide follows.
The dust jacket offers Katz’ biography (1984):
Sylvia Katz has a degree in art history from Bristol University in England and was later awarded first class honors in furniture design at the Hornsey College of Art. Well known for her own collection of plastics and for her articles on the subject, she is also the author of Plastics: Designs and materials (1978). She is currently with The Design Council, London.
While there’s not much pre-1940 or so that I’m hugely interested in from a collecting perspective, seeing these objects in historical context helps me to better understand the things I am drawn toward. Without a doubt, this book is very well done. It leads the reader chronologically through the development of plastic materials up to and through the modern era. It begins with amber and shellac, then celluloid and proceeds through Bakelite, Lucite, ABS and the explosion of plastics in the 1960s and beyond. It is inspiring in that the items featured run the gamut from mundane (the travel toothbrush) to extreme (the Mirizzo sofa). I like this type of book, filled with both pictures and content, in that it provides ideas as to what to seek out and collect.
The objects in the book I like most (and neither of which I have but are shown below) are the Beetle Melmex melamine cruet set on p. 61 designed by A. H. Woodfull and manufactured by BIP, Ltd. (1946 original in urea formaldehyde, melamine in the early 1950s) and the radio with components cast in acrylic designed by David Watkins and manufactured by Clarity Plastics in England (1973) on p.116.
The 15 page collector’s guide is useful as well, offering care guidelines, identification techniques, a glossary, a list of museums, and a list of trade names amongst other information.

The Cottage - Day 6
I can’t tell anymore if it’s raining or not. It probably doesn’t matter. With no need to cycle to the village the day won’t be another rainwatch.
But I will need to go look for wood.
A still day, the sounds of birds and of collected rainwater dropping. The sun over the sea is battling with the overcast skies above the mainland.
Leading Long Grass with my right hand, and Dog-dog with my left hand, I go in search of wood. As the bike fills up with scraps I let the dog off the leash and I ride as she trots. We move over for the little white van I see most days, and for the postvan heading to the cottage.
In our 3-mile walk collecting wood there are 2 more vehicles we must move off the road to let pass. All 4 vehicles of the day seem to be driven by the same old man.
With the rain receded I peel down to a t-shirt. Although the sun hasn’t reached the cottage it is firmly over the beaches as well as the islands when we get back.
I am watching the waves come in 3 miles away, maybe 4, when I notice on the bog road 3 women walking towards the cottage. If they were actually walking here they’d be here in 20 minutes.
The sun finally reaches the cottage, and prompts me to take off the camera the photos from yesterday’s cycle to the village. There are no photographs there. 20 are gone. The batteries are dead. Looks like I knocked the camera in my pocket, wasting the batteries and somehow pressing the right combination of buttons to delete everything.
That wasn’t just the best photographs so far; it was the most varied. I suppose I’ll be going to the village another time. And the mountains will look their best again. Won’t they?
While watching the waves bash into the cliffs of one of the near islands, I see a wave crash up from the far side. It has to be 50 foot high, maybe much more.
It’s another day dominated by working out how to fix the roof that was supposed to have been fixed. Although re-roofing is what is needed, and was what I believed was happening prior to me moving in, I’m looking at ways to patch on the outside and to reroute the leaks on the inside.
Once water doesn’t drip on the art table I can paint; the rest of the leaks are a nuisance but I just want to paint.
I hear a distant rumble and go outside. A couple of days I have heard an aeroplane but this is nearer. On the bog road, coming from the gap, is what looks like a rubbish truck. Whose rubbish has it been collecting I wonder. Not mine anyway. Most of my rubbish I burn on the fire. The small amount that doesn’t burn I carried into the village yesterday and dropped in a public bin there. It was less than would fill a shoebox.
After a lot of time up a ladder looking at the roof I respond to the landlord and tell that things are great and I see no reason why I can’t make a home here with the dog. Then I tell him how badly the porch roof is still leaking.
Given that I was only coming here on the basis that the roof was going to be fixed, it really should be reason enough to give up on living in the cottage.
If I retreat into the living space proper to paint, things will get rather cramped. There are only the 2 other rooms here apart from the bathroom. A kitchen/living room and a bedroom with a fireplace.
The dog persuades me to go on an after-dinner walk. Except I haven’t had any dinner. But this is the time you would go for an after dinner walk, had you eaten, so I concede. The dog needs to walk off her dinner anyway.
We go out the gap as the clouds above the mountains slowly shift off to wherever clouds go. We walk for a mile and a half before turning back. No cars pass us. As we go past a cottage the door is opened just so the owner can say hello. And he tells me I have a nice little dog. He is the same old man I’ve seen driving every car for miles.
It is one of those times where I keep reminding myself this is real. The sun is readying itself to go down, but throwing out those golden hues before it dims to orange and pink. I am walking in the most magnificent postcard. The scene is spectacular, stretching for over 20 miles. There is no wind. I listen and all I hear are insects and distant streams gently gurgling in the bog below. Under a blue sky, wave after wave of mountains are softly rendered in paling shades of warm yellows and misty oranges. This is my back garden?
The dog is reluctant to walk back the way we came. At first I assume it’s because she doesn’t want the walk to end, but she is very adamant and then I realise why. We had passed a few cows in a small field and the dog was visibly scared of them. I had to drag her back towards them reassuring her that cows are our friends without even knowing what that means. To illustrate our cross-species comaraderie I chat to the cows as I go past. More than I did to the old man at his door, it occurs to me. The dog hurries past.
A short while later passing back through the gap I pick up a piece of turf and put it in my pocket as over our heads sheep can be heard. Descending towards the cottage I look back and see five sheep on the grassy knoll at the very top of the hill the dog and I had hiked up the other day. Why would I not live here?
The walk up our twisting driveway that normally takes 5 minutes now takes 15. Because I can’t stop looking at the views. The sun is now setting. The wind is still non-existant, as are the cars. There is just a couple of birds, and some distance unseen, a cow. The islands are as if painted with smoke.
Back in the cottage the rotten smell of the last couple of days is overpowering after our walk in the fresh air. Really rotten. Like a dead rodent. Once again I do the cursory look for a small carcass, as always with the expectation that if I find it somehow it will leap straight at my face. Strangely, I find nothing.
After putting the kettle on I get an email from the landlord. He will come to the cottage in early October to have a go at trying to seal the roof.
Towards the village against the pink-blue sky, I see the hundreds of starlings that I have seen most evenings, doing what starlings do before they go to bed.
I fry an egg for a sandwich, and before the tea hits the grease on my lips the dog is sound asleep.

Regardless of the rain coming down on the drawing board, it sounds as if contentment is the order of the day, or all days ,for that matter. I’ve checked American Hell, and there hasn’t been a cartoon for better than a month, so I’m hoping there’s less anger in your life these days. Now, if the phone would ring from Merica, things would be nearly perfect for you, yes? We’re thinking of you fondly and with a certain amount of envy—Kevin just observed that since you now have internet access, WE could be living where ever it is you are. Ah, but the cats, I remind him.
The American Hell pause is purely organisational. When I’m set up it only takes minutes to trot those posts out, but being set up includes having the ability to scan the drawings.
The scanner and other equipment is in the 2nd load of stuff to be transported here in a couple of weeks or so. Even then I have to mess with converting American electrics to Irish format before I can start producing. So the posts are ready; I just don’t have the means yet to publish them.
Once I get to that point though I shouldn’t have these breaks again.
And on that internet business. I’m on the EDGE network, so a long way from Broadband. I’m still trying things out and thinking of alternatives, so I’ll hold back on details of it until that’s settled.

{doublons} (duplicates) criteria, once you’ve discovered it, has the potential to rapidly become an indispensable component in your template files [1]. Even if it’s a strange beast to implement, it enables some very interesting record selections, but which would not normally leap out at the casual reader of the SPIP.NET documentation, which merely says:
The
{doublons} or
{unique} criteria [2] :
are used to eliminate the display of results which are already displayed in other loops that use this criteria. These two criteria are strictly identical to each other.
Identical? Well, not exactly! With the progression of different versions of SPIP, doublons has come to benefit from several supplementary possibilities:
- we can nominate our duplicates (doublons), for which there can be several in the same piece of code,
- it also enables some SPIP tricks with anti-duplicates!
Basic usage: do not re-include elements that are already handled on the current page
An example is offered to us in the default home page template in the ’dist’ collection [3]
<BOUCLE_recent_articles(ARTICLES) {par date}{inverse} {0,2} {doublons}> some elements to display, like #TITRE </BOUCLE_recent_articles> <BOUCLE_other_articles(ARTICLES) {par date}{inverse} {doublons} > some elements to display, like #TITRE </BOUCLE_other_articles>
This entails listing the articles of the site in inverse chronological order AND reserving the two most recently published articles for some special treatment. As you can see, the "_recent_articles" and "_other_articles" loops are constructed in exactly the same manner. In theory, they would therefore normally return the same list of articles.
It’s thanks to the work of the "doublons" criteria that the 2 most recent articles, already "processed" in the first loop, will not be found in the list displayed by the "_other_articles" loop.
Another common usage: excluding certain elements
Our grand classic: excluding depending on a keyword
We often see the spip-users list see requests about this type of problem:
"I can’t seem to exclude some elements depending on their keywords. I tried:
<BOUCLE_rubriques(RUBRIQUES) {racine} {titre_mot!=invisible}{par num titre, titre}>
but it doesn’t work properly"
And for good reason!
What the user wants here, is to select all the sections that do NOT have the "invisible" keyword attached. However, what the database understands by
{titre_mot != invisible} is that it should select all sections that DO HAVE a keyword AND ALSO that keyword is different from "invisible".
And that changes everything. Since the results will contain, for example, a section which has been assigned the keyword "thingy", which is different from "invisible" (ok!), but which has also been linked to the "invisible" keyword (arg !), and what’s more, there will also be the section that does not have ANY keywords assigned (basically quite the opposite of what the user really wanted !). [4]
The solution: sequence an empty loop which selects sections according to the matching keyword, with a secondary loop that returns results based on using our
{doublons} criterion.
Continuing with our example above, this would give us:
<BOUCLE_exclude(RUBRIQUES) {racine} {titre_mot=invisible}{doublons}> </BOUCLE_exclude>
This loop selects all sections linked with the "invisible" keyword , but which actually displays nothing at all.
<BOUCLE_sections(RUBRIQUES) {racine}{par num titre, titre} {doublons}> {normal processing goes in here} </BOUCLE_sections>
This second loop, using the doublons criterion, will select its members as all the other sections and then apply the normal processing provided by the user.
Naming duplicates (doublons) to use them several times in the same file
Objective: on the home page, manage the display of links to articles and to press releases. The presentation of the two most recently published articles and two most recent press releases are to be different from the mass of all the others.
For our example, we see here the same schema already seen with the DIST loops. This simply entails making some very similar loops live side-by-side without any conflicts. Naming the duplicates will avoid the selection criteria from one loop from interfering with those of the other.
<BOUCLE_communiques_recents(ARTICLES) {!par date}{id_mot=1} {0,2} {doublons com}> some elements to display, like #TITRE </BOUCLE_communiques_recents> <BOUCLE_autres_communiques(ARTICLES) {!par date}{id_mot=1} {doublons com} > some elements to display, like #TITRE </BOUCLE_autres_communiques> <BOUCLE_articles_recents(ARTICLES) {!par date} {0,2} {doublons art}> some elements to display, like #TITRE </BOUCLE_articles_recents> <BOUCLE_autres_articles(ARTICLES) {!par date} {doublons art} > some elements to display, like #TITRE </BOUCLE_articles>
Generally speaking, naming your duplicates is an overall good practice to avoid any current concertina type problems, but also things that may occur later in the future (templates which might be later altered, with the author overlooking the use of the doublons). It is also a component which helps automatically document your SPIP code.
For advanced usage, you could try using SPIP tags for this purpose too. For example:
{doublons #TITRE} or even
{doublons #_myownloop:TITRE}, perhaps even
{doublons (#_myownloop:TITRE|supprimer_numero)}.
Advanced usage: anti-duplicates, or how to stack up a pile of data to be processed
The anti-duplicates mechanism
In this instance, "doublons" will make it possible to accumulate the results of several loops that use different criteria and "!doublons" to apply the intended processes to this collection of items.
The usage schema is as follows:
We select a first set of articles (but display nothing)...

An example of anti-doublons
Objective: build a loop which retrieves the articles of all sections except for sections 2 and 3, AND, in respect of the articles in section 4, only those from the last 60 days.
The solution: we need a first loop that will find us all the articles but excluding those in sections 2, 3, and 4...
<BOUCLE0(ARTICLES) {id_rubrique !IN 2,3,4}{doublons tri1}></BOUCLE0>
....to which we supplement a second loop of the other articles we don’t really want...
<BOUCLE1(ARTICLES) {id_rubrique=4}{age<60}{doublons tri1}></BOUCLE1>
...and then in the third loop we can use anti-doublons to display the articles selected by eliminating the ones selected already according to our various loop criteria.

I live and work in Belfast. This morning, the NI executive announced a significant increase in COVID restrictions for the next 4 weeks in an attempt to curb the rise in infections in the province. They are mainly focused at the hospitality sector (which is being completely shutdown) along with various other restrictions (including closing schools for one extra week) but importantly allowing general retail to remain open. I also watched Keir Starmer's speech yesterday and was surprised to see him finally adopt a position contrary to the government's position - i.e. a similar circuit break to what has been introduced today in NI. My conclusion from that speech is the political consensus in London is a) COVID is going to get much worse across the UK over the next few months and b) it's a foregone conclusion that the tory government is going to be forced to impose stricter measures soon. This is NI today but it is soon going to be UK wide. Even if it isn't, very soon most regions of the UK will be clamoring for "very high risk" Tier 3 status (see next paragraph for reasons why). Keir suggested a circuit break of 3 weeks. I believe the shutdown in Northern Ireland will last longer than the 4 currently outlined because the data we see is effectively 3 weeks old anyway - so even if the virus is stopped in it's tracks by these measures today, it will still grow over the next three weeks - is it realistic to imagine that in four weeks while the virus is at it's peak that we will go back to normality? Possibly but I wouldn't bet on it.
The reality is that in Belfast at least retail trade started to drop off last week and walking round the city center today it is completely empty. Although doors are open, the message is getting through to people and discretionary spending is reducing at a rapid rate both to curb the virus and because tough times are ahead (online will still benefit but not to the extent it did last time because people are going to be more worried about their finances). Let's be optimistic and say in city centers it stabilizes at 50% of normal trade over the next few months. Retailers could cut staff hours and use the job retention scheme but see their staff costs…

So they become known by their full names — Judy Shannon; and (the other Judy) Judy Barlup. I didn't meet Judy Barlup for some time.
After Judy Shannon and I had known each other for nearly 5 years, she was staying with us at our house in Guilford, Connecticut, and San Geraldo asked, "Judy Shannon, do you want coffee?"
I looked around and commented, "You can probably just call her Judy. She's the only one in the house."
And that's when I learned about Judy Barlup. And that's when San Geraldo and Judy Shannon realized how odd this sounded to others. Of course, from that moment on I began to refer to Judy at all times as Judyshannon (one word).
However, after an evening with Tynan, Judyshannon has come to be known as Judyshannonstreetwhut (or wha). Click here if you missed that recent post and would like to have a hairball's chance in hell of understanding.
Judyshannonstreetwhut (or wha) headed home Tuesday. San Geraldo and I escorted her to the airport by train. While waiting in the airport station for our return train, I looked up and noticed for the first time that the walkways above our heads are glass. And I loved what I saw, which really has absolutely nothing to do with anything else I just mentioned.
Don't let me keep on walking on broken glass...
Love that Annie Lennox song. Didn't she sing this at the opening of the London Olympics?
Stephen:
I remember her singing "Little Bird" at the closing ceremonies. Did she sing this at the opening? I also love this song... and Annie Lennox in general.
I had a high school health teacher (an old maid, spinster, if you will) who did not allow any girl in high school to wear patent leather shoes... because they might reflect your underwear. She'd have a heart attack if she were below that sidewalk! (of course she'd have a heart attack if she saw any female on the streets today... bra straps showing, bare midriffs, those high heel! woooohooooo!)
Sharon:
Ah, Catholic School! I DID have those same thoughts as I snapped away, but I didn't see anything exciting.
So interesting post.
Gosia:
Thanks.
Mitchell these images are truly stunning; would you mind if I pinned one? (On pinterest of course.)
The kidling went through a phase where she loved all things Eurythmics, although she called them the Eurythmatics for some reason, lol.
Jacqueline:
Thanks! Thanks for asking! And, be my guest (but please tell your viewers where it came from). I used to have a hard time remembering the name Eurythmics. Eurythmatics would be so much easier!
Love those shots! That's what I miss about not being in an urban area, the opportunity for really cool photography. Of course, if I were in an urban area, I wouldn't have time to do photography because I'd be working in a stressful job in order to be able to afford said urban area. Phew. I need a rest...
Walt the Fourth:
I hope the stress has passed.
I decided to look at all of your photos first this time, after only reading that there were two Judys in your life, one of whom got coffee from San Geraldo in Guilford. I thought and thought and wondered how these photos were going to tie in to that thread. Sneaky guy, you! :) Loved the photos. I first thought that you had gotten a new underwater camera, and you were underwater as Jerry jumped in (oh, wait... with shoes on??).
If I ever drop by for a visit to Fuengirola, you can call me "JudyChabo" (long "o"...that was a little bitty of a ditty of a song that a long-ago beau used to sing about me), or Judeet (the French pronunciation of Judith)... or Seine ;)
Judy:
And when Tynan meets you, you'll probably become known as Judychabointheskywithdiamonds...
ooooh là là!
Great photos Mitchell!
and who doesn't love Annie Lennox?! I do I do!
Jim:
Thanks. I can't wait to go back and take more pictures. The music is always incredible and that voice!Successfully saved Ricotta ravioli with sausage, mushroom and spinach sauce to your Calendar. You can also save the ingredients to your Grocery List.

The first thing to notice is that there is the variable k. Also, the right side of the equation includes a binomial (1+3k) in paranthesis multiplied by 6. In order to combine like terms and in turn, isolate the variable k, we have to use the distributive property. This means to multiply the outer "6" by each term in the binomial (1+3k). Remember PEMDAS (paranthesis, exponent, multiply or divide, add or subtract). So the first step looks like this:
-18-6k = 6*1 + 6*3k
The second step is multiplication (by order of operations PEMDAS). So then we have:
-18-6k = 6 +18k Notice that the 18 is defining how many "k's" there are.
Now comes the combining like terms part. Keep in mind we are isolating the variable. Basically, we want the "number and letter k buddies" like 18k and -6k to be on one side of the equal sign and the numbers without their "k" buddy on the other side (-18 and 6).
so here are the steps to do just that:
-18 -6k = 6+18k add 18 to both sides. You are doing the opposite operation to cancel out on the left.
+18 +18
-6k = 24 + 18k
-18k -18k subtract -18k. It cancels the 18k on the right.
-6k-18k= 24
combine the like terms -6k and -18k by subtracting the coefficient 18 from -6. This makes a bigger negative number.
-24k= 24
-24k/-24 = 24/ -24 Lastly, we do the opposite function of dividing both sides by -24
k=-1 Yay we solved for k!Season

The BSA’s National Executive Committee pointed out that the organization wasn’t living up to one of the 12 points of The Scout Law – bravery.
“Brave means taking action because it is the right thing to do and being an upstander even when it may prompt criticism from some,” wrote the committee. “We realize we have not been as brave as we should have been because, as Scouts, we must always stand for what is right and take action when the situation demands it.”
The BSA went on to say that there is no place for racism in scouting or in its communities, and it won’t be tolerated.
“We condemn the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and all those who are not named but are equally important. We hear the anguish, feel the heartbreak, and join the country’s resolve to do better,” the committee wrote.
The organization also said it would be introducing a specific diversity and inclusion merit badge that will be required to become an Eagle Scout.
“It will build on components within existing merit badges, including the American Cultures and Citizenship in the Community merit badges, which require Scouts to learn about and engage with other groups and cultures to increase understanding and spur positive action,” wrote the committee.
Additionally, the BSA is also committing to reviewing every element of its programs to ensure diversity and inclusion are ingrained at every level for participants and volunteers by applying a standard that promotes racial equality and denounces racism, discrimination, inequality and injustice.
It’s requiring diversity and inclusion training for all BSA employees starting July 1 and taking action toward introducing a version for volunteers
And lastly, the organization is conducting a review of property names, events and insignia to build on and enhance the organization’s nearly 30-year ban on use of the Confederate flag and to ensure that symbols of oppression are not in use today or in the future.Gephy.
Often the phobic realizes that his fear is unwarranted and irrational; but he is completely unable to overcome it. The fear of bridges or tunnels can thus affect one’s professional and personal life in that; one might refuse to drive or travel or will likely make career decisions that revolve around his fear. Drivers might swerve or brake dangerously upon seeing a bridge, thereby endangering one’s life as well as of those around. The fear of bridges phobia can thus be quite debilitating.
Causes of fear of bridges phobia
Most Gephyrophobics fear bridges that run over large water bodies. Their fear, like all other phobias, might have its roots embedded in the past. A negative or traumatic experience involving bridges might have set it off.
The fear is also linked to the fear of heights or Acrophobia. Most bridges run over large valleys or water bodies at a great height. Additionally, some bridges may be small or restricted leading to claustrophobia or the fear of small restricted spaces. An accident or death witnessed by the phobic over a bridge might lead to creation of a similar fear response over and over. The anxiety is the mind’s way of protecting the individual from ‘supposedly dangerous’ situations.
Many individuals fear that the bridge might collapse or that the driver might lose control of the vehicle and crash into the depths below. Such fear is valid and normal in most people; but in case of a Gephyrophobic it can lead to severe anxiety symptoms.
Movie scenes or news reports of accidents that have occurred over a bridge can also lead to this phobia especially in people who are already suffering from other anxiety disorders. Adrenal deficiency can sometimes play a role in triggering this phobia.
Symptoms of Gephyrophobia
Anxiety and panic attacks are common symptoms of the fear of bridges phobia.
- Shortness of breath when driving over a bridge.
- The phobic might squeeze his eyes shut, or experience rapid heart rate and sweaty palms.
- Numbness from head to toe, tingling sensation, shaking, trembling or feeling nauseated are some other symptoms of Gephyrophobia.
- Feelings and thoughts of death, crashing, experiencing violent or negative images or movie stills in the mind are a few psychological symptoms of this phobia.
Many Gephyrophobic individuals try to avoid bridges: seeing pictures, driving over them etc. They might use excuses, lie or avoid situations to avoid bridges.
Treating and overcoming the fear of bridges phobia
Breathing exercises and meditation are two powerful self help techniques recommended by phobics who have successfully overcome their Gephyrophobia. Upon arriving at a bridge, you must try to regulate your breathing and count slowly from 1-10 to ease your anxiety.
Gradual desensitization is one of the best methods of overcoming Gephyrophobia. Start by driving over smaller bridges or simply seeing movies or pictures involving bridges. Try to breathe deeply when doing so. This can help prepare you to cross larger bridges gradually.
Rationalizing negative thoughts by writing down positive thoughts is another self help technique to ease anxiety associated with Gephyrophobia. Friends and loved ones can also help during the process. They can drive you over smaller bridges so that you gradually conquer your fear and cross large bridges alone without experiencing anxiety and panic.
Talk therapy, psychiatric counseling, Hypnotherapy are other tried and tested therapies that can help you overcome Gephyrophobia once and for all.
Nicole says
I have a debilitating fear of driving over high passes, and I feel like I have a heart attack. I want to pull over, but know I can’t because I will be stuck there even longer. Does anyone have any tips/advice at all – anything that has helped you?
Dorcas Gray says
My experience with fear of bridges and tunnels is: I always had a sort of heart rate increase when I would have to drive across a bridge or enter a tunnel. If anything, I thought the tunnel aspect was worse than bridges. Then one day I was out with my husband and had to walk across a very small bridge and I froze halfway across and couldn’t move forward or back. After that my fear of bridges escalated to the point that I would drive 20 miles out of my way to avoid crossing one, or if a passenger, I would have to close my eyes and start gasping for breath. I also get very agitated when I see other people walking across or riding a bicycle across a bridge. There is a small bridge in the town where I live and sometimes I have to walk across it and every time I feel dizzy. I have tried meditation and breathing exercises and it has helped. As long as I know in advance I have to cross a bridge I can now (usually) not end up gasping for breath. If I am on an unfamiliar road and a bridge suddenly appears I still have some problems. It is not pleasant and other people really don’t understand how it can just make you freeze and not be able to move. Also, if traffic stops while I am on a bridge my heart rate starts to climb rapidly.
Sandy says
Hi thank you all for sharing your feelings with bridges. I am petrified of them. I don’t drive anymore because of them and my husband does all the driving now but he can’t go over any bridges or fly overs or slip roads. I start to panic and think I’m gonna die and have the feeling that I am gonna get out of the car and jump off the bridge because my anxiety gets me that bad. Any type of bridge freaks me out. Does anyone else have the same feeling? If so, has anyone been cured? This all happened to me when I was 25 after having my 3rd child by c section.
Miriam Macdonald says
I have these feelings. I have intrusive thoughts, like what if I snap and decide to run off the bridge. I would never but those thoughts are with me. I am also so afraid that when I drive over a bridge my hands are so clenched on the wheel that I think I may swerve at the slightest thing. What if I sneeze. Then I try to deep breathe in and out and I think, what if I pas out from all this breathing. So my solution: I get right behind another vehicle and I stare at it and follow it. Or if there are no other vehicles I drive center lane.
glen a granger says
I have the same problem, it gets worse with age. I got stuck on a bridge today for about 20 minutes and almost passed out several times. I am still shaking. Glen
Olivia says
I don’t really have a fear of bridges to the point where I have panic attacks, but the idea of a bridge scares me. I mostly get anxious when going over a bridge with water beneath it. My body just turns to jelly and I start to shake. Also, other bridges where you can’t see what’s over them scares me. I think it’s because you hear stories about stuff that has happened to people and in movies where pressure build up and you’re trapped in the car which is filling up with water.
Vivi says
Seeing there are many people with the same problem is something of a consolation ;) I have all the symptoms you describe and it’s getting worse with age. A few years ago i was traveling in Vietnam and during a trekking excursion i found myself on a suspending rope bridge, with gaps between the tiles. I thought I could do it, but I ended up sitting down in the middle of the bridge, having a panic attack. My friends helped me go back, by holding me by the arms, shoving the other tourists away and talking to me the whole time. When I reached the end, I cried my heart out. I think that was the most frightening experience I had on a bridge (of the many).
Y2K says
Well, I’m not alone I see. I read many of the comments here about fear of bridges and I don’t feel so bad. It’s more of a problem for many of us. I can handle the smaller bridges. It’s the suspension and high bridges over water that near gives me a panic attack. Or the ones that are arch type bridges where you can’t see the other side of the bridge until you get to the apex. Sweaty palms, pounding heart, shallow breathing. And I believe I’ve tried darn near everything to get over this with no luck. Lately, I’ve tried anchoring which is basically thinking relaxing thoughts while squeezing your fist or an ear lobe or some such thing. The theory is that if you do it enough, your subconscious mind will equate the relaxing thoughts with the squeezing. And then you can use it when going over a bridge and the fear will go away. Not so sure I believe it. I’ve also tried subliminal stuff and that has not seemed to help. The worst part is I’m an engineer and know how these are built.
Melissa says
I have had an anxiety disorder since 20. I am 40 now and I totally fear bridges. It did hit until about 10 years ago and I try to find alt routes. We worked in New Orleans for the last 2 years and there is water and bridges everywhere. I couldn’t go certain places. The cognitive behavior does not work when you feel like you are dying. I can go over small bridges but the larger higher suspension bridges aren’t happening. When you have anxiety for so long knowing you can’t stop and pull over when the tunnel vision hits is a bad deal. I think that my problem is there’s nowhere to stop and gain composure. Sometimes I feel weak, tunnel vision, and my biggest thing is a problem swallowing. I can be driving and not be able to swallow my own spit like I’m choking. Anxiety sucks. Wish they made a magical cure but you have to do your best to make it.
Erin says
I wasn’t always terrified of bridges. It seems it started when I was around 50. I have seen pictures of the bridges out east and west and in Michigan. I can honestly say I would not drive on any of these if you paid me . My fear is the heights . I refuse to look at the water to my side. I have crossed bridges into St. Louis and Kentucky and they were bad. They are nothing compared to those I have seen in pictures in New York and California. Still when I look and see that roller coaster like highway I almost throw up. I do ok on this one going into Kentucky because traffic moves very slowly on it. I clench the wheel and stare straight ahead and somehow make it. I had a doctor over there but now don’t have to go back, thank God.
John says
Is there a discussion group for this crazy issue, I used to go to Manhattan several times a week, bridges and Lincoln tunnel and now, if I accidentally find myself on a bridge I shake violently and almost think I will have an immediate heart attack and harm others! Seems so darn stupid, deep breathing and other suggestions don’t work. the minute I’m on until off I am going to either kill myself or others its that bad. I think there has to be some warning of bridges ahead that way we can either turnaround or switch drivers.
Robert Burke says
I feel the same exact way, mine started getting really bad after I had open heart surgery at 46. I had to go from NOVA to Philly thru Baltimore and thought I was going to have a heart attack, this is a freaking nightmare. Now I am looking for a GPS with programmable routes because if I get stuck on a high bridge I am stopping and calling 911, the worst part is you get stuck on a freeway with no way out
Susannah says
I have always had a problem with heights, and not good with bridges, but could concentrate my way over them. But today, at 53 years old, I was visiting Oregon, didn’t know they call it the city of bridges, and I lost it. The is a bridge that’s 4 miles long and I almost ended up on it. After that I cried and was afraid to drive at all in case I mistakenly ended up on a bridge. I had a panic attack and called my sister in CA to Google how to get to the airport without ending up on a bridge. Once in line at the airport security I couldn’t stop crying, I felt sick all over. I feel a little sick and numb just writing this. I can’t believe this has developed in to such a big thing at 53. I live in CA and am looking to move, but now my choices have suddenly become very limited. I HATE bridges!! I’m single and afraid it’s going to make me seem like a nut job, and very high maintenance. Just what I needed. Ugh!
Amanda says
I’m looking at relocating to Jacksonville and just saw it’s the city of bridges. YIKES! I’m deathly afraid of bridges, especially over water. Any tricks to help?
John says
I am almost at a complete loss because of my fear of bridges, its now got to the point even as a passenger I almost have the same symptoms ‘extreme anxiety’. I try to completely avoid all bridges with exception of small bridges. Its become debilitating and interfering with my job and personal life.
Alyssa says
I’m not a driver yet, by I still get most of the symptoms above. My mom doesn’t believe I have this fear and says to quite playing around. I can cross tiney foot bridges, but the bay bridge is a nightmare. I’m always afraid the bridge will break, and I’ll fall down and die. I have gotten a bit better, but I’m still deathly afraid- and I have no idea why!
John Smith says
When I have walked up to the middle of the bridge I really feel like it is starting to move and its going to break. Like the asphalt is soft under my feet. Then after crossing the middle and going near to the other end, the sensation goes away. I have felt this way walking on a narrow bridge not a large one.
Simone Ross says
My fear is to drive across Bridges. I go into panic mode and my body tightens up. I am ok when someone else is driving, but when I am behind the wheel I am stuck.
A student chef says
My fear of bridges extends back to a childhood trauma: I was held over the side of a bridge for punishment. Since then, I have a problem with bridges. I am fine with heights and crossing overpasses on the roadways (feel safe knowing they won’t collapse!) but Steel arch bridges, walkways, and those over the water bridges produce intense fear and outright nausea.
close the gap says
So horrible! I can’t imagine what that had to be like. Your story hurt my heart for you and filled me with anger towards who abused you. I hope you didn’t have to endure it for long.
john rolf thenor says
I have the same problem too. A few years ago, I got stuck in new york. I waited 2 hours for a family member to come and drive me past the manhattan bridge. Horrific situation. The sad thing is there is no remedy or real solution to overcome that phobia.
Not sure says
So I like heights, rappelling and tree climbing no issue. I enjoy the water, kayaking, sailing, snorkeling. But bridges over water of any height. Total pucker factor. But I love architectural drawings of bridges as well as pictures. What’s that all about? Can this also be caused by poor adrenal production or adrenal burn out?
arnold tropper says
I have similar fears to those mentioned above.. large bridges over water cause my heart to beat fast, I sweat, get dizzy, etc. I always pull over and have my wife or daughter drive over the bridge. I have to drive from New York to Florida.. does anyone know where I can get a list of bridges that I have to cross starting with the Verrazano and moving south?
close the gap says
Did you ever get that list? I too would love it, I hate bridges! Hate this problem too but it seems I can’t help it. It embarrasses me but not to the point where I can ignore it. The fear adds so much time in travels but it is what it is. I will never get to visit the FL keys because of this fear!

I am afraid to look to the right or left when driving across a bridge. I do not want anyone in the vehicle to talk to me. I am terrified until I get to the point where there is land beneath me. It is a real fear that I wish I did not have.
ayana says
Hi Friend, I too can relate to your story. I completed my 2nd bridge walk this week. I love walking and I have many bridges that I love, but once I get in the middle of a beloved bridge, I feel as if I’m going to fly off and die. But I’m determined to get past this annoying phobia. Tomorrow I am planning to walk over the George Washington bridge. Just the thought makes me sick.
Sharon says
I too have a difficult time driving over bridges with water. I feel as if the car lifts up off of the ground and that I no longer have control.
Debra says
My experience is the same. I recently found myself in a cold sweat with hands gripping the wheel and heart beating out of my chest as I was driving across the Coronado bay bridge from San Diego to Coronado. Also have issues with height. I don’t have any horrible things from the past that I experienced- this is something that began in my 20s and I’m now in my 60s. I’m always looking for a way to beat this. I’m a very logical person with great sensibility. This is a mystery to me.
Annieo says
I also had the same experience driving across the Coronado Bridge in San Diego. I grew up in SD and had crossed this bridge many, many times without problem, but one Saturday morning, at age 43, I felt an unexpected sense of intense panic when reaching the bridge’s half-way point, like I was going to lose control of my car and go over the side of the bridge. Since then, all high bridges bring on feelings of fear and panic. I just got back from Boston MA – was stuck in traffic on the Tobin bridge. My hands got so sweaty on the steering wheel I didn’t think I would have full control of the rental car. I’ve recently discovered that if I think of something completely different, like something intensely funny or pleasurable, I’m able to hold it together.
Elexas Mathenia says
I’m not afraid of all bridges just some.
Vineice Mitchell says
I’m not afraid of all bridges, it’s all how my brain see the structure of the bridge that determines my fear. If the bridge is big and very tall in structure, my fear kicks in and I can’t drive across it myself. I can if I’m a passenger. I have a deep hatred of my phobia, wish I never had it. It complicates my life!
debbie says
YES, it’s the same with me. I can be a passenger just not a driver, and all bridges are not equal it depends on how it looks – if it looks like we’re driving to heaven, I go cold and panic. A low flat bridge is no issue.
HeightsWuss says
Same thing here, a lot of it is like the ingress of the bridge, a certain angle/sight of it sometimes swings a full panic (sense of dizziness or loss of control, though never happens) . This became an issue to me around 40, before then no problems, always had a fear of heights but driving over bridges/heights never bothered me as long as I was “inside” something. Seems like bridges with the girders going along the top seem to freak me out more, also ones with no emergency lane/narrow lanes are worse. If I’m in the passenger seat, no worries, a few drinks in the passenger seat, really no worries. Incredibly annoying and almost reaching the point of hindering my life as even certain bridges in my local area I actively avoid….this first happened on a road trip to Memphis, going into Memphis from Arkansas I was fine, leaving I was looking for the first place to exit to get a grip!
Thomas says
Wow, I want to thank everyone. I am experiencing the same fear and can really relate to your stories. I had a terrible panic attack while trying to Newport RI and attempting to get over the Jamestown Verazzoano Bridge. I got stuck in Jamestown after because one look at the Clainborne Pell Bridge I had to pull over. I was by myself, it was terrible.
Roxanne says
How you have accurately decribed my symptoms and fears. Thank you. My family call my fears crazy and leave at that. For years I have experienced ridicule and embarrassment because they couldn’t relate to my symptoms. I’m so glad I found this site. Thank all of you !!
Amanda Lisette says
Me TOO. Feels like driving into sky. Surreal like I lose touch with reality! Dizzy terrified feels like I will die
Ethan White says
I don’t really have a phobia of bridges per say, but I do tend to have subtle feelings of unease when standing underneath them. Not small foot bridges, mind you – but large, concrete overpasses (like those that cross rivers, valleys, bays, interstates, etc). It doesn’t bother me to DRIVE under them, because I’m only under them for a split second, but walking, standing, or parking underneath one.
The other day, I was setting up to shoot a video beside a river, and I had to walk under a HUGE concrete bridge that carries a state highway over the river. (The support beams underneath the deck are gargantuan, 9 to 10 foot tall metal I-beams). Every time I got near the bridge or heard cars passing overhead, I had thoughts of it collapsing, either from the weight of the vehicles, or just from it’s own weight.
Englishman says
Yours is the first account I have read in over half a century (yep, I’m old!) where the phobia is about the UNDERSIDE of bridges. I suffer with not being able to go near overhead railway bridges (especially the steel ones) that cross roads and thoroughfares without being scared witless. Even seeing them makes me very anxious.
I am not sure if the term ‘gephyrophobia’ strictly applies to my fear, which I recognize as very irrational, as I have only ever seen it described as a phobia about walking or driving ACROSS bridges. I have such bad vibes when I know I am nearing the vicinity of overhead railway bridges that I paw over street maps of the areas in order to find alternative routes rather than face my nemeses. I even applied for jobs where the locations were specifically nowhere near roads where railway bridges crossed over them. The sight of them makes my stomach curdle and I break out into a cold sweat.
There seems to be a phobia name for those who don’t like to cross bridges, but not a collective name for someone with my particular phobia, so I’ve always wondered if I’m unique.
Carolyn Martin says
I am in the process of relocating and the only way to reach my destination is by bridges or tunnel. I am not terrified of bridges, but I experience anxiety as I approach them and about mid way, my body is feeling very light or numb. I plan to travel the tunnel route next time. Not sure how that will work since I don’t like being closed in? However, I want to thank you for the suggested tips on this web site.
Sincerely,
Excited to move, sad for bridge travel.

Approximately 100 participants from over 20 countries converged on the Club de la Fondation Universitaire in Brussels on 21 January for ACA’s signature start-of-the-year event, What’s new in Brussels? Recent developments in European Policies and Programmes. The sell-out crowd was treated to eight highly informative presentations focused mostly, but not exclusively, on the higher education initiatives emanating from various European Union agencies and organisations.
Topics of the day included two of the EU’s new “flagship initiatives”, Youth on the Move and Innovation Union. Developments within the Erasmus programme were another subject of discussion. This was examined not only from the perspective of the European Commission itself but also from the point of view of the European Students’ Union, as well as a CHEPS-led study on increasing participation in the popular student mobility programme. Participants were also provided insights into current considerations and future orientations (real and potential) of Erasmus Mundus and the researcher-oriented Marie Curie Actions. The results of a recent Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Organisation pilot project to assess internationalisation within specific academic programmes – which will soon be tested out at a broader European level – rounded out the day’s agenda. The ACA Secretariat is enormously grateful to the outstanding roster of speakers who shared their time and expertise with the assembled crowd, and to the participants whose questions and comments added depth and substance to the proceedings.
ACA’s European Policy Seminar series presents its second instalment of 2011 on 18 March with Brazil, Russia, India, China. Key points on the European higher education compass? The event promises to deliver yet another engaging day of information and analysis for European higher education stakeholders keen to learn more about these four fascinating countries. Registrations are advancing apace, so interested participants are encouraged to act quickly to reserve their place in Brussels for this enlightening event.

Conserving, protecting and enhancing state forest resources
Minnesota is located at the convergence of three major biomes; coniferous forests, deciduous forest and tall-grass prairies. Over one-third of the state remains forested, and over 12,000 lakes, rivers and streams grace the landscape. The state values its natural resources and is blessed to have so many millions of acres of these resources still in relatively pristine condition. There are a multitude of programs and initiatives linked to ensuring that these resources are properly managed and will still be available for the public to enjoy in the future. Like many other states, however, Minnesota is witnessing changes to its landscapes.
The Minnesota Forest Action Plan represents over a two-year effort by the Department of Natural Resources Forestry Division and numerous partners, agencies, organizations and individuals to identify and assess the main trends, conditions and issues facing our vast forest resources today. The plan presents a broad overview of the state’s forests and forest resources as well as identify current and future strategies needed to address a variety of forest conditions in the state, regardless of ownerships.
Best Management Practices
Minnesota’s best management practices (BMPs) program is non-regulatory. The agencies responsible for BMPs policy development are the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ Division of Forestry and the Minnesota Forest Resources Council.

But I still use a planner every day to unload the most important things I need to get done that day. I use the left side for my family/personal items and the right side for business. I have found it very useful to have a place to write shopping items I need throughout the week and my most important to-dos. Some of these things don't get done in a week's time, so I just carry them over to the next week. There is something very satisfying about crossing off tasks on actual papers versus my phone!!!

Motherhood Beyond Bars: An initiative among pregnant and postpartum incarcerated women in Georga
Motherhood Beyond Bars is an initiative that provides education in health during pregnancy, childbirth, bonding, parenting, family planning, and transitioning from prison to the community for pregnant and postpartum incarcerated women. In order to address the issues mentioned above, Motherhood Beyond Bars created three programs: prenatal yoga, Mothering from the Start, and Healthy New Mothers. Mothering from the Start is a childbirth education intervention, while Healthy New Mothers is a postpartum health education and support intervention. Monitoring activities through pre-program and post-program surveys administered to program participants suggest a high level of participant satisfaction. Among participants who completed at least half of the Healthy New Mothers program, 100% reported being satisfied with the course. Similarly, 100% of participants in Mothering from the Start reported that the class sessions were helpful.
Correctional systems have a unique opportunity to improve not only the health of incarcerated women, but also their infants and, in turn, their families. By investing in the health and well-being of such vulnerable populations, states have the potential to improve their overall maternal and child health indicators.

Chris Sununu (R) failed to garner a single supporting vote from the four Republicans who make up the state’s five-member Executive Council in his bid for $27 million in funding to promote the CCP virus vaccine in the Granite State.
The only supporting vote came from the sole Democrat who serves on the council.
Republican Councilor Dave Wheeler, who has been a supporter of Sununu on other issues, raised the question of acquired natural immunity in his dissent to the funding bill to promote the COVID-19 shot.
“We talk about science all the time, but we ignore the fact that people have natural immunity from already having COVID,” Wheeler said.
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, commonly known as the novel coronavirus.
Sununu was quick to respond.
“The vote showed a reckless disregard for the lives we are losing while they turn away the tools our state needs to fight and win this battle against COVID,” the governor said.
Sununu charged that the concerns voiced by opponents to the funding initiative were “based on fantasy.”
Sununu was also taken to task by executive councilors for not following suit with other Republican governors who have outlawed the use of vaccine mandates to deny employment.
“Will you stand up like the governor of Texas and tell private [businesses] they can’t fire people?” Wheeler asked Sununu.
“You want the government to tell private businesses who to hire and fire?”Sununu responded. “That isn’t even socialist. That is completely un-American, sir.”
In 2018, Sununu signed a state law banning discrimination based on gender identity including in the workplace. Sununu remarked at the time that “Discrimination–in any form–is unacceptable and runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die Spirit.”
During the meeting, nine people in the audience were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct including a mother holding a young child, her husband, and a 70-year old woman from Nashua who was charged with resisting arrest. A video of the arrest posted on Facebook shows she was sitting when state police approached her and forcibly led her away. People in the background can be heard yelling “fascists” at the NH troopers while others around the room can be heard shouting “they weren’t doing anything wrong.”
Terese Grinnell, a registered nurse and also among those arrested at Wednesday’s meeting, believes Sununu is trying to backdoor his way into creating a means to trace residents who are not vaccinated. The governor’s proposal includes $10 million for a digital database of each COVID-19 vaccination administered in the state.
“Goliath fell with a stone,” said Grinnell, “we have to keep just doing what’s right, keep showing up and coming together and deciding what we the people we want for our children and being tenacious about that.”
Bussiere has been a lead organizer against COVID-19 mandates in New Hampshire.
The NH Executive Council was slated to take a vote on Sununu’s $27 million proposal earlier in the month. However, a well-attended protest Bussiere and others organized in opposition to the funding along with mask mandates prompted the council to cancel the meeting last minute.
The meeting held on Wednesday was held at the NH police training facility. Normally, NH Executive Council meetings are held at the statehouse in Concord.
A month earlier in September, a large crowd bearing signs like “Stop The Tyranny” gathered outside the statehouse in protest of COVID mandates.
They voiced their criticism of Gov. Sununu for not taking a more aggressive position against Biden’s COVID vaccine mandate like Republican cohorts Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Governor Greg Abbot have done.Full story Throughout the year, pro athletes with Nike NFL Jerseys Alabama roots have found ways to give back to their communities through their foundations, conjunction with their teams and via a variety of charitable organizations.

The last time both teams met, Loudon was dominant for the majority of the match, going 2-0 up until the 73rd minute; Hartford was able to turn the game around in under 20 minutes and equalize due to Loudon’s overconfidence. Hartford’s first goal came in the 84th minute from a free kick by Markus Nagelstad, while the second goal came just four minutes later from a header by Alex Dixon.
Hartford will look to protect its home record of 4-1-1 after losing 3-0 in Dillon Stadium for the first time this season to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. After rewatching last Friday’s match, I believe that Hartford’s defense during this game is what truly cost them their chances of rising to the top of Group F. Going forward, Hartford should strengthen their defense in preparation for their upcoming match. Attacking-wise, they did a better job when compared to their last match against Loudon, but they need to find the right balance and not get ahead of themselves this weekend.
I am anticipating the obvious return of Éver Guzman to Hartford’s starting 11. Hartford fans finally got to see the return of the forward during the final 30 minutes of the match following his recovery from an injury. Unfortunately, Guzman couldn’t fully reignite his chemistry with the squad, specifically captain Danny Barrera, despite almost scoring a header in the 66th minute. Should Guzman not be healthy enough to start next in the game, Markus Naglestad will continue to play in his place; the Norwegian athlete put up a valiant effort in last Friday’s match before being substituted off. If head coach, Radhi Jaïdi, starts with similar players while maintaining the typical 3-5-3 formation, he should swap midfielder Tyreke Johnson to the right side of the field. As the hosts of the Nutmeg State podcast noted, Johnson’s tendency to shift naturally to the right caused him to perform better, even allowing him to score.
As for Loudon, this season has not treated the team well, as it has only won one game so far this season. Loudon’s last fixture came against Pittsburgh in which the result was similar to Hartford’s, losing 3-0. It’s difficult to say how Loudon will perform this weekend, given its sporadic results and performances against Hartford, but the Boys in Green should not underestimate them.
My advice for Hartford? Stay cool, calm and collected. The gap between them and No. 3 Red Bulls II is quite large, but they need to make sure that they can continue to narrow the gap with Pittsburgh who are only six points ahead. Should Hartford win its match against Loudon and Pittsburgh lose to the Baby Bulls on Saturday, the fight for first will soon return.Make Food preparations easy with these vegetable choppers

After a four-day trial, a jury in U.S. District Court in Richmond convicted Christopher Ray Robertson on 20 counts in two separate robbery sprees in late 2013 and late 2014.
Two others — Michael Ellison, 30, of Newport News, and Robertson’s former girlfriend Aquilla Jones, 31, of Durham, North Carolina — previously pleaded guilty to robbery charges in the case, and both got about 15 years.
But Robertson, who prosecutors said “masterminded” the conspiracy, sought a jury trial. (A prior jury trial on the charges n 2019 ended in a mistrial).
Federal prosecutors said the conspiracy began in September 2013, when Robertson recruited Ellison to rob five businesses in central Virginia and Hampton Roads. They said Robertson selected the businesses, “directed Ellison’s actions,” and served as the lookout.
The men were accused of robbing or attempting to rob a Gulf gas station and Captain D’s Restaurant in Fredericksburg; a Big Lots on George Washington Memorial Highway in York County; and a Fast Mart and Food Lion in Spotsylvania County.
The men “parted ways” in October 2013 “to evade law enforcement detection,” prosecutors asserted.
Robertson then moved to North Carolina, meeting Jones in Durham before they moved to Newport News in November 2014. That’s when Robertson got back in touch with Ellison, with prosecutors saying that Robertson suggested starting up the robberies again.
That December, they said, Robertson, Jones and Ellison and a 16-year-old boy took part in eight more heists. Robertson again led the effort, prosecutors said, with he and his girlfriend acting as lookouts as Ellison and the juvenile donned masks and went into the stores with a gun.
Those included stick-ups of a Citgo Gas Station on J. Clyde Morris Boulevard in Newport News; a Shell gas station on Hampton Highway in York County; a Hop & Shop on Jefferson Avenue in Newport News; a Mini-Mart on Green Meadows Drive in Virginia Beach; and an attempted robbery at a Smoke Shop on Western Branch Boulevard in Chesapeake.
Bystanders at a December 2014 Subway restaurant robbery in Fredericksburg got a good description of Ellison’s car — leading to his arrest in Spotsylvania and the conspiracy to unravel. Prosecutors said that Robertson’s phone was “in the vicinity of all of the 2014 robberies.”
After a four-day jury trial this week, Robertson was convicted of robbery conspiracy, 13 counts of interference with commerce by robbery, and six firearm counts. He faces a mandatory minimum of 42 years in prison and a maximum of life.
Latest Courts & Crime
The then-juvenile, Ezekial Keaton, was prosecuted as an adult in Newport News Circuit Court on a robbery count, getting six years in prison. He will also be sentenced later this month on federal perjury, obstruction of justice and accessory charges.
Roberton’s lawyer, Fernando Groene, said his client will fight the convictions. “We respect the jury’s verdict, but Mr. Robertson maintains his innocence ands intends to pursue all the avenues of appeal available to him,” he said.
Groene contended that the government’s case “rests mainly on three witnesses” — Jones, Ellison and Keaton — who “had a motive to lie to reduce their federal sentences.” In fact, he said, Jones and Keaton admitted to lying on the stand at Robertson’s earlier trial.
Robertson will be sentenced on July 20.

Spr!Transparency note – I wrote this post in real time after sewing this top back in April of 2021. Somehow, despite having the post written and photos taken, I did not get this post published! Rather than re-writing the post, I’m posting it as written at the time, with the added note that I enjoyed this top through a good bit of pregnancy and am looking forward to wearing it as the leaves start to change here soon. Enjoy this much delayed post 🙂
I chose this fabric not recognizing how quickly we would transition from winter to springtime. I had a couple of projects with more firm deadlines, so once I was ready to cut into this beautiful fabric, I worried I’d missed the opportune window. These colors speak to cool weather and warm gatherings by the fire for me, and I was worried I wouldn’t be able to translate this palette into something wearable in the bright and sunny spring and summer months.
You may have read my thoughts on the Cielo Top pattern with my first Cielo, but if not, I’ll give you a little recap. I always thought it was a cool pattern, but it didn’t really speak to me until I started seeing it pop up in my Instagram feed in View B with the sleeve cuff omitted. The big, gathered sleeves simplified into a shorter, hemmed version really caught my eye and I finally decided I needed to add it to my collection. I really like to make the pattern as-is the first time around, so I made View B WITH the sleeve cuff first, but I’d been planning on View B without the sleeve cuff, and this is finally it. I was not disappointed, I love the style! To achieve this modification, I simply left off the bottom sleeve cuff pieces and hemmed the sleeves with a double turned under edge.
As I finally pulled this fabric out to sew in March, we’ve been vacillating between temps in the mid 50s and low 80s. I had really built this fabric up in my head to be a strictly autumn / winter color palette, but when I held it in my hands again I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has just enough hints of pink, green, and teal in it that it would be lovely in the spring, as well! The tiny little flowers reminded me of the little blooms that are budding on the cherry blossom trees all around my town, and I was reinvigorated to make moves!
I’ve really come to equate knit fabric with easy projects and woven fabric with time-consuming projects in my mind, so I was really pleased when this project came together over the course of 3 evening sewing sessions. My sewing time is limited these days, and I consider it a grand achievement to steal away into the sewing room for 30 minutes to an hour at a time a few times a week. Unfortunately, this has led me to sometimes avoid certain projects after imagining them to be these big, daunting, time consuming things! Luckily, this one surprised me in the best way. I spent one evening cutting and two evenings sewing, and then I had a brand new pretty thing ready to wear!
In my attempts to add a little extra spring brightness to this top, I decided to add a special finishing touch along the sleeve and waist hems. Instead of a traditional straight top stitch, I played around (for only the second time in 3+ years!) with the decorative stitches on my machine. I chose a leafy green thread and a little leaf and vine stitch, and used this to secure my hems. Being a Liberty London fabric, the floral print is busy and bustling on its own, so the leaves don’t stand out unless you are looking for them. This made me feel a little bit safer to try out the decorative stitch – just in case it had turned out quite ugly, the print would absorb it enough to prevent it from becoming a terrible eye sore! It did not, in fact, turn out ugly, and I love knowing there’s a sneaky bit of extra love in the garment. You can see it (if you look hard!) on the hems below!
After sewing my first Cielo Top, I anticipated that I might want to add on some length to my next version(s) so that I could pair it with a broader range of bottom garments. I’m 5’8”, so the cropped length is a little more cropped than intended on my longer torso. However, given the fact that my baby bump is growing constantly right now and most of my bottom garments these days are high-rise, belly-covering, maternity wear, I decided to leave the cropped length as is. I’ve been wearing this primarily with my favorite maternity leggings right now, but I’m also looking forward to sewing up a simple tank dress or two that I can layer underneath some of my blouses as I move further along into my pregnancy.
This Liberty London fabric was a dream to work with, as usual. I only have one cut of Liberty left in my stash, and I’m already sad thinking about coming to the end of a fun run of Liberty sewing! I do have a few little odds and ends left over from most of the prints I’ve worked with over the last couple of months, though, which eventually will be sewn into pretty little things for my toddler. Until then, I’ll be enjoying my own personal handsewn Liberty wardrobe!!

This year I?ve been fighting the urge to decorate for Christmas earlier than our traditional day-after-Thanks?giving norm. Maybe it?s my beloved guilty pleasure Hallmark holiday movies with their horse-carriage-rides-in-freshly-fallen-snow-holiday-romance-by-the-fire themes or maybe it was just the early cold snap.
I haven?t drug out the tree yet, but I may have tossed a pumpkin to make room for garland and a snowman. And there might be a couple of lights twinkling in my peripheral vision near this very keyboard that shares a spot on my table with a mug of peppermint something.
Oh, and banana bread? Yes, that?s what I smell. Banana bread currents wafting out of the oven as Lennon?s ?Happy Christ?mas? streams from my phone.
What can I say? I?m sorry (no I?m not) for my weakness.
I think we all have something that makes us feel a little less beaten down/tired/stuck as we might have felt yesterday. You know what I mean?that thing that brings a sensation to your gut that puts your mind and heart exactly where you physically are in a moment of time. It feels the way a molten lava cake looks, warm and gooey and good.
Even in the middle of an otherwise chaotic day or week or, sometimes, year, your something brings on an exhale you didn?t even know you?ve been waiting for. And you find yourself present, relishing in whatever that thing is.
For me, it?s the entire pre/current/post Christmas season. I?m sorry Thanks?giving. I mean no disrespect and your buffet is killer, but it?s just that…Christmas! A tough one to compete with.
Devon Corneal, a writer for the Washington Post, wrote a story of her typical neighborhood this time of year: rows of houses with haggard cobwebs and rotting jack-o-lanterns waiting to be discarded after Halloween.
?Except for our neighbor one block over,? she said. ?In defiance of the calendar, this home is decked out for Christ?mas already. White icicle lights. Pine bough swags with red bows. Not one, but two evergreen wreaths. A runway of lights lining the front walk. Driving past this brazen violation of the order of things, I did what any mature, responsible adult would do.?Christmas!? I shouted at the top of my lungs, taking my hands off the steering wheel and clapping like someone who has snorted too many candy canes.?
Corneal got it right when she said their exuberance is extraordinary. And fleeting. And, she thoughtfully added, if someone doesn?t like some Christmas in November, they can close their eyes.
I am enormously thankful for the chance to give thanks. I know what I?ve got. My weakness for garland and lights has in no way minimized that gratitude.
Why not accept the candy cane?s power? Humor the sightings of a couple Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving. And maybe wear the occasional mismatched socks.. find your favourite destination

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee told a Seoul court on Wednesday he would "make a new Samsung" in the final hearing of a trial that will decide whether he returns to jail for alleged bribery.
The heir of one of South Korea's most powerful families was convicted of bribing an associate of former President Park Geun-hye and jailed for five years in 2017.
That sentence was reduced and suspended on appeal and he served just one year in jail before being freed in 2018.
A subsequent Supreme Court ruling sent the matter back to the Seoul High Court, which must now decide on a new sentence. The decision is scheduled for Jan. 18.
"Samsung has been running without looking back but I missed something vital. Although it became Korea's leading company, the importance of its social role, responsibility and public trust was overlooked," Lee said reading a statement in court, dressed in a dark suit and grey tie.
"Now Samsung will be different. I'll be the first to change... No matter what happens, I will never do anything to pursue my personal interests. I will raise the value of the company and focus on social contributions, fix what the court has pointed out as the harms of chaebol," he said.
South Korea’s big family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, are credited with helping raise the country out of poverty following the Korean War but have been criticised for wielding too much power preserved in part through elaborate internal cross-shareholdings.
Lee shed tears when talking about the memory of his deceased father, saying he wanted to do his filial duty by making "a new Samsung" that is sustainable and has "a thorough compliance system that can resist undue outside pressure". sidelined from major decisions at the smartphone-to-semiconductor giant, at a time when the family needs to raise funds to pay a hefty inheritance tax bill.
Prosecutors sought a nine-year jail term for Lee, saying that defendants, including Lee, "did not show passive resistance" to former President Park's unlawful demands.
Lee's lawyers said Lee had gained nothing in this case while the country's former president violated corporate freedom and property rights by abusing her "imperial status and authority".
Under South Korean law, a jail term of three years or less can be suspended; for longer sentences, the person must serve out the term barring a presidential pardon.

South Yorkshire mayor Dan Jarvis, has said facemasks will remain mandatory in bus stations and interchanges across the region where the authority operates.
This follows the Prime Minister’s announcement on Monday, that the legal requirement to wear masks in enclosed public spaces and on public transport will end on July 19.
The mayor said it was ‘not the time’ to remove the legal restriction on mask wearing on public transport and enclosed spaces.
Sheffield City Region has authority to impose the rule at the following bus stations and interchanges. These are:
Sheffield Interchange Meadowhall Interchange Rotherham Interchange Barnsley Interchange Doncaster Interchange Adwick Mini Interchange Dinnington Mini Interchange Hillsborough Mini Interchange Swinton Mini Interchange Woodhouse Railway Station Arundel Gate Mini Interchange
Mayor Dan Jarvis said: “With Covid-19 case numbers continuing to rise rapidly, now is not the time to remove the legal requirement to wear face masks on public transport and in enclosed public spaces.
“This is why from Monday, at the bus stations and interchanges we control in South Yorkshire wearing face coverings will continue to be mandatory.
“We wear masks to protect each other from the virus, and the mixed messages from this government risks making public transport a no-go area for the vulnerable and young people who haven’t yet had both vaccinations.
“The government has the power to make masks a legal requirement for transport networks and enclosed spaces across England and I urge them to do so. A national mandate would without a doubt be more effective and create less confusion for passengers and fewer challenges for staff.
“But if the government is unwilling to act, then alongside other metro mayors, we are doing what we can, with the powers we have, to protect our community.
“I urge everyone in South Yorkshire to continue to wear a mask in public so we can protect each other as we emerge from lockdown. We’ve come so far through this pandemic – we need to keep everyone as safe as we can as the restrictions are lifted.”Accordingly, about 50 patients will be receiving checkups, with the surgeons expecting to provide surgery for 30 patients.
The programme is designed to support patients with scarring to the head, face, and neck areas after injury and children with congenital anomalies.
It is the 14th time that the US delegation has come to Vietnam to perform surgery and transfer surgical techniques to Vietnamese doctors at the NOH.
The programme will run through until November 10.2011 CANADIAN FLUID POWER CHALLENGE INTRODUCES NEW TASK

Toronto, ON – The 2011 Canadian Fluid Power Challenge organizers were a little concerned that a new problem scenario they devised for this year’s competition, held May 12, 2011, in Toronto, might be too difficult for the students. It turns out they needn’t have worried, as more teams succeeded in completing at least one cycle than in any of the previous 10 challenges.
Students from 18 west Toronto middle schools were asked to design and build fluid power devices to pick up a wooden block and place it on one of two shelves — in effect, a simulation of a warehouse material handling problem. They were evaluated on a set of criteria, including the number of cycles completed and the quality of their design portfolios. Leading the parade of successful schools this year was first-place winner, Islington Junior Middle School.
This year’s teacher tour, which took place while the students were building their machines, visited the Bombardier Aerospace plant in Downsview, ON. The teachers saw the final assembly lines for Q400 regional airliners and Global Express corporate jets. They also saw fluid power in action in the testing and R&D centre.
The Challenge, which is a partnership of the Canadian Fluid Power Association (CFPA) and the Toronto District School Board, is intended to provide Grade 8 students with hands-on experience building a mechanism with real-world applicability and to open their eyes and those of their teachers to the world of technology careers.
This was the eleventh year for the Canadian Fluid Power Challenge (previously known as the Hilltop Tech Skills Challenge). The CFPA’s Western Chapter also holds a Challenge in Edmonton that involves both high school and middle school students.

Q3 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc
Older tech companies among the more reasonable stocks right now, says NYU Stern's Damodaran
Transcript
I think collectively tech stocks have not done much worse than the rest of the market especially in the last two weeks. I think it's. I think part of the reason I think we overreact to detect movements in some of these tech stocks that trading at such high prices. That when you see the absolute drop in price it looks awful. I mean a 100 point drop in the stock price when you're trading at two thousand dollars a hundred dollars stock price drop is four percent four and a half percent five percent. So I think part of it is I think we're overreacting to changes. The other is I think that that if you look at the tech sector it's it's very divergent the old tech companies actually are among the more reasonable stocks in the market right now. You look at the the Microsoft the apple. I would buy them. The younger tech companies I think are being corrected and I think legitimately so because I think they had such a great run up that was just a matter of time before they correct.
We have on our screen here I don't like the Netflix business model Netflix we all know has come off of the highs of the summer a big bond offering announced this week what don't you like. I
think they're on a on a in a cycle that they can get out of it. What I see. They borrow money they make more movie and more original content they get more subscribers they go to the market to try to push up the market price and then use that to go borrow more money. And. I don't see a way to get off this get out of this cycle. I mean it's not as if they can slow down the production of content once said subscribers hit a cap because it training their subscribers almost expect 20 25 new shows every year. And that's not sustainable. So there's something about this model that that bothers me it just doesn't sound and it doesn't look to me like a sound business model that can scale up these.
Updated onT-Mobile made a move on the 4G market today announcing it had America's largest 4G network
T-Mobile announced today that they have the largest 4G data network in the United States. They have 75 metropolitan markets fired up with their HSPA+ service with another 25 planned to come online before the end of 2010. This translates into service for about 200 million Americans by the time the 100+ markets are on board.
T-Mobile, largely a lower cost carrier with coverage that is second to big providers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless in many markets, is trying to take a bite out the data pie. The new ad campaign touts that they have the largest 4G service footprint offering speeds that exceed the other carriers’ offerings.
The company claims it’s current max download speeds are on the order of 21Mbps. T-Mobile has plans to expand that to 42Mbps in 2011. Technical experts in the company believe the capacity exists to expand that further to 84Mbps and 168Mbps down the road. This all within the parameters of LTE or Long Term Evolution of the 3GPP standard.
A number of devices are launching with the upgraded service including the T-Mobile myTouch 4G smartphone, G2 smartphone and Rocket 2.0 4G Laptop Stick. A Dell Mini laptop is also available with build in 4G capabilities.
Although T-Mobile’s HSPA+ service is technically 3G service, not 4G as the company is claiming, they have decided to run with the 4G tag on their offering. T-Mobile’s service is still more than twice as fast as competing carrier Sprint’s 4G WiMAX network offering. The technical misrepresentation will likely be called out by other carriers.Montessori teacher

Also, Noah probably isn’t wrong about everything he’s ever said on this topic, just the central points under contention, and he has tons of company.
Noah Smith (Noahpinion) recently published a column in Bloomberg with the title “Health-Care Costs Are Still Eating the U.S. Economy.” This came to my attention because he was kind enough to link to my blog when he alluded to my arguments on health spending. Though there are obvious areas of agreement (e.g., that health spending has risen faster than income; that the so-called “cost curve” hasn’t been bent; that rising health spending puts a very real crimp on take-home paychecks amongst the working class), I strongly disagree with the central arguments he advanced and feel that he did not quite accurately characterize my views.
Noah wrote:
“In sum, health care is still eating the economy, and that’s still cause for alarm….Why is this happening? Some argue that the U.S. is just very rich, and that prosperous countries choose to spend more on health care, which drives up prices. They note, for example, that although U.S. health-care spending is unusually high as a percent of gross domestic product, it’s not th at high as a percent of individual consumption. But this isn’t very convincing, because consumption is a result of high health-care prices as well as an effect — high health care prices force Americans to use more of their income than people in other rich countries.”
He seems to misunderstand the argument and appears to be insufficiently aware of the evidence against his assertions. Since he is surely not alone in these thoughts, I am going to put some time into weaving together statistical evidence, supporting data, and thoughts I have strewn over a good number of blog posts, tweets, etc. over the years. My goal in this post is to parsimoniously explain the evidence at multiple levels, clear up misperceptions, and address probable objections for the benefit of those that have invested considerably less time into assessing the evidence for themselves.
(warning: this is going to be even longer than usual).
Income and causation
On material living conditions and its role in health spending
Practically all informed people recognize income is a particularly strong determinant of national health spending. Many of these same people also argue the US spends too much using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as their preferred income measure.
source
The problem is GDP is not even particularly a good proxy for the income of households (individuals). GDP is designed to measure how much value add is produced within domestic (territorial) boundaries. It usually does a fairly decent job of this, but it does not directly tell us about the household perspective, as in, the average level of real incomes or real consumption enjoyed residents of a country (a.k.a. “material living conditions“). Most importantly, it is an increasingly unreliable proxy for this concept.
My position is national health spending is overwhelmingly determined by the average real incomes of countries’ residents in the long run (differences in propensity to consume may have a small role to play). The elasticity of national health spending with respect to reasonable measures of income or consumption is exceptionally high, averaging around 1.6 in OECD panel data, meaning that a 1% increase in income is expected to increase health spending 1.6% at a national level. Americans are exceptionally rich by these same measures, so it is hardly surprising we spend a tremendous amount on health care — far more than would be implied by simple regressions with GDP and far more than most people appreciate.
I first made this argument with Actual Individual Consumption (AIC) because it is a good indicator of material living standards and because that data was more readily available at the time. AIC is a comprehensive measure of household consumption that is adjusted for government transfers in-kind (e.g., health, education, etc.). Unlike earlier measures of household consumption (e.g., household final consumption) found in National Accounts, it does not systematically under-estimate the material welfare of social democracies where in-kind transfers constitute a substantially larger fraction of comprehensive household consumption or disposable income.
I subsequently demonstrated this same point using (Gross|Net) Adjusted Household Disposable Income (AHDI). Net Adjusted Household Disposable Income is little more than AIC plus Net household savings.
Note: “Net” simply means savings have been calculated to reflect consumption of fixed capital — basically depreciation — whereas “gross” does not account for this.
Unsurprisingly, wherever the data are available, they tend to be exceptionally well correlated.
For example:
So it can hardly be surprising the results don’t much change vis-a-vis health spending or representations of material living conditions. Even when we don’t have AHDI available directly, we can be reasonably sure AIC is a good proxy for it and vice versa.
Like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), these economic aggregates are derived from National Accounts (SNA and its domestic counterpart). However, GDP and GNP are measures of production; they were designed for different purposes, and they actually measure different things. Although these measures are typically reasonably correlated, with AIC averaging around 70% of GDP, (Net) AHDI a smidge more, the relationship between production and welfare variables can vary quite dramatically within countries over time and between countries for systematic reasons. Significant differences can persist for quite a long time, and they are often explicable. Contrary to popular impression, it’s often not just transient noise.
Here are the primary reasons GDP does not relate directly to the household perspective:
- The movement of primary incomes across borders
- The incomes earned by non-resident workforces follow the workers home even if earned within the territory
- The incomes earned by foreign-owned corporations/quasi-corporations are counted in GDP even when distributed as dividends, rent, etc to residents of other countries.
- The movement of secondary incomes across borders
- Personal transfers, remittances, foreign aid, and international cooperation can raise or lower the standard of living in some countries in ways that are not reflected in GDP.
- The allocation of disposable income between domestic sectors
- In some countries, the corporate sectors account for a considerably larger share of GDP and/or national disposable income in the form of retained earnings (which don’t necessarily accrue to the ultimate benefit of residents).
- Differences in gross fixed capital formation requirements
- Some countries need to invest considerably more and face higher rates of depreciation just to maintain production levels.
- Higher rates of corporate investment, for example, might be better ceteris paribus, but countries with higher rates of investment aren’t necessarily better off.
- GDP itself may be systematically miscalculated due to corporate tax avoidance whereas the household perspective is relatively more immune to the incidental effect of this gaming.
- The prices faced by consumers are not the same as those faced by producers.
For these and several other reasons, the relationship between GDP and measures of material living conditions varies substantially between countries and within countries over time.
Histogram of AIC as a percent of GDP
Histogram of disposable income as a percent of GDP
Household material living conditions can evolve quite differently than GDP over many years.
And the cross-sectional relationships can vary over time (note: the connection has decayed notably in the OECD over the past few decades).
These measures enjoy substantial theoretical support.
AIC and AHDI are identical to those recommended by Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, and other notable economists in the “Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress” (a useful primer) and they have been part of System of National Accounts (SNA) for quite some time. These indicators have a strong theoretical basis, and they are widely preferred by experts over oft-cited production measures (e.g., GDP) when we want to compare how much resources households actually have at their disposal.
Here are some relevant quotes that speak to some of the issues:
Adam Sm.”
Simon Kuznets – 1934 Report to Congress:
.”[snip]
“The welfare of a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above.”
1993 System of National Accounts:
“GDP is a measure of production…movements of GDP on their own cannot be expected to be good indicators of changes in total welfare unless all the other factors influencing welfare happen to remain constant, which history shows is never the case…Disposable income as measured in the System can be compared with the concept of income as it is generally understood in economics. From a theoretical point of view, income is often defined as the maximum amount that a household, or other unit, can consume without reducing its real net worth.”
2008 System of National Accounts:
“Per capita growth rates in real national income or in real actual consumption generally provide a better measure of the changes in the average “welfare” of a country’s population than the changes in GDP volumes. GDP is a measure of production within a country but the inflows or outflows of income from or to the rest of the world can have a significant effect on both the level and growth rates in real national income per capita. Similarly, the level and growth rates in GDP volumes can differ significantly from those in the final consumption of households because of the varying shares across countries of capital formation and net exports within GDP.”[snip]
“The adjusted disposable income of a household can be interpreted as measuring the maximum value of the final consumption goods or services that it can afford to consume in the current period without having to reduce its cash, dispose of other assets or increase its liabilities for the purpose. Its consumption possibilities are determined not only by the maximum amount it can afford to spend on consumption goods and services (its disposable income), but also by the value of the consumption goods and services it receives from government units or NPISHs as social transfers in kind.”
Report of the Commission on The Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress:
“In a world of globalization, there may be large differences between the income of a country’s citizens and measures of domestic production, but the former is clearly more relevant for measuring the well-being of citizens…the household sector is particularly relevant for our considerations, and for households the income perspective is much more appropriate than measures of production.”
The Report — [Recommendation 1: Look at income and consumption rather than production]
“GDP mainly measures market production…. However, it has often been treated as if it were a measure of economic well-being. Conflating the two can lead to misleading indications about how well-off people are.”
The Report — [Recommendation 2: Emphasise. The household perspective entails taking account of payments between sectors, such as taxes going to government, social benefits coming from government, and interest payments on household loans going to financial corporations. Properly defined, household income and consumption should also reflect in-kind services provided by government, such as subsidized health care and educational services. A major effort of statistical reconciliation will also be required to understand why certain measures such as household income can move differently depending on the underlying statistical source.
Understanding National Accounts, Second Edition [OECD publication]
In short, while GDP is not always a wholly unreasonable proxy in lieu of better alternatives, we reliably know it is not actually directly measuring the variable of interest (the resources available to residents), and we see this proxy (GDP) can be wildly misleading.
In summary, if we want to compare the resources available to residents of countries to spend, we should strongly prefer measures of material living conditions (direct measures) over indirect economy-wide production measures like GDP wherever the data allows.
This is about prediction and causality.
Contra Noah, my argument is not merely that US health spending “is not that high as a percent of individual consumption” whereby presumably changing the denominator from GDP (territory-wide production) to AIC (comprehensive household consumption) makes US health care look less unreasonable. It goes far beyond the United States or which denominator we reference..
As a proxy for the actual causal variable GDP is (increasingly) subject to various types of error. These errors both attenuate the apparent relationship between income and health expenditures in general and, specifically in the case of the United States, undoubtedly lead to dramatically downwardly biased predictions. We can do better.
Note: Economy-wide production, as measured by GDP, is clearly very important in the long run, but countries differ in their endowments, and there is not a simple linear relationship between measured GDP at any point in time and current income, or even the permanent income, countries’ residents — the r-squared is clearly much less than one. This is not an argument against the importance of production or even of the utility of GDP as a measurement for any and all purposes, but mostly an argument against naive application of it. We have better tools to understand how and why households behave as they do. The “rubber meets the road” at the household level in health consumption, even if mediated mainly by public and private institutions in the short run, as in most other forms of consumption.
AIC and AHDI are theoretically and empirically much more robust indicators of the resources available to residents of a country to spend or save. GDP only significantly determines health spending to the extent it determines material living conditions and the relationship between these indicators varies in the spatial and temporal dimensions.
This fits essentially no high-income countries on the regression line–indeed, they increasingly diverge! If one accepts GDP is reasonably well measured amongst high-GDP countries, and that “income” (GDP) is a strong determinant of health spending, this really ought to raise eyebrows. Clearly, something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
I say the meager health spending of most of these presumably high-income countries is remarkably consistent with their sub-par material living standards conditional on GDP. It is surely no coincidence that virtually all of these same countries tracks with their comparatively modest material living conditions.
We can also see some evidence of this in OECD panel data.
Likewise, we find AIC mediates GDP in this same USA-free panel data.
The 3rd specification above does relatively little to improve model fit and is likely over-fitting to some degree (it’s picking up defects in the model), nonetheless, it suggests changes in GDP means little for health spending without corresponding changes in AIC.
Alternatively, if we subtract AIC from GDP [note: this leave us with a figure comprised of collective consumption, gross capital formation, and net exports as defined in GDP expenditure method] so that the two predictors used in the 3rd model sum up exactly to GDP (expenditure method):
Model 3 implies that a 1% increase in AIC yields a ~1.43% increase in health spending whereas a 1% increase in everything else GDP (i.e., GDP-AIC) yields only ~0.11% increase (an order of magnitude less).
Lest you imagine this is some sort of mechanical effect, a consequence of health spending being included in AIC, we see similar patterns when we crudely subtract health from AIC!
The comprehensive household consumption is the clear victor over GDP in this horse race. These patterns become even more pronounced the more these indicators diverge, as in broader international data (not just OECD) and in cross-sectional analyses of OECD data from more recent years. We also find very consistent patterns in the cross-sectional data (i.e., between countries by year) and time-series for the vast majority of nations (wherein elasticity for health spending on AIC is clustered well north of 1 and GDP around 0, likewise for r-squared coefficients, etc.).
Household disposable income mediates GDP and other domestic sectors at least as well.
When we try to predict health spending using adjusted disposable income or the distribution of GDP according to its institutional sector (+RoW), we find a very consistent pattern: the resources (disposable income) in household sector are vastly more important than everything else. The resource found in the household sector effectively mediate everything else in GDP.
For example, in OECD panel data using Gross Adjusted Housing Disposable Income we find the coefficients for the household sector are several orders of magnitude larger than that for all other sectors combined and separately (including, notably, government!).
Similarly, if we assess these relationships as time series for each country, it’s quite evident that elasticity with respect to the household sector is clustered well north of one whereas it’s grouped around zero with respect to other sectors (government and corporate sectors).
Likewise, even if we subtract health spending from the household sector (RE: the mechanical argument), we find the same pattern.
We can also plot these regression coefficients, along with confidence intervals, to compare the effect of disposable income in the household sector versus government (see earlier link to see the other sectors–not much different)
elasticity with respect to household disposable income less health spending
elasticity with respect to government disposable income
It abundantly clear that GDP that shows up as disposable income in the household sector is vastly more predictive than GDP allocated elsewhere (e.g., rest of the world and other institutional sectors within the country). Clearly, this cannot be explained as a US-only phenomenon or as a mechanical consequence of how we allocate healthcare to household consumption or disposable income.
These measures are also superior predictors of just about every socially relevant metric!
This is not just about health spending! AIC is also a substantially stronger predictor than GDP with respect to the vast majority of socially relevant outcomes and their covariates. AIC also tends to mediate GDP for the vast majority of the variables we would associate with “wealthy” countries, whether for good (usually) and for ill (e.g., obesity rates).
Note: Most of these the outcome variable assessed below are lagged by several years relative to our economic predictors (FY 2011), suggesting this is picking up something more than just short-lived benefits of consumption.
Health outcomes
For example, AIC is substantially better correlated with nearly all of IHME’s health access and quality metrics.
Unsurprisingly, we find AIC mediates GDP in multiple regression (OLS) for these same metrics.
Note: The flipped associations for some cancer rates is likely a consequence of higher rates of diagnosis and longer life expectancy in rich countries. It is consistent with AIC being a better predictor of real health care consumption (quantities) and overall health outcomes.
Social Progress Indicators
To give another example, we find AIC trumps GDP with just about every metric available via the Social Progress Index.
World Happiness (survey measures)
Prosperity Index
Legatum’s Prosperity Index, a measure of business and economic conditions
Eurostat Quality of Life
These patterns described above aren’t likely to just be a consequence of some exceeding poor or backward countries because we find much the same in Eurostat’s QoL measures (mostly high-income countries)
Survey-based estimates of disposable income
AIC also aligns better with survey-based estimates of disposable income like Luxembourg Income Study (LIS).
While these survey-estimates are, in my view, quite flawed (substantial missing income, missing taxes, etc.) and inferior to their National Accounts-based cousins, it’s nonetheless notable that AIC does a better job picking up the signal they do detect.
There is much, much more I could show along these lines (I probably already wasted too many inches of screen space!), but the pattern ought to be clear: measures of material living conditions are not always well correlated with production across the whole domestic economy for a variety of reasons. None of this means that production (GDP) isn’t ultimately important, but it does suggest the relationship between measured production within territorial boundaries and the welfare of residents of a country is not as straight-forward or as tightly linked as some like to imagine. When the relationship between these aggregate measures diverge notably, we should put much, much more (instrumental) weight on the likes of AIC and much less weight (~0) on the likes of GDP if we’re interested in these sorts of questions, e.g., people, their preferences, household budgets, and lifestyle.
The US is not much of a consumption outlier.
Contrary to what Noah and others seem to imply, the US does not exactly stand-out in its consumption (AIC) to GDP ratio or its disposable income (AHDI) to GDP ratios. Amongst the OECD dataset (relatively high-income, high-HDI countries), the US is reasonably close to trend — a smidge high, but not particularly so.
Luxembourg, Norway, Ireland, and Switzerland, on the other hand, lie much further away from the trend and far below it. This is very likely a consequence of idiosyncratic features of these countries, such as their economies’ exceptional economic reliance on cross-border workforces, corporate tax inversions, banking and financial services, and (temporary) oil-exports, which critically reduces the statistical relationship between material living conditions and measures of production (e.g., GDP).
Given the very high elasticity of health spending with respect to material living conditions (~1.6), these high-GDP outliers with large negative residuals will dramatically reduce the apparent “income” to health expenditure relationship if one imagines GDP is a good stand-in for individual income and does not selectively omit them from consideration. It is not as if these countries are unusually disciplined with respect to how they spend on health, most of the implied resources (GDP) over and above the EU28 mean just don’t show up anywhere in the household sector. As regards current health expenditures, their spending is far better understood concerning the resources available to residents (the Y-axis) than the amount of economic production happening within territorial boundaries for national accounting purposes (the X-axis).
We see much the same in the broader international picture (World Bank 2011 ICP).
(Or without trimming the particularly extreme outliers)
This is mostly about differences in the disposable income of households.
I have tended to use the consumption approach to material living standards because AIC is more widely available and probably slightly more reliably measured, but wherever the estimates are available or can be calculated from its constituent parts, it yields very consistent answers. Of course, this is not surprising given how closely household consumption and disposable income are correlated (which is likely attributable to the relatively small role differences in household savings rates play, both on a raw and “adjusted” basis).
For example, the patterns we find concerning net adjusted household disposable income as reported in OECD’s latest “Better Life Index” metrics are very similar.
Like we find with consumption (AIC), US net adjusted household disposable income is also apparently high conditional on GDP.
As I mentioned earlier, US consumption appears to be very much in line with its high disposable incomes.
Despite what many seem to believe, the US household savings rate actually compares quite favorably with much of Europe when disposable income is measured in a way that is invariant to whether government provides a relatively high proportion of goods and services in-kind (as opposed to them being purchased privately by households) — see health, education, etc.
Even if we don’t adjust it sensibly, US household savings rates are merely middling (and haven’t changed much over the past 20-30 years). If we use the more sensible “adjusted” measure of disposable income (AHDI), the US moves up in relative terms because the denominator in many social democracies is artificially low due to the relatively larger role of in-kind transfers in those countries [without adjusting for in-kind transfers the US lead in disposable income is far larger still].
Or, perhaps more revealing, comparing the trend in household financial net worth to comprehensive household consumption:
We can also compare a snapshot of household savings to GDP.
This is mostly about differences in the income actually enjoyed by households. The apparently high consumption of US households conditional on GDP is well explained by the high adjusted disposable incomes conditional on GDP.
Nor does this hinge on the exclusion of collective consumption.
I initially settled on indicators of material living conditions (the household perspective) because that is what economic theorists have settled on for welfare analysis. Many theorists argue collective consumption is (mostly) extraneous for welfare analysis; that it is an intermediate input to produce the welfare we measure at the household level. To quote the commision:
“Expenditures required to maintain consumption levels or the functioning of society could be viewed as a sort of intermediate input – there is no direct benefit, and in this sense they do not give rise to a final good or service. Nordhaus and Tobin, in their seminal 1973 paper, for example, identify as “defensive” those activities that “are evidently not directly sources of utility themselves but are regrettably necessary inputs to activities that may yield utility”. In particular, they adjust income downwards for expenditures that arise as a consequence of urbanization and a complex modern life. Many such “defensive expenditures” are incurred by government, while others are incurred by the private sector. By way of example, expenditure on prisons could be considered a government-incurred defensive expenditure and the costs of commuting to work a privately-incurred defensive expenditure.[snip]
First, focus on household consumption rather than total final consumption. For many purposes, the former is a more meaningful variable. And all of governments’ collective consumption expenditures (which would include things like prisons, military expenditure and the clean-up of oil spills) are automatically excluded from household final consumption.”
My own study mainly supports this: collective consumption is a much weaker predictor of health spending and the vast majority of other things we care about. That being said, the results I have found really do not hinge much on whether we try to predict with final consumption (AIC+collective consumption) or AIC alone.
In other words, US final consumption is still high conditional on GDP because US collective consumption is also actually quite high and final consumption tends to correlate quite well with AIC in practice.
The US is no slouch in collective consumption either.
So it can hardly be surprising the US residual is similarly modest concerning final consumption.
Nevertheless, I still prefer the household perspective (AIC, NAHDI, etc.) because of its theoretical strength and because it holds up better in repeated analyses I have performed.
For example:
Even if we crudely “adjust” AIC by removing health spending to address the “mechanical effect” objection, as in model 4, it still mediates collective consumption quite clearly.
The disagreement is mostly attributable to differences in the GDP share of the corporate sector and the flow of incomes across borders.
While the household perspective is surely the one we should be concerned with for our purposes, some people argue these results are primarily a consequence of some combination of differences in government savings/borrowing/investment or (collective) consumption behavior. One effective way to speak to this concern is to just combine the Net National Disposable Income (NNDI) of the household and government sectors together as if they were one entity, and compare it to the size of the corporate sector and Other (non-NNDI) as a share of GDP. NNDI is consumption + net savings, so this effectively addresses concerns over in differences in real savings too.
The combined sector for the US is still above average as a proportion of GDP, but more importantly, several countries in Europe are way below average. Their shortfall is explained both by proportionally larger corporate NNDI and “Other,” i.e., expenditures included in GDP not found in NNDI. “Other” includes things like consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) for all sectors, but it’s mostly large observable differences in net primary incomes (e.g., dividends, wages, rent, etc.) and, to a lesser degree, net secondary incomes (e.g., remittances) moving outside domestic boundaries. In some countries, such as the United States, the income going-in in modestly exceed those going out whereas, in others, such as Ireland and Luxembourg, they’re massively going out on balance (as a proportion of their small economies).
Another way to visualize this:
This gives a rough indication of how much is across borders (or depreciation) and how much is between domestic sectors (households+goverment vs. corporations).
Ireland and Luxembourg are just two particularly pronounced examples. However, similar patterns have been playing out elsewhere in less apparent but still cumulatively significant ways vis-a-vis the predictive powers of GDP and its association with the variable of interest. They are even more substantial when magnified by differences in GDP per capita and differences in PPPs (consumers vs. producers).
Differences in the relative size of the government sector, neither its savings nor its (collective) consumption, can’t explain away the US lead and, especially, the apparently large residual vis-a-vis GDP.
It’s also notable that US government net lending appears to be pretty close to its long-term average.
Nor have US household savings obviously departed from their long-term average.
Overall these results are consistent with the different impacts of globalization and the increasing importance of directly measuring material living standards instead of relying on proxies like GDP. [You might try reading this for a discussion of differences in the evolution of GDP and AHDI]
Nor is it likely US consumption has become detached from economic fundamentals.
As argued recently by Karen Dynan and Louise Sheiner in a Brookings paper on GDP and welfare, real GDP and real consumption have moved near identically in the US.
In other words, while the consumption share of GDP may have increased a few percentage points in nominal terms, it’s not “eating the US economy” in real terms. The difference between nominal and real movements must be resolved by differences in the evolution of price indices for producers versus consumers. This, in turn, is likely substantially explained by substantially under-estimated increases in nominal GDP (which probably relates to transfer price, profit shifting, etc.– which is reflected in differences in net exports, capital investment, etc.)
To quote Sheiner and Dynan:
“the rise of global supply chains and the legal latitude that companies have in declaring in which countries their economic activity takes place lend material downward bias to estimates of U.S. nominal GDP. In particular, ‘transfer… In 2013, the subcommittee found that Apple used favorable transfer pricing agreements to shift billions of dollars of profits from the United States to Ireland… More generally, Hines (2005) and Lipsey (2006) show that U.S. MNEs register more profits in tax havens than can plausibly be accounted for by economic activity. [researchers].
Nevertheless, the near identical movement of real GDP and real consumption in the US does not mean we can necessarily expect the same in other countries’ time-series or that there is any closer of a correspondence between real GDP and real consumption (or household disposable income) in cross-sectional analysis than I have already shown at length. Quite the opposite, given the increasing challenges of accurately measuring GDP as a result of globalization, measuring consumption (or consumption possibilities for AHDI) directly becomes relatively more important for tracking the evolution of material living conditions between countries.
US health spending did not diverge from other developed countries until material living standards diverged from GDP internationally.
US health spending was thoroughly unremarkable for most of the seventies (and even later).
Despite the fact that one could tell the same story about the alleged importance of market failures in health care, excess health inflation, high physician wages, and so on and so forth before, the United States was not the highest spending and it was very close to the GDP-indicated trend up until around the late-70s to early 80s. If these presumably distinguishing factors didn’t cause relatively high expense before, why should we believe they explain high spending now? What changed?
I submit it’s no coincidence that US material living standards, while always high by OECD standards, did not start to diverge from other high GDP countries until around this same time period.
This difference, however, owes less to the change in US behavior than the much more substantial change amongst a handful of small high GDP countries, the combined effect of which broke the strong relationship between AIC and GDP that had existed previously within the OECD.
Even as late as 1980 the link was strong and the US was clearly close to trend, but in the eighties, nineties, and aughts the position that GDP maps consistently to individual income across countries or across time became increasingly untenable.
So it shouldn’t be surprising health spending followed a somewhat similar trend, albeit magnified given the high income elasticity of health expenditures.
The long-term trend for the US is pretty similar to what my crude model would predict when fitted without the USA in the training data, both regarding its initial position and the split from the rest.
It’s even closer when fitted with the United States, of course. Given the observed non-linear relationship, the magnitude of the US lead in AIC, the plausibility of the model, lagging/variable rates of response (not directly modeled), and so on I don’t think this is entirely unreasonable as a means to provide some context.
We see similar shifts play out in the consumption share of GDP.
To be clear, the PPP-adjusted panel data is very consistent with the argument that real consumption did not grow appreciably faster than real GDP in the United States. The difference is mostly found in other OECD countries where real consumption (and real household disposable incomes) failed to track with real GDP growth. This was likely substantially due to globalization, such as, increased cross-border workforces and tax avoidance behaviors of corporations (particularly predominantly US-owned corporations), which probably had an outsized inflationary effect on the GDP a handful of small countries (e.g., Ireland) while modestly deflating US nominal GDP.
US consumption patterns are highly consistent with its indicated material living conditions.
When Noah et al. blithely dismiss these arguments with assertions like “this isn’t very convincing, consumption is a result of high health-care prices as well as an effect,” I wonder if they’re paying attention. Never mind (1) that US health spending is also explained by high adjusted household disposable income or (2) the residual with respect to household disposable income is modest or (3) US leads in health-spending-adjusted-AIC and there is a significant positive residual in relation to GDP and so on and so forth, we can also see to degree to which this claim is plausible based on how consistent US consumption patterns are with its indicated material living conditions (AIC or AHDI).
If measured AIC and the like are inflated in a way that Noah suggests, I would expect the US to clearly stand apart out from the rest because presumably, health is pushing up consumption to a degree markedly different than other countries. That is, I would expect that health spending would be unusually high conditional on measured AIC and other categories, especially those with high elasticities, would be unusually low for a country with such high indicated material living conditions. We find no such evidence.
For example, if we run Principal Components Analysis on indices of the volume of expenditures per capita across all available expenditure categories and use the first component score, which explains the majority of the systematic variance, we find this score is very well correlated with AIC and that the US is very much on trend.
Note: we see this after adjusting for price levels for each category, as in the “real volume” measures above, and we find this when these categories are instead adjusted with broader PPPs like AIC or GDP
This same factor is comparatively poorly correlated with GDP (which, unsurprisingly, is entirely mediated by AIC)
Even when we progressively pare down the principal components analysis of these consumption categories in real per capita terms (as in, quantities per capita) we find tremendous alignment with the real AIC per capita indicated by OECD and others. For example, if we run PCA on real expenditures per capita excluding health, education, and transportation, things which people presumably believe the US is uniquely distorted in, we still find it’s well correlated with AIC and the USA is very close to trend.
And, again, we find GDP is comparatively weakly correlated with the extracted component.
Given the substantially different loadings/elasticities found in these analyses, we really shouldn’t expect to see this if our consumption was distorted as Noah implies, i.e., our real consumption in non-health categories should be notably consistent with a more impoverished country than indicated.
On the other hand, if you don’t trust dimension reduction techniques like PCA, you can painstakingly analyze the data category-by-category. You can still see that the US compares favorably on all categories reasonably well correlated or with reasonably high elasticity with respect to wealth, that it’s on the AIC trend and usually above the GDP trend. It’s not the negative outlier it ought to be if Noah’s supposition were correct.
As with these dimensionally reduced results, as with health spending, AIC is consistently substantially better correlated with these indicators of consumption and mediates GDP with respect to virtually every consumption variable with prosperity [with the apparent exception of alcohol and tobacco in OECD data — which is almost certainly due to non-resident shoppers in Luxembourg!]. We find this in broad international data (World Bank ICP), and we see this amongst the narrower subset of mostly high-income countries located in the OECD databases (a pattern which is even more evident if we regress on the remaining components of GDP after subtracting AIC)
The US plainly consumes much more across the board. It does so in a way that is highly consistent with the measured AIC or adjusted household disposable income.
And it’s often well above what would be indicated by GDP.
Interestingly, across a large number of consumption categories, the elasticity of consumption varies and varies in a way that is rather consistent across time with some modest exceptions, e.g., the growth of IT/communications (in real terms). In other words, if we have a reasonable estimate of real AIC per capita, we can make pretty good predictions across these consumption categories (especially those with higher elasticities), both regarding their real per capita and terms of their share of consumption expenditures. Again, despite different loadings, transforms, etc. used in these analyses, we find the US allocations across categories tracks well with real AIC per capita over time (even when framed on an annual basis as in this animated GIF)
Substantial reverse causation is not likely.
Typically when one wants to argue A (health spending) primarily causes B (overall consumption), A must plausibly precede B. However, the arrow of causation moves overwhelmingly from increases in (measured) material living conditions to increases in health spending because changes in household disposable income are followed several years later by even larger changes in health expenditures.
As discussed by none other than Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), disposable personal income (DPI), the domestic counterpart to AHDI, is a particularly strong determinant of health expenditures (elasticity =~ 1.4) and health spending lags it by several years due to delays in institutional responses (payers, employers, providers, etc.).
As discussed at length earlier in the paper, real per capita DPI is a highly influential variable in our model of private PHC spending. While our estimates are based on time-series data for the United States alone and include spending only by private payers, the importance of this variable is consistent with a large body of literature examining the empirical relationship between national income and health spending. A number of studies based on time-series cross-country data for the [OECD] economies confirm the importance of the link between health spending and income. It has been repeatedly shown that variations in real per capita GDP (used as a proxy for income due to data availability) account for a substantial share of variation in health spending across countries and time.
In the econometric model of real per capita private personal health care spending, income has a lagged effect on health spending. To capture the timing of these lags, the income term in our model of PHC spending is incorporated as a polynomial-distributed lag estimated over 7 years (from 6 previous years through the current period). Our estimates imply that the effect of income on private health care spending growth rises to a peak at a lag of about 2 years. The specification of the model with all variables expressed as log-differences (growth rates) implies that coefficients on model variables can be interpreted as price and income elasticities, which are constant over time.
Though fluctuations in growth in aggregate income have some immediate effects on growth in private PHC spending, these initial impacts are usually fairly small. The current-period income elasticity in the NHE Econometric Model is only about 0.2... The estimated lagged effect of income for private PHC spending growth peaks at a lag of 2 years. The effective long-term income elasticity of private PHC spending (the sum of estimated coefficients over 7 years) is 1.4…..
The long lags that are built into this model reflect several important characteristics of markets for health services. In particular, since private insurers or public payers account for the large majority of health expenditures, this spending is largely insulated from contemporaneous changes in household income. Furthermore, consumers generally do not pay for most medical expenses directly at the point of purchase. For the most part, the decisions of insured patients are not immediately affected by changes in income except in those cases in which substantial parts of the expenditure are paid for out-of-pocket….
The other critical element captured by the lag in the impact of income growth on private PHC spending is the role of multiple intermediaries between consumers and medical providers….
Furthermore, CMS clearly doesn’t think GDP is all it’s cracked up to be. Indeed, they use the disposable income of households as the dominant exogenous predictor variable in their long-term forecasts, and they note that real GDP per capita is “used as a proxy for income due to data availability” in international comparisons.
I have likewise plotted the all personal health expenditures (public AND private) in relation to analogous measures of material living conditions without incorporating any lags directly into the smoothers to make the sequencing a little more obvious (over the past few decades, as the role of 3rd party payment, has increased, the lag in response has grown).
The robust link between these variables goes back even further in the data I have reviewed, but the lag is readily apparent over the past few decades due to the growing role of 3rd party payers, both public and private (i.e., less and less of the economic burden of health consumption is on the consumers of health care).
Prices and Inflation
The relative increase in health spending is poorly explained by the increasing price of healthcare.
Contrary to Noah Smith’s ostensible argument and contrary to the explicit arguments of Josh Bivens of EPI, the rise in US health spending relative to incomes over the past several decades is poorly explained by any broad index of health inflation in the United States. All mainstream indices of designed to track the rate of inflation in the actual overall health prices, including the BEA index Bivens used, show that health price inflation can only explain a modest fraction of the observed increase in health spending relative to GDP, disposable income, or overall consumption over reasonably long time spans. Much to the contrary, the indices of health expenditure volume derived by BEA, CMS, and others imply the increase is mostly a consequence of real health consumption (as in “volume” or “quantity”) rising faster than real incomes. I suppose some may try to dispute the accuracy of these inflation measures, but this is clearly what is indicated by all of the major price indices!
While it is true the measured health inflation reported by these same indices typically exceeds the broader rate of inflation by a healthy amount, the long-run rate of measured health inflation has usually not even surpassed the long-run rate of nominal growth in income or consumption (certainly not by much for long).
data on FRED
The identity is price * quantity = value, ergo if the percentage change in price is less than the percentage change in the denominator with which we are evaluating value (e.g., nominal health spending / nominal GDP), the health share will decline unless the increase in quantity is substantially higher than zero (in this case appreciably greater than percentage change in GDP per capita).
If the health share of GDP (or PCE, DPI, etc.) actually increased, which it most certainly did, then it must be true that the quantity (volume) of health consumed increased faster than GDP increased. One just cannot reference an index of this sort to claim the increases have been driven primarily by price inflation. Adjusting for excess medical inflation (health inflation over and above the broader rate of inflation) reduces the apparent rate of real health spending growth somewhat, but clearly, the dominant factor according to these estimates is volume (quantity).
For example, between 2000 and 2016, a period in which nominal health spending more than doubled, nominal GDP and nominal disposable personal income grew significantly faster than the rate of measured inflation across broad indices of health prices and most of the sub-components (except for prescription drugs and hospital services with respect to GDP).
We find much the same in CMS’s price indices [Personal Health Care (PHC) being the price index of overall healthcare costs]
There is broad agreement on these points amongst CMS, BEA, and related government/statistical agencies with regard price indices designed to track the overall rate of inflation in the health care sector; all of them imply the (broad) inflation-adjusted increase in health expenditures (as in, deflated by CPI, PCE, etc.) over the past several decades is overwhelmingly a consequence of the quantity (volume) of health consumption rising faster than real incomes because these price indices simply have not substantially exceeded the rate of nominal income growth.
The results in earlier decades might be a bit more debatable because our price measurements likely weren’t as good. Nevertheless, even there the consensus view amongst experts that have actually researched this is that “excess” or “relative” health inflation (i.e., health inflation over and above the rate of general inflation) explains at most a modest fraction of the observed growth in health spending.
source
The majority of health inflation is not even reasonably attributable to “market failure.”
The health sector is a predominantly a domestic service sector. It is a labor-intensive industry that does not enjoy substantial productivity gains that result from technological improvements (e.g., automation) and, unlike most goods, the services cannot be readily traded with other (lower-wage) countries. As implied by Baumol’s cost disease, the productivity gains found in other areas of the economy tend to spillover as real wage growth throughout the economy, including the healthcare sector, and this wage growth will tend to be reflected as excess price inflation in the healthcare sector. The existence of cost disease is about as close to a consensus view as can be found amongst economists.
source
Health prices have only increased modestly faster than the overall service price index.
This is also much slower than the rate of inflation in education, not just higher ed, but also pre-K, primary, and secondary education. We also find inflation significantly over and above the average price index for most others services. One might be tempted to dismiss inflation in health and education as somehow unique, arguably a consequence of government intervention or market failure, but why else would we find this in so many other areas? So long as wages in these services reflect real income growth and their productivity does not increase as rapidly as the broader economy, I don’t see how we can reasonably expect much different than what we observe.
These are even less likely to be primarily attributable to unique features of health care in the United States because the evidence we see in other countries is broadly consistent with this.
For example, the pattern we see cross-sectionally is what Baumol’s effect implies: the relative prices of goods in high-income countries are much less than what we observe in low-income countries, vice versa for services. These patterns are even more obvious and more consistent with respect to AIC (as has been noted by OECD researchers), but I’ll display it with respect to GDP for doubters.
What this tells us is that services in general, not just healthcare, cost substantially more on average in high-income countries. Residents of these countries typically earn higher real incomes than residents of lower income countries and productivity gains are not enough to offset them.
Likewise, the relative price of healthcare is substantially higher amongst richer countries in OECD/Eurostat every year.
Put differently, as compared to the EU28 mean the real price of a comparable basket of medical goods and services varies substantially and is quite well explained by national wealth (albeit still not enough to explain more than a small part of the relationship between income and health spending).
We can also clearly see this as a trend in relative prices (health inflation over and above the rate of general inflation) amongst several European countries.
source
Likewise, the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP) published by OECD suggests health inflation faced directly by individuals has substantially exceeded that of overall inflation (“All Items”) in most developed countries and in the EU28 as a whole.
The modest excess healthcare inflation found in the United States is in no way unique. It is located in most other service sectors (those which are actually particularly reliant on domestic labor), and comparable results are found in the health sectors of other developed countries.
The best evidence indicates US health prices are consistent with its income level.
According to the price indices and derived volume estimates in several years worth of OECD’s PPP benchmarks, along with several closely related studies, both overall health prices and prices for the hospital services (surgical procedures) are not unusually high for a country of its income level. In other words, US health spending is overwhelmingly explained by volume (quantity).
For example, according to this 2017 OECD publication, the index of real volume per capita when adjusted by health PPP (prices) was 210.
This implies the US consumed 110% more health care than the average OECD country when adjusted for health prices whereas we consume 140% more at GDP prices. This, of course, reduces the imputed volume of health care consumed, as it tends to do in higher-income countries, but not unusually so.
The results I found in the published data for 2014 reveal much the same pattern.
Their published tables and plots for prices, both PPPs and price level indices, are entirely consistent with this, but they require some extra work to allow for ready comparison. For example, they show the price level index (PLI) for US healthcare was 114 in 2014 (just 14% above the OECD average), and PLI for hospital services was 130 (30% above the OECD average).
Both of these are far the highest and would be much less than what one might naively predict based on incomes (see here for a clearer illustration for 2011).
PLIs are a little hard to interpret because it is the ratio of the PPP to the market exchange rate and, particularly in the case of the US, can be a bit misleading. My preferred method to illustrate pricing is to just divide the PPP (e.g., health) by the broader PPP to give a reasonable sense of domestic opportunity cost. As in, how much more of a basket of consumption/expenditure (AIC or GDP) must one give up in given country to buy an equal quantity of health services as compared to the OECD average.
This approach yields practical, readily interpretable results comparable to how people usually try to compare the prices of individual goods and services.
So, for example, we compare the price of overall health care to our index of material living conditions– we can see that the real cost of healthcare does appear to rise with national income levels (consistent with cost disease theory)
Likewise, but for hospital services (surgical procedures)
I trust the data produced by these OECD researchers for recent health PPPs a lot more than others because (1) they obviously put a lot more care into design, (2) they disclose their methods, (3) they draw on a much more extensive array of countries than the slip-shod stuff most people cite on these issues, and (4) they work in conjunction with multiple national health agencies. Most importantly, their methods actually allow us to reasonably infer true price differences because it allows for reasonably “apples-to-apples” comparisons.
Although I much prefer the finished product found in the published PPP benchmark estimates to assess the likely role of prices, one can also see earlier results comparing quasi-prices for individual surgical procedures by many of the same researchers in published papers. I took the liberty of plotting all available prices some time ago, but here’s a truncated version (results are very similar–US is not notably above trend).
And read this…
To give an example of the planning they put into this, click the links for types of costs assessed, case types used for hospital services, sample criteria for a particular case type, data collection sample for compensation, and mapping of occupations and skills. It’s surely not perfect, no method is, but it’s clearly been carefully done over many years, and it surely stands a good chance of being able to pick up the alleged sources of high costs in the US.
After this substantial effort, these researchers clearly found that the volume of health consumption per capita correlated strongly with material living conditions (AIC) and that the US health spending was still very high, regardless of the method used to deflate health expenditures (input or output).
And that price levels of health tend to be well correlated with broader price levels (usually higher than AIC in high-income countries, lower in low-income countries).
Let’s compare this to the International Federation of Health Plans (IFHP) results, which Josh Bivens and just about everyone else has inexplicably relied upon over the past few years to argue US challenges with healthcare are fundamentally unique and primarily about prices.
Despite IFHP’s nominal disclosure, it’s nonetheless apparent they mix and match data for different sectors and different regions of countries without any rhyme or reason:
They also combine data from different institutional settings.
And make comparisons across different bundles and goods and services.
They even sometimes have acknowledged some of the issues raised by their so-called “methods.”
Most of these comparisons are also drawn across a tiny number of countries and across a small subset of payer than often don’t reflect the actual composition of spending in those same countries. Their efforts in no way, shape, or form allow us to make “apples-to-apples” comparisons of prices in different countries.
I would also think some critics would be reluctant to take the ad hoc results of small, otherwise little-known, private health insurance trade group, that seemingly started publishing these powerpoint documents around 2009, that otherwise has not been active in producing data for public consumption, and is not particularly transparent about how they go about this, but maybe that’s just me. A few grains of salt are in order. Regardless, potential conflicts and institutional reliability aside, this data smells.
Their prices don’t seem to be as well correlated with national income or with the price levels of other countries as determined by OECD in their Hospital Services PPP. This suggests measurement issues that extend far beyond US-specific measurement. Reliably measuring prices, particularly health prices, is hard even when it’s not a politically charged topic and I see no reason to take their half-hearted attempts seriously.
Utilization and Intensity
Metrics that do not meaningfully predict spending elsewhere should not be used to argue US expenditures are not driven by volume.
Many people insist on using metrics that are poorly correlated with health expenditures to argue the challenges the United States faces in health finance have nothing to do with excess volume. As many others have done before, Bivens cites what he calls “broad measures” of health activity, namely physician visits and hospital stays (discharges), to argue “Americans use less health care.”
While these measures may seem to make sense superficially and might have made some sense circa 1930, when physicians provided most of what little the sector could offer patients, they don’t make much sense as a way to assess differences between countries or changes over time in recent years.
source
source
Even more on point, they clearly do not correlate with spending cross-sectionally within the OECD.
Doctors consultations are not correlated with health spending.
Nor in-patient discharges!
Nor curative care discharges!
Nor curative care bed-days
It’s not like we don’t have plentiful evidence that health spending is rising more rapidly than income in other countries and that this is mostly a result of rising real consumption–both within and between countries. However, the same indicators proffered by others fail to meaningfully explain the rise in health spending elsewhere!
You may not like it, but this is what peak healthcare performance looks like.
If you accept the premise spending is rising rapidly in other countries and that this is mostly real (not prices), as the evidence strongly suggests, you ought to re-evaluate how you think about the drivers of health-care costs (especially volume.)
It’s the intensity, stupid.
There is an important, much neglected, omitted variable in most popular analyses of health spending. Much evidence suggests (1) real health consumption is rising much faster than incomes throughout the OECD and (2) measured utilization and its covariates (e.g., disease burden) have not changed very much. There is no necessary reason why these facts must be at odds with each other.
source
We see this same pattern inside and outside the United States. There is a huge, often omitted, third variable, a categorically different way to think about this: we do much more per health system encounter and/or per sick patient than we once did.
Let’s call this intensity.
Expenditure = Price * Volume
Volume = Utilization * Intensity
Expenditure = Price * Utilization * Intensity
Even if price and utilization actually remained wholly unchanged (they’re not quite), both volume and expenditures can rise rapidly and in-lock-step with percentage increases in intensity.
The overall growth in health care relative to income cannot be plausibly explained primarily as a consequence inflation over the past few decades because these changes are pretty well captured by differences in the types and quantities of these goods and services and poorly explained by price changes for the same goods and services.
For example, above and beyond the earlier discussed price index data and derived volumes, researchers found the substantial overall growth in health spending amongst the privately insured was approximately 100% explained by rising quantities.
These results are highly consistent with the price and volume indices constructed by government agencies (BEA, CMS, etc.) going back decades and compatible with virtually every other study of reasonable scope.
Some other people have argued it’s “price” and cited several studies to support their arguments, but the underlying studies are not methodologically equipped to support this claim (though some authors imply otherwise when talking to the press or in other public fora).
Here is a typical example:
.”
If you actually look at the study what they actually measured is what they call “price and intensity.”
This is little more than the average cost per health system encounter, as in, per visit, per bed-day, and per prescription filled. Changes in price were not actually assessed and no account was made for differences in treatment on a per encounter basis (new or changing composition in surgeries, drugs, devices, diagnostics, etc.). In other words, their data are very consistent with my arguments and with the indices reported by CMS and BEA, even though how they sometimes lead people to believe something very different.
Given the available evidence from other OECD countries (e.g., bed days, discharges, physician visits, etc.) it’s likely their (domestic) data if assessed with similarly granular “utilization” indicators, would show much the same. In other words, most would show at most very modest increases in “utilization” and thus most of the observed growth could be similarly lumped into “price and intensity” if it were reported similarly. Meanwhile, as in the US, we know the price indices don’t support this over reasonably long time spans (not in most developed countries at least), so that pretty much leaves us with “intensity” and there are a good number of indicators to support this view.
My arguments on the role of price, volume, and income are also consistent with the empirically-derived assumptions used by CMS’s Office of Actuary (OACT) in their 75-year medical expenditure models.
Put differently, the rise in health expenditures relative to income is primarily one of technological change, not excess medical inflation, and CMS OACT models it mostly as an enormous income effect.
In short, the government actuarial models, a reflection of mainstream thinking amongst subject matter experts, places little weight on prices, little weight on utilization, and a great deal of importance on technology (and its relationship to income) in the growth of health spending over the past forty years and going forward.
Incidentally, the dominant role of technology/intensity (broadly speaking) as a proximate cause of health spending helps partially explain the differences between the income-elasticities observed at a national (>1), regional ( > 0.5, < 1), and individual level (~0). Even if utilization and prices vary little with income at these levels of analysis, the intensity of medicine is primarily determined at higher levels of aggregation. For instance, if the standard of care is mostly determined by the average (mean) resources available in the larger community, the intensity with which health providers and hospitals diagnose and treat given symptoms/conditions isn’t likely to vary appreciably with the individual income of the patients (save for to the extent this indicates the mean of the broader community).
Given that the individual income elasticity for health expenditures is approximately zero in the United States and most other developed countries, the plot for average expenditure by income decile should look roughly like this within the OECD.
A very rich person in a poor country, for example, isn’t likely to get an MRI scan if he presents with a head injury at an emergency room in his own country. Even if he could afford the fees at US prices, there isn’t the critical mass of people that could afford, let alone demand, that on the margins. Conversely, a low-income person in a rich country may prefer to take a bit more risk under comparable circumstances in the United States and opt-out of such cutting-edge medicine if the choice was left up to him, finding such cutting-edge care to only be worth a fraction of what it costs society (probably similar patterns at the state/regional level with spillover effects and cross-subsidization from rich to poor states/regions )
The United States does more procedures, uses more diagnostics, and exhibits other characteristics that actually are associated with higher income, higher spending, and higher intensity.
Technology and that which is associated with it (additional staff, training, etc.) is the overwhelming proximate cause of rising health spending within and between countries, as in, more new procedures, diagnostics, pharmaceutical/biotech, medical devices, and so on and so forth. While the US may not consume more of those things that are mainly uncorrelated-to-even-modestly inversely associated with health expenditures in both the temporal (over-time) and spatial (between-country) dimensions, the bulk of the available objective measures indicates the United States does more of those things that actually are correlated with income and health spending in both dimensions.
Noah is just wrong on this bit:
“Looking at how often Americans use specific medical services such as knee replacements and C-sections, he finds that they generally tend to use fewer of these procedures than people in a number of other developed countries.”
(emphasis mine)
More importantly, the US is typically right about where we would expect it to be concerning those direct measures of volume which are well linked to higher health spending (especially when they are). Examples of these in published data include CT scans, MRI scans, coronary bypass, knee replacements, hip replacements, kidney transplants, and so on and so forth.
We also do less of those things (and covariates) that are inversely associated with income and health spending (especially when they are).
Of course, these sorts of indicators are just the tip of the iceberg. They are not nearly comprehensively enough to directly explain even half of the difference directly– not in the US or in other OECD countries–exhaustive indicators of this sort aren’t even available domestically (I wish!). By the time OECD, WHO, and company get around to tabulating and reporting such metrics across a reasonably large number of countries, the indicators often already a little dated, as in, higher-income, higher-spending locations have already started moving onto newer tech, procedures, etc. Nonetheless, where such data are available they are (on the whole) very consistent my arguments and the body of literature I’ve cited.
As discussed in yet another blog post, one can assess the available indicators somewhat more systematically, e.g., compare the loadings or correlation coefficients to the average values for the US as compared to other OECD countries. Here, too, we find observable characteristics in procedures, diagnostics, and the like offer a reasonable amount of explanatory power overall and we see the US generally on-trend.
It’s not a coincidence the US has a much larger health workforce than others — a major input into health care costs.
Nor is it a coincidence health sector’s share of employment (head counts, not wages) has grown markedly.
source
Indeed, if one looks at health spending from the point of view health expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) employed directly in the health services sector, it is likely there has been approximately no significant sustained increase over and above material living conditions.
In other words, this isn’t likely to be explained by health wages or profits rising substantially faster than real economic growth in the long run. Instead, this is primarily explained by rising real inputs [e.g., number of employees, their skill level (see nursing and technicians) and, to a much lesser degree, the costs of those inputs rising with average incomes without productivity improvements fast enough to offset them (mostly Baumol’s effect).
We also find health employment rates explains a substantial portion of the considerable variation in health spending found between states (both of which correlate robustly with material living conditions at the state level).
source
Further perspective
Health spending is “eating” all OECD countries.
Every OECD country that has seen their standard of living rise over the past few decades has experienced a substantial increase in the health share of Adjusted Household Disposable Incomes and as a share of Actual Individual Consumption.
Indeed, the overall pattern conditional on real AIC per capita in constant dollars is very similar, i.e., approximately the same level and roughly the same slope (with a pattern of reversion towards the trend observed amongst other countries). Few appear to be obviously “better,” and several appear to be “worse.”
I don’t have the panel data for Net Adjusted Household Disposable Income handy right now and there’s not as much of it available in the databases, but it’s clear these patterns would be near-identical if assessed on that basis instead.
The US has distinguished itself principally insofar as it is further along the household income frontier — an exceptionally rich country without any true contemporaneous peers (as of yet). That being said, even if one insists on using GDP despite much evidence to the contrary, one can hardly reasonably claim that health spending is not “eating” most OECD economies if one applies this term to the US.
The tiny handful of countries that have a weak claim on following a markedly different (especially “better”) trend are those with highly atypical economies (see Ireland, Luxembourg, and Norway)
Moreover, the fact that health spending arguably increased much less in a handful of (atypical) countries with respect to measured GDP does not speak to Noah’s apparent concern about the effect of health costs on take-home wages since these same countries are also the ones with abnormally low wages, and unusually low adjusted disposable incomes, conditional on GDP. The question really should be whether these countries’ residents can enjoy the sort of real average incomes US households do currently and still spend a lot less on health care in the long run.
The evidence thus far suggests not! For instance, in a rudimentary model on OECD panel data to predict health expenditures controlling for year fixed effects, GDP, and AIC, I find AIC effectively mediates both the increasing secular trend associated with time (as in “technology”) and with GDP.
Here are some quick visualizations for how these terms play out in the model:
Likewise, if I change GDP to be the remainder after subtracting AIC, I get much the same result.
GDP and time (a proxy for technology) have at most very modest independent predictive value once we have a reasonable measure of material living conditions (e.g., real AIC per capita in constant dollars). I obtain similar results in many different specifications, both with and without the USA included, and with and without outliers (e.g., Luxembourg). One need not “work at it” to attain such results (it’s not particularly sensitive to these choices). Furthermore, the very modest coefficient on non-AIC GDP would be even smaller if modeled using its income counterpart, i.e., AHDI instead of AIC.
***
Norway, one of the main outliers, can serve as an illustrative example to clarify some issues here (I hope!).
The disagreement between GDP and material living conditions we have observed in Norway over the past few decades, whether measured by household income or consumption, largely reflects what they can afford. If we regress GDP several decades hence against current GDP, informed observers are apt to predict Norway will have a substantial negative residual (especially relative other countries high in human capital) because their extractable oil resources are unlikely to keep up with the production from countries less dependent on extractive industries. That is, their current GDP over-predicts future GDP.
Consequently, they are quite reasonably engaging in substantial consumption smoothing, as are many other petrostates. While they might theoretically be able to consume much more of their gross value add (GDP) today, even failing to make additional capital investments necessary to maintain current oil production (and hence profits), this would exceed what they could actually sustain and they would rapidly cede ground in the material living standards dimension to other developed countries. But, anyways, the point is that as their oil revenues dry up and they start leaning relatively more heavily on their sovereign wealth fund to maintain their relatively high material standard of living, the trend in the consumption (or disposable income) share of GDP will get flipped around.
Presumably, the Noah believes this implies a relative decline in health spending whereas I would predict very much the opposite, i.e., the health share of GDP will increase markedly because their material standard of living shouldn’t be much affected, but their GDP (especially capital investment and net exports) will decline in relative terms. I’m not the only one to make this sort of observation (though perhaps to approach it systematically?).
Indeed, this was pointed out in a recent OECD health working-paper on Norway’s health spending:
[snip]
[snip]
[snip]
While they do not necessarily explicitly articulate my position, let alone generalize it, their argument is nonetheless consistent with mine and quite inconsistent with the GDP-as-individual-income presumably endorsed by Noah and others.
The cross-sectional slope between real material living conditions and health spending has increased markedly over time.
The visible cross-sectional slope amongst OECD countries has increased considerably over time (even excluding the US).
If one were to try to extrapolate health spending today based on the observed linear trend in 1970, they’d under-estimate the expenditure of most high-income countries today by almost 100%. These patterns are generally inconsistent with technology as a major root cause of health spending, save for its effects on broader economic productivity.
My main point here, however, is just that cross-sectional results are pretty much the exact opposite of what people arguing the rest of the world has the health expenditure problem pretty well figured out imply. Indeed, rather than declining as a share of income, or even holding kinda-sorta steady, it’s clearly increasing increasingly. Further, it is doing so in a way that is quite well described by a third-order polynomial when assessed across all years simultaneously.
If this particular non-linear model is a true model, in the sense that it’s a much closer approximation of the true non-linear processes behind the income effect, it implies the cross-sectional models in this same data are also likely biased. In other words, not only do the linear models on the cross-sectional data fit less well (at least relative to what we can determine from panel data), they are systematically biased with respect to income because the linear fit it generates can only crudely approximate the overall slope found amongst the observations at any point in time.
This pattern may be hard to demonstrate cross-sectionally in the OECD data because of a small number of countries in their datasets, but that does not mean it’s not real, only that it can be hard to demonstrate when the model for each year is assessed separately. We can also make this point by assembling the residuals of the linear models for each year and plotting them against differences from mean AIC for each year.
As described it an older post, the linear models cannot fit relatively low, middle, and high-income countries without systematic error of this sort, especially not when the dispersion of income is relatively wide in the given year. Even when modeled with decent indicators of material living conditions, like AIC, countries with exceptionally high indicated values will tend to have systematically higher residuals than they ought to (especially concerning middling income countries).
Where we need panel data (multiple years) to show the non-linear model is quite clearly superior (e.g., AIC, BIC) in OECD data (small n), this much more readily leaps out in cross-sectional analyses of data in broader databases including many more countries, such as the World Bank ICP data (much larger n) or Penn World Tables (on final consumption).
The non-linearity observed in these various datasets are also consistent with the long-run growth trajectory of the US health spending.
source
And OECD time series.
In other words, something like a logistic growth curve with an S-shape (e.g., sigmoid function) is quite possible, and some researchers have actually advanced this very possibility (which doesn’t look too different than other forms of technological adoption)
source
Higher spending in other countries does not appear to be associated with systematically better outcomes past a certain point.
Not only do other developed countries continue to spend a similar proportion of their (household) incomes; purchase healthcare at similar relative prices, and consume similar (observable) quantities of cutting-edge medicine conditional on material living standards; the high spending levels of other high-income countries do not appear to buy them systematically better outcomes.
Lower spending Italy and Spain attain better life expectancy than the likes of Norway and Luxembourg despite spending about half as much on health, not to mention being poorer and probably less competent institutionally! While some may crudely approximate this relationship as if it were log-linear, as in the Preston Curve, this relationship appears to flatten out entirely beyond fairly moderate expenditure levels (say ~3K/yr). Unless one assumes some sort of countervailing force (e.g., obesity) to systematically offset the benefits of higher income and higher health spending, it tends to suggest that most of the spending growth amongst other high-income countries over the past decade or two is no less “flat of the curve” medicine than what has presumably been going on in the United States (albeit somewhat less so because most of them are much poorer). In other words, the outcome pattern mostly doesn’t support the argument that their systems are more rational and delivering systematically better results with their higher spending.
This now-famous visualization would appear to suggest otherwise:
It implies there is a robust cross-sectional relationship between health spending and life expectancy, and that high US health spending is somehow uniquely ineffectual. Our World in Data even goes so far as to say “the presented visualizations are nevertheless indicative of a clear and strong relationship; the health returns to healthcare investment suggested by the figures above are substantial.”
Appearance can be very deceiving. While life expectancy has indeed increased over time, this is primarily associated with the passage of time, a distinct secular trend (as in, broadly improved medical know-how, technology, safer roads, etc.), not with contemporaneous differences in spending. Somewhat more careful analysis of this same data shows a flat slope between countries (especially those in “flat of the curve” territory) and a pronounced secular increase in the intercept with time even for those that didn’t increase real spending appreciably!
Perhaps unsurprisingly (for me), AIC actually fully mediates health spending vis-a-vis life expectancy. Furthermore, regardless of the specification used (AIC and/or health), the coefficients on the log of one or both expenditures rapidly approach zero even, even when the US is excluded, while the apparent secular trend continues on, seemingly unabated.
I can also show a near identical pattern as OWID’s much publicized plot using AIC instead of health spending!
Some countries may experience better outcomes for many and varied reasons, but overall the results don’t suggest this has much to do with their health systems spending their money more effectively. Furthermore, countries may experience substantially different health outcomes for reasons that are wholly unrelated to health systems or economic prosperity. One can hardly argue “confounds!” here (larger n) and simultaneously use this same sort of evidence to make strong claims about the efficacy of the healthcare regime of a single country (pick your
poison medicine).
It’s far beyond the scope of this already very long argument, but I delve the reason’s behind the United States’ long-standing sub-par outcomes in another long post and much more briefly here (a direct, but partial explanation).
A wide variety of other indicators support the United States’ high and rising indicated material living standards
I will not argue this necessarily makes the US “better” overall (there are other dimensions to consider, and people attach different values to different things), but the material aspect is what overwhelmingly determines consumption behaviors in healthcare, higher education, and, well, pretty much all consumption. Whatever the underlying reasons or the tradeoffs involved, the average American has far more real resources at his disposal than his counterparts in other countries. Consumption, disposable income, and reliable wealth statistics tend to reflect this.
Housing
This is also mediated by AIC
It also cuts across the income distribution.
source
Despite larger and fancier housing, it takes less of our disposable incomes than most high-income countries. Bigger homes is also a long-term trend in the US and one clearly not just found amongst the very rich.
And we likely (still) have considerably more stuff in our houses.
source [table of items/method] — also mediated by AIC
This UCLA series on middle-class consumption is useful and generally supports my point from more of a qualitative point of view. Some interesting quotes: “The U.S. has 3.1% of the world’s children, but consumes 40% of the world’s toys…..Europeans would be shocked at the amount of food that’s stored in American households” Also see this NYTimes article.
Car ownership rates.
Again, this is mediated by AIC.
Household financial wealth
Very much contrary to the “it’s just consumption” story, US households have much more financial net worth than others (note: non-financial assets are not well measured internationally and are heavily determined by housing costs — places with proportionally expensive housing look “good” here, but it cuts both ways).
Again, much the same vis-a-vis mediation (even with a thirty-year lag applied)
Eating out
This is also consistent with US time series showing food away from home (restaurants) rising faster than food at home (which represents a smaller part of our household budgets)
This is also consistent with the OECD’s real volume indices.
Recreation and culture
Education
Higher education is relatively more of a consumptive item these days, so I expect somewhat different behaviors than for primary and secondary schooling.
Survey-based measures of income and consumption
While I believe Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and related survey based estimates of disposable income are substantially less reliable than National Accounts based measures of material living conditions in the developed world in general and specifically with respect to the United States, even these paint a pretty similar picture (especially as regards the broad “middle class”)
Likewise for efforts to produce distributional accounts of consumption akin to AIC (unlike the more deeply flawed disposable income estimates, these consumption counterparts do not indicate US consumption is particularly concentrated relative to other OECD countries)
Likewise for narrower measures of consumption
source
Other measures of changes in material living conditions domestically
Though oft-cited, popular tax-based estimates of the income distribution (e.g., Piketty) and household income surveys (e.g., LIS), substantially over-estimate the growth in income inequality and significantly under-estimate the improvement in material living conditions for the bottom ~25% of the country.
We see this in well-designed consumption surveys.
source
And changes in consumption inequality
source
And in well-designed tax-based estimates of the income distribution.
source
source
Since I believe it’s the average that matters, not so much the distribution, I don’t place much emphasis on inequality, particularly measured inequality, as a determinant of national health spending, nevertheless it is apparent that there has been relatively broad-based growth in material living standards and that the consumption habits of the proverbial top one percent can only explain so much.
The combined financial net worth of households AND government.
Some people point to the role of government, so let’s take a quick look at this. Only Norway has unambiguously higher combined net worth, but almost all of this is found in the government sector (their households are way below average) and, as I’ve mentioned previously, this is a consumption smoothing tactic because a big chunk of their GDP is temporary (oil).
You might also keep in mind that much of Europe has much less favorable dependency ratios and they are slightly more generous, so somewhat higher government savings likely reflects larger projected pension burdens. Either way, the marginally higher savings rate implied by this (which still leaves them short) also suggests slightly lower disposable income for their households and less current discretionary income for their governments.
Other macro income/consumption indicators
Primary income of households includes employee compensation, self-employment income, and more (this isn’t just about taxes/transfers)
The picture is reasonably similar for employee compensation alone.
The gap in household disposable income is positively gigantic if we don’t go the extra mile and “adjust” for social transfers in-kind (STiK), which account for a large share of comprehensive income and consumption in many European countries (note: health alone accounts for more than 50% of this in most of these countries, never mind education, disability, etc…. much less discretionary income overall)
Likewise with household consumption without STiK.
Of course, my preferred indicators (AIC and AHDI) adjust in-kind transfers.
source
Still, even after adjusting for social transfers in-kind, the differences are vast. On average Europeans in the 11 core EU countries (107) have AIC closer to Romania (63) than to the United States (162). These are not small differences, even less so when the context is expenditures with an income-elasticity of one-point-six.
Wrapping it up
Those that claim to be most concerned with the eating of the economy often seem ill-prepared to deal with it.
If you honestly believe the rise of healthcare is mostly about prices and that attacking volume is dangerous, as Bivens implies, you are almost certainly wrong, and you are unprepared to address cost containment.
Curtailing volume is the only thing likely to make a significant difference in the “cost curve” in the long run. A price reduction is at best a one-shot deal and far harder to achieve than many seem to believe. I certainly agree that constructing policy to target health spending (volume) is extremely difficult to sustain politically, but it’s the only way to fundamentally alter the trajectory in the long run.
Viewed strictly from the perspective of cost containment, the most successful cost containment regime in the OECD was probably the UK (NHS), which was perhaps an accident of history. They rationed particularly aggressively and managed to hold costs substantially below what we would expect for a country of its wealth for a few more years than usual.
However, people (voters) ultimately wouldn’t stand for it, so this rationing effort was radically reduced (budgets expanded). Today they are much closer to expected spending levels today, and I suspect they will further converge on the trend observed in the US and most other developed countries (while the NHS itself is still notionally popular, people are still complaining about cuts despite the massive increase in spending!)
I very much suspect that total spending on health is ultimately determined by our willingness to pay in the long run. Even if we could modestly reduce prices in some areas the presumed “savings” are likely to get allocated elsewhere within the health system and this won’t necessarily measurably improve outcomes because there just isn’t all that much low hanging fruit and there are real limits to knowledge on clinical efficacy.
For some mildly suggestive evidence along these lines, I ran some quick regressions with OECD’s 2014 PPP benchmark. When the dependent variable is health spending as a percent of GDP, AIC mediates the presumed effect, which might be implied by the bivariate relationship between prices and health spending (model 3), and the coefficient on AIC does not move appreciably.
(Note: I included models without the USA and with GDP per capita instead of AIC for comparison with similar results)
Likewise for when the dependent variable is health expenditures per capita at PPPs for AIC.
The evidence suggests health prices have approximately zero independent predictive value once we have accounted to material living conditions (or even GDP per capita)
In fairness, if I model this with hospital services (surgical procedures) I get a slightly more ambiguous result.
However, I wouldn’t read too much into this because (1) the effect is barely statistically significant, (2) surgical procedures are much more tightly linked to income levels (wages) than the broader health price index, even when measured with GDP, (3) hospital services account for ~37% of expenditures in the US, and (4) the US is already on trend with respect to GDP and AIC.
If this is mostly correct, which seems likely, we don’t have any “scalpels” to deal with overall health spending, only very blunt, very large hammers. Sure, we might do somewhat more Comparative Effectiveness Research and allocate health spending a little more efficiently (not always easy to determine in clinical practice), but there will always be something on some margin that will plausibly improve someone’s life enough to make an argument to spend to within the very upper limits of what society is willing to pay for. Ultimately health spending is determined by what we’re willing to spend, and this is overwhelmingly a function of the average income in the long run.
Consider the case of orphan drugs as something of a bellwether. These are drugs indicated for the treatment of very rare diseases.
source
They are often phenomenally expensive, but the costs to make them on a per patient basis is also very high precisely because these conditions are so rare (R&D, clinical trials, etc. are expensive and do not scale with the number of pills or patients). Indeed, profits account for a modest share of the cost.
source
We as a society, both Americans and Europeans broadly, have decided to pay for them at costs that would have been positively unfathomable a generation or two ago.
source
These are far beyond the financial wherewithal of >95% of the affected patients and their families; they exist because our society has decided to pay for them or, at least, is unwilling to say no. Similar patterns are playing out and have long been playing out throughout healthcare in less obvious ways (there is always room for marginal improvement of some sort).
Likewise, we can look at some recent studies using a novel dataset produced by BEA.
source
Unsurprisingly, in an environment where society allocates a higher and higher percentage of its consumption expenditure to health, research and development dollars have moved heavily towards healthcare.
source
source
Keep in mind that the distribution of health spending looks like this in the United States and probably not much different in other developed countries.
source
We are mainly talking about spending on a small proportion of the population in any given year. These are predominantly the chronically ill, the very old, the gravely injured, premature infants, etc. — groups of people we generally have a hard time saying no to. The trend has relatively little to do with the cost of an everyday office visit or even an ER visit, with half the population accounting for less than 3% of total expenditures in any given year, and it has everything to do with how we treat people when they are sick, severely injured, or presenting with worrying symptoms. It’s not that I believe the growth rate at median person-year has trended much differently (probably not much change in the distribution), but the absolute increases are fairly negligible in the scheme of things and likely don’t seem particularly unreasonable in the eyes of most people as incomes have risen (even if only for very marginal improvements in measured outcomes!).
The lions’ share of this involves tougher choices because we’re talking about cases where lives (longevity) of other people plausibly hang in the balance and where the quality of life is substantially impeded. Even in an environment where most health spending is “flat of the curve,” people don’t seem to be very amenable to inequality in expenditure.
SOURCE: GSS, YEAR=2000
Nor do we seem to allow much income inequality in health expenditures in practice:
source
And people typically respond like this when it comes to cost containment.
source
Conclusion
While I sympathize with the argument that much health spending is “flat of the curve”, especially in its ability to obviously move nationwide life expectancy in the near-term, I am not convinced any other system today is appreciably more capable of containing costs, not in theory (factoring in the political economy of this), not in practice, and particularly not after it has been imported into the United States. Our high spending is overwhelmingly a product of our high incomes and if other OECD countries had our exceptionally high material standard of living most of them would be spending very similarly, with similar utilization, similar intensity, similar prices, and otherwise not obviously better overall outcomes. Over the long-term, very little of the differences in expenditure at a national level are attributable to differences in the healthcare regimes or, for that matter, differences in age distributions, disease burden, etc.
Though I’m not much particularly optimistic about its political viability, I think there is an argument for substantially more inequality in medicine. We have approximately none today. The insistence of societies on equality in medicine seems likely to play a role in increasing cash income inequality throughout the OECD. If the distribution of comprehensive income remains roughly the same and health expenditures rise approximately the same in absolute terms, all of which seems likely, this should be expected.
If you take the view that the incidence of the health expenditure is mostly on the consumer (as a class), possibly even when mostly paid for by public plans (i.e., that they would otherwise enjoy these resources but for the rise of healthcare), and the marginal utility of other forms of consumption is relatively higher for lower-income people, for whom “equal” health expenditure represents a much more significant proportion of their comprehensive incomes (even if not always well measured), it makes some sense that we would allow or even encourage this. This inequality need not necessarily mean less utilization amongst the lower-income, but probably mostly less intensity: less use of cutting-edge treatment, state-of-the-art diagnostics, etc. It’d require a fundamental re-thinking in medicine and, unfortunately, this is in direct opposition to what Noah, Bivens, and company are likely willing to endorse in practice.
On the other hand, I am not quite sure why the average level of expenditure should be a concern for its own sake, as in, so long as we don’t let it ruin our government finances or place an undue burden on the lower income. It seems evident to me that an increasingly wealthy society will find decreasing marginal utility in most other forms of consumption while attaching ever higher value to human life (elasticity >= 1) — it could be formally modeled something like Hall and Jones (2007). The utility to extra health expenditure need not necessarily be high, especially if we have little idea of what actually works on the margin. But, models and assumptions aside, precisely what are we under-consuming as a society? What other types of consumption can feasibly absorb these potential resources and generate unambiguously higher utility at the margins we find ourselves at today?
I am not sure why the burden of proof should be with any particular healthcare regime at this moment in time when the willingness to fund an ever-higher amount of health consumption through a multitude of different schemes is so clearly the revealed preference of virtually all societies today, many also apparently at the “flat of the curve.”
We also saw this elevated elasticity within the United States long before the advent of third-party payers in healthcare, so this seems to have limited explanatory value (it surely contributes something as a proximate cause, but these expansions are likely a consequence of rising living standards).
source
Frankly, I suspect much of this alarmism stems from ignorance or a rejection of the view that this is ultimately driven overwhelmingly by rising material living standards itself and lack of consideration for the sources of prosperity. It’s a product of prosperity, not so much a threat to it. As we become more productive as a society, as our real disposable incomes rise, the cost of many once relatively expensive, once dominant categories of consumption plummet in relation to income. Further, most of these items are normal goods, meaning that demand does not keep pace with rising incomes. The net effect of which is the consumption share of many things falls dramatically. This makes room for consumption of other things — particularly those items that economists would classify as superior or luxury goods (income-elasticity > 1).
source
Whereas food once commanded over half of our incomes, today it accounts for less than 10% of disposable income, and surely much less if we ate as our ancestors did, i.e., at home, doing ~all of the prep work ourselves, with less exotic & varied ingredients, etc. However, this is almost entirely because we are more productive. We consume more in real terms.
Likewise, amongst the OECD, we spend less than most on food as a share of total consumption (AIC) and consume more than most real terms (not necessarily measuring calories), and this isn’t even factoring meals at outside the home (where the US is clearly exceptionally high)!
Consider for a moment that Albania spends a higher proportion of their incomes on food at home than we spend on healthcare and food combined and likely still doesn’t get as much for their food expenditure. The calculus is just profoundly different in rich countries. If in some bizarro world, we actually allocated the same share to food today as we allocated in 1890, we’d probably have a morbid obesity rate approaching 100% (semi-serious), but I digress.
Prices usually decline relative to incomes, and they drop differentially.
A 50% decline in price relative to income implies that the same share of household disposable income would buy twice as much, a 95% decline twenty times as much, and so on. The vast majority of prices declined and declined substantially.
The overall price indices and their changing compositions mask the absolute magnitude of the social change over time (and probably even some within the country). We have become particularly efficient at producing (or at least cheaply acquiring) Goods overall. The ~76% reduction since 1970 implies we could consume four times more real Goods per capita with a similar income share (and it’s likely somewhat under-estimated because this index is re-weighted to reflect changing preferences!). If we consumed proportionally like we did even a few decades ago our “real” incomes or consumption per capita would be much higher because the relevant price indices would reflect this change.
However, because the marginal utility we get from each unit of consumption surely declines across most of these categories and because the prices of most of these same items plummet relative to incomes, we would not do that even if we could. Indeed, we find the consumption shares in many of these categories falls rapidly with incomes even though they don’t actually decline in real terms. This genuine and often under-appreciated economic growth leaves a lot of room in the average households’ consumption budget.

So the perspective that health is “eating the economy” is the really wrong way to conceptualize this. Rather, it’s probably more correct to say something like “the economy ate the market share of other sectors.” Those sectors are victims of their own success and households choose to spend an increasing share of this surplus in healthcare (amongst other notable sectors) because the perceived marginal value of healthcare (technology) is higher than in most other major categories of consumption. One might argue this is just ignorance, that everyone would get greater utility from relatively more consumption in other sectors and relatively less from ever-more cutting-edge healthcare (if we only we had a benign dictator), but I do not believe this to be self-evidently true, at least not for a large segment of our society (no, not just the “top one percent”).
It seems to me the lack of consensus on what we ought to be spending this surplus on is a major strike against this view; as is the derision for seemingly all actual existing forms of expanded alternative consumption (ugh, McMansions! froufrou restaurants!); as is the (approximately) log-linear relationship between income and happiness found within and between countries; as is the high-and-rising costs of many favored progressive projects (see: infrastructure, education, research); as is the fact that most of the significant economic challenges we still face aren’t apt to be substantially resolved by increased production; as are the rising consumptive aspects of medicine; and so on and so forth. Add to this the uncertainty of what actually works in medicine; the abysmal failure of other countries to contain costs in the long run; the lack of ability of so many otherwise intelligent people to accurately diagnose this situation; and the political/administrative uncertainty associated with any so-called “solution.” It is far from clear that a much better solution exists in practice with human nature being what it is.
[simple minded non econ]
HC is diff from other goods in that consuming more, at least in US, is not fun or pleasant: it means tedious waiting, tests that are physically painful and getting bad news
so HC is one thing we might deliberately consume less of then we “want ” to
if you think of household budget as pie, adding up to 100%, as food/clothing get cheaper, something has to change
since we have enough clothes, we spend more on HC
also, do we *really* spend more on HC ?
I bet if you include all the soc welfare spending in , say, EU, they spend more on HC, they just don’t overpay MDs and drug companies, they spend it on housing people so they don’t get sick
Economists: productivity is stagnating
Cancer patients: funny new treatments saved my life
Paraplegic: funny, I can walk again thanks to new tech
Blind: funny, self driving cars changed my life
economists: that your life is changed dramatically for the better is irrelevant to GDP, the god which we worship
other people: talk to the hand
Excellent article! Has there any been any country that actually cut healthcare costs (rather than just bending the cost curve) once they implemented national health care systems? It seems that those who are in favor of a Medicare for All scheme are under the impression that if it was implemented, the US would be able to cut healthcare costs to the level of comparable OECD countries, even though as it stands, the US costs are about double. This would require cutting costs by half which is a very formidable goal. If no country that has created a national health care program has ever done this, it is likely that supporters of Medicare for All who think that it will get the US close to the OECD average are suffering from a major delusion…
Absolutely outstanding article that made challenged a number of pre-conceived ideas I had about the world which was based on looking at income as a measure of wealth rather than consumption.
Now I know that:
1 – Inequality isn’t the huge issue that it is made out to be.
2 – America is still king.
3 – Ireland is signficantly poorer than I previously thought although I expect their rate of growth to exceed many EU countries over the next two decades so they will eventually have an AIC above the EU average rather than below.
4 – My country, Britain, is actually doing a lot better than I thought.
5 – The world is drastically improving and will continue to drastically improve at least in terms of economic well-being disregarding potential environmental problems.
How does Singapore end with an AIC of $25k? That’s less than 1/3rd their GDP per capita.
How do I get this good at looking at data without graduate school?
A response to “Hoopyfreud” on SlateStarCodex since it ate my comment twice:
The OECD researchers publish disaggregated statistics for individual procedures, hospital services (weighted average of procedures), and health care (weighted average of all healthcare) and overhead is calculated into all of this [presumably they have price indices aligned with various SHA components to do these calculations for the entire health sector, but I haven’t found it yet]. Their data indicates we are relatively lower in the overall component than in hospital services, so I think that tends to argue against your notion because hospital services should be relatively more loaded towards end-of-life/high intensity care. Also I think you’re likely to see much more need for administrative overhead in the hospital/institutional sector because of the variety and complexity of what they do than in PCP settings outside of hospitals and their subsidiaries. Billing for a single office visit with no additional services (lab work, preventative care, etc) is about as straight forward as it comes and tends not to be particularly well reimbursed.
Perhaps, but then it must be through extra treatment, diagnostics, etc as opposed to higher overhead costs. This is distinct from “price” as people would typically think of it and it’d still look a lot like what I’m arguing, i.e., higher intensity/technology per encounter. While I’m not entirely unsympathetic to the idea that our particularly plaintiff (+attorney) friendly tort system leads to some unnecessary treatment and inefficiency, it seems to me the data are still generally more consistent with changes in material living conditions (e.g., US spending didn’t diverge until recently and US indicators generally following the same trend across a variety of available metrics, little change in concentration and little increase in out-of-pocket spending amongst low spenders ).
I honestly don’t believe that’s the issue it’s made out to be. The cost of the basic healthcare probably hasn’t risen relative to incomes and people that aren’t consuming a lot of healthcare generally don’t pay much out of pocket either. The issue, such as it is, is that we do far more across the board and we as a society have decided that patients should be sheltered from the cost of their health consumption. Our willingness to spend ever more through these arrangements is a consequence of rising material living conditions, but for the small proportion of people that fall through the cracks of our various overlapping system the apparent “price” can seem very high because healthcare providers are conditioned to treat according to the average demands of the entire population under this extensive system of third party payment (and, to lesser degree, the prices that are presumably billed to these individuals can sometimes be much higher than the average prices actually paid for the same treatment…. though little of this actually get paid directly by the uninsured in practice). That is, it’s not just end-of-life care or even necessarily care for very sick or badly injured; the growth rate is broad similar at all points in the distribution, albeit somewhat lumpy due to the nature of changing technology and medical know-how.
I presumed you were using sprained ankle as a stand-in for presumably basic healthcare, but I wouldn’t be so sure that’s true in the long run and we don’t actually have prices to compare with this specifically. Even if said treatment, diagnostics, etc are exactly the same, the environment this care is provided in is clearly not and these higher costs will tend to get reflected in prices in less obvious ways. The technology, the training, staffing levels, etc has changed quite dramatically in hospitals over the past few decades; just because you might get the same treatment in the ER for a given condition doesn’t mean the cost structure to provide this care is the same or could be provided more efficiently by hospitals given demands for other types of care.
Several reasons.
1) We don’t have good internationally comparable statistics for income or consumption at various points in the distribution. The distributional estimates are based on household surveys and they clearly miss a great deal of income and consumption (people lie and the surveys themselves questionably exclude certain things like indirect taxes, implied rent, etc). They have a lot of measurement error and they likely yield systematically biased estimates for the US (under-estimates of income for the bottom ~40% of the country). For instance, these types of surveys have lower income households in the US consuming multiples of their reported income every year on average despite the fact that they have an average net worth of approximately ~0 and little ability to borrow; higher-income households are under-reporting their consumption (when we know they aren’t saving this much either). It’s just not plausible.
2) When I’ve looked into this I have not found measured differences in the distribution or the median to be particularly informative. Quite the contrary, mean household consumption and income are typically substantially stronger predictors and mediate these sorts of measures in multiple regression.
3) This makes sense because there is approximately no relationship between individual income and health spending in the developed world, including the United States. Our spending is determined by how much we are willing to put into the system, which has to do with the mean, and we don’t want or tolerate much inequality in healthcare. The rich subsidize the poor and likely even 50th percentile household. Lower-income households might prefer to consume relatively more of their comprehensive incomes in other forms of consumption but it’s not like any developed country really gives them this choice.
I replied to your SSC comment here since it ate my reply twice!
While I have no complaint about the overall analysis (although the exposition could be clearer in comparing the early plots that appear to show the USA as an AIC/per capita GDP outlier versus the later ones that state the USA is not such an outlier), the role of third-party payment IN-KIND in distorting consumption toward health care seems underplayed (as does the impact of such systems on price competition and cost-reducing innovation; first-party-paid medical services such as LASIK and cosmetic procedures have shown a smart increase in quality and decline in price along the lines of other high-tech services).
The primary economic problem with contemporary medical care is that there is no good feedback loop to assure that the benefits to the patient (and society) exceed the opportunity cost of the employed resources on a short- or long-term basis. Medical insurance benefits are in-kind and if unused by the patient are lost to him or her forever. Hence the marginal value of a new hip versus a vacation, say, is not a calculation routinely “computed” by our economy in the same way that a new streaming-video subscription is routinely traded off against a vacation via the consumer’s opportunity cost. We generally don’t have to worry very much that our economy is producing too many HD pixels on our screens and too low-quality massages, because both are bought first-party by consumers who internalize the tradeoffs on the benefits side from producers and factor markets that internalize the tradeoffs on the cost side.
I believe it may be possible to combine the desired property of insurance–equalizing wealth, consumption, income, or utility (take your pick) across healthy and sick states of the world–with an internalized patient incentive to consider the tradeoff between medical and non-medical expenditures, but the necessary administrative, legal, and managerial developments would not be trivial.
lol
“What should we spend it on if not healthcare?”
1) Extra savings in the event of financial setback
2) Better real estate (McMansion quips aside, decent housing anyplace worth living is quite expensive relative to incomes for most people, I’ve learned this easily spending lots of time on Zillow lately)
3) More leisure, shorter workweek, earlier retirement
4) Infrastructure (public transport and roads in my city suck)
I admit many of these ways of spending have their own issues and cost diseases, but I would certainly have liked to turned some non-useful extra medical expenses into useful real goods/free time/savings.
When you talk about intensity, all I can imagine is being woken up several times a night in my recent hospital stay to check my vitals (unnecessary), check my blood sugar (I have a device that does that automatically, leave me alone), and run what was a total battery of tests (that found nothing, and they were schedule and run very poorly – I had to get the radioactive dye and run through the machine twice in the same day when it could easily have been once). Meanwhile, simple bedrest would have done me much better then all of that “intensity”, and I would have preferred to have kept the money involved to help afford an upcoming home purchase.
Of course I can think of a million useful ways to spend more money. It would be nice to fly rather than drive my family a long distance to see relatives at the holidays. I could afford to do that more if I had more money. It’s not hard to think of useful ways to spend extra 20% more income if you gave me a 20% pay boost in exchange for healthcare I didn’t want or need. Of course nobody is ever presented with that choice, so we don’t really know what anyone would decide. Instead we basically get “the system says X, take it” and that is better then having no healthcare at all so we comply.
Have you read the Gerard Anderson paper that came out in January that’s making the rounds?
You mean the “It’s still the prices” article? I skimmed it a few weeks ago. It seems to be mostly a rehash of their old paper and it’s largely non-responsive to the sorts of criticisms I’ve raised on this blog (I just noticed they cited me in the footnotes!). I’ve been working on another (very long) blog post tangentially related to the healthcare debate (speaks to the causes of the divergence between GDP and material living conditions), but I’ll probably address that article in my next blog post somehow or other (either a short review of the paper itself or a broader critique of the methods these sorts of articles tend to use…. I have a few ideas).
Yep, that’s the one. I’m a bit puzzled by their conclusion. I’m under the impression (you can correct me if I’m wrong, you know more than I do) that in the US, public sector (Medicare) prices influence private sector prices far more than the other way around, since prices paid by private insurers are elevated to offset below-cost reimbursement rates of Medicare (and maybe because the government has more bargaining power than private insurers). If Medicare reimbursement rates have been diverging further from cost, then that would cause hospitals to charge even higher prices to private insurers to offset that growing gap. The cause of even the private sector price increase would be in the public sector. Or perhaps I’m missing something.
Looking forward to your next post, in any case!
Dude, put all your ridiculous graphics at the bottom of the article and link to them within the text when necessary. The only reason I can think of making articles this painstaking to read is to give the impressive of substance where it doesn’t exist.
If people are misrepresenting you, its because you are possibly the worst human being in existence at relaying information. Although I suspect you make your arguments extremely confusing and hard to follow on purpose. I find it difficult to believe any sane human could look back at this complete mess and think “this does an adequate job of getting my point across.” If it isn’t intentional. it certainly gives the impression you are trying to hide a bad argument behind a copious amount of infographics.
I don’t know, because I got a headache and gave up due to the atrocious formatting…. as I suspect most others did. But I also suspect this is what you hoped to achieve so people will just skip to the end and blindly accept the conclusion.
I need a better class of troll.
Im convinced you are a troll. Managed to strip out the all the graphics and it still managed to be incredibly infuriating to read. I don’t understand are you getting paid by the word? You constantly restate things over and over for no reason. It reminds me of when I was trying to hit the page requirements while using the minimum amount of research possible back in college.
I mean just look at this sentence .”
Oh are they a plainly superior measure, ergo a vastly superior means to evaluate? So in other words, you believe they exist as an exceedingly superior gauge for evaluation, proving immensely superior to the alternative thus demonstrating superiority?
Who writes like this?
Speaking of “in other words” that phrase appears constantly, not including alternatives. You shouldn’t constantly have to rephrase things over and over.
This is the most mind-numbingly verbose thing I have ever attempted to read, even after stripping out the 5 billion graphics, most of which probably don’t even need to exist. Like why? Why would anyone intentionally write like this? I just don’t understand.
Im not trolling, im just genuinely bewildered why someone would put in what appears to be an incredible amount of effort in order to make something nobody in their right mind would want to read.
“Dude”, “the worst human being in existence” created the “impressive of substance”, that I “got a headache and gave up due” the “ridiculous graphics”. “I suspect you make your arguments extremely confusing and hard to follow on purpose” “I find it difficult to believe any sane human” “in their right mind would want to read”. “This is the most mind-numbingly verbose thing I have ever attempted to read”.
###
For a self-professed college attendee, you managed to string together an awful lot of semi-coherent words to comment on a blog post which, according to you, no one wants to read and has no redeeming features. What an unusual way for someone that claims to have the attention span of a gnat to spend their time!
10/10. Would troll again
So If took my short and concise criticism and bloated it to 100 pages of bombast and redundancies loaded with pointless graphics, would you prefer to read that instead? Or would you probably get infuriated and stop after realizing you are being waterboarded with pointless drivel?
Nobody likes having their time wasted, its not an attention span thing… its a cost/benefit analysis thing. When you take a lot of time to relay very little information, the value proposition takes a nose dive. In the time it would take to read this, I could get 100 times more information from somebody who is able to write in a clear and concise manner. So unless I have a compelling reason to believe there is some sort of profound information hidden within (and I don’t) it would be completely illogical to continue slogging through.
And that’s ultimately the problem, I would like to read what you have to say, but you have made it virtually impossible to justify doing so. I am giving you a valid criticism, you can take it or leave it. If you take it though, it would probably be to your benefit.
If you wish to be taken seriously, make an argument and don’t act like a troll.
One example of why GDP is a poor measure is the performance of the state of Delaware’s GDP per capita over the last decade. It’s declined most years in real terms, but almost entirely because of corporate inversions that have been tax events only.
The view that total household expenditures predict healthcare spending seems to have a very optimistic view of the political economy, especially in non-US countries (and even in the US where you point out healthcare spending doesn’t vary much with income). In most countries healthcare comes from the national budget and the national budget comes from the tax base, which is not the same thing as the spending available to households. So the mode of causation must be that raising e.g. corporation tax to pay for more healthcare spending has a downstream effect on household income and that voters/politicians are aware of the tradeoff and accurately asses how much of one leads to a decrease in the other, and that is how policy is decided. From the ground level to me it looks like there are ideological battle grounds of free market vs. healthcare, and the usual interested parties, businesses vs healthcare workers. To see that arrive at a pretty consistent percentage of healthcare vs household income seems unlikely.Rose Water Scented Badam Kurabie Biscuits
Updated: Apr 27, 2019
Badam Kurabye, scented with rose water they remind me of rose flavoured Lokum. They are inspired by the well known Italian Amaretti biscuits but with pistachios, ground rose petals and rose water.
When I first moved to Australia and lived in the East suburb of Perth, I used make and sell very similar cookies to a coffee shop in Mount Lawley. The coffee shop was called Soho and a very kind relative who was the coffee shop regular had organised the biscuit deal for me. With the suggestion of the same relative we named them Azerbaijani Delights. I made and sold cookies to the shop for a few months up until we moved to the south. I still make the cookies quite often however, this days I don’t go into the trouble of shelling kilos of almonds the way I did back then.
Ingredients
4 egg whites
350g caster sugar
1 tsp rose water
450g almond meal
50g pistachio nuts, ground
1-2 tbsp ground dry rose petals
1 cup icing sugar
2 tbsp pistachios chopped
2 tbsp dried rose petals
Method
Preheat oven to 160C fan
Prepare and line with baking paper a large cookie sheet
Place egg whites and sugar into a bowl of a stand mixer (or use a large bowl and hand mixer if you haven’t got a stand mixer). Beat the eggs and sugar until they reach soft to medium peaks add rose water and whisk until incorporated. Using a spatula gradually add the almond, ground pistachios and ground rose petals, fold until all ingredients are fully incorporated.
Shape into 30g balls (about the size of the walnut), and roll in icing sugar. Slightly flatten and using a wet finger make an indent in the centre, sprinkle with extra rose petals and chopped pistachios. Leave a few cm space between each cookie so they don’t bake into each other and bake them for 8-12 min. Move to a cooling rack. Once cooled store in an airtight container. They last at least 1 week.

{{ __('contact.report_article.sku', { number: product.articlenumber }) }}.Being 40 something certainly has it's advantages. One that comes to mind, is developing that certain confidence and savoir faire, which is the by product of many years of experience mixing with people. However, being that age also gains one entry into the regions of mid life crisis territory, and I truly believe I might be having one.
Evidenced in recent days, by the purchase of this vintage Hawaiian dress. My lovely friend Lisa has started a vintage clothing business and we have been having loads of fun trying on all the stock. She refers to me as her fun loving size 14 house model. She is about as lean as Catherine Middleton and needs a more curvaceous body to see how the stuff looks on, well, women with more curvaceous bodies like mine. At first she tried this number on and I was instantly smitten. Never in my wildest dreams thinking it would fit me. She encouraged me to slip it on and it blew me away, because it fit like a glove. You've got to love those stretchy synthetic fabrics circa the 1970's. Suffice to say, I was her first ever customer. Which is ironic seeing as we intend to team up and take a market stall together. Her selling her vintage clothes and me, my vintage homewares.
You'd be forgiven for thinking this is mutton dressed as lamb though. It's the best shot the 4 year old could manage to take of me, (Mr Beach House is of course, out on the water today, when I need him) but you get the idea and I for one need a bit more of this and a little less of the constant putting out for everyone else in my life, whilst all my dreams and aspirations are relegated to the back burner.
Which brings me to a great pick up line I heard the other day. It's way too late for me and believe me, I've been spun a few over the years, so I know a good one when I hear it. It made me giggle and wish for a moment I was 25 again. It went something like this:
Boy to Girl: "That's a beautiful dress you are wearing and it would look great on my bedroom floor"
I think if some gorgeous young thing had said that to me on the dance floor all those years ago, I would have had to think twice. So now I just need to convince Mr Beach House to take me out in this dress and whisper something like that in my ear.
Yeah right......... cue skidding noise and a 'lifting needle off a record' visual. Day dream over and it's back to the real world for me.
Have a great week guys.
Today I am linked up here

Love the dress!
I remember in the 70's shortly after my parents' divorce, my dad went to Hawaii on an exercise (Air Force); he brought us all home Hawaiian dresses. I hate it at the time (I was 14, and didn't appreciate it - I wish I had kept it!)
The dress looks great on you!!
The dress is great and great on you! It's a really good fit.
Love the dress, beautiful print and so summery.
The pick up line is superb!!! Made me laugh out loud.
PS: I'd like to invite to join the Bosisto's giveaway at my blog, I have 4 lavender packs up for grabs here:
i love the old hawaiian print. the dress looks great on you and i love the pick up line!

Carolyn, that dress is truly fabulous! I completely love it and the pick up line is priceless. x
Love it! It looks great too. Am very partial to a Hawaiian print myself! I have a lil purple, strapless number, and its one of my favourite dresses. Think you definitely need a dinner date/ event for this one ;-) xx
Very cute- perfect for cocktails near the sea!
You look fabulous Carolyn. That dress screams Hawaiian New Year's Eve Party. Remember them being all the rage in the 80's and 90's? Or was that just here in Qld? Its a beautiful dress.
Anne xx
Marilyn,.... this dress is fabulous! And it looks fabulous on you....now you can take it off and ship it on over to me.. :) Way back in our minds we are thinking it's time for retirement and heading to the beach....so way downsized it's not funny. And this type of thing is exactly what I would love to wear all the time. (dreaming here) xo
Who would have thought it would have looked far better on than on the bed. Amazing! It really rocks.
Nic
Great dress Carolyn, you look fab in it! Your post made me giggle too :)
Cas x
Gorgeous colours - love the print!
You look fabulous Carolyn.
You shouldn't doubt yourself!!!
You just need a midori splice in your hand and hibiscus flowers behind your ear and you'll be set for a night out in the Summer breeze.

Mr.Beach house better watch out if you go out without him wearing that outfit. Everything is gorgeous on you. Hot mama. Good you girl. It never hurts to see yourself in something great and know you look better than the outfit wearing it. Happy week. IF that's vintage it sure looks good.
I love the dress and the sandels and you look amazing. Thanks for joining TTT. Hugs, Marty
I love it and I would buy this outfit. Visiting from Shabby Creek Cottage
your party dress is very beautiful. i like your collection for party dress. Mostly this kind of dresses are being used in the party. i just wanted to know that which fabric is you are wearing
It's just a stretchy nylon I think. The dress is home made, but I didn't make it. I bought it as second hand vintage. Hope that helps.
CarolynDay 34 – I never thought twice when I pulled out a Ziploc storage or freezer bag to store an opened bag of crackers or a package of frozen waffles (because the kids destroyed the box). I never gave it much thought when I tossed those bags in the garbage when I was done using them. It’s hard to say how many of those bags made their way to the landfill. It’s hard to say how many didn’t make it to the landfill and ended up blowing around and ending up in a waterway. It’s hard to say why I didn’t give any thought to the use and disposal of these plastic bags.
It was great to find out that plastic bag recycling programs accept plastic storage and freezer bags (like Ziploc), but I wanted to do better. I ended up purchasing reusable storage/freezer bags (gallon size). I couldn’t be happier with this product. They are sturdy, easy to seal and easy to clean. I see no reason why we would ever need to use another plastic storage/freezer bag again.
Tomorrow, the not so sweet truth about chocolate.
3 thoughts on “Reusable Storage Bags: Never going back to plastic”Greetings, all! My wife and I have finally started building our garage aquaponics system! :D We're planning on using two 55 gallon drums, one as our fishtank and the other as our growbeds. Our ideal location for this project is our attached two-car garage; the layout of our yard and existing landscaping makes it difficult to put up a tasteful looking greenhouse outside. I realize that our ideal location isn't the same thing as nature's ideal location... given the brutal humidity we get in the summers, I am wondering if a 50 pint-per-day dehumidifier mounted near a window for drainage will be adequate to the task of saving our garage from rotting away. What are your thoughts?
Attached is a picture of what we've accomplished so far. We plan to hang the lights from the brackets they're currently sitting on in the picture, and put the cords in conduit.

Is it possible to seal off the grow area with something like panda poly? That would allow us to use a more efficient dehumidifier. Or is it best to dehumidify the whole garage as per the original plan?

Hi Gavin,
There are many past discussions on this subject around the site. Try poking around(you can use the search bar at top left hand) and you're sure to find something like this

My initial thought seeing the lights is "YOU WILL NEED MORE"
unless you really like watercress.

I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss watercress :P According to wikipedia it's quite the superfood:...
In all seriousness, though, I totally agree: I do need more lights. I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to add an HPS lamp or two. I'm worried about heating and ducting issues, though. Like you said elsewhere, pulling in outside air is great, except down here in the south with our 80-90 percent humidity.

True that. It'd be nice to squeeze a few more golden beets and basil plants in per harvest, that's for sure :D At this point, having weighed the costs of setting up a proper grow room to the small amount of money the tiny system could either bring in or save us, I am tempted to go back to the drawing board and use the existing equipment out of doors during the warmer months.
Update on materials: Ordered a 400watt Sunsystem 2 Metal Halide with a Hortilux MH bulb, a 10'x100' roll of panda poly, and a handful of heavy-duty timers for the lights.
Next up, fire suppression!
Pics to follow once all the new equipment is in.

A small window airconditioner for summer time would serve as a dehumidifier and would keep the garage cooler, I would get the smallest unit for it.
A dehumidifier for winter would keep your humidity down while supplying some heat of about 500 watts per hr.
A fan mounted in the wall or window would also keep the humidity down.
Also remember that the halogen light will turn about 90% of the watts consumed into heat.
Be careful covering the walls with plastic since walls have to breathe, covering the walls with plastic could make it even worse.
Humidifiers are rated in BTU's, that is what you have to look at. The same BTU humidifier could hold 20 quarts or 50 quarts, but it does not indicate how much moister is removed per hr. Also if the humidifier is rated / consumes 500 watts, these 500 watts will be given off as heat into the air.
I agree that is humid in North Carolina spring time until about June -July and then is will be dryer unless it rains. Then in the fall it will be humid again until it is getting cold or it freezes.

Now that the craziness at work and the temperatures here have died down a bit, I'm back at this project like a fiend! :D I am wondering about my ventilation options. The growing space is 765 cubic feet.
The smallest air conditioner I can find locally is 5,000 btu, with an advertised *max* airflow of 120 cubic feet per minute. I don't know exactly how high the a/c will have to be turned up to keep the plants alive when the heat picks up so I have no idea what the actual airflow rate will be. When selecting my exhaust fan, what airflow rate should I be looking for? 120 cubic feet per minute? Slightly more? Slightly less? One website I visited suggesting dividing the total cubic feet by 5, so that leaves 153.
Maybe I'm overthinking this... attached is a picture of the grow area. The walls aren't up yet, but it's basically window-to-window and all the way up to the ceiling (I want to go vertical! :D)
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
perhaps overthinking a bit (at least among people who don't have much experience with "grow rooms") If you want people who can give you good number recommendations for air flow and stuff you might have to venture into a hydroponic or indoor grow room type of forum and then the thinking will have numbers to make it sane.
I would probably say get a little AC unit if you think you need it. A box fan to mount in the wall for ventilaiton if you need it (an extra box fan around the house is not likely to be a bad thing anyway.) And the primary thing I think you need for air movement/ventilation in any indoor plant set up is an oscillating fan since the plant need some variation in the breezes to help develop nice strong stems and those same breezes can sometimes also help foil pests.
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
How is your framework setup? How much water surface is presented to the air? Do you have covers on your FT and ST to control vanishing?
I have a rack AP framework in my lounge area for tilapia sear, however, I live in AZ where mugginess isn't an issue. Be that as it may, I structured my framework to have almost no "untamed water" to lessen the sound, however, I would think it significantly affects vanishing. My FTs and ST have tight tops with a little feed bring forth, max GB water level underneath the outside of media, and DWC beds likewise have tight-fitting tops. When I complete the last stage to again incorporate the 40g reproducer tank, it also will have a top. Altogether, I have 2x 27g "stuff box" FT, 1x 27g ST, and around 20 sq ft of developing the region, with one 900gph siphon. It's as boisterous as a little tabletop wellspring when running (on a clock), quiet when off (runs 30 min/off 120). That, yet I just need to include 2-3 gallons of a top off every week. I'll post pics when I complete the last stage soon (stage #284, yet who's checking), which incorporates a 40g glass reproducer, +15 sq ft develop bed and 3 dutch cans. I at last just completely improved my filtration, expelling the little RFF and MBBR after enough disappointment with releases (no Bueno in the lounge area).
What do you accomplish for lighting in the carport? I'm utilizing both LED and T5, yet the T5 bulbs appear to pass on at an uneconomical rate contrasted with the LED. Furthermore, they get hot, without dynamic cooling. Despite the fact that the purple shading isn't excessively engaging, and can appear from the control (I'm not developing medication!), I figure I will stick to LED, and conceivably plan my own water cooled units (heat traded with FT)
I have a major BYAP framework outside, however, the sun and warmth are really fierce here. In addition, I appreciate the vegetation in the house, and it coordinates my nerdy character. I simply wish I didn't need to pay for lighting inside!
I would prescribe you Get a dehumidifier and add a hose to deplete outside or down a story channel (most are set up for one as of now, yet the crimped minimal white plastic hoses suck... I utilize a clothes washer supply hose) so it won't top off and quit constantly.
You can check for your choice here
Remember that it may take days (or perhaps seven days) to get all the abundance dampness out of the dividers, floor, and whatever else put away in the carport... before you'll see the stickiness number begin to drop.
Keep the entryways shut however much as could reasonably be expected and pursue under 70% relative stickiness to avoid form.
(Potentially check whether you can lease or acquire an extra dehumidifier for the primary week or somewhere in the vicinity?)

Ida Grove, IA (2010): Accomplish LM was applied in a root zone band at 1 quart per acre with 5 gallons of 10-34-0 dual placed with NH3 (anhydrous ammonia) in the fall of 2009.
Garden City, KS (2012): Accomplish LM was applied at 1 quart per acre with grower’s standard practice of 150 lbs. N and 30 lbs. P in strip-till.

Those with clean hands and pure hearts,
who don’t make vanities the purpose of their lives
or swear oaths just to deceive.
– Psalm 24:3-4 (CJB)
Do you ever avoid approaching God? Or just are not too excited about worshipping him? You know you’re his child, but you don’t go skipping to the throne room to share your heart with him. King David of old might be able to help us here.
In Psalm 24, he asks who is qualified to worship God. Then he answers his own question: Someone who is honest, has clean hands (actions are right), and a pure heart (attitudes are right). Those qualifications are pretty clear to all of us.
Then he gives one more requirement: Those “who don’t make vanities the purpose of their lives”. To understand what vanities are, we need to look at the book of Ecclesiastes. This author (likely David’s son Solomon) tried everything: wine, women, song, lands, learning, power, and popularity. Nothing satisfied. He said it was all vanity, meaning empty. It had no substance, brought no satisfaction, and vanished into thin air in light of eternity.
Are there “vanities” in your life? Things that are attractive in the moment, but don’t bring long-lasting satisfaction? Or activities that distract you from the true purpose of your life? In our hearts, we know the most important purpose is knowing and following Jesus, worshiping and serving God, loving and caring for our neighbor. When the unimportant takes its proper place, God says we will be ready to worship.
We may all have some sorting out to do!

This follows a “major incident” in Zambia that affected power supply from Cahora Bassa, the power utility said on Sunday.
Stage 4 will last until Friday morning, after which Stage 2 will continue until Saturday.
Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said they had no choice: “It is necessary to ration the remaining electricity generation reserves, which have been extensively utilised this morning as we are not getting a reduction in demand that we expected from the implementation of stage 2 load shedding.”My Dad has taught me an awful lot of valuable lessons in life, I’m very grateful for that. He’s a very unique type of person. When my parents split, he was my primary caregiver until I was about 17.
He’s an author, he runs his own business. He’s a relationship counsellor. His career is based around self-help. He’s good at it.
Dad cares about people a lot, and he’s very charitable.
He is the type of person who would rather teach you to fish than give you a fish. He wants to see people be the best they can be.
It was always important to him that I was cultured, educated, and capable as opposed to being a bit of a ‘princess’.
He raised me in a way that I think is quite unique. I was always treated like a grown up to some degree, influenced to have understanding for people.
He gave me all he could give; and when he ran out of things to give me, he let go. Like when you’re teaching a kid to ride a bike, you support them half way down the path and you let go and watch them as they ride freely and surprise themselves with how well they’re doing. It was an intensive course in being an adult, I’d say.
He would sit with me doing homework for hours on end until I got the maths right or understood the concept I was studying in philosophy. If I was having a hard time with friends at school, he would sit with me and calm me down until I saw sense and understood that it wasn’t worth getting upset over. He encouraged me to build my business at a young age, so he set me up a website and recommended me a bunch of books to read.
He didn’t want me to be dependent though, because to him- that’s not love. He wants me to be able to cope with whatever life throws at me, he wants the best for me, and he wants me to be proud of myself. He doesn’t want me to be lost without him. That is his perception of love.
When I turned 18, he let go pretty much all together.
I had to learn to cope on my own and teach myself to adult.
There was a lot of growing pains. It is hard when you don’t think you’re flying at first. You feel like you’ve been dropped in the deep end and you can’t swim yet.
No matter how many tantrums or fits of rage I had, no matter how much I kicked and screamed and generally broke down, there was no saviour. It was hard for my Dad to see me struggle, but if he hadn’t have left me to it then I never would have surprised myself and discovered that I could in fact swim. He knew that he already gave all he could give.
Now, I am self-sufficient. I rely on no one, I make my own money, I find my own way, and I love it.
My Dad is happy, he has a wonderful relationship with his girlfriend and her kids. His life is going really well.
We’re not particularly distant, but I’m just grown up now. There’s no need to be as close as we were.
I am grateful for my Dad’s uniqueness, because it helped me grow. It was harder to understand at times when I was younger.
Children are generally hyped up and rewarded a lot by their parents.
When all your friends are getting a similar treatment, being praised for little things, being gifted a lot, having a bit of a song and dance made of them, it makes you wonder why you aren’t getting that.
The ego chatters and you think ‘am I not doing good enough?’, ‘am I not loved?’.
I think it’s really sad that I used to associate material gain and gush with love. Love is a subjective thing, I’m grateful that I don’t associate my worth with objects or appearance. I’m grateful that I don’t expect things.
I feel like I’ve been rewarded with perspective. Something I personally value more.
My Mum is a giver in a different respect. My Mum gifts me with flowers often just to say that she appreciates me, like her Mum did for her. I appreciate the flowers she gives me and the simple little things she does for me so much more, because my Dad taught me that I’m not entitled to them. I see these little gestures as an act of love and kindness. I understand the way that different people express themselves. The feeling of happiness I get when someone does something small for me is elevated.
My Dad taught me how hard it is to work and how difficult it can be at times to make money for yourself. Now when someone gifts me something I think, ‘wow, how many dirty floors and shitty customers did you have to deal with to give that to me? How many hours at work that you didn’t really want to do did you put in just to show me that you care about me?’. I appreciate the gift of someone’s time as an act of love in itself.
When people gift me with things, it’s because they care for me so much that they went out of their way and did something that they didn’t have to do to showcase their appreciation. I guess my sense of gratitude is higher because I see it like that.
Generally, my Dad used to reward me by telling me that I did a good job, or that I’ve come a long way. I should be proud of myself. He made a point not to tell me how wonderful I am all the time because he didn’t want me to doubt myself later down the line when I was an adult who wasn’t congratulated for doing minor things. He never gifted me in grand gestures because he wanted me to know that I wasn’t doing any of these things for anybody else. I wasn’t passing exams for my teachers, I wasn’t learning, working, growing, generally busting my ass for the sake of anybody else. I was doing it because I will now be able to say ‘look what I have done for myself. Look what I can do now that I’ve learned all that.’. I make myself proud, and although other people’s praise means a lot to me, I know that I don’t do it for them. I don’t need the approval. My own approval is enough.
I’m not saying that anybody’s view on love or approach to parenting is wrong. People grow and learn in different ways, and different people are receptive to different treatments. I’m just sharing a perspective that I’m appreciative to have been raised by.Monday, September 12, 2022, Nicklaus Golf Club at LionsGate

Some of the bigger lines around whichpeople around Marbré organize are housing, anti-gentrification, social struggles, encarceration, specism, feminism and borders. The place is organised through an open general assembly and happy to welcome new people and groups.
Some words on the situation
We met a first eviction in february 2021, but succefully reopened the building the next day which gave us a lot of strength. Since september 2021 we are facing a new threat following our eviction process. The ruling received in june 2021 admitted us cumulative delays of 3 month + a 2 months grace period + the winter eviction break(1.11-1.4.). But thebailiff seems deaf on that ear: he signed a request to leave the space by september 23. Our legal strategy is an appeal to the executive court (JEX) to go against this interpreatiion by the bailiff and a hearing took place on october 5. The JEX’s decision though will take until the
16th of november, several weeks during which the place technically stays evictable. Our political strategy has been to mobilize to the maximum of our capacities from september 23 to october 5 with different activities everyday, we invited local squats and collectives and prepared ourselves
for Day X. We are of course staying mobilized after the fifth and there are more workshops, discussion and so on taking place at marbré for as long as we manage to keep the place. We are learning how to collectively deal with stress, fatigue and the fear of loosing the space. We are exploring solidarity together and sharing knowledge and skills. The perspective of the eviction is of course worrying, but we also see it as possibility to live a strong collective experience and want to give all we have for it even if we’re just at the beginning of this marathon.
We invite you to participate in the defense of our spaces like Marbré. For this if you are around you can come here, propose activities or participate, show your presence, spread the word. There is an emergency eviction sms-list, you can join it by sending a number to lemabre@riseup.net or by coming here. In case of eviction there will be a demonstration 7pm the next day at Mairie de Montreuil. All signs of solidarity are welcome: each by their own means and wishes, let’s go against all the actors and profiteers of evictions, exploitation, urbanisation and gentrification: lawyers, bailiffs, developers, restaurants, bio shops and other chainstores, camera and other surveilance systems and alarms, construction sites of big urbanisation projects in the like of Grand Paris, infrastructure and télécommunication, cop shops, courts, councils, construction agencies and profiteers of emprisonment like Bouygues, Vinci, Eiffage, Spie and many many others.
Let’s defend our spaces, and resist against evictions and the exploitations of our lives.
International Solidarity
The problems we face don’t stop at city lines and stateborders, names might be different but our enemies are the same everywhere.
International solidarity breaks the isolation that repression tries to submerge us in, making us stronger and less alone. In these moments of struggle, whether smiling on the barricades or in our discussions, in our thoughts we are also with the friends in other places that face repression, solidarity with Køpiplatz, EIF, la Trasheria and all rebellious squats and all those hit by repressive operations like Prometeo (congratulations!), Bialystock and Scintilla,the repression against Gare in Athens, the §129 processes in germany, the friends facing accusations of criminal association and terrorism in france and elsewhere.

A day after Diwali air quality index in Delhi descended to its minimum and this led to health hazards in Delhi. Due to the burst up of firecrackers air quality degraded to a very low quality and crossed the permissible limits after the night of Diwali.
It has been 15th November now and the air quality is still a matter of concern. According to SAFAR( System of Air Quality & Weather Forecasting & Research), the air quality index in Delhi today is in between moderate PM10(μgm-3)-178 and poor PM 2.5 (μgm-3) -102.
An AQI(Air Quality Index) which ranges between 0-100 is evaluated to be good and satisfactory. Above that to 200 is moderate while above 200 to 300 is poor and above that falls in very poor and severe category. As per WHO (World Health Organisation), an index of around 10 is believed to be as safe.
The air quality in Delhi is poor all year, but it deteriorates dramatically during the winter, exacerbated by Diwali firecrackers and stubble burning in neighbouring states.
Uncomfortable breathing, nausea, headache, cold and cough, chest pain, and other symptoms are caused by smog.
Here is a seven-step guide to protecting yourself from pollution:
Stay inside.
Until the situation improves, avoid morning and evening walks and try to exercise only at home. According to a recent study, Delhi's morning walks are bad for your lungs and can harm your immunity. So think twice before venturing out for some fresh air or inhaling the deadly smoke. The morning is the worst time for air pollution. Shift outdoor activities to the evenings, when pollution levels are lower.
Utilize anti-pollution masks.
With such septic air quality, it becomes necessary to wear a mask. It is critical to select the proper mask. In an ideal world, a mask would filter out all dust particles from the air you breathe in.
Maintain hygiene and stay covered up.
Infections are more likely in the winter, so try to wear full-sleeved clothing and full bottoms. Furthermore, it is critical to wash your hands and feet every few hours to remove dirt particles from the environment. If at all possible, clean and wash your surrounding roads to help settle the dust and pollutants.
Purchase an air purifier.
In today's toxic air, an air purifier is highly recommended. If you have children, the elderly, pregnant women, or asthma patients in your home, an air purifier is a must-have. A good air purifier costs between Rs 6000 and Rs 30000, which is a better investment than a trip to the doctor.
Make use of a closed-transportation system.
Avoid riding in open vehicles like two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws. Instead, take the metro, buses, or a car. In fact, you should practise "carpooling" to reduce fuel emissions, as this is one of the leading causes of air pollution. Fewer cars on the road equal lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and better air quality.
Grow trees as well as indoor plants.
Plants emit oxygen. As a result, the best way to improve air quality is to plant as many trees as possible in your surroundings. Some plants that can purify the air and thus reduce indoor pollution include aloe vera, areca palm, English ivy, and spider.
Eat healthily and exercise regularly.
Finally, it is critical to maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Stay hydrated to keep your immune system strong and ready to fight off diseases. Water proves out to be a cleansing agent of your body. Include vitamin C and vitamin A-rich foods in your diet to keep your immune system healthy, such as oranges, carrots, and lemon.
Incorporate ginger and garlic into all of your dishes, and consume yoghurt once or twice a day. Jaggery (gur) can help cleanse your lungs of pollutants. You can eat it every night at night or simply replace sugar with jaggery in your daily diet. Don't exercise outside of your house as you will breathe in poor quality air.

Problem is, that phrase doesn’t always mean the same thing to everyone. In fact it can mean several different things in at least 5 different types of service connection claims.
Let’s see if we can clear some of the confusion up.
5 things many Veterans don’t know about Total VA Disability Ratings.
1) There are MANY paths to a 100% rating.
The idea of a Total VA Disability Ratings start from the same point:
Total (100%) disability ratings will be assigned “when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.” 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a) (2013).
There are 5 ways to get there, though:
* Total VA Disability Based on 100% Schedular Rating. When the Veteran’s service-connected condition meets the 100% impairment rating requirements found in Table 4 of 38 CFR, they receive a 100% schedular rating).
* Total Disability Based on Schedular TDIU (When a Veteran has one service connected condition at 60%, or a total rating of 70% with one being at least 40%, the Veteran can request a 100% schedular TDIU rating).
* Total Disability Based on Extra-Schedular TDIU. (When a Veteran is service connected for one or more conditions, but is not able to secure substantial gainful employment, he/she can seek an extra-schedular TDIU rating of 100% even if their ratings don’t reach the schedular TDIU requirements above).
* Total Disability Based on an Extra Schedular Rating (if the VA schedule of ratings does not adequately compensate a Veteran’s service connected disability, they can seek a 100% extraschedular rating. This is NOT the same as extra-schedular TDIU)
* Temporary Total Disability based on hospitalization (generally speaking, this is awarded when a Veteran is hospitalized for a service-connected condition and for the 6 months following that hospitalization).
Don’t confuse these PATHS to a 100% rating with the designation that a veteran has “permanent and total disability rating.” A lot of veterans spend a lot of time trying to get to this designation, and while I’m not discouraging it (quite the contrary), it is an end state, not a path.
So, for example, a lot of veterans email my law firm and ask to hire us to get a “permanent and total disability rating.”You do NOT need to have a 100% rating to get a permanent and total VA disability rating. This type of rating only happens when a veteran has no chance of recovering or improving from their disability – it protects them from a reduction. So, if your goal is to get your VA disability properly rated at 100%, focus on getting that rating. Then focus on showing the VA that there is zero chance that you will recover or improve from that level to get the permanent and total VA disability designation.
2) A Claim for Increase is also a claim for TDIU when there is evidence of unemployability.
In the Rice v. Shinseki case (22 Vet. App. 447, 454-55 (2009)), the Federal Circuit held that a Veteran’s request for a higher disability rating, coupled with evidence indicating that the Veteran’s ability to work was “significantly impaired” by his or her service connected conditions reasonably raises the issue of entitlement to TDIU as an alternative basis for increased compensation.
This type of claim is an inferred claim and should be considered by the VA Regional Office whether the Veteran specifically asks for it or not.
What does that mean in practical terms? Depends on where you are in your case.
When FILING a claim for increase, if you are unemployable because of the service-connected condition – regardless of the percentage, include VA Form 21-8940 and specify that you are seeking TDIU in addition to the claim for increase for that condition (include all service-connected conditions that impact your ability to get and keep substantially gainful employment).
When arguing that the VA wrongly denied a claim, look in your C-File for claims for increase where you also alleged you are unemployable or unable to get employment because of that condition, and then you could argue that the TDIU claim is reasonably raised by the record.
We are arguing the opposite in a case currently before the Board of Veterans Appeals – that a claim for TDIU, being a claim for increase, necessitates that the Board adjudicate the increased compensation claim as well as the TDIU claim.
NOTE: Don’t confuse the concept of unemployability with unemployment. This is a common mistake, and one that the BVA makes far more often than it should. Unemployability means the ability to get and keep substantially gainful employment. Unemployment is largely irrelevant to a TDIU claim – in fact, veterans can still work and collect TDIU.
3) Extraschedular TDIU is NOT an Extra schedular Rating.
Adding MORE confusion to the mix, there are 2 totally different types of “Extra Schedular” ratings.
The first is a 38 CFR 3.321(b) Extra Schedular Rating.
This is available “in exceptional cases where the [normal schedule of ratings] is inadequate.” Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet.App. 111, 114 (2008), aff’d sub nom. Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
To determine whether a 3.321(b) extra schedular rating is warranted, the Board must determine that the schedular evaluation under which the Veteran is rated does not contemplate the [Veteran’s] level of disability and symptomatology, and that the Veteran has an “exceptional disability picture exhibited by factors such as ‘marked interference with employment’ and ‘frequent periods of hospitalization.’ “
The second type of extra-schedular rating is “Extra Schedular TDIU”.
Extra-schedular TDIU is governed by 38 CFR 4.16(b) – and is totally separate from the consideration of an extra-schedular rating under 3.321(b). See Kellar, 6 Vet.App. at 162; Stanton v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 563, 564-70 (1993) (issue of extraschedular evaluation is separate from issue of TDIU rating)
A key difference – but not the only difference – is that Extra Schedular TDIU requires evidence that a Veteran is unemployable, but does NOT require proof that the Veteran is inadequately compensated by the normal schedule of ratings. a 3.321(b) extra schedular rating has nothing to do with unemployability – you merely need to prove that the normal Schedule of Ratings does not adequately compensate you for your service-connected disability.
4) The VA will deny your claim for TDIU – administratively – if you don’t file the 21-8940.
I see this happen SO much. Veteran claims unemployability or TDIU, and the VA actually catches the inferred claim.
They send a letter saying – essentially – send us a copy of VA Form 21-8940. The Vet never sends it in.
The VA has an internal policy of an administrative denial of a request for TDIU if the Veteran fails to send in VA Form 21-8940. And they usually don’t give a second warning.
If your request for TDIU was “administratively denied“, what can you do?
Send in the VA Form 21-8940 within a year of the VAs request for the VA Form 21-8940, and your claim should get processed properly (knowing full well that the VA rarely does what it should). Take a look at 38 USC 5103(b)(1) for the authority on this.
5) The VA will NOT give you an exam for a TDIU claim unless you specifically identify the medical condition that led to the Unemployability.
Hell, they may not even give you the exam anyway.
But the important point to note, here, is that you should list on VA Form 21-8940 every single medical condition that is, or that you believe should be, service-connected that you believe plays a role in rendering you unemployable.
They may not give you a CP exam on each of those conditions – but at least you’ve laid the groundwork for arguing later that the VA failed to fulfill its Duty to Assist if it denies your claim.
And, by the way, in about half of the cases where the VA says that the Veteran never submitted a VA Form 21-8940, I’ve found that they have already submitted at least one copy of the Form.
How do you find out if you submitted one and the VA is just not seeing it?
Get a copy of your C-File: it’s the most important document in your VA Claim.

Great site. I had a TKR on left knee which was rated 10% for 49 years. Got the 100% for 13 months. July 1 2015 I had revision surgery to replace the plastic spacer and stop the bleeding. Filed a claim for 3 months of temp 100%. VA said operation wasn’t needed and said no to my claim. Plan to file again. Any other suggedtions?
William,
Thanks for the compliment!
Out of curiosity, why would you refile instead of appealing the denial?
Chris
I went from 50% to 80%, two separate awards from the same claim. I
am also 100% disabled through SSDI.
Jan 2012 is when I filed claim. Sent a NOD through my VSR (where I live VSR is part time Monday/Wed). I received a denial letter dated 24 Aug 2015.
I have not worked, nor been able to work since Apr 2011. Any help would be appreciated.
Mark
If you are disabled through SSDI for the same conditions that are service-connected, at those percentages, it sounds like you might be eligible for TDIU. Did the August 2015 Ratings Decision talk about TDIU? Did your VSO file for it?
Chris
I have seen other information on your site about using a “Sworn Declaration” instead of VA form 21-8940. Im not sure if I need to file this form or the other.
Mr. Attic, I am at 100% I got it in January, but prior to this I filed for TDIU and sent the 21-8940 from along with a total disability letter from the Social Security Adminisrtation. Should this help me get this? ( waiting for C-File ). Joe
If you are granted Social Security Disability for a medical condition you claim as service-connected (or that has been previously) service connected, the Social Security AJ’s decision is pretty powerful evidence of entitlement to Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU).
Very interesting!! I was a Service Officer for the American Legion and have a small idea of the VA, but I think its time to be represented by someone who has the true knowledge. I am currently 60% and much worse then that. I can not be employed and make a decent living and when I think, I am only 10% away from being unemployable.Home Ikks Kids Accessories Hats & Gloves Ikks Hats & Gloves

It was first described by Arnold Pick in 1892 and was originally called "Pick's disease", a term now reserved for Pick disease, one specific type of frontotemporal dementia.:
However, the following abilities in the person with FTD are preserved:
In later stages of FTLD, the clinical phenotypes may overlap. FTD patients tend to struggle with binge eating and compulsive behaviors. These binge eating habits are often associated with abnormal eating behavior including overeating, stuffing oneself with food, changes in food preferences (cravings for more sweets, carbohydrates), eating inedible objects and snatching food from others. Recent findings have indicated that the neural structures responsible for eating changes in FTD include atrophy in the right ventral insula, striatum and orbitofrontal cortex on structural MRI voxel-based morphometry (right hemisphere).
Patients with FTD show marked deficiencies in executive functioning and working memory. Most FTD patients become unable to perform skills that require complex planning or sequencing..
In rare cases, FTD can occur in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) (typically amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The prognosis for people with MND is worse when combined with FTD, shortening survival by about a year.. The most severe brain atrophy appears to be associated with Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and TDP pathology associated with behavioral-variant FTD.
With regard to the genetic defects that have been found, repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is considered a major contribution to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, although defects in the GRN and MAPT genes are also associated with it.
Structural MRI scans often reveal frontal lobe and/or anterior temporal lobe atrophy but in early cases the scan may seem normal. Atrophy can be either bilateral or asymmetric.'. This is entirely in keeping with the notion that on the basis of cognitive neuropsychological evidence, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is a major locus of dysfunction early on in the course of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal degeneration. The language subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia) can be regionally dissociated by imaging approaches in vivo.
The confusion between Alzheimer's and FTD is justifiable due to the similarities between their initial symptoms. Patients do not have difficulty with movement and other motor tasks. As FTD symptoms appear, it is difficult to differentiate between a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and FTD. There are distinct differences in the behavioral and emotional symptoms of the two dementias, notably, the blunting of emotions seen in FTD patients..
Of the six features, three must be present in a patient to diagnose one with possible bvFTD. Similar to standard FTD, the primary diagnosis stems from clinical trials that identify the associated symptoms, instead of imaging studies..
In neuropsychology, there is an increasing interest in using neuropsychological tests such as the Iowa gambling task or Faux Pas Recognition test as an alternative to imaging for the diagnosis of bvFTD. Both the Iowa gambling task and the Faux Pas test are known to be sensitive to dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex.. It is thought that somatic marker is processed in orbitofrontal cortex..). Although Alzheimer's and FTD share certain symptoms, they cannot be treated with the same pharmacological agents because the cholinergic systems are not affected in FTD..
CSF leaks are a known cause of reversible frontotemporal dementia.Sunglasses Gucci GG Dedication 0488 S- 002 Brown 54 18 Havana ceabrera.org,Sunglasses,/mendacious4730385.html,S-,$130,Brown,002,,/,54/18/,0488,Gucci,GG,Havana,/,Havana,,Clothing, Shoes Jewelry , Women , Accessories ceabrera.org,Sunglasses,/mendacious4730385.html,S-,$130,Brown,002,,/,54/18/,0488,Gucci,GG,Havana,/,Havana,,Clothing, Shoes Jewelry , Women , Accessories Sunglasses Gucci GG Dedication 0488 S- 002 Brown 54 18 Havana $130 Sunglasses Gucci GG 0488 S- 002, Havana / Brown / Havana, 54/18/ Clothing, Shoes Jewelry Women Accessories $130 Sunglasses Gucci GG 0488 S- 002, Havana / Brown / Havana, 54/18/ Clothing, Shoes Jewelry Women Accessories

(For externals: request Teams link from contact)In
crystalline solids the interactions of charge and spin can result in a
rich variety of emergent quantum ground states. A prime example is
twisted bilayer graphene, where recent measurements have demonstrated
the presence of superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and Mott insulator
quantum states. The origin of these quantum states is related to the
enhanced correlation effects of the partially filled flat bands in the
system. Rhombohedral graphite (RG) is perhaps the simplest and
structurally most perfect condensed matter system to host a flat band,
which is also protected by the symmetry. In this seminar we will provide
detailed investigation of the flat band in RG by using low temperature
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) measurements combined with
electronic structure calculations [1]. We measured the flat surface band
of 8 and 10 layers of RG at various charge densities and find
correlated behavior up to a temperature of 20 K. At charge neutrality we
also identified a degenerate ground state, forming a competing domain
structure between a sublattice antiferromagnetic insulator and a
gapless, correlated paramagnet. Our density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) calculations explained this observation by revealing a
degenerate ground state of the system. Our work establishes RG as a new
platform to study many-body interactions beyond the mean-field approach
in a topological electron system. [1] I. Hagymási et al., Observation of
strongly correlated, degenerate ground states in the flat band of
rhombohedral graphite. Nature, under review (2021).

2014 Artist Interview Series
Jon Bøe Paulsen international artist Jon Bøe Paulsen. Jon recently displayed his talented skills with several pieces that have been featured in our online art exhibitions of The Senses, Figurative, and Traditions. Accompanying a few of the detailed pictures below are direct quotes from Jon speaking on his dedicated process.
1) Please tell us your name, artistic practice of choice, and location in the world.
My name is Jon Bøe Paulsen and I live and work in Oslo. Norway. My title includes ARCALM, or Associated Living Master, for the Art Renewal Center in Port Reading. NJ.
2) Are you self taught or did you formally study art?
I studied at the School of Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA, USA. I also attended the Norwegian State Art Academy and the Eksamen Artium, both located in Oslo, NO. I consider myself as an artist belonging to the group of new realists where the human being is looked upon in a new light and painted strongly figurative. The meaning of Clair Obscure, in Italian ‘chiaroscuro‘, is light in the darkness.
3) This is a hard choice for many visual artists, but what is the first answer that comes to mind when you think of your favorite color?
My favourite color is Raw Umber.
4) What is difficult for you about your chosen medium?
The difficulty of course is to draw or paint that chosen motiv the way I pictured it in my mind.
5) Which artist living or dead would you want to have a drink with? What type of beverage?
Francis Ford Coppola owned a serious vineyard the last time I checked. I would like to sit down with the man who made “The Godfather” and what is later called “The world’s fastest three hour movie”. And after that glass of red wine, I just simply leave his premises.
6) Do you have any hidden talents or secret party tricks?
Maybe. I said maybe I have a hidden talent in writing novels. Others are better qualified to answer that question though. I published a documentary novel once in the eighties.
“Jernanger”
25.8″ x 38.8″
7) What subject matter appears most in your artwork? What do you love about that subject?
The subject that I often return to concerns human beings that are trying to look into their souls. I love that subject because it challenges my ability to tell a story with one simple painting.

Before settlers arrived, the South Fork of the American River was home to the Nisenan Indians, who lived in the Yuba, Bear, and American river watersheds. It’s obvious why the Nisenan settled in this area, with the beautiful rolling hills, the thriving wildlife, and the awe-inspiring rivers. While the Nisenan have been largely overlooked since the Gold Rush, their heritage is still visible: the city Coloma is even named after the Nisenan word Cullumah, meaning beautiful. Tragically, the Nisenan Indians were pushed out through disease and violence as settlers swarmed California in search of gold.
The Gold Rush
The South Fork of the American River became famous in 1848 when James Marshall first discovered gold while constructing a mill for John Sutter. This discovery sparked the California Gold Rush of 1849. The promise of wealth brought miners from all over the United States in one of the largest mass migrations in the history of the Western Hemisphere.
Early miners were immediately successful – the gold was so plentiful that you could walk along the banks of the South Fork of the American and pick it out of the sand. As the gold became more difficult to find, miners used more destructive methods to scour the banks of the river. Hydraulic mining, in particular, was widely used and caused severe pollution through erosion and the use of mercury. These environmentally devastating methods were banned in 1884 and mining has since petered off, but gold can still be found in the river.
In the end, the California Gold Rush produced an estimated 750,000 pounds of gold, which would be worth more than $14 billion in 2014. However, it also left behind devastating environmental effects: more than 7,500 tons of mercury was used in hydraulic mining, causing approximately 13 billion tons of erosion. The environmental effects of the Gold Rush are still visible today, and everything from the trout in the American Rivers to the San Francisco bay and California wetlands has suffered as a result.
A Powerful Struggle
As California’s population grew, so did the demand for power. The popular 21 mile stretch of whitewater is sandwiched between the Folsom Dam, built in 1955, and the Chili Bar Dam, built in 1964. These dams provide power and water to much of northern California, but they also threaten the health of the river.
When a dam is constructed, though, many factors can hurt the surrounding ecosystem. For example, the controlled releases of the water create a relatively consistent water level throughout the summer; this is unnatural for the area, which usually experiences decreased water levels as the summer passes. While it’s easy to assume that consistent water is better, the reality is that many of the plants and animals are adapted to and even require seasonal drought.
While many of these effects are necessary to provide much-needed resources to California residents, the American River Conservancy works hard to protect as much of the South Fork of the American River as possible in hopes to mitigate negative effects.
American River Conservation Efforts
The environment is a resilient thing, and it has bounced back with remarkable success from the extreme stresses of both mining and damming. This rebound has been aided significantly by conservation efforts along the South Fork of the American River, notably by the American River Conservancy (ARC). Since its foundation in 1989, the ARC has worked to buy land to limit development along the riverbanks and create a corridor of environmental conservation for the protection of wildlife biodiversity.
There are currently more than 3,800 acres protected between the Chili Bar Dam and Folsom Lake, which preserve the diverse habitats along the South Fork of the American River and in the Sierra Nevada Foothills. In this swath of conservation, the South Fork American River Project Area is host to approximately 7% of California’s native plant and animal biodiversity. The trout population, which is notoriously sensitive to pollution, is strong in the South Fork of the American River.
Wildlife along the American River
The corridor of conserved land along the South Fork of the American River is host to incredible wildlife diversity. The diversity begins with the wide range of habitats along the river, including the Blue Oak Savannah, foothill woodland, and riparian zones between the water, forests, and fields. Common trees include a variety of oaks, the California Buckeye, multiple species of willow, and the White Leaf Manzanita. Brush species such as elderberry shrubs, Himalayan blackberry, and California wild grape are common.
With the variety of terrain and wealth of plant species, there are many habitats which provide homes to animals along the South Fork of the American River corridor. There are 117 bird species alone, including Osprey and the rare Bald Eagle. Common mammals in the area include coyotes, grey fox, and mule deer; some nature enthusiasts might even catch a glimpse of black bear, bobcats, or river otters. Fish and amphibians include the rainbow trout, Sacramento pike minnow, pacific tree frog, and Gilbert’s skink.
Recreational Use Today
The South Fork of the American is famous for more than its gold history or its role in powering California—it’s also one of the most popular destinations for whitewater rafting and kayaking in the State of California! The popular whitewater adventures on the Forks of the American include whitewater for all ages and skill levels, with both relaxing floats and exciting, blood-pumping rapids to choose from. Moreover, the cool temperature of the water guarantees it’s a refreshing place to cool off, no matter how high the temperatures climb in the summer. Whitewater recreation sports are possible all summer long due to the Chili Bar dam, which releases water for recreational and electrical purposes.Costumes ‘N’ Parties is Primarily a Costume Rental Boutique located at two strategic locations in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia).

Early Christian Mosaic in Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, Italy
I came across some references to early Christian ritual vestments this morning in Matthew Brown’s The Gate of Heaven. He cited The Awe-Inspiring Rites of Initiation by Edward Yarnold, and The Archæology of Baptism by Wolfred N. Cote. I looked up these references and they were intriguing in describing an early Christian practice of face veiling during initiation rites: [Read more…]I'm A Celebrity's Vicky Pattison has revealed what really happened when John Barrowman was sent out of the jungle.
The actor had a sprained ankle after taking a tumble on the dodgy terrain outside the camp, and was sent off to get some treatment after.
The 51-year-old was taken to hospital after he slipped down a path when walking to clean a pot and immediately screamed out in pain.
The former Doctor Who star was left in agony on Sunday night.
Vicky, who won the show after turning up as a late arrival in her series, said she doubts he would have been given any special treatment as he went back, saying he "wouldn't have got a cereal bar."
She told This Morning's Phillip Schofield and Rochelle Humes: "He was taken to a hospital but he joked he was with male strippers and that... I doubt he would have even got a cereal bar...
"They didn’t give me a drive through any time, I've been in there and done it. You’d be surprised, they’re pretty rigid."
Phil and Rochelle expected him to have been given some tasty treats in his night in hospital, but Vicky was certain that wasn't the case.
A show source told Mirror.co.uk: “John is back in camp and he was very keen to go back on the show as soon as he knew nothing was broken.
“We have heavily strapped his ankle for now and will be keeping a close eye on him.
“This was not a case of trying to persuade him to stay or forcing him to go back, he was desperate to get back in there and carry on with his jungle adventure.
"But how much he can do and what trials he can take part in will depend on how the ankle heals.”
I'm A Celebrity continues tonight at 9pm on ITV as This Morning airs weekdays at 10.30am on ITV.This is the development version of memes; for the stable release version, see memes.

I blogged on a mix of Mormon and family history relating to sugar beets along with some political philosophy (It has been made known to me that I was not subtle). There are a few comments that have digressed into a discussion of irrigation practices and the Moody Blues.
Besides my second guest post now published there, I read Keepa regularly and frequently comment. It really is one of the best blogs out there, IMHO.
The blogger there has become a friend and has even met Anonymous D.
Keepa appreciates our respectful input although the founder does not easily tolerate fools, abuse, or anything else that does not meet her high standards. I'm pleased to have found a home on the net among the Keepa'ninnies. Long may they!Notable Alumni

Seamless Sailor, Julie Sandler Lambert, sent a note a few months ago with a great idea for a fun project that I couldn’t wait to make – a floaty seat using those toy swimming noodles. She wrote a post on her blog, S/V Second Star, with excellent instructions on how to make a noodle chair. Simple and easy to make. She suggested a guest post on Seamless Sailor, so I’ve added her post here. Thanks, Julie!

“That’s Using Your Noodle”
By Julie Sandler Lambert – May 2013
In preparation for our upcoming weekend cruise I spent the day getting prepared. Did I plan out our provisions? Nope. Did I replace the secondary bilge pump so that we would have a backup? Not that either. Today the most important thing we needed to get ready was our floaty toys. I looked at all of the websites for our local big box stores to see what they had to offer. While there were a ton of chair style floats, most seemed like they wouldn’t last out the weekend, others were way too expensive so I decided to design my own.
Below are my pictures of the construction.
After a quick test I realized that the noodle doesn’t sit at the top of the water, which I would have realized ahead of time had I thought about our noodle use from last summer. That changed the dimension of the fabric for round two.
—————————————————————————————————————————————
Seamless Sailor Addendum:
I used Julie’s pattern and made a wonderful noodle seat out of Phifertex. This is a great floaty toy that doesn’t take up much space and it dries quickly. It’s all about storage, right?! My husband decided he wanted two noodles as we have the smaller noodles ($2 each at Best Hardware). So no surprise noodle seat version 2.0 was devised with casings for two noodles. Easy, inexpensive and works great!
Many thanks to Julie for her ingenuity coming up with the pattern and sharing it with Seamless Sailors!
Have you created any swimming toys you want to share?

I so enjoyed this post! I’ve wanted to make a noodle chair and this was so easy – I am an Up-Cycling Sewist and use vinyl event and celebration banners that would otherwise go to the dump as my main material. This was soooo fun!
So glad this was a helpful post. Up-Cycling is fun and helpful to our earth. We use old sails quite a bit. Enjoy!Images of Wales Back to Webpage Archive
The feature below was first shown on my website on 3 February 2000
The tower of St Samlet's Church is a landmark for miles around in the lower Swansea Valley. The parish of Llansamlet was well established by the end of the 17th century, but the present church building is more recent. The village, about four miles to the northeast of Swansea, prospered in the 19th century because of the nearby coal mines and iron works.
After displaying the above photo on my website in February 2000, I was contacted by June Conway of Dartford, Kent. June is the great-great-granddaughter of Henry Bodycomb's brother George. June kindly provided this fascinating piece of family history about Henry:
Henry Bodycomb was the brother of my great-great-grandfather George Bodycomb. Their father, Robert Bodycomb, ran The Smiths' Arms for many years until his death in 1873 and then Henry took it over. Henry married Catharine Jennet Savours.
It is said that Henry was thrown from his horse one Sunday, on his way to church, and subsequently died from his injuries.
Descendants of the Bodycomb daughters ran The Smiths' Arms until it was taken over by the Welsh Brewery. My great-great-grandfather came to Dartford, and one of his daughters and several grand-daughters were sent back to Llansamlet to help Catharine run the pub following Henry's death. One by one, Catharine married them off to local men. Fortunately, my grandmother remained in Dartford, or I might not have been!

In the midst of the Ukrainian upheaval (read here and here) the region of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has undergone changes resulting in backtracking on democratic principles. While Ukraine is embroiled in a revolution, CEE finds itself in a state that can be hardly described as anything else other than its own devolution.
Central and Eastern European countries have in the recent weeks and months done their best to demonstrate why democracy should not be taken for granted. Perhaps more so than other cases, Hungary sticks out as a sore thumb. The latest changes to the Hungarian constitution as envisaged by the current Orban government have been heavily criticised by the European Council and European Parliament (see report here), mainly concerning the limiting of judiciary independence, religious discrimination of churches not recognised by the state, and the government party making it extremely difficult for opposition parties to gain access to the media. One might add that in a system which is consistently searching for enemies, both from within and out, any criticism coming from the European and other institutions is not well received. And thanks to the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and his party it further feeds anti-EU sentiment.
While Hungary has been busy falling out of love with the EU, our fellow European citizens in the Czech Republic have finally put forth a legitimate reason as to why it is that the country is so attractive for Hollywood film makers. Some would say that the best stories are written by life itself and that is certainly true of the country’s political sphere. A chief of staff of the now former Prime Minister Petr Necas was earlier this year accused of abusing her power and bribing MPs which was preceded by the special police task force raiding the building of the seat of the government, this is is a phenomenon in its own right. Following the resignation of the PM Necas, the President has since installed his own puppet government which has governed for months without any legitimacy whatsoever – since the Parliament never approved the current cabinet. Luckily for the Czech Republic, the early elections which were held in late October have given birth to a coalition which is in the process of making a legitimate cabinet that will soon take over. But even the election itself was not scandal-free. However, the Social Democrats who won the poll fell short of expectations, sparking a rebellion from within its own ranks and almost resulted in the party splitting itself in half. It has been alleged, to no one’s surprise, that the rebellion was inspired – if not directly orchestrated – by the power grabbing president Zeman who has proved that he is not shy of going beyond his competences and mandate.
And if that wasn’t bad enough for the region, neighbouring Slovakia has pulled off a stunt which is unprecedented in the country’s modern history. In late November, one of the country’s regions shamefully elected a far-right candidate to its highest office. A political apathy and simple packaging of complex issues (aka populism) has resulted in a situation that is a painful reminder of what is at stake if we ignore the next year’s European Elections.
Moving on to the Balkans, and in case you thought that democracy is by no means a tyranny of the majority, the Croats and their referendum on the definition of marriage as a marriage between one man and one woman will make you think again. We have reached a stage when fundamental rights are being decided by a majority vote and under the principle that being loud also means being right. Better still, stretching the definition of democracy even further, the Romanian MPs have recently passed a legislation in which they’ve put themselves outside the remit of the law as far as corruption is concerned. In other words, political corruption for Romanian MPs has been, with a stroke of a pen, decriminalised. Problem solved. And it would appear that the same attitude of denial has been accepted as their own by MPs in neighbouring Bulgaria where people have been staging protests for months on end in their effort to rid themselves of corrupt politicians.
Anti-democratic forces have been recurring all across Europe. Rolling back our democratic principles is by no means a phenomenon restricted only to the CEE countries. We have now witnessed, for example, the rise of the extreme right both in Spain and Greece which is to some extent a result of the devastating economic policies pursued in this part of Europe. Democracy, as it appears, is a very fragile concept, and of all the principles that we in Europe hold so dear, democracy in particular should not be taken for granted. Anti-democratic elements such as extremism are creeping into our systems and minds with only the most cursory glances from most observers. It is our responsibility to not only report on these developments but equally to address these issues head on. The very least we can do is to turn up and vote at the upcoming European elections earlier next year. Let us restore reason into our public sphere because as we know, and to paraphrase Edmund Burke, evil triumphs when good men and women do nothing.

Lash walked through the hotel lobby lost in thought. The alcohol and gloomy weather had put him in a foul mood. He was here to work and he just wanted to get this film done and move on to something else while he was still in one piece. He stopped and looked inside the hotel bar. Lauren was sitting on one of the barstools. It was definitely her, he’d recognize that shiny raven black hair anywhere. Against his better judgment, he walked in and sat down next to her.
“Tough day?” he asked.
Lauren didn’t answer, just stared into her nearly empty drink.
Lash ordered a whiskey for himself and another glass of wine for Lauren.
“You know I hardly ever drink like this, but damn, he can be exasperating,” she said.
“Family can be like that.”
She looked up at him at last. “You have any brothers or sisters?”
“Nope. Only child.”
“I thought so.”
“Why? Because I’m such a spoiled brat?” He smiled at her.
“Something like that.” God, he had a great smile, she thought. Kind of lopsided, it gave an almost childlike vulnerability to his slightly rough face. She couldn’t help but smile back at him.
“Was that a smile? I knew my charms wouldn’t fail.”
“You are a spoiled brat. And an egotistical one at that.”
“Ouch. That hurt.” His face grew serious. “I do know firsthand what a pain in the ass your brother can be. But he’s good. If you two can’t figure this mess out, no one can.”
Another drink later, Lash knew he was in trouble. Lauren was too easy to talk to and all he could think about was how she would look out of those clothes. He tried to blame his thoughts on the alcohol, knowing it had lowered his inhibitions, but he was beyond rational thought now. Her knee brushed against his under the bar and before he could stop it, his hand had slid underneath her skirt and up the smooth warm skin of her thigh.
Lauren’s eyes went wide in surprise, but she didn’t push his hand away. A moment later, her lips parted and she let out a small moan of pleasure. Lash downed the rest of his whiskey, then stood up, pulling her against him. Without a word, he led her out of the bar.
As soon as the elevator doors closed, his hands were all over her again. They jerked to a stop on the top floor and he grabbed her hand and led her down the hall, fumbling with his keycard.
“Lash, I don’t . . .”
His lips came down hard on hers stopping her protest as he pulled her into the room. He roughly ripped off her blouse as they stumbled towards the bed.
Lauren knew it was a mistake, knew she’d probably regret it in the morning, but she didn’t care. Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe she just wanted to be screwed by a famous movie star. Hell, maybe she was just horny. But none of that mattered as Lash pushed her down on the bed and stripped off his own clothes..
Hoyt couldn’t stand the subtle tension with Ang. He’d stayed late at the RA, sorting through financial records with Ward and Sanderson.
Now, back at the hotel, he went straight to Ang’s room. He needed to clear the air with her.
She opened the door and let him in without a word. She had her hair pulled up and was in yoga pants and a long baggy sweatshirt. She made his mouth water.
Ang watched him and laughed. “If I knew yoga pants turned you on that much, I would have broken them out sooner.”
Hoyt wasn’t used to having someone read him as well as she did. “Sorry,” he said.
She raised an eyebrow.
“I’m sorry for staring at your very fine ass.” He paused. “And I’m sorry for being an ass.”
Ang sighed and all traces of laughter disappeared. “Should we try to go back to just being partners?”
“I don’t know if I can,” Hoyt admitted. “This is all new territory for me. I know I’m fucking it up. I don’t mean to.”
“I think we need to spend less time trying to complicate things and just enjoy each other while we solve this case.”
“You make it sound so simple,” he said.
She shrugged. “Maybe it can be.”
Hoyt had his doubts, but he was certainly willing to give it a try. “Okay, how about I go grab us dinner. Then we can work for a couple hours.”
“Do you miss working for Lash Brogan?” Ang asked as she settled herself onto the couch later that night after they’d eaten.
Hoyt threw their empty pizza box in the trash.
As a general rule, he didn’t like talking about those days. Not that he regretted them, he just didn’t like advertising the fact that he’d been a celebrity bodyguard. But for some reason, he didn’t mind talking to Ang about it. He actually quite enjoyed it, which was a definite first for him.
“Sometimes,” he answered honestly. “I was overpaid for sure. And it was a good gig, except for the taking a bullet part. But it was time to leave. Lash had become a friend.”
“Why was that a problem?” she asked.
“It’s too hard to keep a distance, to be a good protector, when you start socializing with your protectee.”
He paused, thinking how easy it could be to slip into the same situation with Ang. Could they really be partners and lovers?
He watched as she cocked her head, as if she knew exactly what he was thinking. She was way too damned in tune with him.
“You know this is different, right? We’re partners. Fifty-fifty. We look out for each other equally. It’s not your job to protect me,” she said.
He knew she was right, but she sure as hell brought out his protective instincts. But he knew it would piss her off if he said it out loud. So he kept his mouth shut.
She held his gaze for a moment, then her face softened. “Well, since we got that settled, let’s finish our work so we can enjoy the rest of our evening.”
And that was all the motivation he needed. He forced himself to focus on the task at hand so he could get her naked and in bed.

8 ½ x 11”
2013
Photographer: Troy David Photo
The Award Project is an installation of 83 awards that I received throughout my childhood, hung chronologically, alongside a letter from my dad. The final frame of the installation holds an email my dad sent me, in which he expresses his concerns for my financial future, and his distress with my choice to pursue art. I highlight this letter because I have these same anxieties. The letter placed among the awards forms a point of conflict, transforming the piece into more than just a showcase of the many awards I have received. The letter exposes another layer of depth to the awards, opening conversations about expectations, education, and family dynamics, especially those between my dad and me.Description

Onion Knights is a very literal take on the “Tower Defense” genre, albeit with a bit more interactivity and direct control. There are no turrets to place atop maze walls, dutifully waiting for the inexorable procession of enemies and tanks to blunder into their range - rather, you have direct control over your little knight in a mobile turret (which can only move up and down), allowing you to directly respond to any area of the screen except the tower itself, which you are defending. It’s a big job for such a little knight.
Fortunately, you have the aid of three allies: a giant hammer-wielding knight who can knock foes back, a lady sharpshooter who can lay mines and take down enemies who sneak past your main cannon and a tinkerer who fires off deadly homing missiles and other projectiles. You also have access to special consumable “skills” (such as a sneeze that wipes out all foes on the field) and persistent, upgradeable “Hero” units who can help out for a limited amount of time, just once per battle.
THE FLOW AND THE STORY:
The Onion Knights have been set the task of defending their nation from the oncoming hordes of the Curry Kingdom! Strap into your cannon, select your special weapon and skill loadouts, cry havoc, and loose the dogs of war!
...And that's about it. If you’ve ever played tower defense before, you know the drill; keep the bad guys away from your tower, or you’re done. If they manager to infiltrate and scale your tower, or your cannoneer runs out of HP, then it's game over, man! Game over!
The game throws hordes of enemies against your little cadre of brave warriors, all of which are intent of taking you down. The enemies are fun and varied, from armored knights and birds to dragons and ninjas to enemy hero-class units that will give your little knights a run for their money. You objective is to mow these bad boys down while trying to keep your combo counter high, while you simultaneously dodge thrown projectiles and incoming cannon shots.
The Rest:
For controls, Onion Knights only offers keyboard and mouse; up/down for the main character (who is always in auto-fire mode) and shortcut keys for your three allied knights. You have up to three special skills and up to three special heroes who will pop in for a minute or so to help with the war effort. ESC usually takes you directly to the Quit screen, rather than backing you out of the current menu area, so watch it, lest you bail in the middle of a battle.
The graphics are pretty darn nice for a mobile port. The characters are the cutesy, hand-drawn-looking fare, as well as the animations and backgrounds. As this is apparently a mobile port, there's no option to control the volume level aside from just a Mute function, and the game is LOUD at default settings.

Wrapped in other world atmosphere, it is one of the most illustrious hotels in Europe. For over one century, it has stood out for the level of hospitality and a long list of famous guests. The two gourmet restaurants of the hotel that are amongst the most renowned in the city.
The brief
- The hotel needs to replace the old kitchen, damaged and no longer performing at its best.
- The new kitchen should be extremely flexible to allow the chef Thomas Wilken to express his creativity to the fullest and to fulfill customers’ needs.
- It is necessary to combine high quality dishes with large production. The kitchen of the hotel works for the restaurant, the bar, the Atlantic catering company for events of up to 3500 people.
- The substitution of the kitchen includes the renewal of the plumbing and electrics, flooring and wall cover.
- The work needs to be completed within a very short space of time because the kitchen of the hotel cannot be closed.
The solution
- The hotel chooses Ambach for its reliability and the highest standards of quality, performance and hygiene.
- The cooking block is installed in one single stainless steel piece with four components of System 900 together with a module of System 700. Invisible waterproof joins make them into a single hygienic top.
- Thanks to the new generation of induction cook tops, there is less ambient heat loss and improved working conditions in the kitchen.
- Compared to the previous kitchen, the new Ambach kitchen saves more than 50% of the energy previously required.
- The position of the various cooking elements is ergonomic and is a perfect reflection of the work flow in the kitchen. This creates a comfortable work environment and saves time.
- The chef is extremely satisfied: the kitchen lives up to his expectations and standards. The invaluable help of consultants Krefft e Gottschalk made installation quick and easy.artlı Telefonlar

Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus is equipped with a triple camera. The rear camera system of this phone consists of the main 108-megapixel HM2 lens of Samsung, the 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens of Sony IMX355 and the 2-megapixel depth-detection lens. The selfie camera of this phone will probably be 16 megapixels. It is said that a 5000 mAh battery powers this phone. As confirmed by Xiaomi today, this phone will support fast 120 watt charging. Other key features of this phone include support for IR Blaster technology, NFC and dual JBL speakers. According to the latest rumors, the price of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory is 2,199 yuan (approximately Rs 25,700) and the version with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal memory may be priced at around It will sell for 2,499 yuan (approximately Rs. 29,200). The main camera will be based on a 50-megapixel sensor, and users will need to use a 13-megapixel camera to take selfies. The beating heart of this phone is MediaTek Dimensity 810 chipset, which has 6 or 8 GB of RAM and 128 or 256 GB of internal memory. Redmi Note 11 is powered by a 5000 mAh battery and its charging speed reaches 33 watts. It seems that the 128.6 GB model of this phone will go to the Chinese market at a price of $ 186, and Chinese users will have to pay $ 218 to buy the 128.8 GB model. The 256GB 8GB model will probably be priced at $ 249.
On the other hand, for the Redmi Note 11 Pro, we should expect the Dimensity 920 chipset. Users can choose between 6 or 8 GB of RAM and 128 or 256 GB of internal memory to buy this phone. Also, unlike the standard model, the Redmi Note 11 Pro uses an old display, and the resolution of the main camera reaches 108 megapixels. It seems that the battery of this phone is 5000 mAh, but its charging speed reaches 67 watts. The 128.6 and 128.8 GB models are priced at $ 249 and $ 280, respectively, and the 256.8 GB model is priced at $ 311.
Xiaomi is one of the best companies in the field of fast charger production among all smartphone manufacturers, and so far some of its phones are equipped with 100 and 120 watt chargers. Market. But it was usually only the flagship phones or, ultimately, the affordable flagships that came on the market with very fast chargers. Now it looks like a mid-range phone is set to hit the market with a fast charger. With its Redmi Note series, Redmi was able to help Xiaomi become the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world. The phones of this company are extremely good and valuable in terms of purchase, and therefore have many users in many parts of the world. That's why the Chinese company decided to launch its much-anticipated midrange with a feature that doubles their purchase value.
As mentioned above, the Redmi Note 11 Pro is the most powerful phone in the series. The Redmi Note 11 is set to hit the market with a very fast charger at 120 watts. The Redmi Note 10 Pro and Pro Max came with a 33-watt charger, and even a version of the two phones available in China had a 67-watt charger, so using a 120-watt charger is a significant improvement. Currently, some of the Xiaomi handsets that support 120-watt chargers are the 11T Pro, the Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra, and the Mi Mix 4, all of which are in fact the company's flagship. Although the Redmi Note 11 Pro is the most powerful phone in the series, it will never be the size of a flagship. However, in terms of charger speed, it will be significantly higher than all the flagships that competing companies are launching in the market.

Ultra juicy and best served smothered with all manners of Tex-Mex fixin’s, these grilled chicken burgers have become a weeknight (and weekend) default meal at our house. They take less than 10 minutes to prep, boast serious southwest flavor, and are even healthy too!
Plus, since we usually throw the chicken burgers on the grill (you can also cook them stovetop if you prefer), I’m left with little to clean up, beyond our dinner plates…and my skinny margarita glass.
About These Mexican Chicken Burgers
If you read the phrase “chicken burger” and immediately translated it to “hockey puck,” as fellow victim to many a flavorless, dry ground chicken burger patty, I understand. Before you condemn all chicken burgers forever and ever amen, however, I beg you to give one last chicken burger recipe a try—this one. Even our red-blooded, red-meat-loving neighbor deemed them, “shockingly good.”
High praise from a sworn beef lover and Blue Cheese Burger super fan.
To make a satisfying, juicy chicken burger that’s worthy of its bun, you need two things: 1) moisture and 2) serious flavor. Plain ground chicken is pretty, well, plain.
To amp up both the juicy-factor and the taste of these grilled chicken burgers, I added a can of Old El Paso Chopped Green Chiles. A lover of Mexican foods and flavors, I’m working with Old El Paso to develop a series of Tex-Mex-inspired recipe this year. These green chile chicken burgers are the first of more serious southwest deliciousness to come!
The juices and gentle heat of the green chiles infuse the chicken burgers with Tex-Mex flavor. When combined with a few southwest staples like cumin and chili powder, these chicken burgers go from blah to BINGO.

Tools Used to Make This Recipe
- No grill? No problem! This affordable cast-iron grill plate can be used right on your regular stove and makes beautiful grill marks.
- Ben’s favorite grill set (for indoor grilling and all kinds of fish, roasted veggie, and fried egg flipping, I love this spatula).
Smother these grilled chicken burgers with all the best Mexican-inspired toppings like avocado, salsa, and sour cream, and you have yourself a fiesta that’s on the table less than a half hour.
Do yourself a favor though—do not eat these chicken burgers while wearing white pants. Don’t ask me how I know—I just do.

I’m sharing this post in partnership with Old El Paso. As always, all opinions are my own and thanks for supporting the brands and companies that make it possible for me to continue creating quality content for you!
oh yummy! Girl this looks so good!
How do I save the recipes on my iPad
I like the sound of these, but given the fact that green chiles can be hot, even when they are not supposed to be, I would probably leave out the jalapeño, or cut it back to ½ pepper. I’ve actually never used ground chicken before.
Susan, the green chiles are super mild, but if you are very sensitive to spice, leaving out the jalapeno is a good idea. Ground chicken is very worth trying. It’s healthy, easy to use, and yummy when mixed with the right spices. Enjoy!
Wow, this looks amazing!
these chicken burgers sound so yummy! I love adding the avocado and cilantro. going to have to try this one for sure :-D
Oh my goodness. This looks like a deliciously messy meal- the best kind of meal in my opinion! I love chicken burgers- I always use the dark ground meat so the patties stay nice and juicy.
I have ground my own chicken in a little food processor. It’s really simple except you have to have a light touch and just do it in several pulses rather than just turning the machine on. It’s always worked for me just fine, ground chicken in Las Vegas, Nv. is an unknown meat! lol unless you ask the “butcher” in the market to grind it for you.
I had no idea! Thanks for sharing this tip.
I was wondering if you can use ground turkey as a substitute? I can’t always find ground chicken where I live!
Yes, definitely! I hope you enjoy the recipe.
These are delicious! I had to make a couple substitutions because of what I had on hand (ground beef instead of chicken, yellow onion instead of green onion), but either way this recipe is a keeper. Thanks so much.
I’m so happy to hear that Jocelyn!! Thanks for trying the recipe and letting me know how it came out :)
Can you cook these in the skillet on the stovetop?
Absolutely Natasha! Preheat the skillet the same way that you with the grill, then cook the burgers in a bit of olive oil. I hope you enjoy the recipe!
I live for spicy food! I like to put jalapeños on top of burgers so these are right up my alley! What percent ground chicken did you use?
Laura, I used either 90 or 93% lean—I can’t recall now, but it was one of those two. I hope you love the recipe!
Hi Erin, I was looking for the perfect preconcertfood food and I saw this burger recipe. prerequisites were delicious, nutritious and enough to to prevent us from “Running on Empty” during the concert , so I made the burgers a third of a pound instead of quarter pound. The old paso chili added the perfect blend of moisture and spice and are now a staple in my pantry
Rey, I am thrilled to hear these were a hit and kept you full too! Thanks so much for trying the recipe and sharing your review.
Made these tonight, they were fantastic. We used jalapeno cheese and spicy salsa, my husband loved them. Thank you for the great recipe.
Jen, I am so excited to hear this!!! I love the idea of using jalapeno cheese too. Thanks for trying the recipe and letting me know how it turned out!
I am a College teacher
I made this tonight and the family (including a picky 13 year old) loved them! We topped the burgers with cilantro, tomato, avocado and Kraft avocado ranch.
Erin, I am thrilled to hear this. Thank you!!
Hello. This sounds great. What would you pair this with?
Hi Ashleigh, you could serve whatever you like! I think a vegetable side would be nice. Maybe a light, crisp salad (you could add black beans and use a light ranch dressing to stick with the Tex-Mex theme) or keep it simple with roasted vegetables. Sweet potatoes would be delicious. Enjoy!
Yummy! I added an egg just because I was anxious they’d fall apart. I baked them in cupcake pans for the protein for my Mexican quinoa bowls. Delish!
I’m so happy that you enjoyed the recipe, Ashley! Thank you for sharing this kind review!
These were great, no binder needed!
I’m so happy that they were a hit, Angela! Thank you for sharing this kind review!
Soooo great! So easy. The entire fam loved it! Xoxo Thanks
I’m so happy that you enjoyed them, Laurielulu! Thank you for sharing this kind review!
These were phenomenal! Such great flavor, I skipped the jalapeno for my daughter and used sliced colby jack cheese! A definite make again!
I’m so happy that you enjoyed them, Crissy! Thank you for sharing this kind review!
I loved these burgers! They were so easy and satisfying! What a great recipe!
So glad you enjoyed it Bryanna! Thank you for this kind review!The Expanse - Season 2
One of the best tv shows made in 2016 year. For me, this tv show deserves all the best. The Expanse - Season 2 is an outstanding top class tv show. You do not need to be a Drama films lover to feel great spending time on watching The Expanse - Season 2. I am a huge fan of Mark FergusHawk Ostby and this tv show was his best work of last years. The acting is really unusual in a good meaning. The Expanse - Season 2 has many original details and specifics that I really cannot get out of my head since watching it. Watch it and I'm sure you'll become another fan of The Expanse - Season 2 too. Have a great time watching it.

We also observed a withdrawal impact: Persons who were exposed to fewer emotional posts (of either valence) in their News Feed had been significantly less expressive overall around the following days, addressing the query about how emotional expression affects social engagement on line. This observation, and the fact that people were extra emotionally constructive in response to constructive emotion updates from their close friends, stands in contrast to theories that recommend viewing constructive posts by friends on Facebook may.

We’re repeatedly subjected to a lot of iPhone 7 rumors floating around the web featuring possible iPhone 7 features and design. But, out of all the speculations, what do we really want in our upcoming iPhone?
Image: Upcoming iPhone 7 Concept
The question keeps dangling in front of us without anyone bothering to address the situation. We do not wish to have our dreams to be shattered by buying Apple product like the iPhone 6 plus, which was hardly innovative. Or, do we?
Obviously, the issue is no longer a subject of customer dissatisfaction. Instead, it has become a major issue, which company needs to address with sheer focus if it wants to bounce back from a declining phase in the smartphone economy. Apple is already a mess in China. The country used to be the second largest market for iPhone, but the last year has witnessed a tremendous decline in the sales of iPhone.
Feature in Upcoming iPhone 7
The upcoming iPhone 7 needs to be a sure shot hit if the company wishes to win back the consumers, investors, and shareholders.
Also Read: iPhone 7 Release: The Decline of iOS Market Share Will Continue
So how would that happen? While Apple Inc. is going through a declining phase of iPhone sales, Google’s Android has established a strong hold in the international market. Apple CEO Tim Cook might need more than meager efforts for the upcoming iPhone 7 to beat the heat.
We went through numerous iPhone 7 rumors on the web and opinions offered by our team of researchers and writers who have surveyed Apple aficionados several times in past. Finally, we’ve come across a strong feature, which the next in line iPhone MUST carry. Only if it wants to win back the love from all over.
Water Resistance
Puh-lease! Dear Apple, we need this, badly indeed. One of the biggest causes of damage in our iPhone is water. Water damages lead to expensive repairs, and to be frank, we’re tired of flushing those ridiculous amounts of money. We’re investing heaps for buying your iPhone. The least you could do is offer some sort of protection from water. Imagine a girl trying to click a picture of her coffee to upload on Instagram. Somehow the mug flips and the entire content covers her iPhone. Moreover, she wipes off the coffee and discovers that her iPhone is dead. Disgusting and highly annoying! Galaxy S7, your fiercest competitor (as soon as iPhone 7 is launched) is priced at lesser amount compared to what iPhone 7 might be. But still the Android-based smartphone giant offers IP68 water resistance and dust resistance. It can be used in a pool, mud, rain, or steam baths. So, why can’t you, Apple?
Well, there are many other features too, which we would love to have in the upcoming iPhone 7. You can have a look at those features in our previous article.
Also Read: These Features Will Make Upcoming iPhone 7 Worth Buying
Well bigger and bigger … But just the same old design is hardly innovative either right?
Let’s see something unique, useful and designed well which has some from another company. Oh look / it’s a projector in a phone – that works well…oh look this phone has an IRblaster… How useful … Or what wait they removed in the 3rd last model last year.
What are you waiting for from Apple? Can you not see whey are unique? Name another company that can replicate what Apple have, without droning on about iSheep?
The IOS market is not in decline. It’s growing. Perhaps Android is growing slightly faster, but to say The IOS market ‘is in decline’ is simply untrue.Heartland Stories

How to Create the Best Strategy for B2B Content Creation
The definition of B2B is business to business. It is not disputable that content is very important. Being able to create a good content creation strategy for business to business communication is a factor to consider for your business to do well. A good content creation strategy is like a map that guides the promotion, planning, measurement and production of your content.
The content creation strategy is supposed to be in document form if the marketer shall be categorized as good. In the creation of a content creation strategy, the steps spoken about below should be used as a guide.
You Have to Start
. Your company has to be defined in the line of your strategy as you begin the process. You must be able to go further deeper than your mission statement and define your brand.
Establish the People you Want to Reach
You cannot create a product for everyone. Getting the individuals who are truly interested in you is your goal. You should ascertain what they are interested in and what they want to see in their business.
Have the List of What you Want to Achieve
Have the clients needs in your thoughts and get the right solution for them. At the beginning, you should have small objectives but which are in line with your big personal objectives. Content marketing Success will come about when your focus is on the goals.
Production of a Theme
Without a theme, the strategy becomes incohesive and the audience is lost. A very big misstep is choosing topics based on nothing every day. The theme around which content is written should have been predetermined before.
The Making of an Offer
A special offer or a promotion can be what you need to firmly establish your strategy. In your blog spots, think of giving an ebook, checklist and white list.
Form your Keywords
The main words used usually determine your success especially with search engines.Have a list of words that are in line with your theme and that can be used across multiple forms of content.
The Theme Should be the Base of your Efforts
Blog spots are not the only the thing that make a successful content marketing strategy. The monthly offer should be boosted in terms of traffic by the email newsletters and advertisements that reflect on your theme. Social media should be used in the strategy but you should put into consideration the theme you wish to push forward.
Establish a Calendar for your Content
Letting content creation be a last minute thing is unwise. When you do the last minute rush up, it will definitely be seen even by the people you are targeting.Having the calendar helps you not to be left behind.

The Awards - an icon of the country’s small and medium business sector – celebrate their 25th anniversary this year. Back in 1992, the then government-owned Telecom collaborated with the States and the Commonwealth Government to set up the Awards in Victoria as a showcase of the best of Aussie business and to inspire others budding entrepreneurs. Even as Telecom transformed into Telstra, that commitment to championing small business never wavered. In fact, Telstra went on to expand the Awards, creating the state/territory and national awards that are now permanent and prestigious fixtures in the Australian business calendar. Meanwhile, the Awards have continued to develop alongside the sector they aim to recognise, most recently adding a new category for charities and not-for-profits in 2016.
As the Awards’ chief judge and Ambassador from 2012 to 2016, Will Irving, now Group Executive of Telstra Wholesale, has identified a handful of common traits among the winners. “Most (winners) did not set out to make millions,” he says. “They set out to produce a great product or turn around a family business, keep a local area alive (or) meet a customer need that they themselves had, or someone they knew had, or where they saw customers missing out on what could be.”
Renowned business journalist and founding editor of BRW Robert Gottliebsen was also heavily involved in the early years of the Awards’, While the finalists and winners naturally attract most of the attention, Gottliebsen believes the true legacy of the Awards is the vast number of businesses that benefited from taking part. “The most important thing about them is not so much who wins them, but the process of entering,” he says.
“(Entering) makes them think about their strategies (and) their weaknesses. I know a lot of them have been helped by…the process and being forced to sit down and say this is what we did, this is what we plan to do, is that good? (That has) been a tremendous contributor to the health of small business in Australia.”
Entrants to the Awards also receive a free Business Health Check which benchmarks their business against industry standards as well as the opportunity to network with like-minded business around Australia. The past two-and-a-half decades have also seen the rise of the internet, mobile technologies and software automation, creating a dramatic shift in the small business landscape. Not surprisingly, more than 80 per cent of Telstra Business Awards Alumni credit such technologies as critical or very important to their success.“
Smaller businesses can operate now in a way that was just so much more difficult back 25 years ago,” says Gottliebsen. “It's never going to be easy to run a small business – it's a really hard task – but it's been made just that little bit easier.”
The times are always a-changing. Over the next twenty-five years, technologies, trends and markets will continue to shift and evolve. Yet some things will always remain the same, as relevant tomorrow as they were yesterday. “What is undoubtedly true,” says Irving, “is that the same human qualities of determination, flexibility, care for staff and customers, eye to the short and the long term, passion…and an ability to pick good people – these things will be as true of winners in the 2040s as they are today and were in the past.”
As hundreds of Australian businesses begin planning their entries for the twenty-fifth Telstra Business Awards, will yours be among them? Could your story inspire the next generation of successful businesses?

There was better news for the Reds who triumphed in a thrilling win, and there was a special milestone for one player.
Maritza Munoz reports.
TRANSCRIPT
It was a close match at Allianz stadium on Friday night.
One point stood between the Broncos and the Eels at full-time, sending Brisbane home as the losers, 19-18.
There were bigger concerns in the Broncos camp when forward Ben Hannant left the field in the 72nd minute with a calf injury.
It’s expected he’ll be out for a few weeks and possibly ruled out of the first State of Origin match.
At the Gabba, there were more losses as the Lions took on the West Coast Eagles.
Poor skill errors by the Lions sent the Eagles soaring to a 108-82 win leaving Brisbane with its fifth loss from seven outings.
But it wasn’t all bad news for Brisbane with the Reds securing a 32-17 win over the Sharks.
It was the perfect night for prop Greg Holmes who celebrated his 100th game for Queensland.
Greg Holmes, Reds: “Yeha mate it means everything you know. I can remember when I was in the Reds college years ago, and it’s a very special experience, and I could do with a bit of a bigger hat, this one doesn’t fit real well.”
Following their tour of South Africa, the Reds will return to Suncorp Stadium on June 1st to take on the Melbourne Rebels.

The right service can make a huge difference as far as these services go, and while any licensed company can do a decent job, your home – and your air conditioner – deserve more than that. Every service is different and only you can make the right choice that works for your home. But in most cases, you should look for the following three signs to ensure that you choose the right service.
1. Free Estimates
The basis of any successful business is repeat business, and that means delivering quality service for a reasonable price. That starts with up-front estimates. A quality air conditioning service technician will spell out all of the costs involved in any repair job up front, before any work has been done and any money has changed hands. That protects you in the event of the unexpected and ensures that you know exactly what’s entailed in any repairs. It also speaks to the honesty and forthrightness of the service: protecting you and your system regardless of the circumstances.
2. Manufacturer Endorsements
AC manufacturers have a vested interested in keeping their systems maintained by quality technicians. It helps them maintain their own reputations for quality and reliability. Most AC repair companies have endorsements from satisfied customers, but endorsements from manufacturers carry a huge amount of weight. It means those companies have faith in the repair service to do right by their products: to treat any issues swiftly and efficiently and to enhance their own reputation where it matters the most. Look for a company with endorsements from major AC brands such as Goodman, Aprilaire, and Mitsubishi, with a particular eye on your specific brand of air conditioning.
3. Guarantees
Estimates and endorsements are terrific signs that the air conditioning company has the right skills and integrity to do the job. But at the end of the day, the system needs to work once the repair technician is done. The most effective way to get those results it to look for a company with a guarantee: who promises that the parts and labor are top-notch and offers to return and correct any further issues should the repair job not be up to snuff.

“You forgot your ski’s!” “There’s no snow!” These are some of the many things that have been shouted at me when I’m out walking with my poles, but I couldn’t care less. I know something they don’t – my walking poles are amazing and I don’t care at all that it looks a bit odd.
Nordic Walking was originally created as a way for Scandinavian cross-country skiers to keep in shape during the warmer months. It quickly gained popularity by turning walking into a full body workout and has proven its worth for rehabilitation purposes.
In a nutshell, it’s walking on all fours with great posture. Normal walking engages up to 45% of your muscles and it can be hard to get your heart rate up to the moderate-high intensity range. Nordic Walking engages up to 90% of your muscles, providing a much more intense workout, if intense is what you’re after. Because you’re using your own body weight as resistance, the level of intensity is up to you.
If you are not feeling fit already, that’s fine, just take it easy. Walking with the poles helps with balance, mobility and taking some of the load off bad backs/hips/knees/ankles. When I started Nordic Walking my back had been giving me grief for months and I could barely walk a flight of stairs. Three months later I was walking 6km carrying my toddler in the backpack. Fitness comes back quickly – just start gentle and work your way up to it. I’ve worked with people after accidents/surgeries, with Parkinsons, MS and other health conditions that normally make exercise difficult. Age is no bother either, my son started learning at 2 years old and the oldest Nordic Walker I’ve met was in their late 90’s.
Core engagement is another bonus of walking with poles. I’ve had a bad back for nearly 20 years and it’s at its best when I have a strong core. Nordic Walking engages your core muscles with every step, similar to swimming or kayaking. Posture also improves gradually as you’re using the muscles that hold your spine upright. Much of the shrinking we experience as we age is due to poor posture.
Can you just grab some poles and get started? Yes, and no. While the research says that any walking with poles is better than without, there are some things that offer a huge advantage. Because we’re talking about a repetitive exercise, learning the right technique will help you get more benefit and reduce your risk of a RSI (repetitive stress injury) down the track. The right gear also makes a world of difference. You could try to run a marathon wearing a pair of thongs, but running shoes would be far better. Likewise, hiking poles while similar, are no comparison for the purpose built Nordic Walking poles. The best option is to learn the technique in a group class with the right gear.
The biggest benefit of all, you get to improve your health while seeing more of this magnificent island we are lucky enough to call home.
Group class requirements: ability to walk 100m unassisted, comfortable shoes, outdoor clothing to suit the weather.

And this March, a new, live-action version of the movie will be released in theaters starting Emma Watson as Belle. While most people seem to be excited for the classic film's remake, when actress Angela Lansbury, who played Mrs. Potts in the original, heard about the new version of the film, she admitted to being a little confused.
"I was a bit taken aback, naturally. I thought, 'Why? Why are we doing this over again?'" she told Entertainment Weekly back in September during the film's special anniversary screening at the Film Society of Lincoln Center. ."
As a tribute to the film, Lansbury also sung the movie's famous theme, "Beauty and the Beast," during the anniversary event. The film became the first animated movie to be nominated for Best Picture in 1992, and Lansbury said the movie will always be considered a memorable film for many and that the live-action film will be quite different.
 91-year-old actress went on to say that animated films like Beauty and the Beast also come from a time of hand-drawn artwork that is no longer made, which also adds to the film's richness. Lansbury calls the 1991 classic a treasure that can't be duplicated or ever replaced. Who can disagree with that?LÜBECK CITY

Kurt Squire Shares Lessons Learned In ‘Making Games for Impact’
How do you tap into people’s passion for gaming to improve learning outcomes and positively influence society? Kurt Squire tackles this question in his new book, Making Games for Impact, sharing lessons learned from real-world projects.
Informatics Professor Kurt Squire is a leading scholar in games research and development.
As educators struggled to effectively leverage technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, the gaming industry experienced tremendous growth, revealing both the problems and potential of expanding computer games beyond just entertainment. Over the next five years, game-based learning is expected to reach a market size of $17 billion, but how do you design and develop games that actually make a difference? Drawing from two decades of experience in games research and development, Informatics Professor Kurt Squire offers lessons learned in his new book, Making Games for Impact (MIT Press, 2021). His experience stems from the Games + Learning + Society center, which he started with Constance Steinkuehler in 2005 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and recently relaunched in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at UCI. Presenting a series of case studies from the center, Squire examines how to make games for impact, also touching on innovation and entrepreneurship in higher education.
What was your motivation for writing this book?
As game design becomes mainstream, we’re seeing more teams making games for impact — whether it’s in learning, healthcare or personal growth. A lot of what we wrestled with was about taking innovations out of the university and into the marketplace. How do we leverage university expertise to partner with commercial teams? Or is it better to spin out student companies? After almost 10 years of projects supported by $10 million in grant funding, we created many successful products and partnerships — and made some mistakes — so I wanted to share our experiences before it went cold.
And why look at impact in particular?
I like to think of “impact” instead of just learning, because some people think of learning in narrow terms. Most game projects are really trying to make an impact in the world beyond learning gains.
Why focus on individual case studies?
I find that people learn the most from stories — or case studies. Each case study is designed to illustrate a specific point, like how do you build up an art team? Or how can you use analytics in design? Each chapter does report on more focused research studies, but a book lets us tie these studies together so that hopefully, a reader can sense what it is all trying to add up to.
Who is your target audience, and what do you hope they take away from this book?
The target audience is anyone from people in games or game studies interested in how we design them for impact, to educators curious about games. I also hope that teams building games for impact — from educators making a math game to people working in healthcare — will want to read and share the book with their teams because they’ll see themselves in there somewhere. My hope is that they’ll read portions and think, “Oh, we are about to make that mistake! I should share this and we should discuss it first.”
How do you think the pandemic impacted digital games for learning?
On the one hand, kids (and people) turned to games more than ever outside of school. Games, as an industry, exploded. We turned to Animal Crossing, Among Us, and Minecraft for comfort, friendships or adventure. We collaborated, shared, constructed and celebrated in virtual worlds. Yet in schools, technology was mostly implemented in a pretty conservative way. With few exceptions, we mostly used technology for displaying lectures and submitting homework. My hope is that the pandemic really alerted people to the possibilities of game-based learning technologies. I’m hoping that many people asked why they can create virtual societies or structures in Minecraft, but in schools, [they just] more or less repeat back what teachers want them to do.
When people ask about successful games for learning, I point them to Plague Inc., a game about designing a pathogen to wipe out humanity. It’s been in the top 10 mobile games for the better part of the past decade now. Play that game and you understand all kinds of ideas central to viruses and managing the pandemic.
You mentioned moving innovations from academia into the marketplace. Can you expand on that?
We live in what’s been called an “entrepreneurial age” of the university. With reduced tuition dollars and uncertain federal funding, universities are looking for ways to diversify income. Academics struggling to make sense of this “entrepreneurial university” might look to colleagues in games for lessons on navigating the modern university structure. Games, as a discipline and as an activity, have come of age in this milieu.
Many scholars teach in cost recovery or professional programs and have had to build up staff through creative project management, so our field has learned a lot about navigating these structures. This book offers lessons not just about games but also about navigating universities and institutions generally, such as how to choose projects, how to partner with administration, and how to grow teams through diverse funding sources.
A big lesson I learned was that it is critical for innovators to ask, “Whose problems does this innovation solve?” We often focus on our own problems (i.e., revenue, student learning), but those may not be the problems of administrators. What most administrators are really interested in is accruing social and cultural capital. The book ends with some reflections on how innovations can thrive within the modern university by aligning with broader institutional goals and exploiting niches in the environment.
Any current projects in the works through the Games + Learning + Society center?
We’re working on many projects now, particularly around well-being, attention focusing and remote collaboration, as well as entrepreneurship with XR [extended reality] during the pandemic.

Fatima Mojaddedi
Deposited 2016
Abstract
This dissertation is an ethnographic engagement with the social and political space of Afghanistan and how it has been shaped by the intensities of warfare in the last decade, with a focus on the realms of language, representation and economy. Taking Kabul as the panoramic ground of profound social and epistemological transformations, the dissertation traces a crucial shift beginning in 2011-2012, from a highly speculative war economy (a “green zone economy” that privileged the commodification of language and culture and the privatization of war, with crisis as an alibi for governmentality) to one based on equally speculative practices of prospecting for natural resources in the Afghan underground: where an estimated three trillion dollars’ worth of copper, gold, iron-ore, marble and oil & gas is presumed to lie in wait.
I illustrate the nuanced epistemological concerns and political contestations that stem from an Afghan effort to distinguish between sources of violence and sources of economic value (especially in the aftermath of Kabul’s demilitarization) in a milieu where foreign militaries presuppose that civilians and insurgents cannot be distinguished, except through the medium of war-time translation and collaboration.
The twin concern with generalized forms of death dealing and tragedy, on one hand, and the moral and political exigency for Afghans to distinguish between a world of appearances and one of essences (the Islamic and Quranic interpretation of zahir (exterior/surface) and batin (interior/ground), on the other, opens onto a set of epistemological concerns undergirded by several oppositions, which I argue, are central to American war making. I illustrate that the movement between these artificial binaries (Persian/Pashto and English, literacy and illiteracy, rationality and irrationality, repetition and transformation) inspires aspirational fantasy on an economic frontier and invests some Afghans (especially those who speak English and are literate) with the power of calculative reason (aql) and understanding (fahm and dânish), while condemning those who are illiterate (and sometimes those who only speak Persian and/or Pashto) to forms physical supplementarity and crisis--from literally being expendable prosthetic bodies (human body armor) to the breakdown of meaning in incestuous relations and the intensification of moral crisis.
In this context, conventional writing and the felt lack of its absence illustrate for us the logic of war in more consequential ways. The belief that writing is the domain of what can be known (rationally understood) and universally applied invigorates the ideology of literate persons and war-time collaborators with shocking breadth and tenacity. It organizes antagonisms between persons and structures forms of death-dealing.
I trace how the production of a binary around literacy and illiteracy produces, even in moments of technological acquisition, the retrospective fantasy that orality is not only the prior but also the locus of unfettered subversion and ignorance of the law. This misrecognition of linguistic diversity as lack comes to inform, in contexts of unprecedented transnational war-time activity, the charge that Afghans are beholden to an excessive localism that fuels the predicaments of the Afghan State and errors of judgement (such as incestuous transgressions, and suicide bombing) which would destroy society altogether. The issue of vulnerability to ideological suasion and excess emerges alongside these presuppositions. It informs the belief that the incapacity to exercise reason (due to illiteracy) renders Afghans vulnerable to diverse forms of propaganda and the inability to distinguish between the world of appearances (both technological media images and the Islamic notion of the zahir (surface manifestation)) and reality.
I trace these complexities through a series of intense contact points where these oppositions come into play and determine forms of access and violence 1) in translational contexts during combat missions where linguistic transformation results in deadly misunderstanding 2) in familial contexts and contestations over property, where the failure of interpersonal and extrajudicial mediation results in mass murder 3) in courtrooms where failed suicide bombers (who did not detonate out of technological error or because they were attacked by members of the Afghan National Police) are subject to the limitations of oral testimony and to the belief that photographic evidence proves that they will repeat their crimes if released from prison 4) instances of incest that arise out of illiteracy and, when exposed, generate moral crisis 5) the production of zones of exteriority and interiority (especially in Kabul’s Green Zone) that rely on phamakological inclusion and reproduce the literal supplementarity of Afghan bodies 6) the attempt to find the “real” sources of economic value as part of a multi-national gold and mineral extraction endeavor—the continuation of an obsession with the Afghan ground that has a long imperial history from the 1800’s onwards (when it was assessed through botanical, railway and coal prospecting missions).
Together, these sites and the consideration of the earthen terrain alongside the terrain of rationality and linguistic difference situate us in the midst of wartime catastrophe. They foreground the fantasy that rationalism is the sine qua non of modernism, and the belief that literacy is the basis for reflective and intellectual thought, and for being human.

BMW has standardized on a new technology unveiled by Nvidia, Omniverse, to simulate all aspects of its manufacturing operations in an attempt to push the framework come in simulating manufacturing twins that rely on digital twins. Their presentation, BMW and Omniverse in Production, provides a detailed tour of how the Regensburg plant has a fully functioning, real-time digital twin capable of simulating scale production and final planning based on constraints down to work order instructions and robotic programming on shop floor.
Improving product quality, reducing production costs and unplanned downtime, while increasing production and ensuring worker safety are goals that all manufacturers strive for, but rarely achieve consistently. Achieving these goals has much more to do with how fluid and real-time data from production and process monitoring, product definition, and store-floor planning are shared across production in an understandable format that each team can use.
Overcoming the challenges of achieving these goals motivates manufacturers to apply analytics, AI and digital twin technologies. At the heart of these challenges is the need to accurately decipher the enormous amount of data production operations generated daily. Getting the most out of data that any given production operation generates daily is the essence of smart manufacturing.
Definition of what McKinsey’s and WEF’s collaborations are today. In addition, McKinsey and WEF have set high standards in their definition of what a future factory is, as they provide ongoing analyzes of the selected group of manufacturers’ operations to customers.
According to McKinsey and the WEF, lighthouse manufacturers are scaling pilot projects for large-scale integrated production. They are also known for their scalable technology platforms, strong change management performance and adaptability to changing supply chain, market and customer constraints, while maintaining visibility and cost control across the manufacturing process. BMW Automotive is an opening member of the lighthouse manufacturing companies McKinsey and WEF, which were only identified after evaluating over 1,000 companies. The following graphic from McKinsey and WEF’s research provides a geographical overview of lighthouse manufacturers’ factory locations globally.
Above: McKinsey and WEF’s ongoing collaboration provides new insights into how manufacturers can continue to use new technologies to improve operations, add greater visibility and control across store floors, and keep costs in check. Source: McKinsey and Company, ‘Lighthouse’ producers show the way – can the rest of the world keep up?
BMW’s factories in the future
The four sessions that BMW contributed to during Nvidia’s GTC November 2021 conference together provide a plan for how BMW will transform its production centers into the factories of the future. The core of their plan is to get the back-end integration services right, including real-time integration with ProjectWise, BMW’s internal systems Prisma and MAPP and Tecnomatix eMS. BMW relies on Omniverse Connectors, which support live synchronization with each application on the front of their technical into scale so that their tech stack could scale and support analytics, AI and digital twin simulations across 31 factories.
Excel by customizing models in real time
How BMW implemented Nvidia Omniverse explains why they succeed with their future initiatives while others fail. BMW recognized early on that the different clock speeds or cadences of each system integrated into production, from CAD and PLM to ERP, MES, Quality Management and CRM, needed to be synchronized around a single data source that everyone could understand. Nvidia Omniverse acts as a data orchestra and provides information that any department can interpret and act on. “Global teams can collaborate using various software packages to design and plan the factory in real time, using the ability to operate in a perfect simulation that revolutionizes BMW’s planning processes,” said Milan Nedeljković, a member of the board of BMW AG.
Product customizations dominate BMW’s product sales and production. They currently produce 2.5 million vehicles a year, and 99% of them are custom-made. BMW says each production line can be quickly configured to produce one of ten different cars, each with up to 100 options or more across ten models, giving customers up to 2,100 ways to configure a BMW. In addition, the Nvidia Omniverse gives BMW the flexibility to quickly reconfigure its factories to accommodate new major model launches.
Simulation of line improvements to save time
BMW succeeds with its product customization strategy because every system crucial to production is synchronized on the Nvidia Omniverse platform. As a result, each step of adapting a given model reflects customer requirements and is also shared in real time with each production team. In addition, BMW says real-time production monitoring data is used to benchmark digital twin performance. With the digital twins from an entire factory, BMW engineers can quickly identify where and how each model’s production sequence can be improved. One example is how BMW uses digital people and simulation to test new workflows for worker ergonomics and efficiency and train digital people with data from real employees. They also do the same with the robot technology they have in place across plant floors today. The combination of real-time production and process monitoring data with simulated results helps BMW engineers quickly identify areas for improvement so that quality, cost and production efficiency targets continue to be achieved.
Above: BMW simulates robot enhancements using Nvidia’s Omniverse first before introducing them into production batches to ensure greater accuracy, product quality and cost targets are achieved.
For any manufacturer to succeed with a complex product customization strategy that BMW has, all the systems on which manufacturing depends must be synchronized with each other in real time. There must be a common cadence that the systems work with that provides real-time data and information that each team can use to perform their specific jobs. BMW achieves this today, enabling them to plan down to model-by-model configuration level in scale. They are also able to test each model configuration in a fully functional digital twin environment in Nvidia’s Omniverse and then reconfigure production lines to produce the new models. Real-time production and process monitoring data from existing production lines and digital twins helps BMW’s engineering and production planning teams know where, how and why to change digital twins to fully test any new improvement before it goes intoOn Sunday 16 September the Brisbane Modern Quilt Guild (BMQG) meet at The Hub, Mt Ommaney for its monthly meeting. The doors open at 10am for members to come together and sew. We sew all day until 5pm, so members come and go as they wish. There is a formal chat from President Fee at 1pm and show and tell at 3pm. The guild currently has 47 members.
This month was exciting because half the membership got name tags, which look fantastic.
In October the BMQG has a stand at the Brisbane Craft and Quilt Fair. So to decorate our stand we had a sew machine mat challenge. Members were very enthusiastic and we got about 14 sew machine mats. The requirements for the sew machine mats were 12″ x 24″ and we had to use the Modern Quilt Guild colours. We had one member who didn’t like those requirements and made a very modern sew machine mat which was round.
Our meetings always end with show and tell. below are some pictures of our very talented members.

Ultrathin films of two perylene dyes, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylicdianhydride (PTCDA) and N,N′-di-n-butylperylene-3,4,9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (C4-PTCDI), have been grown on the (001) faces of freshly cleaved single crystal, NaCl, KCl, and KBr. Tapping mode AFM studies of these materials show that their crystalline motifs vary widely depending upon the substrate and growth conditions and that a form of layered growth is observable in the first few monolayers of deposition for both dyes. Nucleation of these crystalline deposits at edge sites on these substrates appears to be central to the growth of the first monolayers of these materials. Luminescence spectra for both PTCDA and C4-PTCDI, captured in situ during the growth of the first 1-4 monolayers of material, show the presence of a monomer-like entity during the initial growth stage. For PTCDA thin films this luminescence signal decays rapidly as nucleation of the crystalline film occurs. As film coverage is increased, luminescence of ultrathin films of both dyes is dominated by emission from one or more excimeric states. For C4-PTCDI/KC1 (001) the monomer-like emission does not completely disappear during the first monolayers of film growth, suggesting a degree of disorder sustained on a distance scale of a few molecular units at the grain boundaries and edges of the crystalline regions. The relative ratio of monomer/excimer emission of C4-PTCDI on KCl (001) is strongly temperature dependent and changes reversibly as the temperature is cycled between room temperature and 100°C. The luminescence intensity for thin films of both dyes on all of the substrates investigated is enhanced in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, consistent with previously reported declines in the dark conductivity of these materials as they are taken from UHV to atmospheric environments.

The Nomad to Sefton (Allenby) has told me by email that if my initial allegations re the Dillabaugh case were proven either Allenby or Ellerton had to go. If it is the former the shares are suspended and won’t come back. If it is the latter the sole witness for Sefton in its libel trial against me will have resigned in disgrace. So I have won. I gather that the Sefton board is meeting this afternoon so, one way or another, the AIM career of Hawaii Jim is almost over.
I have already popped over to the offices of uber expensive bully boy City lawyers Pinsent Masons , champagne in hand, to record two short videos and when they go live that will be it from me.
Publicly I have put a brave face on this battle and on the Sefton dirty tracks campaign. But it has been a strain. I fear that there is not a cat in hell’s chance of me getting my costs back. Would I want to do this again or would I rather spend time with the bird, take up fishing again or do a bit of what I really want to do (goat farming)?
My priorities going forward are the restaurant, the UKInvestor Show, my partner (the deluded lefty) and my family, notably my step mother and ageing father - not necessarily in that order. As such the 666 shirt of investigative financial journalism united is (temporarily) retired. After today I shall confine my public comments on shares to my premium Nifty Fifty website. If you want to know my thoughts on shares pop along to Real Man Pizza and buy me a salad or subscribe to the Nifty Fifty
Shareprophets has 20 writers including younger investigative stars such as John Crawford and Ben Turney who I shall advise, if asked, but for now that is it from me on shares. The younger guys will take the battle against the AIM bad guys forward. I have a book to write (on Sefton), articles to write for this website on West Ham, Greece and other really important matters and a life to lead.
Thanks for your support since this battle commenced. My 36 hour drinkathon now continues and anyone who fancies coming along to Real Man tonight after 6 is more than welcome.Creek Canopy

Creek Canopy
Creek Canopy is an observatory deck that provides users an intimate experience with Boulder Creek. Special attention was given to the form and progression of the structure to seamlessly integrate it with the surrounding environment. The form is derived by environmental characteristics of the vegetation on site. The diagonal support structures and facade coincide with the natural irregularity of large trees and thick vegetation respectively. A narrow entrance and expansive gathering area mimic the feeling of walking through the natural vegetation screen. The progression leads to a spacious overhang above the creek, revealing natural space encompassing the tree canopy and micro climate of Boulder Creek.

My daughter Mandy always loved music. She was one of those kids who could remember all the lyrics of her favorite songs, and she had a nice singing voice. It wasn”t a surprise when she became a standout vocal talent in high school.
At the graduation ceremony (in 2006), she was recognized as the top female vocalist, and a couple months later she arrived at Colorado State University to study music education.
Sometimes life progresses along just the way you would expect. My daughter knew what she loved doing, was really good at it, and now had the opportunity to pursue it with her whole heart. No one knew how it all would turn out, but she was on her way. A new phase of her life”s journey had begun.
But it didn”t last long.
Before the end of her first semester, the change became obvious. At first she was having problems hearing the lectures. Before long she could not hear most of the piano notes. Our little girl was going deaf. She lost 60 decibels within the first three months. Within eight months it was closer to 110. From September to May, the fabric of her dream continued to unravel. By the end of her first year, the dream had died.
Perhaps the saddest moment came at the end of the second semester. The music students performed their freshman recitals. Mandy stood with her hand on the piano and watched the lips of others to keep in time. I looked across the room and saw Mandy”s voice teacher, a CSU professor and close friend. We were all holding our sadness in place behind supportive smiles: a tender hypocrisy. When her final song was completed, her fellow students offered a deaf applause (shaking upheld hands) and an embrace. That was that! She left Colorado State in mourning, depressed and believing she would never sing again.
Angry, Not Bitter
She could have become bitter, and she certainly was angry””angry with God. Like Job, she wanted to make sense of the situation. Why did God give her such a wonderful gift if she would never be able to use it? Like Job, she needed to stay on the path (live faithfully), without understanding the plan (how God could use her life, albeit differently than what she imagined).
And that is just what happened. In time, Mandy realized that God”s gift, the music, was inside of her. If you check on Wikipedia you will now find an entry for Mandy Harvey, an American deaf jazz singer. After losing her hearing, she became a professional jazz vocalist.
Her website () presents the long list of places where she has performed, including twice at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and the three albums she has created. Her story is intriguing because it is one of despair, doubt, endurance, and eventual joy.
And inside the story you will find the challenge of the book of Job: Will you continue to trust and love God even when there is nothing in it for you?
Joe Harvey serves as associate professor at Johnson University Florida in Kissimmee.
Nice story about overcoming adversity, but the whole story is predicated on the false idea that God has a specific plan for us. He doesn’t. God wants us live like Christ and be led by His words regardless of physical circumstance, abilities, or dreams. That’s the lesson of Job too.
We received this comment from Renee on June 7:
“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope” (Jeremiah 29:11).
For those who trust Him with their lives, He does have plans that incorporate our plans . . . that’s how big He is.
I’m not sure why the other commenter is taking issue with this story, saying, “God wants us live like Christ and be led by His words regardless of physical circumstance, abilities, or dreams. That”™s the lesson of Job too.” As far as I can tell, that’s what Joe Harvey’s point was when he wrote, “And inside the story you will find the challenge of the book of Job: Will you continue to trust and love God even when there is nothing in it for you?”
I guess some people just need to be contrary to feel smart.
As a musician who went to Conservatory to study classical performance, I can relate to so many details of her story. Mandy, you are a beautiful woman, so inspiring…. helping so many others to get up and move through the unexpected changes in their life plans. That is the embodiment of faith. Trusting the Lord even when it hurts and you can’t see….. or hear. â¤Activities

Those 10- or 12-hour days may simply be unworkable once children are in the picture. Whether you’ve already started your family or you’re just starting to think about it, you may want to consider finding a family-friendly job with flexible work options.
“Flexible work options” is an overarching term for all sorts of work styles that are more flexible than a traditional 9-to-5 office job. Things like remote work (a.k.a. telecommuting or working from home), flexible scheduling, part-time work, freelance or contract jobs, and alternative schedules all fall under the flexible work umbrella.
Here are four ways to find a family-friendly job with flexible work options:
1. Pinpoint companies that support work-life balance and flexible work.
When it comes to supporting work-life balance, not all companies are created equal (as you may well have discovered in your own career!).
To find companies that may support working parents, start looking for companies that promote work-life balance and flexible work options. FlexJobs has been compiling a database with over 40,000 companies that have offered flexible work options.
Start your search by checking out companies you admire, products and services you use on a regular basis, or companies in your area. You’d be surprised at how many might offer flexible work options for employees.
2. Use the best keywords to find family-friendly jobs.
The keywords you use to search for jobs online can help you locate family-friendly jobs amid the millions of job listings out there. Instead of simply searching for WHAT you want to do for work—job titles that match your career interests—include keywords that describe HOW you want to work.
If you want to work from home, use keywords like “telecommute job,” “remote job,” “distributed team,” and “virtual job.” Avoid phrases that scammers use like “work from home” and “work at home.” If you’re looking for a flexible schedule, search keywords like “flexible schedule,” “flexible hours,” and “alternative schedule.”
For part-time work, search for keywords like “part-time hours,” “half-time hours,” or specific hour ranges like “20-30 hours per week.”
And for freelance or contract jobs, those are some great keywords to start with. Also try searching for “project” and “temporary” jobs.
3. Consider the most flex-friendly career categories.
At FlexJobs, we track over 50 career categories to see which career fields typically have the most flexible jobs. And while all of these 50+ career fields do contain flexible job listings, some career fields offer more flexible work options than others.
The top 10 career fields offering flexible jobs are:
- Medical & Health
- Customer Service
- Administrative
- Sales
- Computer & IT
- Education & Training
- Accounting & Finance
- Project Management
- Retail
- Software Development
4. Learn from other working parents who’ve found flexible jobs.
When we hear from successful job seekers who’ve found flexible jobs, we want to know how they did it, so we can share their best tips with you.

My parents never liked it and I don't either. My parents expected better and I tried to deliver (and neither Catholic nor Jewish moms are any match for Mormon moms in imposing guilt). In age, I fall between Governor Romney and President Obama and I think I knew guys in high school just like both of them:
While far from any prep school culture, the three public high schools I attended all had good-looking, fun-loving guys who loved to joke around like the young Mitt is above (and to the left). No pictures have yet surfaced of his "fun" with the gay kid he went after with scissors to cut his hair. I was the kind of kid that got picked on sometimes, apparently without regard to any sexual orientation. And I didn't like hanging out with guys who did that sort of joking around.
Truth be known, I knew and hung around with some guys who, while maybe not quite as cool as the young, future President appears (above and to the right), did engage in similar activities. I could say like Clinton that I never inhaled. But as this is true confession time, while I never smoked pot or even tobacco, I just might have experienced a touch of vicarious high from smoke in the air that was around me - and that was in the bathroom and gym floor of a high school dance I attended. (The early-70s were an era of declining enforcement of standards in student behavior). I can clearly describe the sickly sweet smell of pot as I recently did to my 15-year-old son, whom I believe when he tells me he has never smelled it. I had at that age. I would like him to be prepared.
People complain about our failures to "vet" political candidates while others claim we are digging too deep - there are few who can withstand the scrutiny of a life without something embarrassing coming out. We are imperfect human beings after all. The important thing is which direction we are headed, away, or deeper into our mistakes.
I'm not really sure where this is going except to reveal my discomfort with Romney's pranksterism even with his apology for whatever happened in that one incident he doesn't remember too well. Perhaps I am more comfortable with Obama's youthful weed smoking which he freely admits and regrets in his autobiography published some years ago. Make your own choice in the matter.
Oh, and me in high school? Co-editor of the school newspaper - classic nerd.

Boys Will Be Boys!
Anonymous/M I don't know about Mormom moms being better at giving their kids a guilt trip than Catholic or Jewish moms. Maybe my French DNA messes things up a little. I remember vividly changing the sheets on my teenage son's bed and pulling out a Playboy magazine (in the 70's, they were way more genteel than even the present soft porn). The poor kid was mortified to find me sitting cross-legged on his bed reading some of the articles aloud and laughing my head off. He wailed tearfully, "But Mom, you're the bishop's wife. You're SUPPOSED to be mad at me!" To spare his feelings, I didn't put this comment in FaceBook since he is less likely to read this blog (he made a joke once about being from Slytherin, so I am not positive about that).
Well, I probably should have kept my mom out of it. But I did have a big dose of guilt that saved me from some trouble. I think you dealt with your situation very well.

Since the beginning of the year, an average of only 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of flower has been sold per month via prescription.

With total sales in 2020 below 40 kilograms as of the end of August, the Czech Republic will likely end this year with a total market of less than 75 kilograms – unless the current linear growth trend drastically changes in the coming quarter.
The country continues to be a minor player in the European cannabis industry, and expectations that insurance coverage would prompt significant growth have not yet materialized.
Moreover, the latest data shows that:
- The number of patients decreased from 1,103 in June to 998 in August.
- Sales fell from 6,050 grams in July to 5,494 in August.
Since July 1, new regulations mandate that doctors provide information to the State Institute for Drug Control (SUKL) on the results of medical cannabis treatments using an anonymized form.
The Czech survey, which includes information on adverse reactions and treatment outcomes, resembles a process in Germany.
Since the beginning of 2020, Czech patients have been entitled to insurance coverage on 90% of the retail price for 30 grams of flower per month for medical use, regardless of THC content.
In exceptional cases, doctors may authorize quantities exceeding the monthly limit of 30 grams for reimbursement, but the limit cannot exceed 180 grams per month.
What happens in practice, however, is far different: Roughly 1,000 patients receiving cannabis treatment in the past month have had access to about 5 grams per month each on average.
As Marijuana Business Daily previously reported, bureaucratic hurdles and limited participation in the medical marijuana program by doctors and pharmacies represent challenges that were not resolved with the introduction of the health insurance coverage scheme.
Elkoplast Slušovice remains the only domestic producer.
The latest harvests made available by the company were 7.2 kilograms in May and almost 5 kilograms at the end of July, according to the State Agency for Medical Cannabis (SAKL).
The rest of the supply is imported mainly from Canadian producers Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis.

The countdown to the Sydney Spring Racing... in a beautiful condition just behind the leaders Leebaz and Fat Al.
Shinn angled Streama off the fence coming around the turn and she responded well when asked for an extra effort to run past Leebaz and hold off the fast-finishing Junoob who worked home strongly down the outside of the field.
Trainer Guy Walter has suggested that Streama may be retired to begin a career as a broodmare, but Shinn said after the race that he was not thinking about the future and just wanted to relish the moment on one of his favourite mares.
“I can’t tell you how special this is,” Shinn said.
“To everybody involved, the whole stable and Guy Walter and more so the horse.
“She has been around for a long time and she has been the flag bearer for Guy’s stable for a number of years.
“It has been great to get another Group 1 against her name.
“It is up to Guy and the connections, but I think that it is just a matter of savoring the moment for what it is today and it is a very special moment.”
Shinn has developed a very successful partnership with Streama in the past 12 months, piloting the mare to victory in the Group 1 George Main Stakes (1600m) during the 2013 Sydney Spring Racing Carnival, and he said that he was very confident heading into the race and was just hoping to receive a bit of luck in running in the 2014 Doomben Cup.
“I was very confident, I galloped her on Tuesday and she just worked beautifully,” Shinn said.
“It is very hard to win Group 1s and you have to get the right run in transit, but I was able to position her third the fence behind Leebaz and I just stalked him the whole way.
“She has that grittiness, she is really determined and she knows where the winning post is.”
Walter was delighted to see Streama record another victory at Group 1 level and praised the consistency of the mare, who has had won a Group 1 in every calendar year since she made her racing debut back in 2011.
Walter said that he was still unsure whether Streama would head to the breeding barn and said that he could not have asked for a better ride with the five-year-old – naming her as one of the best horses that he has ever trained.
“I couldn’t preempt the owners there, but she has been a wonderful mare.
“She won the Keith McKay as a two-year-old and here she is as a rising six-year-old with a fourth Group 1 win.
“She has won black type races from 1200 to a mile and a half and she has never had an unsound day.
“It must be close to the end of her career and this is certainly a crowning moment of her career to win a race like this.
“She has had a lot of big moments, but it is hard to top today.”
Walter and Shinn have formed an extremely tight bond since the leading hoop made his as a jockey, comparing each other to family, and Walter was quick to pay credit to his stable rider.
The veteran trainer said that he was delighted with Shinn’s ride on Streama and acknowledged just how big an asset the Melbourne Cup winning jockey is to his stable.
“It was a wonderful ride; he had a awkward gate, but got her into a magnificent position and he is just such a good rider,” Walter said.
“He has an outstanding record on this mare.
“I am very lucky to have a rider of his skill and he is a great stable rider because he is very mindful of the fact that every horse is important and he will talk to me about a maiden horse like he will a black type horse.
“He is a very dedicated rider and he is absolutely top.Blogging is an on-line journal of discrete message access.

“Probate” is the legal process of administering a decedent’s estate – i.e., transferring ownership of the decedent’s property to (1) those named in the decedent’s will (devisees) or (2) the decedent’s heirs if the decedent died without a will (i.e., “intestate”).
The personal representative of the decedent’s estate is tasked with performing all the duties of settling the decedent’s estate including collecting assets, paying debts, distributing assets to devisees and/or heirs, filing final tax returns, and filing all requisite forms with the Massachusetts Probate & Family Court.
Further, there are times when a decedent’s estate involves real estate and the real estate needs to be legally transferred or sold.

A word of Welcome to Colaiste Ide College of Further Education It is always a difficult decision to know what area of study one wishes to pursue after completing one's full-time education. It is even more difficult, if having left full-time education many years ago to make that decision to return again and to take up where one left off. Coming up to the Leaving Certificate we are presented with so much choice and pressure to make a correct lifetime choice that it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what is the correct option to chose. Post Leaving Certificate courses have been developed with a view to providing students with options to study in their areas of interest and to either pursue those interests in Higher Education or to move directly to the workplace. They also provide mature students with a route that enables them to avail of a second chance education system that allows for the acquiring of new skills and re-acquaintance with skills acquired at an earlier stage in life.
The system of assessment used by the QQI Accreditation system enables students to be assessed on a continual basis rather than solely on an end of year examination which can give a more accurate reflection of a student's work and results. Colaiste Ide has been providing courses at this level since the mid 1970's and has developed a reputation for delivering effective and relevant career related courses. Over the years, students have achieved successfully achieved what they have come to the college to study and have moved on directly into employment or on to Higher Education Institutions.You want to go out with your friends, but your sense of independence and your impatience make you rather irritable.

General Aspects
Post-operative pain is greater after plastic surgical procedures that involve muscles being either cut or divided. Placing an implant or expander beneath the pectoralis major muscle, for example, is much more painful than placing an implant in front of the muscle.
The same principle applies to autologous breast reconstruction. A Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap involves cutting and removing a piece of the rectus abdominis muscle, whereas in a Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator (DIEAP) flap the muscle fibres are simply separated to gain access to the perforating (feeding) blood vessels. TRAM flap reconstruction usually therefore causes more post-operative pain than a DIEAP flap, in which the pain is described as being either low or moderately severe. For any procedure in which part or all of an abdominal muscle is sacrificed, it may be necessary to wear an abdominal binder for a prolonged period of time.
Wound healing is normally complete within the first three weeks. There may be a feeling of tightness where tissue has been removed, for example in the abdomen following a DIEAP flap, or in the chest, after an implant has been inserted, but this is normal and will gradually ease off after the first two months.
Breast reconstruction usually requires a recovery period of between four and six weeks. If your work involves only light duties, such as administration, you may be able to start back again sooner. However, anyone performing heavy manual work should take the full six weeks recovery.
Postoperative Care
Every patient who undergoes general anaesthesia is admitted to the recovery room after surgery. Specialized medical and nursing personnel are available there to monitor and take care of you. The recovery room may contain several patients at any one time and can be busy. You may need to remain there overnight or in an adjacent side room equipped to deal with patients requiring continuous medium or high dependency care.
In recovery, your general condition and breast reconstruction are assessed. If you have undergone microsurgical free tissue transfer, regular monitoring of the flap takes place and is of the utmost importance. Your nurse will initially check the flap every hour, both visually and manually to evaluate blood flow. The earlier a problem is detected, the higher the chance of a successful outcome. This regular monitoring interferes with sleep and your first night after surgery is quite restless.
When you wake up in the recovery room you will also notice the following:
- Your chest is covered with a retractable blanket, so that your reconstruction can be easily assessed.
- Intravenous and / or intra-arterial catheters: usually two intravenous catheters are placed in the arm opposite to the side of the reconstruction. These are used to administer fluid, blood (if required) and medication. In patients with a history of heart and / or blood pressure problems, an arterial catheter may also be inserted for more detailed monitoring. The catheters are removed once you start eating and drinking again.
- Gastric tube: this is introduced through your nose to drain excess fluid from your stomach and prevent reflux of gastric contents into your lungs. The gastric tube is usually removed before you wake up and only in exceptional circumstances, remains in place for the first 24 hours.
- Urinary catheter: this measures your urinary output and is also placed for your convenience. This catheter is removed when you are able to walk to the bathroom, approximately 48 hours after surgery.
- Blurred vision: protective ointment is applied to your eyes during surgery. It may cause some blurred vision but this usually resolves within hours.
- ECG cables*: used to monitor your heart function and rhythm.
- Blood pressure cuff*: this regularly inflates to record your blood pressure.
- Pulse oximeter*: a device placed on one of your fingers or toes to measure the amount of oxygen in your blood and your pulse rate.
- Oxygen: may be temporarily administered via your nose or mouth if, as a result of the anaesthesia, your own breathing is insufficient.
- Compression stockings: to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, special antithrombotic stockings are worn for your entire hospital stay. In addition to the stockings, you will receive subcutaneous injections of low-molecular heparin once a day. For reconstructions involving gluteal or thigh flaps, specific compression underwear is put on at the end of your procedure.
- Calf compression pumps: are used if you are at high risk of deep venous thrombosis and / or pulmonary embolism. These are removed once you can mobilise.
- Drains: a number of plastic tubes are placed at the site of your breast reconstruction and at the donor site. These remove any excess blood or fluid that accumulates in your wounds. The drains remain in place until the fluid output is minimal, which may take several days.
- Positioning: you will be placed in a sitting (DIEAP flap) or flat (gluteal or thigh flap) position following microsurgical breast reconstruction. Positioning is not as critical following implant based reconstruction. You will immediately be encouraged to move your arms and legs to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The day after surgery patients are asked to get up and sit out of bed
- Pain: everyone’s pain threshold is different but post-operative pain is usually minimal. Almost always, it can be controlled with simple analgesia such as paracetamol. If you experience pain, you must inform your nurse. Higher doses and more potent drugs can be administered if necessary.
- Diet: no food or drink is allowed on the morning of your operation. You may however rinse your mouth with water. Post-operatively start with sips of water or clear non-carbonated drinks and then build up to a normal diet as you feel able.
- Bowel movements: morphine containing medication administered during your anaesthesia may cause post-operative constipation. If this becomes problematic, stool softeners can be given to stimulate bowel movements.
- Other medication: you may be given additional drugs intravenously or orally depending on your recovery. Any normal medication can be restarted after a few days but always check with your nurse or surgeon before doing so.
- Flap monitoring (autologous tissue only): this is performed clinically. The flap color, consistency, temperature and capillary refill are all regularly assessed. The flap and surrounding skin temperature are compared using special skin adhesives that detect any change. Flap monitoring is initially very frequent: every hour during the first post-operative day, every 2 hours during the second post-operative day and every 4 hours during the third post-operative day. In the event of any change in the flap, you may need to return to the operating room to solve the problem.
* Removed when you leave the high dependency area.
Once at home
Please do not start smoking once you go home. You run the risk of compromising the blood flow to your breast reconstruction and developing complications.
Your biggest enemy will be fatigue. This is due to a combination of wide surgical undermining, prolonged anaesthesia and a reduced number of red blood cells in your circulation. Your operation has created large wounds underneath your skin that need time to heal and this requires a lot of energy!
We recommend that you listen to your body and periodically take some rest throughout the day. Do not drive or perform strenuous physical activity for the first 6 weeks of your recovery. Also try to arrange some help around the home. It is important though that you remain mobile and continue light exercise or short walks.
Everyone recovers at their own pace but it generally takes between 2 and 5 weeks. After 6 weeks, you will be able to resume most daily activities such as, housework, your job, sport and normal sexual relations.
DIEAP flap reconstruction patients should not lift objects that weigh more than 2 to 3 kg (a handbag or small household object) for the first 6 weeks. This prevents a rise in intra-abdominal pressure and tension on both the internal and external wounds.
For gluteal or thigh flap reconstruction patients, the weight lifting restriction is less severe. You must however not put too much pressure or tension on your donor site scars. Cushions can be helpful to prevent this during the first few weeks of your recovery.
Avoid direct pressure on your breast reconstruction at all costs: do not place heavy objects or tight garments (a bra or clothing) around your breast and do not lie on the flap itself. Touching the breast is however completely harmless.
You may experience emotional instability and mild depression following this type of surgery. Please share these feelings with your breast care nurse or plastic surgeon. Although these feelings are usually transient, professional support can be arranged, if required.
The area around your breast(s) and donor site will remain swollen for 6 to 8 weeks as a result of fluid accumulation (oedema). This can lead to difficulty finding clothes that fit but be patient, as it will gradually resolve over the next few months.
If you notice an increase in redness, temperature, swelling or pain at your breast reconstruction or donor site, please immediately contact your plastic surgeon. Fever or any other unusual symptoms should also be reported as soon as possible.
Post-operatively, 2 or 3 out-patient appointments are scheduled, to check your wounds and assess progress. The subcutaneous sutures dissolve themselves and do not need to be removed. The skin glue will peel off after 2 to 3 weeks. There is normally no need for bandages or additional wound care. If you do have a problem with wound healing, your plastic surgeon will provide precise instructions on the type of dressing required.
Approximately 48 hours after surgery you will be allowed to shower. Avoid soap containing fragrances or dyes and rubbing the wounds. Keep showers short and do not take a bath for the first 4 weeks. When finished, you can dry your skin with a towel or cold air from a hairdryer. Avoid hot air as your skin sensation may be temporarily reduced following surgery and you can inadvertently burn yourself. Once the wounds are healed and the scabs have fallen off, start moisturising your scars with a hypoallergenic lotion or cream.
Remember to eat a balanced diet, containing plenty of calories, minerals (especially iron) and vitamins. This is not the time to diet! Healthy foods include red and white meat, fresh fruit and vegetables. Do not hesitate to contact your plastic surgeon’s office, if you have any questions or concerns.
Six months after your primary surgery, a second surgical procedure is frequently arranged to adjust the shape and volume of your breast reconstruction, revise scars or perform nipple reconstruction. If necessary, the contralateral breast can also be augmented, reduced or lifted.
In the long-term, you will be regularly followed-up by members of the specialised multidisciplinary breast care team (breast surgeon, oncologist and plastic surgeon). Final adjustments can be made to your reconstruction to optimize the aesthetic result. Your General Practitioner also plays an important coordinating role and can help with many basic problems and questions.:[ad_1]

ISTANBUL - About 5,000 protesters clashed with about 2,000 policemen in downtown Istanbul in Turkey on Saturday evening.
An eyewitness told Xinhua that police used water cannons to disperse thousands of protesters gathering in Taksim Square.
The protesters condemned the closure of Gezi park, chanting " open park, belonging to the public."
However, the police did not let the protesters enter back into the park which has been cordoned off since last week.
Only nine members of the Taksim Solidarity Platform were allowed to lay flowers in the memory of three demonstrators and one police officer who died during the three-week-long nationwide protests.
While some protesters started to leave the square, others regrouped at the Istiklal Avenue which intersects with Taksim square.
Amid the nationwide demonstrations, the Taksim Solidarity Platform has demanded the fulfillment of their conditions put forward during talks with the government.GS-801 Medium To Large Size Lamp

Box Editor 1.0
Box Editor 1.0 Description:
Box Editor - For the first time, Apago's Box Editor software is a low-cost plug-in to Adobe Acrobat that allows advertisers to easily set accurate "bleed and trim" dimensions or "boxes" to define the size of an ad. PDF/X files have been widely adopted for advertising workflow. But, the bleed and trim data required by the PDF/X standard often contain incorrect information leading to costly mistakes and lost time. To place ads on pages and impose pages and spreads efficiently, publishers need PDF/X files from advertisers with accurate data in bleed and trim boxes.
The software allows advertisers to import and export bleed and trim data in the new XML format to create a "Library" of ad specifications for different publications. Box dimensions can be entered as decimals (2.25) or in fractions (2 1/2). A powerful Grouping feature allows the advertiser to position both the trim and bleed boxes at the same time.Box Editor is a tool that allows you manipulate ad content in PDF/X Files.
Box Editor also includes unique capabilities that act as a control panel for digital ads. Publishers can see PDF/X-specific information including Trapping status and OutputIntent values. The "Vue/X" mode automatically configures Acrobat to view PDF/X files correctly. With one mouse click, Publishers can delete all of the content outside the trim or bleed area removing unwanted registration marks and "slugs." The Fonts and Colors tabs can be used to quickly identify all the fonts and colors that were used in the ad.
Apago's open XML format makes it easy for publishers to publish their ad specifications on their websites, enabling advertisers to easily download the XML file and import it into Box Editor software.
Currently, advertisers or their prepress providers visit each publication's web site, print the specifications for reference and manually enter the bleed and trim sizes to create a template page in a layout program such as QuarkXPress or Adobe InDesign. The new XML format allows all of the specifications for each publication to be in one downloadable file, thereby avoiding data entry errors.
Although XML is well suited to the task of exchanging ad specifications, previous attempts were complex and not widely implemented. The new Box Editor allows both a standard way for publishers to supply the bleed and trim data, and a simple and inexpensive software tool that allows advertisers to import that data and easily manipulate it within a PDF/X file.
Box Editor 1.0 Requirements:
· Adobe Acrobat 5 or later.

How does the SynAck ransomware use Process Doppelgänging?
A technique called Process Doppelgänging was used by the SynAck ransomware to bypass security software. Expert Michael Cobb explains how this technique works and why it's unique.
Kaspersky Lab detected ransomware called SynAck that uses Process Doppelgänging. What is this technique and what does it mean for ransomware threats?
The Process Doppelgänging technique was first introduced in December 2017 by security researchers at the endpoint security firm enSilo. The researchers demonstrated how it can use process hollowing to circumvent security software by exploiting how it scans for malware and interacts with memory processes.
Process hollowing is the creation of a process for the sole purpose of running a malicious executable inside it. A process is loaded in a suspended state, but then elements of memory are replaced with crafted code and the process resumed, fooling the system and any security software into classifying the process as legitimate and safe to run.
Up-to-date antivirus tools can detect attacks leveraging process hollowing. However, although Process Doppelgänging utilizes process hollowing, it's harder to detect and defend against, as it leverages a Transactional New Technology File System (TxF) to roll back any processes it has altered into legitimate states, leaving no trace of the attack behind. TxF integrates transactions into Windows New Technology File System, which makes it easier for application developers and administrators to gracefully handle errors and preserve data integrity.
Process Doppelgänging masks a malicious executable by making changes to an executable file that is never committed to disk by overwriting a legitimate file in the context of a transaction. A section of the transaction is overwritten with code that points to the malicious app, which is then loaded. This creates a process based on the modified executable and enables arbitrary code to run in the context of a legitimate process.
As the malicious process is launched from the transacted file, it appears to be legitimate when it is checked by security software. And, because it doesn't require the creation of any files during the process, antivirus products may have a hard time detecting it using signature scans.
Kaspersky Lab has already discovered a variant of the SynAck ransomware using this circumvention and detection technique to greatly improve its stealth and infection capability. The new SynAck variant checks the status of an infected machine against a hardcoded list of countries and languages. Attacks have been recorded in the United States, Kuwait, Germany and Iran, so SynAck is most likely targeting specific user groups. There is no doubt that other hackers will upgrade their malware to make them undetectable.
Implementing Process Doppelgänging does require advanced technical skills and knowledge -- but that isn't in short supply in the cybercrime industry. As this attack technique exploits fundamental features and the core design of the process loading mechanism in Windows, it can affect all versions of Microsoft Windows. Microsoft may not move to address this issue, though, as it is not a vulnerability, but an evasion technique that leverages Microsoft's transaction technology.

President Xi Jinping, making the first visit to neighboring Nepal by a Chinese president in 23 years, said on Sunday that China appreciates Nepal's stance of upholding the one-China policy and other core interests. He also said that any attempt by separatists to split China will be in vain.
Xi made the remark during a meeting with Nepal's Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli in Kathmandu.
Those who engage in separatist activities in any part of China will be smashed into pieces, Xi said, adding that external support for separatists will be seen by the Chinese people as delusional.
During the talks, Oli reaffirmed his country's support of China in safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Noting that Nepal firmly backs the one-China principle, Oli said his country resolutely opposes any use of its territory to engage in anti-China separatist activity.
Xi called on the two countries to further connect their development strategies. China supports Nepal in developing its economy and improving its people's livelihoods, Xi said. He also emphasized the importance of jointly building the Belt and Road, saying the two countries should speed up the process of boosting interconnectivity.
The two countries should take improving cross-border roads into consideration, initiate a feasibility study for building cross-border railways, gradually open more ports, increase direct flights and enhance cooperation in telecommunication, Xi said.
The two sides should also make more efforts to promote trade and investment and push forward the China-Nepal cross-border economic cooperation zone, Xi said, adding that China would like to help Nepal develop hydropower.
The two countries should enhance people-to-people exchanges and promote communication in such areas as education, tourism and local government, Xi said. China will continue to offer a helping hand for Nepal's reconstruction after the devastating earthquake in 2015, he added.
Xi also stressed the importance of enhancing law-enforcement cooperation, fighting terrorists and cross-border crimes and jointly supporting multilateralism and free trade.
Oli congratulated Xi on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Noting that China has made remarkable progress in the past decades, he said China's development represents an important opportunity for Nepal.
Xi's visit was a historic moment for the development of Nepal-China relations, Oli said, adding that Nepal's people were excited to host the Chinese president.
Noting that Nepal and China are real friends and partners, Oli said that the two countries have always respected and supported each other with no interference in the other's domestic affairs.
After the talks, the two leaders jointly witnessed the signing of cooperation documents covering such areas as interconnectivity, trade, investment and border management.
Xi arrived back in Beijing on Sunday night, wrapping up his three-day South Asian trip, which also took him to India..

Unveiling YunnanIntroduction
Always the correct amount of feed with minimum work and energy: this is the principle of the Lely Vector. Cows and their natural behaviour also came first when developing the Vector. When cows are out to pasture they can eat all day; now they can also do that in the barn.
With automatic feeding you not only save time: you can also remove feeding entirely from your daily routines. Your cows always have a fresh and properly mixed ration at the feed fence, meaning that they can eat several times a day. This stimulates the cows’ activity, ultimately leading to a rise in milk yield.Woods Contract Flooring (wcfservices.info)10 frederick street

Starting Wednesday night, the Virginia Department of Transportation will put up new signs raising the speed limit from 60 to 65 mph on a 9.5-mile segment of the interstate.
The stretch starts at Jefferson Avenue and ends a little east of Hampton Roads Center Parkway, according to a news release from VDOT spokeswoman Brittany Nichols.
The new signs will go up on the westbound side overnight Wednesday. Eastbound signs will be finished up Thursday night.
Nichols said the decision to raise the speed limit came after a traffic study of that stretch of road, looking at road conditions and crash data. The speed limit goes into effect as soon as the new signs go up.
Matt Jones, 757-247-7478, mjones@dailypress.comThere was a time when almost everyone who died in Middletown was buried. This tradition was so time-honored that few families considered any alternatives. Today Cremation in Middletown is just as common. Clients who want simple funerals often decide on cremation while pre-planning and the choice are common when funerals are delayed. It is also becoming common because funeral directors offer traditional services, followed by cremation.
Cremation Can Simplify Pre-Planning
Clients may pre-plan their own funerals when they want to control costs and get very specific services. Cremation in Middletown is often part of these contracts, especially when customers want very simple arrangements. Funeral homes typically include pre-planning information on their websites. When clients pay the site, a visit website information includes detailed cremation choices and checklists that make it easy to design custom funerals. Senior citizens and those who are very sick often order their own cremations in order to spare survivors from a series of decisions as they are mourning. Eco-friendly patrons choose cremation in order to help conserve land and eliminate the possibility of embalming fluid seeping into the soil.
Cremation Offers Flexible Choices
Families may choose to have relatives cremated when funeral plans need to be delayed. They often have the ashes returned to them in urns and then take the time they need to contact everyone and set a date for a memorial. Cremation is often a smart choice when funerals are being held far from the point of death. Although professionals do ship bodies for burial, it is much simpler and less expensive to transport an urn or box of cremains.
Cremation Does Not Rule Out Traditional Services
Because many cultures and religions have relaxed their attitudes about cremation, more families are including it in elaborate traditional services. Funeral homes can still embalm the body, arrange viewings and hold services anywhere that clients choose. Bodies are displayed in temporary, but beautiful, coffins. Once all services have ended, professionals respectfully transport and cremate the deceased and then return the ashes to survivors.
Funeral homes are arranging more cremations today than ever before. That is because the practice is affordable, simple and makes planning easier. It can also be adapted for very simple services or intricate ceremonies.Well, most of you are tightwads anyway. Rather than focus on the harm to craft that Tescos and/or Adnams are doing by flogging off small cans of beer cheap over 80% of you just see a bargain. Though as Mudgie points out what must be around half price the Adnams beer is the equivalent of £1.44 for a 500ml bottle so exactly sale of the century. And for those that were wondering it seems it was being discontinued.
As to the beer, it was fine. It had that unpleasant vegetal note you get in lager, but as that's generally expected I'm not complaining. I foolishly drank it after an American IPA though so any subtleties, and most of the dry hopping were lost on me.It is excellent homemade recipe for dinner.

How do you make a football out of an inflated condom, a plastic bag and a piece of string? Pay close attention to the opening scene of this colourful postscript to World Cup 2010 and you might just find out. Dudu (Eriya Ndayambaje), the Rwandan boy at the centre of Africa United, gives a Blue Peter-style demonstration, accompanied by a bravura speech about the benefits of prophylactics. It’s the kind of blatant propaganda that won’t amuse hard-line Catholics.
Writer Rhidian Brook has structured the story of orphan Dudu, his younger sister Beatrice (Sanyu Joanita Kintu) and middle-class soccer fanatic Fabrice (Roger Nsengiyumva) as a road movie. It begins in a village in Rwanda, where Fabrice’s “silky skills” catch the attention of a Fifa talent scout, who invites him to audition for the World Cup opening ceremony. Before you can say Cesc Fabregas, Dudu has bundled his “team” onto a bus, for the trip to Kigali. But their destination isn’t the Rwandan capital and they end up in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Dudu’s clanger is a game-changer that turns their adventure into a gruelling 3,000 mile trek to Johannesburg’s Soccer City.
When Hollywood takes a trip into the Dark Continent — The Last King of Scotland, The Constant Gardener, Disgrace — we often end up with movies that are filtered through the consciousness of white people. Africa United, the feature debut of director Debs Gardner-Paterson, is a UK/South Africa/Rwanda co-production, shot in three countries and with the emphasis squarely on the experience of young black Africans. Those hoping for a glimpse of Angelina Jolie or David Beckham hugging cute black babies should look elsewhere.
The film-makers wanted to get beyond the stereotypical portrayals of a continent ravaged by poverty, violence and disease. Dudu is both a self-appointed leader and a flamboyant story-teller who bolsters his companions with a parallel narrative about their journey, which unfolds in a series of animated sequences. Brook’s screenplay is strong on the kind of topical banter — football and Barack Obama – that will appeal to young audiences, who will also share the travellers’ sense of wonder at the breathtaking landscape. Africa United rolls along with the help of Sean Bobbitt’s sparkling cinematography, Victoria Boydell’s innovative editing and a bold mix of African and European music.
But there are also serious issues here, highlighted by the group’s stop at an HIV testing centre, and encounters with teenage soldier Foreman George (Yves Dusenge) and former sex worker Celeste (Sherrie Silver). This is where the limitations of the actors – particularly the boys playing Dudu and Fabrice – become painfully obvious. Their delivery is wooden and they lack the subtlety to draw us into the traumas experienced by their new friends. Similarly, there are a couple of explosive scenes – one involving a thug played by Tsotsi’s Presley Chweneyagae — that fail to generate any sense of peril. At least Dusenge wordlessly conveys some of the inner turmoil resulting from his own “rumble in the jungle”, but Ndayambaje’s relentless chirpiness soon begins to grate.
Rabbit-Proof Fence and Slumdog Millionaire have their flaws, but they also leave audiences with strong feelings of revulsion, pity and disbelief at the cruelties and injustices inflicted on children. Africa United aims for a lighter approach, which is no bad thing, but it also focuses exclusively on a journey, with no subplots or substantial supporting roles for more experienced actors. That’s a risky strategy when the performers are not skilled enough carry you through the emotional rollercoaster that such an extraordinary trip must entail. There are underwritten cameo parts – Fabrice’s mum, a saintly nun, a gruff South African security guard — that might have given the film more dramatic weight if they’d been given more room to breathe.
Africa United packages its messages about teamwork, loyalty and friendship in an engaging, family-friendly plotline. No-one should leave the cinema without knowing how much fun you can have with an inflated condom. But like the England team at the World Cup it lacks the depth or quality to make it all the way to the top.
(Africa United is showing as part of the BFI London Film Festival, on 17 and 20 October.)

Nice! I reviewed the documentary “Africa Unite” a couple of years ago and I had to do a quick reality check when I saw your review, thinking at first that a sequel had been made.
I read recently that South Africa is the place to make a tax-friendly movie these days, as Bulgaria was a while ago. I hope this means that we’ll be seeing more and learning more about the continent, and that that will engender more responsible social engagement like that of the Gates Foundation.OK, these are my favorites (don't tell the other earrings...they're so sensitive!)

We closed PACK OF Lies on March 8th. And by the 13th we were being told to stay home.
I remember that same weekend being so disappointed that a friend's show was canceled. And the thought was - yes, we can lay low for 6 to 8 weeks or so.
Here we are. So many of my artist-friends not able to perform, sing, act, play - do the art they've dedicated their lives to. Some are going so far as ...to move from the large cities, where they can no longer afford the rent. Some had established themselves in one aspect of show business or another, a lifetime of work, only to have it all disappear.
I'm doing alright because I'd been supporting myself with temp work as of late. In a smaller town. My heart goes out to all those who are making the hard choices right now. In other countries, artists were supported to take time off. Workers of all stripes were paid - to take time off. If only...
I decided to take a painting class at the end of last year. A form of art I've been able to keep at. And I just keep re-upping for a weekly zoom class. Plein aire, tonalism, abstract landscape. It's been sustaining my artist/self. Here's one of them. I hope to do more.
Excited to head up to Bethel today for an invited tour and reception for the Maine Gem and Mineral Museum. It opens to the public on 12/12.

Looking forward to being on stage with Good Theater in Feb/March of next year with the incredible drama PACK OF LIES by Hugh Whitemore.
Based on a true story. What do you do when you discover your best friends and neighbors turn out to be Russian spies? And what do you do when Scotland Yard wants to set up a sting operation in your house to catch them?
"This is a play about the morality of lying, not the theatrics of espionage, and, in Mr. Whitemore's view, lying is a viru...lent disease that saps patriots and traitors alike of their humanity." - New York Times
"Absolutely engrossing... an evening of dynamic theatre." - New York Post
Presenting - a beautiful piece about women photographers in Idaho, with my voice as Jane Gay.
Thrilled to be giving voice to Jane Gay, photographer of the Nez Perce. I'll keep you posted when it's complete!
Happy Summer, everyone!
It's so green here. And the lilacs are all in bloom, some outside my kitchen window. Heaven.
Thrilled (I really am!) to announce I'll be doing a show in Good Theater's next season in Portland, Maine - with all the fabulous folks there. More to come....
Also, I've been hired by a PBS affiliate in Idaho for a piece they're producing about Emma Jane Gay, an American photographer. I'll be reading her letters and diaries.
From the Wiki page - Emma Jane Gay was an American woman who devoted her life to social reform and photography. She has become most notable for her photographs of the Nez Perce, which she took during a federal expedition led by American ethnologist and anthropologist Alice Cunningham Fletcher.
And lastly, our PortFringe show open in 2 weeks! LIGHTING MARTHA by Carolyn Gage - you can purchase tickets at this link.
Looking forward to working on the play Lighting Martha by Carolyn Gage with PortFringe this June.
And I'll be doing voicework on some short horror pieces with Bill Dufris in Portland. How fun.
And also, coming up in May a workshop of a new play... More details about that soon....
I'd say moving to Portland Maine has been a good thing for my career. Such an amazing community here.
It appears that it's been ages since I wrote a post. Thanks, FB for reminding me that I haven't been busy as an actor!
And speaking of which... I'll be transitioning out of NYC to a smaller city soon. Looking forward to this, as I jokingly, lovingly, achingly say that "I moved to New York City to stop acting". But it's the (sad) truth of it.
Not much of a joke, in the end. I've been acting in many forms, voice, stage, some TV, since the late 90s - and don't intend to stop y...et! So I'm moving on.
Here's a photo of that younger me doing some wild theater-when I was first in LA.
I'll be in touch, and hopefully about a fun project or other.
And I'm here! Still kicking in the Big Apple. Mostly just watching some incredible stagework from the sidelines these days. (Three Tall Women, and the like) One of these days I'll jump back on the boards.
Recently did a narration for the big bang, and stars and planets - an interactive museum exhibit. I love this work! Intimately talking about he creation of the universe - nothing like it.
A friend just snapped this from my first TV gig (thanks, Robyn C) which was, incredibly and crazily, SEINFELD.
How many years ago?? I should be a professional by now, right?
My upcoming show in NYC. 10 Performances only!
The Play I am producing- here is the flyer. Next will be The Cellar FB Page - stay tuned!
Tickets are selling quickly!
Come join us tomorrow night in NYC for an evening of music, trivia, and theater. I'll be reading a sweet 10 minute play.
A lovely fellow named Jason Norman interviewed me for his book on horror films for my work on DEEP DARK - Behind the Screams! Here's a link -
Here's to old friends and keeping in touch!
I'll be doing a theater production in NYC in June. An old friend who was a casting director in LA wants to produce. A nice thing - to be asked to do a show. It hasn't much happened here in NYC thus far.
I'm so looking forward to being on stage again!...
(oh, and it's going to be 67 degrees here in NYC today - how crazy is that??)
Maybe I'll be a producer now!
Would you come see a sci-fi play based on a comic book that had strong (and fun) female protagonists, and was set mostly in a spaceship?
Facebook keeps reminding me I should write something on the page. Which, in turn, is a reminder of how much is no happening in my performing life of late.
So I'll write about that, FB.
Lately I've been trying to figure out how to exist in a world of my own creation where I don't act, do not have the opportunity to do my work....
This has been my challenge.
That, and just making enough money to live in this crazy, expensive city. I've just about got that down, but it's been 5 years, and the toll has been that it's taken so much of my energy and time resources to do so.
So, not much to talk about.
Except for the fact that I miss working. I miss being on stage, which is what I think I do best.
I'm getting to see some shows, like THE HUMANS.
With this one, I actually woke up having had some pretty crazy dream. The feeling of unease and darkness below the surface (and literal) came home with me, it seems. That's what I love about the stage, it enables the audience to feel something, in that moment, a shared experience.
Shared experiences are not the norm these days. We have our own little, insular worlds we create. Keeps us safe.
Still, it's fall, and it's a gorgeous day. I'm grateful for having the chance to live here. When I let myself be open to it, not let it get to me, it's a pretty effing amazing city, and world to behold..- Size: 7'10" x 4'5" ft (238 x 133cm)

Why People Seek Therapy
“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.”
Maya Angelou
People seek therapy for all sorts of reasons – for support with relationship issues, stress, low mood, anxiety, trauma; to work through loss in its many forms; for support during times of transition; for help in working through unresolved business from the past. We can wind up feeling stuck, as though we have lost our flexibility for responding to life’s challenges, falling back on old patterns of behaviour - which may have helped in the past, but now don’t seem to be bringing satisfaction. Family and friends are a great resource, however, we sometimes need somebody independent of our familiar support system to work things through with. Having the space to tell our story is so important, as is being heard in that process, by an attuned therapist.
With the right support, I believe we all have the creativity within us to develop more satisfying ways of meeting the demands of our daily lives, so that we can move forward more rewardingly.

Making the law more fair, more wise, better balancing freedom and authority, better reconciling individual and societal interests, better resolving competing interests among the citizens whose lives and conduct it regulates.
Yes, chief judges are also administrators. More than that actually. They are the chief executives of the judicial branch. And a chief judge who is a poor administrator, a poor executive--or a poor delegator of administrative responsibilities--will not likely be successful in advancing initiatives to improve the organization, internal operations, personnel administration, and intergovernmental relations of the judicial branch.
But the primary and most critical function of the judiciary is adjudication. The primary and most critical function of a judge is deciding cases. On a court of last resort such as the Court of Appeals, the primary and most critical function of the judges' is to resolve those legal issues which are the most important. Not to the parties alone, but to society at large. And the primary and most critical function of a chief judge is to lead the court, to lead the judges, in making the fairest and wisest decisions in resolving those legal/societal issues.
A great chief judge must be a great judge and leader, who enjoys the highest professional and personal respect of his/her colleagues. Someone who thus evokes the best from them in collectively rendering the best decisions and who, as a result, creates a great court. A court which is viewed as great, not just by sycophants from the bench and bar and academia, or at official bar functions and graduations, or in official and semi-official publications. But one which is viewed as great by detached observers, by courts elsewhere which are influenced by its decisions, and by the next generation that is much better off because of those decisions.
A chief judge doesn't have to be the most brilliant judge on the court. Doesn't have to be the best judge period. But he/she must be a great enough judge to have the highest respect of even a more brilliant judge. And by dint of that respect as a judge, be able to lead--even that judge. Not administer. Not organize. Not be the comptroller. Not be the executive director. Ok, yes, all that too. But that's secondary at best. The great chief judges are first and foremost great judges.
For example....
Benjamin Cardozo was a great chief judge, and his court a great one. He and his court moved the common law forward, improved the law in so many areas in New York and influenced its development throughout the country. We remember him and his court as among the very best in the nation's history for that reason. He was a great judge who led his court to render great decisions.
Likewise, Irving Lehman was a great chief judge because he was a great judge. Like his predecessor and dear friend Cardozo, Lehman was a legal realist. He understood the role of the judiciary and the nature of judicial decision-making. He too was held in the very highest esteem by his colleagues. New York and the nation are the beneficiaries of his and his court's decisions--freedom of religion and state constitutional law among the notable areas. He was a great judge who led his court to render great decisions.
Stanley Fuld was a great chief judge and his court a great court, because he was a great judge. Perhaps no judge in Court of Appeals history--with the possible exception of Cardozo--influenced so much development in so many areas of the law, and was so admired by both state and federal judges nationwide as he. From employment law, to rights of the accused, to freedom of the press , to conflicts of law, etc., etc., Fuld's opinions advanced the law in New York, influenced its development in other state courts, and even served as guideposts for the United States Supreme Court when it began to protect individual rights vigorously under Chief Justice Earl Warren. Fuld was a great judge who led his court to render great decisions.
Speaking of Chief Justice Warren, what about the great chiefs of the Supreme Court?
Same thing. They're the great judges who lead their courts to render great decisions. And if Earl Warren and his court were too liberal for your taste, let's consider both liberal Warren and conservative William Rehnquist. Both were very strong chief justices because both were very strong judges. They enjoyed the admiration of their colleagues and, thus, were able to lead their courts to render great decisions. [Alright, if you didn't like one of those chief's and his court, let's just call those decisions very consequential.] Warren led his court to render decisions which vigorously--expansively--enforced individual constitutional rights. Rehnquist led his court to render decisions which effectively trimmed what some viewed as excesses of Warren's court. Agree with them or not, both were great chiefs. Even their ideological opposites on their courts thought so. Both these chiefs helped make their courts strong and led them to render consequential (ok?) decisions.
Now the opposite you ask? Let's just consider the chief justice in between Warren and Rehnquist. Warren Burger. Very few would accuse him of having been a strong, let alone great, chief. Very few would regard the court he led as strong, let alone great. The reason? Burger was not a particularly strong judge. He didn't enjoy much respect from his colleagues as a judge. Indeed, he was viewed by his colleagues--as well as by those who studied his court--as among the weakest, if not THE weakest, judge on the court. Not surprisingly, he was unable to lead the court effectively. Unlike the Warren and Rehnquist courts, the Burger court vacillated and waffled and, like its chief, is almost uniformly viewed as having been weak and undistinguished.
And yet, Burger was an active and energetic administrator. He devoted himself to governing the federal judicial branch. He is responsible for countless administrative initiatives. Probably no chief justice since William Howard Taft in the 1920's was more involved and more devoted to judicial administration than Burger. But unlike Taft, because Burger was not a great or even particularly strong judge, he was a weak leader of his court which, in turn, was undistinguished.
Oh, and one more thing about the great chiefs. Warren and Rehnquist and their courts are known and will be remembered because of their decisions. Not because of administration. Ask anyone who thinks that Warren and his court were great. Not one will say because Warren was a great administrator of the federal judicial branch. Same for Rehnquist.
And the same in New York judicial history. Ask anyone about Cardozo and his court. Lehman and his. Fuld and his. No one will say those chief judges were great because they were great administrators.Free Download MOD APK Android LastCraft Survival

Picture the scene: you’re in your house, minding your own business, when all of a sudden you look out into your backyard and see a carpet python hanging from your roof.
Not only is the giant snake dangling there, but it’s actually in the middle of a tasty snack. Well, tasty to the snake at least – to you it’s just plain terrifying.
That’s exactly what happened to one unsuspecting family recently, when they witnessed a huge python devouring an adult-sized possum right outside their Australian home.
Snake catcher Stuart McKenzie was called out to the house on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland early on Wednesday morning, May 13, after its residents spotted the snake slithering along their roof.
On his arrival though, the 30-year-old heard a ‘commotion’ and was shocked to see the 6.5ft snake hanging from the family’s roof with a large ring-tailed possum hanging from its mouth.
Not wanting to disturb its meal, Stuart waited for an hour to let the python finish ingesting the possum. ‘I knew if I tried to take it away right at that moment, it would likely drop its food and not want to eat it again,’ he explained. ‘It’s just nature so the best result is that the snake gets it food as it is already dead.’
It was while he was waiting that he decided to capture a time-lapse video of the incident, as well as a number of pictures showing the python at various stages of its meal.
The snake catcher explained:
It took about an hour to eat it completely, so I just sat with the residents while we watched and waited for it to be done with its meal. The people at the home were very good about it and were pretty intrigued by the whole thing.
After the snake had finished its meal, Stuart transported it from the family’s home and released it into nearby bushland ‘a long way away from homes’ so the python could digest its meal in peace.
‘He will have found a nice and warm spot to stay warm and digest that huge meal over the next week,’ the snake catcher explained.
Pythons are non-venomous snakes, and so catch their prey by wrapping themselves around the animal and crushing it to death before swallowing it whole.
This particular snake was able to consume the large possum because pythons’ jaws are able to unlock to stretch around larger creatures. Welp, rather them than me.

Impact:
Hyperinsulinaemia (excess levels of insulin circulating in the blood relative to the level of glucose) is thought to be the primary trigger for:
ovarian ‘cysts’ and infertility;

What's the next step:
Dietary and supplements.
No refined carbohydrates and a reduced total carbohydrate intake – use low GI foods (< 50) instead;
Chromium increases insulin sensitivity:
Magnesium: - Plasma magnesium is inversely related to insulin sensitivity;
Population studies show that a high daily magnesium intake is associated with a lower
incidence of type 2 diabetes, and low serum magnesium with a higher incidence.
PCOS women have significantly lower serum and total magnesium;
Omega 3 EFA’s improve insulin sensitivity:
Omega 3 EFAs are incorporated into the phospholipids of cell membranes;
High levels of omega 3 EFAs improve insulin sensitivity and insulin transport through

All that remains is whatever you’re listening to, allowing you to enjoy your favorite songs, podcasts, or eBooks without distraction.
We're maintaining a separate list of the best noise-cancelling earbuds as well, but our picks below represent the greatest ANC headphones across any form factor. Over-ear headphones can aid the noise-cancelling effect by forming seals around your ears, though in-ear buds can still deliver high-performance ANC, just in a more portable package. Whichever you prefer, you’re sure to find the right pair in our best noise-cancelling headphones picks below.

- Save with the best cheap noise-cancelling headphones
Black Friday and Cyber Monday headphone deals
If you're looking to save big for the holidays, check out our Black Friday headphones deal page and bookmark our Cyber Monday deals hub, too. All the major brands are offering big discounts, include Bose and Sony. In fact, you can find the class-leaking Sony WH-1000XM4 for as low as $248.
The best noise-cancelling headphones you can buy
The Bose 700 may have more powerful active noise cancellation, but the Sony WH-1000XM4’s incredible overall performance and lower price makes it the better value. Everything that made the WH-1000XM3 a critical darling remains intact, including the phenomenal soundstage and touch controls that allow for seamless playback and call management. Having the ability to personalize audio via the Sony Headphones Connect app is awesome, letting you create your own sound profiles or pick from multiple fine-tuned presets that lend themselves well to almost every music genre. You’re also getting top-tier ANC that gives competitors a run for their money and lets you enjoy longer playtimes than any Bose model with the feature enabled.
Sadly, the call quality isn’t great, which has been a reoccurring problem for the Sony Mark series. But to the WH-1000XM4’s credit, this is the only legitimate complaint that can be made about Sony’s flagship headphones.
Read our full Sony WH-1000XM4 review.
An argument can be made for the Bose 700 being the best overall noise-cancelling headphones that would bring up some compelling points. There is no denying that Bose has the strongest, most effective active noise cancelling technology on the market. Period. The Bose 700 reaps those benefits, boasting 10 levels of ANC that can be adjusted in the Bose Connect app and works flawlessly to silence the majority of external sounds. Most importantly, the 700 achieves this without compromising sound quality, allowing listeners to enjoy clean, well-balanced sound reproduction. Bose’s companion app also lets you adjust the EQ for personalized audio.
And what’s not to love about the headphones’ ultramodern design? The slim, sexy silhouette of the 700 is as much of an engineering feat as Bose’s ANC performance, and the high price point should certainly make you believe it. But we need to address the elephant in the room – battery life – a field where many other models in the category outperform the 700.
See our full Bose 700 review.
The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds is the king of the wireless ANC earbuds. Think of these earbuds as the wireless in-ear variant of the Bose 700, offering much of the same functionality to deliver unbeatable ANC performance, and that is with half the mics. They come with 10 levels of ANC that can be adjusted in the Bose Connect app, which also blends with an ambient listening mode to allow full awareness of what’s happening around you.
A new software update introduces new ANC profiles that were engineered for specific activities and places, as well as Aware Mode, which automatically reduces “loud distractions as they happen,” returning to full transparency mode when they pass. Sound is warm and clean, though call quality is the product’s unsung feature, producing excellent clarity on both ends.
Aside from the bulky design (both earbuds and charging case), the only thing holding Bose’s flagship earbuds from perfection is the middling battery life. A single charge is rated at 6 hours, but that number drops quickly to 5 hours when factoring in the listening modes and heavy streaming. The charging case only offers an additional 18 hours as well, a major letdown when seeing how huge it is.
Read our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review.
The latest entry in the QC over-ear series is the best yet, welcoming several improvements, including better active noise cancellation, sound, and battery life. ANC is as effective as it is on the 700, blocking out nearly 90 percent of ambient sound at a high rate. Bose’s ambient-listening mode (Aware) does a fantastic job of piping in external sounds for increased awareness. The combination of proprietary TriPort acoustic architecture and a volume-optimized Active EQ gives these headphones a refined, well-balanced sound signature to enjoy most music genres. Having 24 hours of ANC playtime is also huge, considering all the older Bose models only give you 20 hours.
Not being able to turn off ANC means the battery will drain more quickly, plus the absence of some features found on the 700 and QC35 II might have you hesitant about choosing this model over the others. Well, just know that the ANC, sound quality, and battery life make up for any shortcomings.
The older model Bose QuietComfort 35 II is currently on sale for just $199 at Amazon, saving you a whole $150.

Although there’s only one level of active noise cancellation on the ultra-premium AirPods Max, it works like a charm. The cans do a great job of blocking out ambient sounds, especially at the lower end of the frequency spectrum. It’s almost as good as Bose’s ANC, which is a fine showing for Apple’s first pair of over-ears.
Elsewhere, the AirPods Max sound great, especially with the surround-sound spatial audio feature switched on, and there design standards and build quality are so high you can almost forget that these headphones cost $549. That’s a lot more than the Sony and Bose headphones higher up the list, so this is a luxury purpose, but can very much be a worthwhile one.
See our full Apple AirPods Max review.
When the WF-1000XM3 launched, it set the standard for active noise cancellation on wireless earbuds. What would Sony do for an encore? Release an even more advanced version that trumps the original and other category leaders in several areas, including ANC, battery life, design, sound, and touch controls. Sony tweaked its noise cancellation to better deal with louder frequencies and rumblings, while also completely silencing common disturbances in home and office environments.
Audio remains unbeatable with the WF-1000XM4 given a more dynamic, well-defined sound profile ideal for all music genres, video content, and other media (e.g., podcasts, eBooks). The plethora of features in the Sony Headphones Connect app opens the lane to personalize your listening experience, from the multiple well-engineered EQs to spatial audio via 360 Reality Audio for immersive 3D sound. A full charge gets you 8 hours of ANC playback, some of the highest in the category,
The revamped design is sleeker and more practical than its predecessor, though the fit is looser this time around.

Another premium ANC option is the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 Carbon Edition. These over-ear cans has the fine craftsmanship to challenge even the AirPods Max, and they sound superb. A beautifully wide soundstage delivers big-sounding songs magnificently, but it's just as capable with more detailed, intimate-sounding tracks.
There's no customizable EQ, but it doesn't feel particularly necessary, and ANC is highly effective as well. There's also a very cool Soundscapes feature that adds in various nature sounds, adding a relaxing touch when you need to chill out for a while.
See our full Bowers & Wilkins PX7 Carbon Edition review.
The first-gen OnePlus Buds were a notable entry in the audio space for the Android mobile manufacturer, but their noise-cancelling brethren have already left an even greater impression, rivaling the AirPods Pro in aesthetics, ANC, and audio. A more premium design with a dual-tone finish and aluminum plating, alongside IP55 water-resistant protection for the buds and an IPX4-rated charging case, show OnePlus can create buds that complement their high-end smartphones. The 11mm drivers produce well-balanced audio with substantial frequency range to enjoy a nice blend of lows, mids, and highs. Three-level ANC is also impressive, filtering noise levels almost up to 40dB.
Then comes Warp Charge technology to generate 10 hours of use on a 10-minute charge, which you’ll be grateful for since ANC playtime is shorter than advertised.
Read our full OnePlus Buds Pro review.
The AirPods Pro land on our list of best noise-cancelling headphones because these ANC earbuds blocked noise quite well in our testing, whether we were commuting or walking around New York City. It's also easy to activate the ANC with just a long press on the earbud stem. And for those times when you need to be aware of your surroundings, there's Transparency mode that lets ambient noise in so you can listen to music and listen to the world around you. The latest iOS 14 update brings new features like automatic switching and spatial audio, which creates 3D-like sound for listeners, into the mix.
The AirPods Pro offer a very comfortable and secure fit, which you can personalize thanks to three sets of included silicone tips and even a fit test you can run on your iPhone. And these buds are great for working out, as the AirPods Pro offer sweat- and water-resistance. The battery life with noise cancelling on is only 4.5 hours, but you can 24 hours of juice through the wireless charging case.
See our full Apple AirPods Pro review.
How's this for an ANC headphones bargain: great sound, a modern and flexible design, ample features, a useful app, a full set of accessories and the best battery life in its class, all for $149? That's the Cleer Enduro ANC, currently the #1 spot taker on our best cheap wireless headphones list.
The Enduro ANC isn't perfect — there's a fair bit of wind noise in ANC mode, and it's seemingly made with smaller ears in mind — but there's no arguing about the incredible value for money. Cleer's noise-cancelling headphones are particularly good for travellers, as we got a superlative 50 hours and 15 minutes of ANC playback in our testing.

Take the Beats Studio Buds’ body, add wingtips and all the AirPods Pro’s coolest features, and you get Beats’ best wireless earbuds to date. The Fit Pro is an excellent workout companion that produces better clarity and punchier bass than Apple’s flagship buds, plus it comes with Spatial Audio to enjoy 3D-like sound when listening to select tracks on Apple Music, watching movies or jumping on FaceTime calls. Five of the six mics are use during calls, which, along with a voice accelerometer, helps isolate vocals for interference-free voice and video chats. We also appreciate the updated design, granted wingtips were the only real change, but they reinforce stability when performing lateral-heavy exercises.
Despite operating on the H1 chip, these buds lack a few features found on current AirPods models, including Adaptive EQ and Enhanced Find My mode. The Android app doesn’t offer much extended functionality either. Besides those complaints, the Fit Pro is a top-tier product for both fitness and casual music lovers.
How to choose the best noise-cancelling headphones for you
Active vs. passive noise cancellation
The first item to check off the list when shopping for the best noise-cancelling headphones is active noise cancellation, which shouldn’t be confused with passive noise cancellation. What are the differences?
ANC uses advanced circuitry and microphones to pick up noise signals and create inverse waves that cancel out these sonic disruptions, whereas PNC physically isolates high-pitched sounds through the headphone design and materials. Most headphones advertised with noise cancellation are categorized under ANC.
Battery life
Noise-cancelling headphones have a reputation for sucking up lots of power, so you’ll want a pair that holds a charge long enough to get you through a long business flight or weekly commutes. ANC wireless headphones can typically offer anywhere between 15 to 40 hours, while noise-cancelling wireless earbuds are usually rated for 4.5 to 8 hours.
Sound quality
ANC technology can compress sound and reduce dynamics, which may affect audio performance when turned on. In some cases, you’ll notice a background hiss when listening to music. However, there are noise-cancelling headphones out there that limit these disruptions to deliver full, crisp sound.
Design
Design is just as important when selecting the best noise-cancelling headphones. Over-ear headphones tend to give the best noise cancellation, though some of the more recent Bluetooth on-ear and in-ear models are proving to be just as effective.
How we test noise-cancelling headphones
We've judged the best noise-cancelling headphones on several factors: audio performance, battery life, Bluetooth range, call quality, comfort and fit, and the effectiveness of the noise cancellation. We also weigh special features, such as included apps, and how easy they are to use.
During the testing phase, our reviewers wear each pair of headphones for 2 hours at a time throughout the course of a week, to test comfort over time.
ANC, meanwhile, is tested in both indoor and outdoor environments where ambient sounds are produced at high levels. This includes airplanes, city parks, convenience shops, offices, and public transportation. ANC headphones programmed with transparency modes are also tested thoroughly to determine how well the listener can hear their surroundings.
For sound quality, we listen to many sample tracks that span a number of genres, including hip-hop, rock, jazz, classical and R&B, while evaluating volume, clarity and fullness. And now that more streaming music services are offering high-resolution resolution audio, be sure to read our audio codec FAQ for everything you need to know about FLAC files, MP3s and everything in between.
Once we complete our testing, we rate headphones based on our five-point system (1 = worst, 5 = best). If a product hits nearly every mark, it’s awarded an Editors' Choice badge.

I would like the noise cancelling headphones, not to listen to music, but to block out all noise, so I can concentrate and study, and to tune out background noise while at work. My question is, re this headphones, must I listen to music/audio in-order to tune out all noise? If I do not want to hear any sound - including music - is that possible ? or the headphones silence works only to tune out noise while listening to audio?
Also, which one is the best re no noise AND no white noise OR hiss?
Thanks in advance.
I use noise cancellation in the same scenarios as you are looking for help in (blocking noise while working or concentrating on studies).
TL;DR: Bose QC35s work best for me. They're comfortable enough for all-day use, and have about the same noise cancellation as the best from Sony. I noticed a very slight hiss only from the Sonys when there was no music/voice playing.
I used Sony's 1000XM3 for a while, and also tried Bose's QC35, since they had the highest ratings for noise cancellation. What I found was that the Sonys seemed to do a ever-so-slightly better job at noise cancelling, but they just were not comfortable for long-term usage. I've been much happier with the Bose QC35s because I can wear them 10+ hours per day without any pain or discomfort. The headband of the Sonys would slowly begin to hurt after 2-3 hours, and the earcups were not as comfortable, especially the lower part that pressed a little to hard behind my jaws. These may sound like minor issues, but when you wear headphones all day every day to block noise, comfort becomes a big issue.
As for hissing, I don't hear any from the Bose, but I hear a slight hiss from the Sonys. If you get the Bose, be sure to update the firmware on them, because there was an older firmware that had issues with hissing.If your departure, transit and arrival point are not in the UK then you have nothing to worry about.
However if you are travelling to the UK with pets, or travelling between EU and UK with pets, then this is where the grey cloud of the unknown is.
Everything will be down to which one of 3 groups the UK will be placed in by the EU. Most countries run a 3 group policy. Group 1 countries are normally places like Australia, UK, Fiji, Ireland, Japan, Hawaii & New Zealand. This would mean rabies free countries, and isolated against rabies outbreaks. They tend to be islands.
Group 2 would be countries such as most of the EU, USA, Canada and some other islands such as Jamaica etc. These are deemed as rabies free with no reported cases in the recent past.
Everything else that is not listed or has no agreement goes in group 3.
If there is no agreement between EU & UK, the EU may at worse place the UK in group 3, which would mean pets would need to have been vaccinated for rabies, have a rabies blood titre test (RNATT) to back this up and for the test to be current. If pets don’t meet the requirements then it is quarantine. However Ireland complicates this as there is a land border between the UK and Ireland (EU) and the UK is committed to stay within the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement. On a positive note, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president has taken a personal interest in this issue himself being that he has his own dog who was formerly a rescue from Greece.
Time will tell what will finally happen but best bet is to make sure your pets rabies vaccinations are up to date and even get a rabies titre test RNATT done once every 2 years. At least this way you won’t have to wait months for your pet to travel if the worst case scenario happens. Also it is beneficial to have this document at hand if your are likely to travel elsewhere such as Australia, Singapore or New Zealand where this document is crucial.
Updates from reliable sources can be found at the below link. Until then we will continue in uncertainty, but to minimize the impact make sure your pet is up to date on his vaccinations and if you are likely to travel, get a rabies titre test done. Your local vet should help you do this.Years ago, there was a popular TV game show called \u201cTruth or Consequences.\u201d It required contestants to correctly answer questions or otherwise face a consequence \u2014 usually, a silly stunt, though sometimes producers surprised viewers with a tearful personal reunion like a soldier\u2019s return home. Bob Barker, one of the show\u2019s hosts, had a memorable sign-off: \u201cHoping all your consequences are happy ones.\u201d Given how much we doubt the presentation of \u201ctruth\u201d in our current era, Barker\u2019s sign-off got me thinking. For one thing, is truth still important to us, or is it a relic of the past? And for another, what are the consequences of our skepticism about what is told to us as \u201ctrue?\u201d \u201cHappy\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to follow. We have many data points to suggest we don\u2019t trust what we see or hear. As relates to government, a 2020 Pew study reports that across party lines, only 20% of U.S. adults trust their elected officials. Hence the joke, \u201cHow do you know if a politician is lying?\u201d Answer: \u201cHis lips are moving.\u201d And it\u2019s not just in politics that we\u2019ve become disbelievers. We used to trust our scientists. After all, science is steeped in research and facts. Today? Not so much. Again, Pew reports that in February 2020, only 51% of respondents hold a \u201cfair amount\u201d of confidence in scientists. COVID-19 has likely further eroded that percentage. So, by and large, we don\u2019t trust the government and are cautious regarding scientists. How does social media fare? An MIT study reviewed 126,000 stories spread on Twitter, where the study\u2019s reviewers characterized the stories as true or false based on six independent fact-checking organizations. What did the study\u2019s co-author, Sinan Aral find? \u201cFalsehoods travel farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth, in all categories of information, and in many cases by an order of magnitude.\u201d This probably helps to explain why only 35% of all adults trust the political news they get on social media (Pew, 2019). This sounds like another variation of the stale joke about how the politician. How do we know if social media is lying? It\u2019s sharing a story. It\u2019s one thing to feel a diminished sense of truth in the people and news sources around us. It\u2019s another to consider how lying has impacted our own personal behavior. Here\u2019s a seemingly innocuous example. How often do you use \u201cgotta go\u201d when trying to get off the phone when you actually don\u2019t \u201cgotta go?\u201d Usually, the sayer follows with a fake line, like \u201cGotta walk my dog.\u201d I will fess up to using this myself. Sometimes our lying has a humane aspect to it \u2014 what we often call a \u201cwhite lie.\u201d Maybe you\u2019ve engaged with someone who has particularly struggled during COVID-19, and you say something like, \u201cYou look like you are holding up well,\u201d when clearly they\u2019re not. I\u2019ve committed this one, too. The alternative of saying nothing and letting the silence hang or saying something truthful like, \u201cMany people are choosing to go gray\u201d does not seem any better. There are, of course, the lies we tell that have no possible social redemption. Constructing a false online dating profile with a PhotoShopped picture is an example. I am told some people even misrepresent their marital status. There is the deceptive practice of \u201castroturfing,\u201d where we cook up positive reviews of a product in large amounts to facilitate adoption, such as the case of fake book reviews. All this lying \u2014 in so many forms and degrees \u2014 might make us feel like the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who is said to have lit a lamp in broad daylight as he went about looking for \u201ca single honest man.\u201d Where will we find our single honest man? And what are the consequences are of living in a culture where being duped is assumed. Gone are the days where we did business on a handshake or said, \u201cI give you my word,\u201d and it was sufficient. The consequences of lying are steep and may go as deep as a loss of self-esteem, disillusionment in our future, and more fragile relationships. Perhaps Mark Twain\u2019s lighter but ever so true words can guide us, \u201cIf you tell the truth, you don\u2019t have to remember anything.\u201d Jill Ebstein is the editor of the \u201cAt My Pace\u201d series of books and the founder of Sized Right Marketing, a Newton, Massachusetts, consulting firm. She wrote this for InsideSources.com.Balfour Beatty US has secured a contract worth $140m to deliver two new educational buildings for Southwestern Community College (SWC) in North Carolina.

Date: 28th Feb 2020 @ 9:30am
The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes
Wow! The book displays along the school corridor have changed and they look ‘pawesome’. They all captured my attention and made me want to read every book that each class has focused on. This time my nose for a good story would ‘lead’ me to the book that Year 6 has been reading – The Highwayman.
There were so many objects on the display; a horse, a sword, a cape, a rose and some coins. This intrigued me as to what the story was about.
The story is about a Highwayman who is in love with a Landlord’s daughter (Bess) but the King’s men are after The Highwayman. The Highwayman wants to be with Bess but he knows he will put her in danger if he is with her. Does the Highwayman get to be with Bess? Do the King’s men capture the Highwayman or worse? I won’t spoil the ending, you will have to read it yourself to find out what happens.
To my surprise, when I started reading the book, it was a poem. In the poem were couplets (two consecutive lines that rhyme) metaphors (when an object is described as something else) and similes (when an object is compared to something else using like or as). These really brought the story to life and helped my little imagination create wonderful images of the story. My favourite part of the book was Alfred Noyes’ choice of powerful vocabulary and the way that these made the characters and the action even more dramatic. My least favourite part was when the author described one character as ‘dumb as a dog.’ I was quite offended by this as I’m quite intelligent, I can read books!
My favourite part of the display is the children's writing. They have written their own version of The Highwayman poem using the same structure and style as the author. The pride and care they have taken in their learning stand out and their poems are really enjoyable to read. Taking care and pride in yourself is very important, just look at my new haircut.
I really enjoyed this book and lookout for the next time I blog about one of the books on display.Thibaut Roussel, currently Operational Manager at Orange Technocenter, has a demonstrated history in the telecommunications industry.

‘I warmly congratulate the entire school community, the Principal, Tara Scott, the other teachers, Special Needs Assistants, Caretaker, Board of Management, Parents and most especially the Children of the School on there great efforts to achieve the second Green Flag in the space of two years,’ stated Councillor Feeley.
After the successful evaluation, two students, Roisin Flanagan and Cailin McGovern travelled with Principal, Mrs. Tara Scott to Dublin on the 23rd May to collect the Green Flag.
Present for the raising of the Green Flag by Ryan McGovern, the eldest student in the school and Darragh Flanagan the youngest student were the Board of Management, many parents and a wide section of the community in Glangevlin. Sean MacKiernan, Chairman of Cavan County Council, Cllrs Damien Brady and Maura Maguire-Lynch and Susan McVitty on behalf of her husband Cllr. Peter McVitty joined local Councillor John Paul Feeley at the ceremony. The sixth class children recited a specially composed poem to mark the event. Also present was past Principal Luke McGinley who continues to work with the school to foster the great tradition of music and song in the Glan area. Also present to help out the schools present crop of musical talent were some of the McManus Brothers, well known musicians and dancers and Jason and Sandra McGovern, all past pupils. Local TD, Brendan Smith sent apologies as he could not attend the event on a sitting day of Dáil Éireann.
‘The Green Schools initiative is a true demonstration of the National School at the heart of the community. The students brought what they had learned about conservation of energy, controlling litter and reducing waste to their homes and also to community building such as St. Patrick’s Hall, Glangevlin. It is occasions like this that show how much schools like Curravagh are at the heart of the community and why they must be protected into the future,’ stated Councillor Feeley.
The Board of Management and the Staff in Curravagh NS have been very proactive in promoting this project and in developing the school in recent year. They secured substantial funding to install solar panels and wood-pellet burning stoves which greatly reduced energy costs, further funding to improve the playground and finally a substantial grant to refurbish the school building, installing new electrics, doors and windows and other needed works.
‘Only last year, Brendan Smith TD, as Minister for Agriculture officially marked the completion of the refurbishment works. That was fitting given his huge involvement in securing the very substantial funding which brought this work about. I was pleased to work closely with him and the School Management to secure the needed funding. This investment prepared Curravagh NS building for many years and will, I hope allow it to prosper into the future. The fact that the recent investment emphasised energy conservation and fuel efficiency also helped secure the second Green Flag,’ concluded Feeley.The longer we work or live in a place, the more we accumulate. And the more we accumulate, the more cumbersome and time consuming it is to get around and find what we need. The same is true in the land of CRM, so the team at Tokara has been implementing a solution our clients love that ensures they have access to all the documents they need, right at their fingertips while at the same time enhancing the performance of their Pivotal CRM system – what could be better?
We see what we will call ‘attachment clutter’ everywhere — in nearly every Pivotal customer environment we work in. And we see some of the most extreme cases at client sites where the newest version of Pivotal may not yet be running. What exactly does it look like? It’s like a mountain of literally every conceivable type of file attachment the client has – PDFs, DOCs, XLSs and more – saved directly into their Pivotal database. With the passing of each year, the actual number of attachments increases, while at the same time the sizes of files themselves are morphing into space-sucking giants (think of the evolution and now, ubiquity, of high resolution image files or even video file sizes).
On the one hand, creating this ever-larger tome of information is critical to business success and ‘comes with the territory’ in any robust CRM software system that allows you to collect and organize diverse types of relevant data on prospects and clients, as well as all of the interchanges you’ve had with them. There’s no question that you have to have it all. But at some point, the size and weightiness of storing all of it in the Pivotal database itself can begin to impede overall system performance, as well as the speed with which the system can locate and retrieve files users are looking for.
That’s where the SharePoint Solution (AKA ‘Document Management Module’) comes in.
What if you could take all the attachments currently housed in your Pivotal database, relocate them to SharePoint, and have them all accessible from Pivotal with the click of a link? And what kind of performance enhancements would you see with your Pivotal system now running at full speed?
Tune in next week for details on how Tokara’s implementation on these projects streamlines Pivotal CRM performance and efficiency with a best practice SharePoint solution almost everyone would benefit from!
If you’d like greater detail on the performance benefits Pivotal CRM users are seeing as they migrate attachments out of their Pivotal database and into SharePoint, we’d love to speak to you. In the meantime, if you’d.05 SEP 2021

An illustrated presentation by Joyce Rosser, Haringey Friends of Parks ForumThe Wonders of Wood
At the Dusty Barn, we're getting used to the covering of sawdust on nearly everything we own and love creating pieces from furniture that would usually end up in the skip. Most of the wood we come across is the unloved and outdated pine furniture. It is a soft wood but surprisingly hard and perfect wood for carving out our designs.
People have been carving wood for millennia, and we are honoured to make our make in the world with our little homemade brand.
We have found a beauty of wood in its natural state, the grain visible and the knots adding real character. Whilst carving, we've fallen in love with it's smell! Our pine is also beautiful once stained, the grain appears less but the texture looks so much richer. With using the highest quality furniture paint, our signs are also stunning with a clean coating with the natural wood exposed underneath the carve.
Next on our wood odyssey, we had our 'Dusty Barn' logo made into a hand held branding iron which has meant we can mark each of our pieces with our name, our brand that we have grown so proud of. The smoke, smell and marks left by us with branding and carving complete our achievements.
We've all seen the thousand of pallet projects, where the wood still looks like broken, like rubbish, or even unusable, but with a lot of love and a cracking sanding disk we uncover the most remarkable pieces. It's been known that pallets can be made from anything from the standard Pine and Oak, to the more exciting Birch, Maple, Ash, Beech, Cherry, Walnut, Poplar, Willow, Linden, Aspen, Cedar, Spruce, Fir and even Hemlock. You can see the variety so clearly on our Home collection 'Heart piece' I really want one of these in every room in my house, we totally love them!

April 24, 2021
Unlike the former restaurant tenant at this prime Jeffersonville location, Upland has not disappointed! Craft beers, good appetizers, and even brunch!
We’ve been to Upland a few times now. Our first visit was their opening weekend and we dropped in for a quick drink and snack to finish watching The Masters. We asked to sit with a view of the TV, which also offered a Louisville skyline cand river view. For drinks, we had the classic Champagne Velvet and the Campside IPA. For a snack, we tried the whipped feta and honey. After eating this, I realized that feta cheese may be my favorite cheese.
Our second visit was for a happy hour drink after work. We sat at the bar and ordered the Patio Cat the Juiced in Time Hazy IPA. We also decided to have a snack and ordered the cornbread muffins. Patio Cat reminded me of a shandy and is certainly a drink that would be perfect for summer weather.
Our most recent visit was probably my favorite! We visited on a Saturday, sat at the bar and brunch was being served! We ordered the Egg Sandwich and B&G (biscuits and gravy). For drinks, we had the Upland Lily and the Campside IPA, again. The Upland Lily is Upland’s take on the Oak’s Lily. It was a great brunch beer. The fruity and tart flavors of the beer went amazing with the savory egg sandwich and fried potatoes!
The locations offers plenty of space and seating. There is an outdoor bar that will be opened in warmer weather, bar seating indoors, plenty of tables inside and patio seating outside. I’m certainly glad to have Upland Brewing Co in Jeffersonville, IN!
Cheers to many more beers here!“Soft Bark, bark, soft bark…simmering growl……simmering growl”….that is what I was hearing from Sadie and Daisy….yesterday morning. I had my back to the porch, feet up by the fire and was reading. It was just daylight outside. They had been fed, watered and let out to run around to “do their business” and were back inside lying on the floor…but kept looking outside.
I looked over my shoulder but didn’t see a thing. They became so annoying that I finally got up and took a long look outside. They were both sitting at the door….looking at the same place. I looked long and hard and did not see one thing so I sat back down and resumed reading telling them to “be quiet”. It wasn’t happening. It kept going. Their noises were twitching and an “idling growl” had become my music for the morning.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of annoyance, they went nuts and stood up. The soft barking turned into a “I’m gonna rip your face off” kind of bark. I got up and looked outside and there were 10 deer in our back yard. I let them out so that they wouldn’t wake the whole house up or tear my door up……..and the chase began. Thank God I didn’t have to run the dogs that day. God and the deer took care of that!
As I sat back down in my chair, I thought about how keen Sadie and Daisy’s eyes were. I had looked more than once to see what they were looking at and saw nothing. Nothing at all that was moving. I saw dead grass, dead trees and a few birds in the air but the dogs weren’t looking up?????? As I thought about it, I am not sure if they saw or smelled the deer. I am pretty sure they SAW what I could not!
Funny, at the exact same time, I was sitting and reading Mark Batterson’s book, “The Grave Robbers,” for the second time. He was making the point in the book about our vision. Sometimes because of the “law of familiarity,” we become accustomed to daily provisions given to us by a Holy God and we have lost our view of His daily miracles in our lives. This is what I was reading, “One of the truest tests of spiritual maturity is SEEING the miraculous in the monotonous.” He calls it, “in-attentional blindness!” Mark continues to point out this truth, “God has wired us in such a way that we’re hypersensitive to new stimuli, but over time, the cataracts of the customary cloud our vision. [We are looking, like me that morning, but NOT seeing.] We lose our awareness of the miraculous, and with it, the awe of God. ”
I encourage you today…think about what you SEE when you look in the mirror…and possibly what you are looking at but “NOT SEEING”. I think of what David wrote in Psalms 139:13-14, “You knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” And the call of Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1:5, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart…”
Today, I encourage you with this word…God sees when we don’t. HE has KEEN and sharp eyes. He even saw us before we were formed….and He has set each one of us apart to do and accomplish for Him. These things cannot be seen first, unless we choose to “Look through the eyes of our Creator”.
Trust HIM with the vision HE has for your life. Seek another set of eyes to ALERT you to what you are not seeing…even if you are looking…HOLY EYES have 20/20 VISION.Hi My name is Duane Weir, I am a Canadian Born and Bred.

As we look back with a sense of pride, we know that this journey was not without its scars. It had its hardships, its trials, its crucibles. Yet this adversity is what made us stronger. It tempered our resolve, it galvanized our mission. It made our people stronger.
As a blacksmith heats, cools, and hammers a shapeless bar into a deadly sword, the fires from the forge of the past decade cause us to reflect and respond as we push forth into the future. The branches of our identity today grow into something that is rooted in the changeless truths of our past. Those truths are:
We are forged through service
From day one the BTS mission has been to support the national defense and ensure a safer tomorrow for all of us, no matter if the arena is the battlefield, the boardroom, or beyond. Service is why we exist and if we don’t have that front and center, we’re going nowhere.
We are forged through combat
From our leadership teams to our downrange staff and veteran workforce, BTS has been forged in combat. This perspective makes the mission real for us in a way you simply can’t appreciate otherwise. It’s what drives us and what sets the stakes so high as we do our best work every single day, no matter the job.
We are forged through tenacity
The last 10 years have been a rollercoaster. For everyone. From sequestration to budget cuts to COVID, digital transformation, and nation-state attacks on our infrastructure. We have seen the threats up close and personal. From the existential challenges to the looming darkness of the adversary, we have confidence in the future because we’ve made it through the fiery furnace of the past.
We are forged through possibility
Good people with great ideas are truly the raw materials of innovation. BTS was born as a startup, an organization birthed with a mission in motion, evolving as we went. Yet what got us to today isn’t enough to get us to the future. It takes a constant hammering, heating, beating, and tempering to fight for the future possibilities that don’t exist in the present.
Growth is never easy. We don’t celebrate for the sake of celebration. We put credit where credit is due- on the people, partners, and support of our customers and community at large who have been with us through the peaks and valleys as we have become the BTS of today. This celebration will last a moment. But the mission goes on forever.
We have walked through the fires for a purpose. We are BTS.
BTS. Celebrating 10 years of service. 2011 – 2021

SEPTEMBER 11 WAS A DAY OFF FOR NICK MALTER ’87, a New York City firefighter assigned to ladder company 113 in Brooklyn. He and his wife, Jill, were listening to the police scanner after the World Trade Center was attacked when they heard an unprecedented announcement: the recall of all off-duty firefighters. More than anything else, this revealed the horrendous dimensions of the unfolding tragedy. When the couple went out to their front stoop, they were stunned to see stapled office papers descending through the air and landing at their feet. He hopped on his bike and went to work, Jill saying only, “Good luck.”
Laura Walker ’79, president of New York public radio station WNYC, looked up from a Brooklyn sidewalk to see debris floating down from the first impact. I’m going to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to get to the studio, she thought, her first impulses focused on the news story and the fate of WNYC’s FM antenna on top of Tower One.
Kofi Appenteng’s ’81 office was in Tower Two, but he was still at home in Connecticut when the phone rang. “Thank goodness you answered! You know why I’m calling?” said a client of his from Ghana. “No,” replied Appenteng. “Turn on CNN,” his client said. The screen lit up just in time for him to see the jet strike Tower Two.
At his firehouse Malter and 14 other off-duty firefighters gathered spare firefighting tools and first-aid equipment then ran out into the street to commandeer a city bus. By 11 a.m. they were on their way to lower Manhattan to join the on-duty companies from his department that had already responded.
“Both companies were there before the collapse,” he recounted. “Miraculously, no one was lost. They were in the building trying to rescue people but ended up rescuing themselves. They had the incredible luck of standing in the right place or running in the right direction as the building collapsed, so they survived.
“I was thinking, Okay, we’re going to do triage; we’re going to have bodies everywhere. I helped remove two victims alive that first day. Those were the only living victims I saw. I didn’t realize that there would be so few people I’d rescue.”
The world quickly learned what Malter knew: for the most part, rescue would not be part of the story of September 11. After the shock came the confusion, the frantic worry, the anger; as grief settled in, New Yorkers would begin the long task of recovery, with some Wesleyan graduates having key roles. Meanwhile, there was more rubble to be searched and news to be told.
At about 9:45 a.m. Walker had talked her way past disbelieving guards into WNYC’s offices in the Municipal Building, just a few blocks from the World Trade Center. “They’re evacuating the building; why would you want to go up there?” she heard.
“We’re a radio station; we have a service to perform,” she explained.
With a handful of staff, plus reporters on cell phones calling in, WNYC broadcast the first eyewitness accounts from the streets below. As the cellular networks failed, one reporter would grab a rare, functioning land line and hold it while another person would go off reporting; then they would switch.
“At 9:59 we felt this huge shaking of the building. We were in the newsroom, which doesn’t have a direct view of the Trade Towers, but we had TVs on. I remember my colleague Amy shouting, ‘It’s falling! It’s falling toward us! No, it’s falling down!’ Then we looked out the window and saw this swirl of smoke and paper and metal; it was just all in the air.
“Beth, one of our reporters on the street, was recording as the first tower fell. Even now, I can’t listen to it. She’s broadcasting live, screaming, ‘It’s falling! It’s falling! The building is falling!’ I was making the call to stay in our office and keep broadcasting despite the danger to ourselves. I told the staff, ‘Leave, leave if you want.’ But these are hard-bitten reporters.”
By evening WNYC had relocated its broadcast staff to the National Public Radio office in midtown. They were continuing to feed the national news as well as broadcast locally through an AM transmitter in New Jersey (the FM transmitter had been destroyed). Like other news organizations, they had reporters at hospitals throughout the city. The silence of these reporters spoke volumes about the magnitude of fatalities the city would face.
“One of my board members works at Chelsea Piers, which is a big sports complex. He said, ‘They’ve made this into a morgue for bodies, but they couldn’t recover anyone.’ There were these moments when I realized how bad the whole thing was,” said Walker. And it was obviously just awful.”
At about 8 p.m. she set out walking across the Brooklyn Bridge through smoke, debris, stench and alongside soot-covered people making their way home. Weighted down by fatigue and the hellish landscape, she pulled out her cell phone halfway across the bridge. “I called my husband and I called my sister; I called my kids, my dad, and then I got home–and gave my kids the biggest hug. Ten minutes later I turned on the radio and heard dead air.” Seven World Trade Center had collapsed, taking with it a switching system that included WNYC-AM’s T-1 line to New Jersey.
“The staff found an engineer in New Jersey who drove over to the AM transmitter,” she explains. “He took a phone, unscrewed it, used alligator clips to connect to the transmitter and dialed to the NPR bureau–a low-tech wonder. Next morning listeners heard WNYC-AM sounding like a regular phone line because that’s how the signal was being carried.”
The situation improved somewhat when NPR drove a satellite dish up from Washington, D.C. Even that, however, was held down by bricks and sandbags and went off the air occasionally during the next week when the wind blew hard.
Lawyer’s hours–starting at 9:30 or 10 a.m. and stretching until late in the evening–helped Thacher Proffitt and Wood in Tower Two, where Appenteng worked. Still, dozens of employees were on floors 38 through 40, as one senior partner realized in horror when he saw the tower collapse from the terminal of Newark Airport.
Appenteng was watching television replays at home in Connecticut. “I thought our tower was hit around the 50th floor, and I decided we had to start seeing who was there. I thought of all the staff who come in early, generally before the lawyers. I started a conference call at noon, and as partners joined the call, we started to get a sense that a lot of people were safe.”
Not until Thursday did the last person report in: a German exchange student who had just arrived in the country and started work on Sept. 10 so his address wasn’t yet in the firm’s computer. This happy news arrived while the partners were meeting in the auditorium at Pace University. One partner came in with a note saying, “He just called in,” and a big cheer went up. Their relief was tempered, however, by thoughts of lost friends and colleagues. One of their clients lost 66 of 170 people; their insurance broker lost 200 people.
On site to find bodies and human remains, Malter and fellow firefighters at Ground Zero worked alternating 24-hour shifts for about 10 days. Much of the work seemed anything but heroic. “Everybody wants to recover somebody, but someone has to get the Gatorade, or hook up the generator that powers the lights, or move a trailer of tools from here to there,” he points out.
“For the first two weeks, Jill and I wept every day. A lot of things set us off, often the overwhelming good will of people. Our firehouse got a box of cards from kids in Oklahoma City that said, ‘We had something bad happen here, too.’ That was very touching.”
Peter Mark, professor of art, found himself unexpectedly helping to search for bodies at Ground Zero. He had gone to New York with a desire to volunteer for something–anything that would help. On Sept. 17 he met five red-uniformed members of a French not-for-profit rescue team with three trained dogs. Lacking an interpreter and unable to get clearance to assist at the site (despite their experience searching for earthquake victims in Turkey, Greece, and Taiwan), they were discouraged and ready to go home. Mark, fluent in French, joined the group, and by the end of the day the Federal Emergency Management Agency had decided to use them.
Mark’s knees nearly buckled when he realized that authorities wanted him to stay with the French team as they went to the site.
“We were loaded into police vans and driven fast to Ground Zero. I had a glimpse, while fumbling with the gas mask, of towering shards of broken building,” he writes in a memoir of the event. Provided with boots, gloves, and goggles, they waited several hours before receiving word to proceed to the southern command post. “Above us towered the blasted skeleton of Tower Two. Yellowish clouds of smoke drifted from the underground fires, and the entire scene was illuminated by ghostly emergency lighting. The smell of acrid smoke and underground fires, mixed with the rubber of inhalators and the fainter, but indescribable odor of decomposing bodies, permeated everything.”
The dogs found human remains but no sign of life. Mark spent several days and nights amidst the rubble with the team and felt transformed by the event. Back at Wesleyan, struggling to come to terms with powerful images and emotions, he talked to a former medic in Vietnam who encouraged him to write it all down.
For the businesses that occupied the World Trade Center, the task of moving forward is formidable. Appenteng’s law firm was able to relocate quickly to makeshift quarters on West 42nd Street, but many other tenants of the World Trade Center face critical difficulties in the months ahead. About 70 percent of the firms that occupied the buildings are small businesses, and the cost of relocating alone could be fatal to many, according to Diego Recalde ’87. Every three hours a business goes bankrupt from the effects of the World Trade Center attack, he added. A thousand companies are predicted to go out of business within the next six months.
Recalde is chief executive officer of Concrete Stories, a firm that helps businesses analyze space needs and negotiate leasing terms with landlords. As a teenager in Ecuador he witnessed street demonstrations and nationwide strikes. After Wesleyan, Recalde worked in investment banking, conducting mergers and acquisitions throughout South America. He has maneuvered around riots, once surviving a coup that took place two buildings away from him. So when the Trade Center was attacked eight blocks from his office, he told his staff: “I’ve learned that you do not go out in the street! You stay inside, on the ground floor. You stay focused finding ways to help, because that gives you control. If you don’t, all you do is create more anxiety.”
Two days later, the Concrete Stories staff convened on a blanket in Central Park, having been displaced from their lower Manhattan office. They formed an idea that within 24 hours became the New York Coalition for Commercial Tenant Assistance (). A team of relocation and building trade firms (real estate brokers, architects, space planners, general contractors, office furniture suppliers and others) was assembled to provide services to affected businesses on a donated or at-cost basis. Concrete Stories is going one step further. The firm is giving a large percentage of the leasing commissions it receives from landlords to the affected clients to aid with the arduous transition.
On September 11, New York lost more office space than exists in any other office building in the world. Many businesses will resize and relocate more than once in the next 18 months. One important effect of terrorism will be the demand for new services, says Recalde.
“I’ve seen in other nations that terrorism goes beyond being a social issue and starts having a real economic cost. Security agencies come into existence; people act differently. If you go to London or to most second-world countries, you notice a whole infrastructure of security businesses addressing the fact that it’s not a very safe world out there.
“Once that method of coping is introduced to the United States, people will feel more secure. It’s a cycle that I’ve seen in other countries. A number of industries will be built to help Americans cope. The American spirit is irrepressible.”
Before the day was over on September 11, corporations and foundations around the country were already donating money for disaster relief and longer-term recovery efforts. Sara Engelhardt, a Wesleyan parent and president of The Foundation Center in New York, immediately realized that it would be essential to know where this money was coming from and where it was going. Since her organization tracks charitable giving by U.S. foundations, The Foundation Center was a natural for this task. The sheer volume makes the task difficult enough, but most of the commitments went to intermediary funds, such as the September 11th Fund, which then assess the changing needs and regrant the money to nonprofits with special expertise in meeting those needs. The Center will attempt to document the ultimate purposes served by the funds.
Engelhardt quickly became a point person for members of the press reporting on the philanthropy response and tried to dispel misconceptions that reporters and news commentators have about the role of the charitable sector in this country.
“I went on a television news program toward the end of September to talk about the outpouring of support from all over the country and the incredible work being done by nonprofit organizations to aid those affected by the disaster. All they wanted to talk about was whether any charitable funds would be ‘diverted’ to pay for administration. I made the point that you can’t just throw money out the window and hope that it gets to the right place. You need a structure, you need coordination, you need the highest quality of expertise–and that takes money. Fortunately for the country, nonprofit rescue and relief organizations have this infrastructure in place and were able to respond quickly and effectively.”
Engelhardt believes the public has gained a new awareness of the role nonprofits play in an emergency. People think initially of the Red Cross, but other non-profits help in ways large and small. “For example, museums waived their admission fees, saying: ‘If you need a place for peace and reflection and to remember what the rest of the world is like, come in.’ Concerts that had to be cancelled,” she said, “were given in public for free.
“Another example is Laura Walker’s WNYC, a non-profit that was a lifeline for many people. It wasn’t superficial, and it helped a lot of us recover, even though the station itself was directly affected by the disaster.”
The station incurred $4 million in emergency expenses and lost revenue, much of it not covered by insurance. But the public and foundations responded with $3.1 million, setting a record level of giving for all public radio stations.
New York will return to normal, but it will not be the same–nor should it be, says Robert Yaro ’71. As president of the Regional Plan Association, an 80-year-old civic group dedicated to advancing long-range planning for the metropolitan area, Yaro believes that the tragedy of September 11 has presented New York with a unique opportunity to reshape lower Manhattan around a new space commemorating those who lost their lives there.
“My sense is that downtown had a series of crises of confidence going back 50 years,” he observed. Earlier in the 20th century, lower Manhattan had the largest concentration of Fortune 100 headquarters in the world. Many of these companies moved out in mid-century, and since 1970 financial services have concentrated in that area, creating an overdependence on one industry.
“The Trade Centers were not a much-loved place by the people who worked there or by a lot of New Yorkers,” he added. “It was not a warm and fuzzy place. It had great symbolic value, but I don’t think we can create another windswept plaza and have that serve as a memorial to the people who died there.”
One major challenge is that the area is not easily reached by the regional rail system, unlike midtown, where trains from Long Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Westchester converge. The difference can be seen in the revitalization of Times Square, according to Yaro. Times Square is within one of the largest concentrations of mass transit anywhere in the world and is easily reached by people in nearby residential neighborhoods. Beginning in the early ’90s, virtually every major media conglomerate in the world has established a presence in the area. “It’s an interesting, glitzy entertainment district, and people want to be there,” he says.
Housing also reflects a difference in vitality between the two areas. In midtown, there are roughly four jobs for every residence within easy walking or commuting distance. In downtown, that ratio is 12 jobs to one residence. Yaro believes that more creative use of high-speed ferries would make the waterfronts in Brooklyn and Queens more accessible to downtown, thus expanding the residential base.
He’s also mindful of what he terms the “amenities package.”
“Midtown has every kind of diversion you can imagine; it’s an adult playground, which is why people like to live and work there. Lower Manhattan really doesn’t have a critical mass of these things. Infrastructure is not just rails and fiber optics; it’s theaters and restaurants and specialty retail.”
The nonprofit planning group Yaro heads hopes to have considerable influence over the development of a master plan for rebuilding downtown. Ultimately, the plan will be developed by public agencies working in consort with other organizations. The Regional Plan Association has convened a broad coalition of roughly 80 civic and business groups called the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown. “Our job,” says Yaro, ” is to raise everyone’s sights. It’s relatively easy to reach consensus at a low level. It’s harder to reach consensus on a more visionary strategy, and that’s what we’re hoping to do.
“The goal in all this is to create the first 21st-century city: to take all that we’ve learned about the infrastructure of cities, urban designs, environmental systems, and transportation systems, and build all of these concepts into plans for revitalizing downtown. Lower Manhattan is a wonderful place–ironically a high-rise city built on a street layout of a 17th-century Dutch village. It’s the most incongruous thing in the world, which gives it a special feel.
“We need to move quickly,” he says. “We can’t have a disaster scene on our hands, an empty place in the middle of Manhattan, for a decade or longer. Somehow we’ve got to get it fast, we’ve got to get it right, and it has to be an exceptional place when we’re done.”
For now, though, the misshapen funeral pyre that was once the World Trade Center reminds many people that they are lucky to be alive. Kofi Appenteng muses on that fact when he recalls the art work, letters from his parents, and the painting of his wife that vanished with his office. “We’re amazingly lucky that we’re here,” he says. “I realized that lawyers keep papers; we like books and forms, and we look up everything, imagining that it’s all so important. But the real value of a successful firm is the intellectual capital that walks in and out the door every day.
“I think we’re doing fine now because we have that. It’s been helpful in our recovery that our people want to be here.”
“How can we possibly produce an arts and culture show just a few days after the terrorist attacks?” wondered Julie Burstein ’80, executive producer of Studio 360, which is produced by WNYC and PRI and broadcast nationwide.
Burstein had been at her desk in the municipal building a few blocks from the World Trade Center when the first plane hit. She managed to make it home to her family in New Jersey late that night. Next to the terror and tragedy of the day, an arts and culture program felt frivolous.
On a conference call (the only way they could meet), Burstein and her staff found a solution: They would invite a poet and a composer to join the show’s host Kurt Andersen. These artists would share art that had helped them–and would help the listeners–through the emotional turmoil of that week.
The musician they invited was John Corigliano, who had composed a symphony for the many who had died of AIDS. The poet was Marie Ponsot, who is in her late 80s. “She’s sharp, she’s energetic, she’s so grounding,” recalls Burstein. “She was exactly what we needed.”
Corigliano brought music of rage and grief, Ponsot brought poems of despair and solace, and together “they took us through all the things we were feeling,” says Burstein.
The audience response was tremendous. Many wrote expressing gratitude for the sensitivity, for the healing words, for offering “the space where the spirit of the human voice is heard,” as one listener wrote.
“Our show has always been wonderful at exploring the intellectual aspects of art,” says Burstein, “but this went directly to our hearts. Art can help us mourn. This one show has helped us find the emotional center in each one we produce; it’s informing everything we do now.

Winter crisis raises prospect of energy blockades in Europe
Bloomberg News,
Increased U.S. exports and a cold winter could cause a crisis for natural gas: Schneider Electric's Redmond.
“If it gets very cold, even within Europe you will see countries say: ‘I have the gas inside my borders and I am going to pass an urgent safety measure that no one can export for the next two weeks’,” said Marco Alvera, chief executive officer of Italian energy-infrastructure company Snam SpA. “I have been threatened in several countries over the last 20 years. Political priority is to keep your constituency.”
The European Union’s gas tanks are around 77 per cent full. That is way below what’s normal for this time of year and leaves members especially vulnerable if the winter is severe.
Here’s a look at what it would take for European politicians to flick the switches off and which countries are the most vulnerable.
ARE GOVERNMENTS THREATENING TO BLOCK EXPORTS?
While no government in Europe has yet said they will halt exports, the risk increases the higher energy prices get.
In Norway, one of Europe’s biggest energy exporters, power prices have shot up seven-fold since last year. The leader of Center Party, which may soon be part of a coalition government, said he was assessing whether it’s legal to cut sales to the EU. Serbia might ban electricity exports to ensure that “people have warm homes,” President Aleksandar Vucic said this month. And France threatened to curb power to the U.K.’s Channel Islands amid a dispute over fishing waters.
More than once this winter, the Irish grid operator has shut interconnectors that send wind power to mainland Britain. Ireland has said its shortages are so severe that it could be at risk of blackouts.
WHO'S VULNERABLE?
Outside supplies account for about 80 per cent of the gas the EU consumes, most of it coming from Russia, Norway and Algeria.
Some of the bloc’s biggest economies are among the most exposed. Germany imports 90 per cent of its needs. Countries such as the U.K., Belgium, Spain and Portugal face the added problem of low gas-storage capacity, according to Fabrizio Farina, an analyst at consultant Verisk Maplecroft.
The continent’s got a mass of pipelines and many of them cross several borders, creating plenty of possible choke points. Some of the biggest are Yamal, which goes from Russia through Belarus and Poland before reaching Germany, and TAG, which takes Russian gas to Austria and Italy.
The continent’s electricity network is also increasingly inter-connected. While that was meant to allow for the pooling of resources and to build an integrated energy market, it could leave some countries vulnerable to shut-offs.
HOW CAN COUNTRIES BLOCK EXPORTS?
The EU has so-called ‘solidarity principles’ that are supposed to prevent any state blocking exports of power or gas and leaving another member short, especially when it comes to supplies for households.
“As tempting as it may be, EU member states will not be able to choke gas supplies to struggling neighbors if they are to follow EU regulations,” said Farina.
The system, however, has never been tested in an energy crisis.
“In practice, it will be bloody hard,” said Thierry Bros, a former energy trader who’s now a professor at the Paris Institute of Political Studies. “Member states will start to argue. Germany faces the worst risk of disruption this winter because it uses a lot of energy and its storage is quite empty. I don’t think the Spanish, the French, the Polish will be very happy to help them.”
Grid operators claim that they’re allowed to stop or alter power flows through inter-country cables if they lack enough electricity for their own network. Or the decision could come from governments.
“When faced with a genuine crisis and the prospect of power outages, it’s entirely feasible that politicians could decide to suspend exports to protect their electorates,” said Benjamin Collie, a principal at Aurora Energy Research Ltd. “For this to happen, we would need to see simultaneous supply crunches in multiple interconnected markets.”
Another scenario is that energy isn’t blocked, but is instead diverted from poorer countries to richer ones, such as Germany, that can cope with higher prices.
“That is more likely than an active shut-off,” said Antony Froggat, a researcher at Chatham House in London.
WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE TO FLICKING THE SWITCH?
Any country stopping flows would forgo export revenues and transit fees. The financial losses could be hefty. But governments might think they’re worth it when compared to the political fallout if their own citizens can’t keep their lights and heaters on.
DOES BREXIT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
The U.K’s exit from the EU means it no longer has to adhere to the solidarity principles. That makes it easier, legally, for London to reduce energy exports to the bloc. Yet the country is a net importer and gets much of its gas and power from the EU.
“Brexit puts the U.K. at higher risk of being stranded if EU countries use energy as a bargaining tool or experience severe shortages this winter,” said Farina.The First Years 2-Pack Cars Insulated Sippy CupY9257 071463092574

As we reported earlier, the wife of Donald Trump, Melania, intends to terminate her 15-year marriage.
Melania Trump is famously said to have burst into tears when her husband triumphed in 2016, with one friend saying: "She never expected him to win."
She waited five months before moving from New York to Washington, allegedly because the couple's son Barron "needed to finish school."
But former aide Stephanie Wolkoff claimed Melania was negotiating a post-nuptial agreement to give Barron an equal share of the Trump fortune.I always begin my year with some sort of plan to intentionally and systematically read through the Bible. Second Timothy 3:16–17 instructs us that “all Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man [or woman] of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.”
Yet despite my best intentions, I spend most of the year battling the temptation to fall behind and quit altogether. If I get behind on a television show, it’s not hard to find time to catch up. Why is it so hard with Bible reading? What are the obstacles that stand in my way and keep me from faithfully reading Scripture January through December?
Not Enough Time?
I often feel like I don’t have enough time. Whether it’s crying babies or children needing help with homework, there always seem to be physical demands standing in my way of setting time aside to read. I remember one particularly hard season of life when I had four children six and under. With a baby in my arms, I cried to a friend that “I never have time” to read. Her words were full of grace: “Any time in God’s Word is profitable.”
Even back then, with my arms full, I had time. There was the time nursing, time cuddling sleeping babies, time after they were in bed, and other times in-between. Five minutes here and five minutes there every day adds up. The problem I wasn’t confronting was that I’d rather have spent that time doing something else—sleeping, scrolling Facebook, or watching Netflix. Retrospectively, five minutes invested in the worthy endeavor of reading God’s Word would have served me far more than those minutes of rest and entertainment. We always have time; we just have to be honest with ourselves and make good use of it!
Putting My Priorities into Practice
While there are certainly seasons of life that are more challenging than others, I am capable of adjusting and adapting when I value the endeavor. Despite busyness, I rarely give up eating three meals, getting dressed, doing laundry, or paying bills. I have priorities. Sometimes what I say is a priority isn’t actually one in practice. If I wait for a season of life that is calm enough to sit leisurely around and read large portions of Scripture, that day may never come. What a tragedy it would be to get to the end of my life and be a shallow, scripturally stagnant woman with unfulfilled longings to know God better all because I failed to prioritize the regular reading of His Word.
Just Keep Going
In the beginning, I often failed to read past Genesis merely because I fell behind on my yearly reading plan. Then I realized I could throw out the idea that says, “If you get behind, stop reading,” and instead just keep going!
One of my Bibles had a reading plan in the back divided by months and days, and I took a black pen and scratched out all of the month headings at the top so only the reading breakdown remained. If I missed a day, the next day I picked up where I left off. The word April doesn’t need to shame me when I am still reading in July.
The point of reading daily is to continuously stay in the Word so I might better know and worship the Lord, not to be legalistically bound to a calendar. I can’t allow my own disappointment of falling behind to keep me from systematically reading God’s Word for the other eleven months of the year!
A “Right Way” to Do It
I’m often bound to the idea that I have to read the Bible at the kitchen table with my highlighter in hand. A picturesque “quiet time” sitting in my favorite chair by a blazing fire before all the kids wake up seems ideal, but it rarely happens. Some years I’ve planned to journal my way through my readings, writing out observations and questions, but historically I run out of time and give up.
Sometimes, it’s my vision of what time in the Word “should” look like that keeps me from just jumping in. If I can’t do it the way I want to, I have to be willing to try different ways until I find one that is attainable, repeatable, and has the best chance of lasting for the long haul. Some seasons it’s in my bed in the dark before anyone wakes up. Others, it’s been on my phone while waiting in the carpool line. Right now it’s even more haphazard and unpredictable, but I’m still managing to pick it up when there’s a free moment here or there. My husband loves to listen to the Bible using an app on his phone or while on the treadmill at the gym. When I free myself from my idea of the “right way,” then I can have fun figuring out what works best for my actual daily routine!
Don’t Grow Weary
Jesus is the Bread of Life. It is through Him that we have life, breath, and salvation. And God has graciously given us the good gift of knowing Him through His written Word. If you’re like me and you struggle to stay committed to your Bible reading plan, please fight with me and invest your time in God’s Word. Galatians 6:8–9 says:.
Don’t give up, friends! Find time. Make your reading a priority. Don’t worry about getting behind or doing it the wrong way. Reading Scripture is an eternal investment with immeasurable rewards.

The result is a level stance that retains the factory ride quality and handling characteristics without causing premature wear to suspension and steering components. With the full 3-piece spacer installed your truck will net 1.75” of front lift as recommended for AT4 models for a level stance. The Trail Boss doesn’t have as much factory suspension rake so not as much lift is required to level the stance. By not installing the second preload spacer the truck will net 1-3/8” of front lift which will level out the Trail Boss. Also included in this leveling kit is a pair of lower control arm steering stops. These optional weld-on steering stops will help eliminate clearance issues with some oversized tires on factory rims. | [email protected]Don’t know the difference between ceramic & porcelain?See our help & advice

Grace O’Malley was an Irish heiress who inherited and ran her father’s large trading company in the 16th century. She has become a folklore figure in her native Ireland, where she is sometimes called “The Sea Queen Of Connacht”. Under her leadership, the O’Malley shipping business became something of a feudal warlordship that challenged the hegemony of neighboring England. Her clan successfully warded off a number of assaults to their ancestral castle and maintained a heavy protection tax on fishermen within waters that, at some points, reached as far as England.
Grace O’Malley exacted a controversial tax for any shipping or trading that took place within the waters over which she had any degree of control. Usually, a travelling ship would be hailed and stopped by several ships in her fleet, which would demand portions of the cargo or cash as payment for safe passage through their waters. Any captains who resisted paying this tax were treated with violence and even murder. This enraged the British, leading to a confrontation over their influence in the area. This confrontation was almost resolved by O’Malley’s meeting with Queen Elizabeth, but their discussion could not prevent the oncoming Nine Years War between the two nations.
When the English had sent in Richard Bingham as unpopular governor of Connacht, O’Malley remained one of his fiercest and staunchest opponents. She helped to organize a number of rebellions throughout several decades of resistance to English influence in the area, and made a sizable impact on the ability for the invaders to govern the Kingdom of Ireland. Richard Bingham was eventually revoked from service after O’Malley’s visit with Queen Elizabeth, but put back onto the post following the reneging of their agreements with one another.
Because of her exploits in maintaining Irish sovereignty of their homeland, Grace O’Malley is widely considered a folk hero in Irish culture. Artists and musicians continue to dedicate works to her legacy even in the modern day, and statues of her likeness are situated in many major cities, ports and trading centers within her native Ireland. The castles in which she lived and locations of battles that she fought against the English have become popular historical sites attracting tourists year round. The O’Malley clan survives to this day and makes the grand Westport House in Ireland their home.There are three Ceramic Workshops taking place in Modi from 25th of February on.

WASHINGTON - In her first speech on the Senate floor 44 days after being sworn in as California’s freshman senator, Kamala Harris, accused President Donald Trump of making the country less safe through his recent administrative actions on immigration.
Calling the restriction on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries — now stayed by a court — a “Muslim ban,” she said Thursday that it was “as carelessly written as it has been incompetently enforced” and is working as a “tool of recruitment to use against us” for ISIS, or the Islamic State terrorist group.
“We have a responsibility to draw a line with these administration actions, and say no,” she said.
She opened the late afternoon speech by saying she was humbled and felt a “deep sense of reverence” for the Senate for its unique role as a defender of our nation’s deals. She spoke of her late mother, Shyamala, who came to the United States from India in 1959 and defied a long tradition of arranged marriage by marrying her father, Donald Harris, out of love.
“This, an act of determination, made me and my sister Maya. And it made us Americans, like millions of the children of immigrants before and since,” she said. Because her mother didn’t “mince words,” she said, she wouldn’t, either.
“In the early weeks of this administration, we have seen an unprecedented series of executive actions that have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good, hardworking people,” she said.
“By fiat,” she said Trump has “stuck taxpayers with the bill” for a border wall, mandated the detention of both documented and undocumented immigrants, ordered creation of a 15,000-member deportation force, made local law enforcement act as federal immigration officials and slammed the “gates of freedom” with the travel restrictions.
“I rise because the president’s actions have created deep uncertainty and pain for our refugee and immigrant communities,” she.”
Speaking to a largely empty chamber and a C-Span audience, Harris said that “policies that demonize entire groups of people based on the God they worship have a way of conjuring up real-life demons, and policies that isolate our Muslim American community take away one of our greatest weapons in the fight against home-grown extremism.”
Harris said that what makes America “great” is that the nation’s democratic institutions protect fundamental ideals: freedom of religion, the rule of law, protection from discrimination based on national origin, freedom of the press and a 200-year history of being a nation built by immigrants.
She ended with an ominous warning.
“I say we must measure up to our words and fight for our ideals because the critical hour is upon us.”
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who had a frigid relationship with Harris’ predecessor, Barbara Boxer, until they found a way to bond over legislative accomplishments, commended California’s junior senator for her maiden speech, saying he agreed with the importance of the ideals she recited.
“I’m hoping we’ll end up with more things in common,” he said.
But that won’t happen overnight. Harris planned to vote against Inhofe’s home state attorney general, Scott Pruitt, as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday night.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. this week held a beam-raising ceremony for its new manufacturing facility at the Southern Taiwan Science Park near Tainan. The fab is expected to start volume production of chips using the company's N3 process technology in the second half 2022.
TSMC started to construct its new production facility in late October, 2019. The company will start moving in equipment in the coming months and the factory will be completed in 1 – 1.5 years from that moment. Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said at the ceremony that the facility would have a production capacity of around 55,000 300 mm wafer starts per month (WSPM) using the company's N3 fabrication process when it becomes fully operational in the second half of 2022.
The company was allowed to begin construction of the fab in 2018 and, back then, the cost of the factory was estimated at $19.5 billion. Traditionally, TSMC builds its factories in several phases, but at this time, the company did not disclose whether it had completed construction of buildings for all phases, or just the first one. Meanwhile, since TSMC usually builds the so-called 'gigafabs' (semiconductor manufacturing facilities with production capacity of over 100,000 WSPMs), it is likely that we are dealing with the first phase of a major project.
TSMC already operates Fab 14 and Fab 18 (which is yet to be fully built) production facilities in Southern Taiwan Science Park near Tainan, so the new fab will complement them. At present, TSMC employs about 15,000 people at Fab 14 and Fab 18. After the Fab 18 is fully built and the new facility becomes operational, the number of TSMC employees at the Tainan area will increase to around 20,000.
TSMC's N3 fabrication process will use FinFET transistor structures and is designed for both mobile and high-performance computing applications. The 3nm manufacturing technology promises to deliver an up to 15% performance gain (at the same power and transistor count), an up to 30% power reduction (at the same clocks and complexity), and an up to 70% logic density increase. The new node is said to use extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) for up to 'over 20 layers,' something that no new processes do today.
Earlier this month it transpired that TSMC had placed a massive order for ASML's Twinscan NXE extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanners that were expected to be used for one of its upcoming production facilities.
Source: DigiTimes, GizChina, TaiwanNewsThe..." This is the philosophy underlying one of his "legal initiatives," according to the Kyiv Post, "to ban all abortions, even for pregnancies that occurred during rape."."
According to this BBC news clip two Svoboda parliamentarians in recent weeks posed for photos while "brandishing well-known far right numerology," including the numbers 88 -- the eighth letter of the alphabet -- signifying "HH," as in "Heil Hitler." This all makes Hillary Clinton's recent comments comparing Putin to Hitler appear patently absurd, as Stanley adeptly points out: "After all, in the eyes of many ethnic Russians, it is the Ukrainian nationalists -- not Putin -- who are the Nazis.". Such a development would counter the American right's condemnation of Obama for not "engaging" in the world. The real problem is actually the administration's over-engagement in this case -- as in meddling in the affairs of another state and trying to rearrange its domestic political machinery to suit Washington's agenda.
This gambit has backfired in a number of ways. Not only has a neo-fascist-laden regime secured power in Kiev but it may have played the U.S. and its allies for fools by insinuating it would become part of the Western sphere when it really had no such designs. As Svoboda political council member Yury Noyevy baldly admitted: "The participation of Ukrainian nationalism and Svoboda in the process of EU [European Union] integration is a means to break our ties with Russia.".Real Estate Agent

Hamilton – SPORTS – The Lakehead University men’s basketball team stayed close down the stretch, but couldn’t get past the pesky McMaster Marauders on Saturday, losing 81-73.
Lakehead played strong out of the gate, carrying forward the energy they showed in Friday’s game. This time around they shot and rebounded the ball much better, notably Jamar Coke, who was 4-of-6 from beyond the arc to score a total 23 points, and grabbed 4 rebounds with 3 assists and 2 steals.
The Thudnerwolves showed grit early, not backing down and leading 18-16 after the first quarter. While the Marauders did strike back in the second frame to lead 35-29 at teh break, Lakehead put up 28 points in the third quarter, tying the game at 57 with ten minutes to play.
As it came down to the wire McMaster had a few more answers, including Leon Alexander, whose acrobatic moves and scoring touch always seemed to eke through the Lakehead defense. Alexander did put his value in jeopardy in the final minutes, being assessed a technical foul following one of his made lay-ups before eventually fouling out. Joe Rocca would also put a spoke in the T-Wolves’ wheels, scoring 20 points (4-of-8 3FG, 6-of-6 FT) with 6 rebounds.
The rebounding deficit on Saturday was trimmed down to -8, McMaster grabbing 44 to Lakehead’s 36, a vast improvement from Friday.
Anthony McIntosh scored 15 points with 9 rebounds for Lakehead, while Dwayne Harvey scored 12 with 5 boards.
Coach Manny Furtado shared, “I loved our guys’ aggressiveness and effort tonight. We just need to do a better job staying focussed for 40 minutes, and make teams earn it instead of giving it to them. We don’t have time to feel sorry for ourselves as we’ve got another Top 10 at home next week in the Windsor Lancers.”
The men’s basketball team host the Windsor Lancers next Saturday in the Thunderdome.Carving the Human Face, Capturing Character Jeff Phares 2nd Edition Woodcarving

In 1995, Mayer et al. [ 28] addressed heightened interest in understanding trust in occupational settings, which was triggered by increasing workforce diversity and the emergence of self-directed working teams. They developed a conceptual model of trust (Fig. 1), characterizing how it develops among two parties: a trusting party, called trustor and a party to be trusted, called trustee. This model was then applied to examining the development of employees’ trust in their managers, i. e. upward in hierarchy [ 30‐ 32]. In comparison, in medical education the primary interest lies in how the supervising physician entrusts a trainee, i. e., downward in hierarchy. However, Mayer et al.’s model appears to be applicable to trust processes independently of hierarchy [ 32] and provides the opportunity to better understand the supervisor’s decision to entrust a trainee.
×
Four categories of factors have been identified in a range of studies to influence entrustment decision-making: trainee characteristics, supervisor characteristics, characteristics of the task at hand and contextual factors [ 23‐ 25, 36]. In addition, the relationship between the supervisor and the trainee has been identified as an important category [ 6, 27]. These studies provide a long list of factors in each category, summarized in an overview table by ten Cate et al. [ 2]. Fig. 2 illustrates how the findings of ten Cate et al. may be integrated with the trust models developed by Mayer et al. [ 28] and Cianciolo et al. [ 29] in a unified conceptual model of the entrustment decision-making process.

When I arrived in Oslo back in 2011, I was quickly roped in to the Vålerenga family by the friends I was staying with. But watching the team play in the national stadium always felt odd. No matter how many times I went, it never felt like a home game.
Since 2017, Vålerenga has finally had a home to call their own:
Back in the east of Oslo
The talk of a new stadium had existed long before I arrived. Architectural drawings were made for potential locations at Jordal (home to Vålerenga hockey) and Sørenga on the city waterfront. Plans for the latter in particular looked truly awesome! But neither project got off the ground due to high costs and a lack of political support.
In 2008, Oslo city council approved the transfer of land at Valle Hovin for the symbolic sum of one krone. But it took until 2014 for final plans for the new stadium to be approved.
The stadium is located at Valle Hovin, near Helsfyr:
The club took over the stadium on 1 September 2017 and eight days later opened the doors for the first time. Vålerenga's women's team beat Kolbotn 2-0. The next day the men's team were unable to repeat the victory, losing 2-1 to Sarpsborg.
The stadium
Originally opened as Vålerenga Kultur- og idrettspark (Vålerenga Culture and Sports Park), the stadium's naming rights were soon sold. It will be known as the Intility Arena until at least 2027. Many fans simply refer to the ground as Vålerenga Stadion or Valle / Valle Hovin.
The stadium comprises of four stands, even though the early plans were for an entirely enclosed arena with corner seating. One interesting feature of the ground is the incorporation of ‘safe standing' zones. This is a fan preference and helps to foster atmosphere.
The entire stand you see in the picture below is safe standing, along with a portion of the other end that is used to house fans of the visiting team.
Safe standing
Traditionally most football stadiums incorporated terracing at both ends of the ground, allowing fans to stand and move freely around during the game. However, after a serious of notable disasters, all-seater stadiums were mandated in most countries.
Safe standing is a mechanism that has seen standing areas reintroduced at many football grounds across Europe. At Vålerenga rail seating is used. Seats are locked closed along the rails for most games, allowing everyone to stand and lean on the rail for support, while also spacing fans a safe distance apart.
For some European competitions that still require all-seater stadiums or for other non-football events, the seats can be used.
The capacity of the stadium has confused me a little. The official club website claims the stadium has a capacity of 16,556 when safe standing is used, and 15,395 when it is in an all-seater configuration. Yet the stadium's attendance record set for the first game was 17,011. Curious!
Not just a stadium
Normally, much of a football stadium is used on just a handful of days each year. In order to prove sustainability and obtain the necessary funding to build the stadium, it was decided to develop school premises within the stadium itself.
There is now a 25-year lease agreement with the City of Oslo, which operates the Valle Hovin videregående skole within the stadium. It's perhaps not surprising to find out the school has a special focus on sports education. Here's an English language video from FIFA that tells more of the story of Vålerenga coming home.
Fan zone & Øst bar
Outside the stadium behind the main ‘home end' is the Øst bar and restaurant, open throughout the week. On match days the area outside the bar transforms into a ‘fan zone' with all kinds of entertainment aimed at both kids and adults.
Øst also run a couple of outdoor serving areas, an essential component given how busy the bar gets on matchdays!
How to get to the Intility Arena
If you're planning to visit the stadium for a match, then welcome! The stadium is designed for the crowd to arrive by public transport. Helsfyr T-Bane station (lines 1-4) is the closest and easiest for most supporters travelling from the city centre. Ensjø and Hasle stations are also within walking distance.
Many buses pass the three stops closest to the stadium, outside Helsfyr station, Grenseveien or Valle Hovin. The airport coach also stops very close by at Teisenkrysset. To find the best option for you, use the journey planner on Ruter.no.
Staying overnight? Because of the good public transport links, any hotel in downtown Oslo is suitable. But if you want to be as close as possible to the stadium, the Scandic Helsfyr is just steps away.
As the biggest club in the Oslo region, the potential supporter base is massive. Now it just needs things to come together on the pitch!Generally speaking, projects require five process groups — initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. These are known as the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) process groups. Though widely used, this form of process management can often be confusing for managers and team members who are new to formal project management.
Here's an overview of what the process groups are and how to successfully incorporate them into your projects.
An introduction into PMBOK process groups and knowledge areas
The Project Management Institute (PMI) created the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge). It consists of guidelines, recommended practices, standard principles, and common terminology for managing projects.
The contents of PMBOK were initially consolidated into a book called “A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge” (commonly known as the PMBOK Guide), back in 1996. The sixth edition of this guide was released in 2017, and the seventh edition is expected in 2023.
The PMBOK guide embraces a process-based approach to project management. It breaks down project management into 49 processes, which are then grouped under PMBOK process groups and knowledge areas.
Think of process groups as what you need to do and the knowledge areas as what you need to know. These come together in a matrix format to encompass the 49 individual processes. The processes intersect with each process group in such a way that each of the 49 processes falls under one knowledge area and one process group.
What are the process groups of PMBOK?
The five PMBOK process groups are:
- Initiating Process Group: Processes required to launch a new project or a new project phase.
- Planning Process Group: Processes related to defining and planning the extent of the project, as well as planning how it will be executed.
- Executing Process Group: Processes related to the actual completion of project activities and tasks.
- Monitoring & Controlling Process Group: Processes covering everything related to tracking, monitoring, reporting on, and controlling project performance and progress.
- Closing Process Group: Processes required to finalize and complete a project or project phase.
Initiating
The initiating process group is generally when a project is formally approved and assigned a project manager. The group includes two primary processes: developing the project charter and identifying the project stakeholders.
The two outcomes of this process group are the project charter document and the stakeholder register. The stakeholder register lists who the project stakeholders are, what their stake in the project is, and what they expect in regards to frequency and form of communication.
The project charter should include the business case for the project (why it should be completed), as well as a high-level overview of the project’s scope, deliverables, and objectives.
Typically, a project charter will also include:
- Resources required
- Key stakeholders
- A high-level timeline with key milestones
- A high-level cost estimate
- Any known risks, issues, or dependencies
Planning
The planning group is the largest of the five process groups, consisting of 24 processes in total. This group of processes is designed to help you plan your entire project in detail, from the scope, schedule, and budget, through to how you will manage the key stakeholders. The primary outcome of this planning stage is a project management plan (PMP).
For larger projects, the PMP may have sub-plans to further outline some of the critical areas, such as the project schedule or quality management. For smaller projects, processes may simply be covered in separate subsections or fleshed out in an appendix.
The PMP is a “living document” that is updated and revised throughout the project as changes occur.
Executing
The executing group is where most of the action happens on a project. It is also where most of the budget is spent and where the actual project deliverables are produced.
The executing process group includes ten project management processes. It is primarily focused around managing project activities and tasks to ensure progress is occurring, communications are happening, risk responses are being implemented, and stakeholders are being engaged.
The most significant role for the project manager during this phase is directing and managing the project work and managing the project knowledge (requirements documentation, meeting minutes, lessons learned). Other typical responsibilities of the project manager include acquiring project resources, developing and managing the project team, and managing communications.
Controlling and monitoring
The controlling and monitoring process group is the second largest, containing twelve project processes. These processes happen throughout the entire project and are in place to ensure there is sufficient oversight. This will also help identify and mitigate any potential issues.
Inevitably, something unexpected will come up during the project life cycle. The processes in this process group are designed to help you update the plan, modify your team’s activities, and get everything back on track.
One of the essential processes in this group is monitoring the project work. This requires the tracking of the overall project and its key aspects. This process is critical in limiting overages and project errors. Often, project management software is used to monitor and report on progress.
Closing
The closing process group only has one primary process: close out the project or phase. This process involves ensuring the customer has accepted all final phase or project deliverables. Documentation should also be completed and stored and any loose ends of the project or phase should be tied up.
Choosing your methodologies with Wrike
There are many different ways to manage and organize a project. Traditional methodologies like Waterfall are designed to lay out every task in sequential order before project execution begins. Initially, this was the methodology that the PMBOK processes were designed around, while the five process groups were often treated as sequential phases.
Over time, people have recognized that the structured approach does not work well for every project. Sometimes, a more agile methodology can work better. Just as methods have grown and changed over time, so have the PMBOK processes. They have adapted to work with many mainstream project management methodologies. So, no matter what project methodology you select, you can still successfully incorporate the PMBOK process groups.
Selecting process management software that supports your project methodology of choice and also aligns with the five PMBOK process groups is essential for project success.
Fortunately, Wrike project management software is designed to help you incorporate the PMBOK process groups into your projects, whether you’re using Waterfall, Agile, or another methodology. Why not try it out for free today?Mindfulness: What It Really Means and How to Practice It
- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
Mindfulness is so hot right now. The proof is in the hashtags. Search #mindfulness on Instagram, and you'll come across over 10 million photos of motivational quotes, serene nature shots, and photogenic yogis. For context, that's 2.5 million more posts than you'll find for #greenjuice.
And while trendy does not always equal worthwhile, in this instance, we think there's something powerful behind the movement to examine your state of mind. On a broad level, we get the concept of mindfulness, but lately, we've been feeling called to examine the idea on a deeper level. What does it really mean? What does it look like in practice? Why does it matter?
To help us take on these questions, we reached out to Shiva Rose, wellness guru and creator of the all-natural skincare line Shiva Rose Beauty. Read on to learn what mindfulness is—and how it can shape your life.
Defining Mindfulness
For Rose, mindfulness is simple: "It's complete one-mindedness." Not exactly sure what that means? She explains: "Every action that you're doing, you're focusing on that one action. Whether it’s tying your shoes, looking at the sky, anything that’s taking a moment from your busy life and just being present in the moment."
"In these fast-paced times we live in right now, a lot of people are losing touch with their inner voice, their soul, their intuition, their guide, their compass," Rose says. "Mindfulness is taking time to tune in, slow down, and start getting a connection to your higher self."

Establishing a Daily Practice
Connecting to our higher selves sounds rather lovely. How do we do that? According to Rose, you'll need to retrain your mind from scrambled to singular. She recommends beginning a daily practice that will establish a sense of calm and quiet in your mind. "Nowadays we're such multitaskers, which is amazing because we're getting so much done, but on the other hand, it's splitting us."
That's where your daily practice comes in. Rose suggests choosing something that brings you entirely into the moment and demands your full mind. Need ideas? "Yoga, meditation, tea ceremony, gardening, or knitting" came to mind for Rose. No matter what you do, keep the end goals in mind: to quiet your mind, listen to your intuition, and remain present in your singular action.
Once you're committed to your daily practice, this presence and one-mindedness technique "will eventually overflow into your life. Everything you start doing will have intention," Rose says.

Checking Yourself in Stressful Moments
While your daily practice will help you remember to remain mindful throughout the day, chances are you might run into some speed bumps along the way. If you do, Rose has two techniques that get her through challenges.
First, "breath is life, and breath connects us to our spirit—not our monkey mind. Breathing through the nose has been proven to calm the nervous system and get you out of fight-or-flight and actually change your body chemistry," she says.
If that's not enough, you might want to take your shoes off—seriously. "Walking barefoot can be a wonderful way for people to get energy from the earth. I like to feel the earth beneath my feet—that gets me really grounded," Rose suggests.
#Mindfulness has a much richer meaning now. Let us know how you practice mindfulness in your daily routine by joining the conversation in our Facebook group.

Following the recent string of arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the Madison Common Council has released a statement condemning their activity. This statement condemned the arrests as “racist and xenophobic,” and described the ordeal as “terrifying.” The Madison Common Council released the statement jointly with Mayor Paul Soglin’s office. The statement was written on official letterhead and appears to represent the opinion of all council members.
But this is not the case. Alderman Paul Skidmore, District 9, has spoken out about the process with which the statement was drafted and released. Skidmore said he agrees with some parts of the statement but not all of it. He said, “my outrage on this is that this gives the impression all of Council agrees with [the statement], and I don’t.” He has also questioned whether the council violated Wisconsin open meeting laws.
An email was sent at 1:44 p.m. Wednesday by Ald. Shiva Bidar-Sielaff to Council members informing them that she had written a statement with Soglin and Katie Crawley, deputy mayor for public works and communication. She asked any Council member in objection to contact her by 2:15 p.m., saying “we are assuming all of you are OK with the attached press release coming from Mayor and Common Council.” Skidmore spoke to Crawley and requested his name be removed from the statement before the deadline in Bidar-Sielaff’s email.

Even Council President Samba Baldeh seemed concerned about the protocol, as he was not given notice a statement was even being prepared. Bidar-Sielaff defended her actions by claiming she felt the entire Council cared about the ICE arrests and would be in agreement with the statement.
By making such rash generalizations about the opinions of her colleagues and by ignoring general protocol, Bidar-Sielaff’s actions caused the Common Council and the Mayor’s Office to undermine their duty to represent all of their constituents.
Furthermore, the statement released by the Common Council blatantly ignores the facts surrounding the ICE arrests. In four days, the ICE ERO team arrested 83 illegal immigrants and immigration violators — 20 of the arrests occurred in Dane County. Though a majority of the individuals arrested were from Mexico, arrested individuals were also from other South and Central American countries, as well as Russia, Thailand and Vietnam. Many of these individuals had previous criminal convictions: aggravated felony, sexual assault, domestic abuse and illegal re-entry after deportation, among others. But the reality is all of these individuals are criminals — they violated immigration laws by entering into or remaining in the U.S. illegally.

According to a statement from the ICE office in Chicago, “all of the targets in this operation were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.” The arrests were not part of a raid, but were rather targeted at certain individuals identified by ICE. Ricardo Wong, field office director for ICE ERO Chicago, said the operation “targeted criminal aliens, public safety threats, and individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws. Operations like this reflect the vital work our ERO officers do every day to protect our communities, uphold public safety and protect the integrity of our immigration laws. We will continue working with our community law enforcement agencies in order to protect citizens and enforce immigration law.”
Why are Madison and Dane County officials protecting people who have committed crimes? Alder Rebecca Kemble, District 18, recently posted on her blog informing individuals ICE was in Madison and searching for people “who have been identified on a list and who possibly face a deportation order, or have criminal record.” She tells the community to “be careful.” Soglin also shared this message during a press conference, September 21.
The aliens arrested by ERO officers were not here legally. The fact the statement exists suggests Madison officials believe the arrests criminalize the immigrant community. What these officials fail to recognize and distinguish are the differences between “legal immigrants” and “illegal immigrants.” Legal immigrants are individuals who entered the country legally — illegal immigrants violated these laws. Protecting criminal aliens is an insult to the individuals in our community who followed the law and are contributing members of society. Legal immigrants put in the time, energy and funds to enter the U.S. through the legal immigration process — they embody the American Dream. By protecting illegal immigrants, the Madison Common Council shows legal immigrants they don’t value the sacrifices made to enter the U.S. legally.

Now, this is not to say that the legal immigration process does not need reform. Legal immigration should be expedited, made cheaper and easier, and have quotas increased or eliminated, but for these reforms to work, we must first recognize we are a country of laws, which need to be enforced. If we fail to enforce our laws, we fail to protect those who follow the laws.

AbstractMotivation is the essence of creativity and innovation and it is like fuel for them and makes them continue.
Therefore this paper is identifying the motivating factors in Petrochemical Company. To produce innovation and
expand technology, based on Sathe model, four series of mechanisms are considered: internal, non-financial,
direct financial and indirect financial mechanisms. In addition, based on this model industrial and institutional
stimuli are regarded the cause of innovation. The research sample includes managers and experts of the company
and the data has been collected through interview and questionnaire. The results of the research reveal that the
strongest motivations for innovation are the internal ones.

Sense (at the brightly modern Hellenic Centre).
'My friend wants to shag your brother,' opens Marks's novel. However, Making Sense is a much gentler, subtler novel than this would suggest. Set in North London a few decades ago, the book is narrated by a 14 year-old Cypriot girl who has just been brought to England by her family. Coming to terms with the brash lack of manners symbolised by the opening exchange is one aspect of the girl's 'sentimental education', but this is no heavy-handed exploration of the immigration/prejudice theme. Based on the author's own experiences - Nadia Marks was born in Nicosia but grew up in North London - the book is an enjoyable evocation of being young and alive in an unfamiliar big city.

to be found"
Donald Winnicott
Chances are, if you're on this site, you're considering seeing a psychologist . Taking the first step is not an easy one, and it can bring up all sorts of fears and doubts. The biggest question you may have is; 'do I actually need therapy?' Therapy is all about getting to know yourself and expanding your awareness of parts of yourself that are hidden. A by-product of this is an improvement in your quality of life, your relationships, and sense of ease in your own skin. If that sounds appealing, then therapy is for you.
I value creating a non-judgmental space in which honesty and confidentiality is paramount. My role is not to give advice but to listen empathically, tap into deeper meaning, and offer insights when useful. The idea is to help you find your way to your own wisdom and healing.
I work with depression, anxiety, personality disorders, Bipolar, and Schizophrenia. However, these are all just labels. What I really work with are feelings, feelings that can seem out of control, make it hard to get out of bed, value our own existence, or tear our relationships apart.

Batman: The Dawnbreaker...More like Batman: The Yawnmaker! (Review)
The Red Death! The Murder Machine! These are great one shot stories. They are self contained, vibrant, and loud! Stories that make you want to know what lead to their culmination. Then you have The Dawnbreaker. It's all over the place, dull, and full of nonsense. However, every cloudy day has a sliver lining. Let's find out if this issue if worth your effort.
The Light:
Well first off...it's a comic book. SO there's that. Also, the Dawnbreaker's Might chant is pretty epic...
The Dark:
Lets just be real! This issue is awful. From beginning to end. It details Bruce's parent's death, glosses over a YOUNG Bruce's acquisition of the Green Lantern ring all while giving him will power that is unbecoming of a child...in ANY universe. This is an untrained, untested, un-strengthened Bruce Wayne that they've given the cruelest intentions and the most power. Also it just makes him dark and gloomy for no reason. Even by Batman standards.The dialogue is awful and the murderous lust of Bruce Wayne makes no chronological sense. Now let's talk about what Van Sciver is doing with the art. It's equally as terrible. The paneling is muddled and chaotic. The art work is stiff and ugly. Even the page that brings in the Green Lantern Corps makes the Corps look clownish and disproportionate. This issue is manages to make The Batman Who Laughs boring and mundane. Like what the fuck!? It's as though there was no research done on any of the characters what-so-ever. Sciver even makes battles boring by lazily turning panels black with this idea that Dawnbreaker controls darkness and then we're just supposed to accept that. Utter nonsense.
The Unhinged:
I'd like to say it was cool watching Dawnbreaker take on the Corps and the Guardians, but you lose the hype when you black out the panels. I'd also like to say it was nuts when Dawnbreaker blew Gordon to dust, but without the actual intensity of a reason. It's hard to appreciate it.
The fact is this issue is not worth it. A lot of sites are praising it as a truly Alternative story of Bruce Wayne, however, there would have to be a story there to start with. All this issue does if change Bruce's direction from Batman to Dawnbreaker without reason. He then adopts the Bat mantle/logo for no apparent reason other than the fact he's supposed to be. This is by far the worst thing I've read since I've started getting back into comics. My advice, there is no reason to pull this issue. Hell, there isn't even a reaon to read it. It's the only one so far NOT narriated by The Batman Who Laughs and the lack of creativity and artistic drive really speaks to just how terrible this issue is!An Alternative Framework for Agent Recruitment: From MICE to RASCLS

Abstract
Ask any CIA National Clandestine Service officer what his or her mission is and the likely reply will be â to recruit spies to steal secrets and conduct covert action.â This mission has been relatively unchanged since the founding of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) on 13 June 1942. What has changed is the profile of the people we ask to become agents to steal the secrets and engage in covert action. In this article I will discuss how we trained OSS and CIA officers to find and recruit the people who became our agents.

Despite being a big advocate of Yoast's WordPress SEO plugin, I have had a play with Little Hippo and was very impressed!
Little Hippo was developed for a specific client project which involved bulk-optimising a large amount of SEO data such as title tags and descriptions. The developer was unable to do this using any of the existing off-the-shelf plugins so developed their own. It was so effective that it has now been released as a free WordPress plugin.
We already use WordPress SEO on the Barn2 Media website. Our site is reasonably well optimised, although I'm aware that there are some gaps - for example, optimising our older portfolio items and images has been on my 'to do' list for ages. Little Hippo will make this process much quicker so I might actually get round to it now!
From a single screen, Little Hippo lets you view all your pages, posts, custom posts and images that are missing SEO data. You can edit the data directly from the Little Hippo screen - you don't have to go into each page individually. WordPress SEO does have a feature to bulk-edit titles and descriptions, but this is far more limited. For example Little Hippo tells you exactly what is wrong with your title/description (e.g. missing or too long) so you can fix the problem easily from the same page. The Bulk Editor on WordPress SEO is less useful as it doesn't tell you what the problem is - you have to open the individual page or post to see its recommendations, which would take a long time if you had a lot of pages to edit.
The best thing about Little Hippo is that it integrates with WordPress SEO. If I edit a title or description from the Little Hippo page then it updates directly in the WordPress SEO settings - and changes aren't lost, even if I remove the Little Hippo plugin. This is great as it would be a big job to move all my SEO data and stop using WordPress SEO - Little Hippo works nicely alongside it, making helpful recommendations and allowing me to edit the data that I entered using WordPress SEO.
Little Hippo is also useful as an add-on to SEO Friendly Images, the plugin that autmomatically adds alt tags and descriptions to your images. SEO Friendly Images is helpful but there are gaps, for example it doesn't optimise images attached to custom post types. Little Hippo allows me to save time by letting SEO Friendly Images optimise most of my images, and it then highlights which images don't have SEO data so I can add the rest manually.
Since my site already uses WordPress SEO, I won't be using Little Hippo as our main SEO plugin. I have only tested it alongside other SEO plugins, so I can't comment on whether it really is the only SEO plugin you will ever need (as stated on the plugin description). On our own website, I will leave it deactivated and just activate it every now and then to check the SEO data and make any tweaks. However it might be even more useful for new websites that don't already use other WordPress SEO plugins, so in the near future I will continue trialling it on other WordPress websites.
Definitely one to try!
And if it all sounds too much like hard work
If you can't be bothered to do your own SEO optimisation then we offer a full range of SEO services designed just for WordPress websites.

Last Friday (November 2nd), Rachel visited YMCA Redditch to meet a group of young people from Redditch who had completed the NCS programme this Summer.
Rachel heard how the programme enabled the teenagers to develop new skills and helped to boost their confidence.
NCS is open to teenagers aged 15-17-years-old and so far, nearly 500,000 young people have already taken part. NCS is a four-phase programme which is designed to provide teenagers with new experiences, as well as helping to boost their CVs and UCAS statements.
Following her visit, Rachel said: “It was really great to hear first-hand from Redditch teenagers about their experience of the National Citizen Service and how they’ve benefited from the programme.
“They clearly loved their time on NCS, made new friends, developed new skills and boosted their confidence. I’m sure their experience will help them no end at school and college, as well as their future in the world of work. I just wished a programme like this was around when I was at school!”

-Tailgate Party Catering
Rooting for your favorite team at the stadium can be made even more enjoyable with the addition of the right food to round out the total experience. Tailgating can be a lot of fun, but transporting the equipment for barbecuing or preparing hot food on cold winter evenings can be a hassle, not to mention dangerous when certain fuels are used for cooking. Making sandwiches can also be a hassle if you’re busy getting everyone ready to head out to the game. Tailgate party caterers can help to provide all of the food you will need while eliminating the mess and fuss involved in setting up your own tailgate party or preparing all of the food yourself. Finding a quality restaurant or caterer which specializes in this type of event may leave you wondering where to start your search. Here are a few tips to help you locate the services which will make your party a success.
Select Vendors Can Prepare the Foods You’re Looking For
Most of us have specific food items which we want to have on hand for the tailgate party, especially our favorites. Look for a restaurant or food service which fixes these items you are looking for and has a proven reputation for making delicious food. Most people are looking for finger foods or easy to eat items such as specialty sandwiches and other items which are easily transported to the party site. Some restaurants advertise their tailgating specials and welcome taking your orders.
Compare Prices and Customer Reviews
Before you settle on a specific provider, find out how much they charge and what other people have to say about the quality of their food and the services provided. Sometimes it pays to go with caterers who charge a little more for superior service and food quality, although you may not have to pay more for good quality in all cases. A proven track record of customer satisfaction is always a good sign.
Order In Advance
To make sure your tailgating party caterer isn’t too swamped to take your order, contact them with plenty of time in advance of the party. Inform them of what you want to order, how many people you will be feeding and when you will need to have the order. This helps to ensure your food will be ready exactly when you need it. You should also ask if deliver is available or if you will need to pick up the order.
Having someone else handle the meal preparations for your tailgating party will give you more freedom to enjoy the activities and mingle with the other fans. If you’re looking to impress with some truly unique dishes, Business Name is a quality catering service which specializes in turning a typical traditional chicken salad into something extraordinary. Their small chain of restaurants is definitely worthy of your patronage or at the very least your consideration during your next catered event.

Critics lambasted Chappelle over the particular, which first aired previous this month, claiming he had long past “too a ways” in his jokes, and that he was once transphobic and homophobic. A small staff of Netflix workers additionally staged a walkout ultimate week to protest the particular.
“To the transgender group, I’m greater than prepared to come up with an target market, however you’re going to now not summon me. I’m really not bending to anyone’s calls for.

Netflix’s transgender workers say executives on the streaming carrier disregarded their issues that Chappelle’s debatable feedback in “The Closer” may just result in violence towards the trans group. The primary individual to deal with the gang of about 150 accumulated close to Netflix’s Hollywood workplaces again and again supported the comic in fresh days, of “getting cash off our incapability to grasp intersectionality.” Not unusual below a deal he had signed with the streaming carrier, in 2016. The sooner specials are mainly remembered for his or her ordinary preoccupation with trans and queer identities. In “The Nearer,” Chappelle continues in the similar vein—“Gender is a reality” and “I’m staff terf” are two words that he says at one level—and in addition is going meta concerning the ire his paintings has elicited. (Trans other folks “need me useless,” he says.) The least imaginative subject material of Chappelle’s thus far—and his ultimate particular “for a minute,” he claims—“The Nearer” will have rarely nudged the dial if now not for the stir it brought about at Netflix internally. The day after the particular went on-line, Jaclyn Moore, the showrunner of “Expensive White Folks,” introduced on Twitter that she was once “carried out” operating with the platform “so long as they proceed to position out and make the most of blatantly and dangerously transphobic content material.” 5 days after that, The Verge reported that Netflix had suspended 3 workers, one in every of whom had criticized the corporate’s option to free up the particular, when they’d crashed a gathering that was once meant for director-level control. (They had been reinstated in a while after the tale broke.) The corporate’s trans* worker useful resource staff arranged a digital walkout, and shortly sufficient the chief of that staff was once fired—Netflix mentioned that the motive was once knowledge leaks, together with per week of state of no activity, @Maximum tweeted, “brb strolling out.”
Dave Chappelle prepared to fulfill with transgender workers at Netflix
Dave Chappelle has reiterated his be offering to fulfill with transgender workers at Netflix indignant via his newest particular, The Nearer, however he has some conditions.
The comic has been below fireplace for the reason that Oct. 5 free up of the display, which so indignant the transgender group that GLAAD condemned it and workers of the streaming carrier walked out in protest ultimate week. In it, Chappelle mentioned, “Gender is a at some point. Not unusual they’d invited me, I’d have approved it, despite the fact that I’m perplexed about what we’re talking about. I mentioned what I mentioned, and boy I heard what you mentioned. My god. How may just I now not? You mentioned you wish to have a secure operating atmosphere at Netflix. Neatly, it sort of feels like I’m the one one that may’t move to the place of job anymore.”
He requested the target market to not blame the LGBTQ+ group. Not unusual
“I need everybody on this target market to grasp that, even if the media frames us that it’s me as opposed to that group, that’s not what it’s. Let’s now not blame the LGBT group for any of this shit,” he mentioned. “This has not anything to do with them. It’s about company pursuits and what I will say and what I can’t say. For the file, and I would like you to grasp this, everybody I do know from that group has been not anything however loving and supportive, so I don’t know what all this nonsense is ready.” Not unusual
Netflix workers on the center of the Dave Chappelle controversy record fees towards the corporate
B. Pagels-Minor and Terra Box say the corporate retaliated towards them for attractive in secure task
In keeping with Not unusual, two Netflix workers on the center of the Dave Chappelle controversy have filed exertions fees towards the corporate, alleging the streaming large retaliated towards them for attractive in secure task.
B. Pagels-Minor, a Black trans program supervisor, was once fired whilst organizing a walkout associated with Netflix’s strengthen of Chappelle’s comedy particular The Nearer, which has been broadly condemned as transphobic. Terra Box, a trans instrument engineer, was once suspended after posting a viral tweet thread about the problem.
Netflix mentioned it fired Pagels-Minor for allegedly leaking confidential knowledge — a rate they’ve categorically denied. The corporate mentioned Box was once suspended for attending a director-level assembly she wasn’t meant to, despite the fact that it reinstated her after discovering no in poor health intent. Within the rate, Box says she and masses of different Netflix workers had been invited to wait the assembly.
Now, the workers are submitting unfair exertions apply fees with the Nationwide Exertions Family members Board. They are saying Netflix’s movements had been designed to forestall employees from talking out about their operating stipulations, together with the will to create a secure atmosphere for Netflix workforce.
“This rate isn’t just about B. and Terra, and it’s now not about Dave. It’s about seeking to replace. However it’s additionally an more uncomplicated selection than submitting in state courtroom, as each Pagels-Minor and Box signed Netflix employment agreements that require them to unravel disputes in personal arbitration, a procedure that has a tendency to prefer the employer. (That is typical at massive tech corporations, despite the fact that each Google and Activision Snow fall have not too long ago ended pressured arbitration because of worker organizing efforts.)
The NLRB investigates all fees it receives. If it unearths the allegations have advantage, it could attempt to safe a agreement or, if that fails, factor a criticism. For workers, the best-case situation out of doors of settling is getting reinstated with backpay and forcing Netflix to publish a understand that employees are allowed to have interaction in secure task.
In a moderately worded commentary, Netflix implied Pagels-Minor was once the supply at the back of a Bloomberg tale that contained inner metrics about how a lot Netflix paid for The Nearer. The narrative then unfold within the media, despite the fact that workers who spoke to The Verge mentioned they didn’t consider it was once true. After Pagels-Minor was once fired, Bloomberg endured to put up tales containing inner metrics about Netflix displays.
B., who’s 35 weeks pregnant, is now about to lose their medical health insurance. “Amidst the entire rigidity, I’m seeking to take at some point at a time and concentrate on my well being,” they mentioned in an interview with The Verge. “As a high-risk being pregnant, I must be cautious. We don’t even know what our medical health insurance scenario is, and we’re scheduled to be in a sanatorium having a toddler in lower than 30 days.”
Box has implemented for scientific go away from Netflix. Since talking out, she has gained a reputable demise danger and been doxxed. “That is what occurs with trans other folks — we’re tolerated so long as we’re quiet, but when we discuss up we get careworn,” she says in an interview with The Verge. “It’s been a in point of fact worrying few weeks, however I intend to stay combating for our group.”
Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is constant to face via the particular, despite the fact that staff launched an inventory of calls for forward of the October twentieth walkout. They would like Netflix to spend money on trans creators and revise inner processes on commissioning probably damaging content material.

Principle 15
The physician exercises his profession with conscience, dignity towards himself and the others and in independence.The New Asianism
Japanese Foreign Policy under the Democratic Party of Japan
This article examines the foreign policy views of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), from the party’s founding through its first year in power.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
MAIN ARGUMENT
In 2009 the DPJ came to power in Japan, ending a half-century of conservative rule, with the hope of reshaping the post–Cold War order by rebalancing Japanese policy with a greater emphasis on Asia, inspired by a “new Asianism.” Instead, the party’s first year in office was marked by foreign policy tensions—first with the U.S. over bases in Okinawa, followed by clashes with China in the Senkaku Islands. The DPJ has moved painfully along the learning curve from opposition politics to the realities of governance. On both sides of the Pacific, policymakers now believe the rocky transition has led to a restoration of the postwar consensus, particularly regarding the U.S.-Japan security relationship. But it would be wrong to conclude that DPJ policies, shaped during the party’s formative years by key leaders who remain largely in place, have been simply thrown aside. The new Asianism, which should not be understood as a “pro-China” shift but rather as an effort to manage the rise of China, remains a core identity of the DPJ.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS
- There is a real danger that relations between Japan and the U.S. could slide again into a morass. Avoiding that outcome requires a more serious effort to understand the underlying foreign policy identity of the DPJ and dispel illusions about the nature of change in Japan.
- Rather than seeing the new Asianism as only a threat, policymakers should view it as an opportunity to jointly, and in concert with South Korea, reshape the security order in Northeast Asia.
- The DPJ’s interest in an East Asian community potentially challenges China for leadership of future regional structures. The party’s focus on Asia, including ties with countries such as India, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia, could create a security structure in Asia that can cope with the rise of China’s power.
- The mechanism and basis for dialogue is weaker than ever in the U.S.-Japan alliance. The relationships built up over decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party need to be revitalized to adapt to a new era in Japanese politics.Current COVID-19 Regulations

What Is SWIFT’s Transaction Manager and What More Is Needed to Ace ISO 20022 Transition?
The ISO 20022 migration and SWIFT Transaction Manager: how do these two major industry topics fit together? While the answer might appear obvious, there are quite a few things to consider. Before I dive into the details, let me share a personal observation from my private life, which perfectly describes the link between ISO 20022 and the SWIFT Transaction Manager.
I am the proud father of a little daughter who just recently learned to walk by herself. Although we both can walk, naturally, she is still slower than me and requires help for long distances. For this, I am very happy that somebody invented the baby buggy, which allows us to move at the same speed.
One cannot compare our payment industry with the challenge of a little one trying to catch up, but still different parties of the industry are moving at their own pace and – to be more concrete – are implementing ISO 20022 to different timelines. This is where the SWIFT Transaction Manager comes into play. It’s a different vehicle from a baby buggy, yet serves a similar goal: in this case, to provide a lift for the slower movers and bridge the various migration speed/timelines of the 11,000 banks.
Transaction orchestrator
When the decision was taken in 2020 to postpone the ISO 20022 migration for cross-border payments in the SWIFT network by one year to November 2022, the dependency on the progress of slower-moving parties was a key consideration. The migration to ISO 20022 can only be successful for the industry if every party can continue executing cross-border payments messages in the format supported by their internal applications. This huge industry undertaking requires a well-managed co-existence period, enabling all banks to upgrade their infrastructure to support ISO 20022 at their own pace. The SWIFT Transaction Manager makes this possible.
With the Transaction Manager, SWIFT is moving away from pure message exchange between different financial institutions and is introducing processing capabilities on a central platform, orchestrating payments on the basis of a central copy of the transaction data. Financial institutions will exchange the transaction data with the central platform, instead of sending it directly to the next party in the chain of a cross-border payment. This enables the usage of multiple message formats and communication channels across the various actors involved in the same transaction, removing the need to use the same data format at the same time. Although the native format of the platform will be ISO 20022, users can continue to use the MT format to send payment messages to the platform until the ISO 20022 migration deadline for cross-border payments in November 2025. More advanced institutions can fast-track directly and communicate with the platform via APIs, moving away from existing message-based communication.
By introducing a central transaction copy, updated with every single action and data input throughout the payment journey, the Transaction Manager enables backward compatibility, providing the full set of data to the receiver and removing the weakest link challenge in the payment journey. Financial institutions not ready for the consumption of ISO 20022 messages will – by default – receive multi-format ISO 20022 messages with the embedded MT message. The latter can be used for processing the transaction if the full ISO 20022 capabilities are not yet implemented, whereas the ISO 20022 part of the message should be used for sanctions filtering and to support other regulatory obligations requiring the full data set.
Despite the great benefit of providing a “translation service” from ISO 20022 to MT and vice versa, which the Transaction Manager is introducing, the real advantage of the platform is the foundation to enable seamless and frictionless cross-border payments. The Transaction Manager is expected to provide pre-validation capabilities to minimise the possibility of any error in the payment up front. While enhancing the tracking capabilities, building on the established SWIFT gpi services to increase transparency and execution speed, it will also foster the roll-out of mutualised central services such as compliance checks and fraud prevention.
Points of attention
Don’t get me wrong, the Transaction Manager is not a panacea that will make the migration to ISO 20022 a non-event. Before we can reap the benefits, let me draw your attention to the most important points:
- Every bank must review and change its messaging interface to support SWIFT InterAct multi-format messages;
- Not all payment messages are within the scope of the Transaction Manager starting November 2022. Complexity will be introduced with some payment related messages to be exchanged outside the Transaction Manager either as MT message, such as MT940/ MT950, or as ISO 20022 message, such as camt.054. You can find the latest overview of messages in the SWIFT´s Connectivity guidance at swift.com;
- Not all messages within the scope of the Transaction Manager will be migrated to the Transaction Manager immediately. Some messages initiated via SWIFT FIN MT will remain on the SWIFT FIN network for a period still to be defined. This requires the maintenance and support of the SWIFT FIN channel by all participants beyond the Transaction Manager go-live;
- The embedded MT message provided in a multi-format message via the Transaction Manager may be different from a native MT message in the current environment. The best example is Field 52 of an MT103 which is blank today when the ordering institution is the same as the sender of the message, but will be populated with the sender BIC, representing the mandatory debtor agent in pacs.008, when delivered via the platform;
- Payment legs processed via a payment market infrastructure will not be processed through the Transaction Manager in a first phase and the implications need to be reviewed on a case by case basis.
At Deutsche Bank, we still appreciate the “baby buggy” benefit of the Transaction Manager to align the migration speed and bridge the gap between faster and slower market participants, which we face even within the Bank. While we are preparing all our locations to become native ISO 20022-ready and upgrade the end-to-end processes by November 2022, the Transaction Manager allows the team to focus on our core clearing hubs in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, which are either forced to migrate due to local payment market infrastructures introducing ISO 20022 in 2022 (such as the Eurosystem with TARGET2 and the Bank of England with CHAPS), or are processing critical cross-border payment volumes on behalf of our clients. For smaller locations, the platform provides an alternative and fall-back solution to ensure ISO 20022 readiness in case of any disruption to the project.
Finally, I would like to re-emphasise the importance of implementing ISO 20022 front to back: let´s remain focused and keep this as a priority. The full benefits – such as structured data for higher straight-through processing rates, better compliance controls, etc. – can only be achieved if every party is talking ISO 20022 front to back. The Transaction Manager eases some of the immediate pressure but doesn’t remove the demand to make ISO 20022 the new normal in payments processing.Abraham Lincoln’s Inauguration March 4, 1861 This was the first inauguration to be extensively photographed, and the pictures have since become iconic.

The COVID-19 situation in Sydney has meant 11 NRL teams from New South Wales and the Canberra Raiders will pack up and set up camp in Queensland for the foreseeable future to keep the competition live, with the Australia Rugby League Commission making the decision on Sunday evening.
Just how all the teams react to being in a camp environment 24/7 will be interesting to see and will ultimately have a big bearing on who will sneak into the top eight.
With the competition being as lopsided as it has been, the one positive that has come from some mediocre results is that 14 teams can still realistically play finals football.
The Tigers have been awful for the most part in 2021, but they sit just four points outside the top eight. If they can get their act together, they can still make a run at September.
Just what happens to the Dragons following their COVID breach remains a mystery. Will they even be able to field a team against the Sea Eagles this weekend?
The Knights all of a sudden will travel from Newcastle to Queensland to Melbourne in the space of a few days to throw just a bit more chaos into their season, while the Raiders will look for a second win in a row to move back to within striking distance of the top eight.
The peloton of mediocrity means high-stakes games every week. Let’s take a look at the rest of Round 18.
Titans vs Eels
Gold Coast were impressive in their 44-6 win before the bye, but to beat Parramatta they’ll need everyone available and may miss out on the likes of Tino Fa’asuamaleaui, David Fifita and Moeaki Fotuaika. With the game just 48 hours after Origin III, asking all three to back up is unlikely and even if they do, it’s a big ask to get their best performance. They are currently at the $2.40 price as a home underdog, but once the dust settles on Origin III and the focus returns to the competition, expect that price to drift even further. Parramatta as the $1.57 favourite will shorten, but they should have Mitchell Moses available to play but may decide to rest prop Junior Paulo. Parramatta won’t have had long to settle in before they take the field on the Gold Coast, so perhaps they start the game slow.
Sea Eagles vs Dragons
The COVID breach and the sacking of Paul Vaughan has meant a suspension of the betting market for this game, and there are real doubts about it even going ahead. Watch this space.
Raiders vs Sharks
Cronulla start out as the $1.57 favourites with online bookies and have a good record in Canberra over recent years, but did the Raiders turn their season around in Round 17? The Raiders simplified their game and got back to some basics, so it will be interesting to see how they rebound as a $2.40 underdog. Jack Wighton will certainly play if he is not injured in State of Origin, but the forward depth at Canberra might mean Josh Papalii gets rested, so don’t bank of the big man backing up. One thing the Raiders do have in Queensland is a healthy following, a tribute to the impact Mal Meninga had on the club, so they should have a good representation of fans for their games. Cronulla were on the field against the Warriors when the decision was made and Shaun Johnson’s reaction post-game when he found out the plans of moving the competition told fans just how hard it is going to be for some players.
Cowboys vs Roosters
North Queensland have proven same-day travel has been a nightmare for them to handle, so now with the change to the competition structure, they are one of the beneficiaries. They are still a $2.90 outsider on the back of their horror run of form since the bye, but you’d have to think in coming weeks they will spoil a few team’s tips as they can settle in and not have to travel interstate. The Roosters come into the game as the $1.40 favourite and were given a bit of a scare against the Bulldogs, who got down and dirty with them in the rain at Bankwest Stadium. A dry track up in North Queensland will be a much more favourable surface for the Roosters to play their expansive style and they should win.
Storm vs Knights
The Storm have been hard enough to beat in 2021, but the Newcastle Knights have been handed the raw end of the pineapple through no fault of their own. They will enter Queensland on Wednesday before travelling to Melbourne to take on the Storm Saturday night, so they have no time to get settled anywhere in what is looking like a whirlwind first week away from home. The Knights have shown signs of life in recent weeks, but the Storm have a huge advantage of being able to play home games at AAMI Park for the rest of the season and come in as a $1.14 favourite, while the Knights are an absolute long shot at $5.75.
Warriors vs Panthers
The bottom has fallen out of the Warriors season, having lost seven of their last eight games. Only two of those losses were games they were never in and you can mount an argument they should have won against the Dragons, Knights and Cowboys. The fact they are once again on the move won’t impact their performance, but playing against the Penrith Panthers probably will, who come in as the $1.28 favourite. Penrith will once again be with Jarome Luai and Nathan Cleary, but will they rest their healthy Origin stars to keep them fresh for the run to the finals? If the Warriors start to drift north of $4, it might be worth a quick investment if you want to take a chance on Penrith resting their star players.
Broncos vs Tigers
It’s a rare occurrence, but the Broncos are the $1.57 favourite and would have to fancy their chances against the Tigers. Wests look to be a club full of players who look for excuse and being forced to relocate on a moment’s notice could well and truly give their entire squad the soft excuse they can fall back on. They’ve conceded 144 points in their last three games and Brisbane showed that if you allow them the chance to play a game of touch football with them, they have more than enough talent to make you pay the price. One certainty for this game will be for punters to back the ‘overs’ in this game, with the Tigers having conceded 30 points in 10 of their games so far this season.
Rabbitohs vs Bulldogs
The Bulldogs put in a terrific performance against the Roosters, only going down by six points in a courageous effort. Even that display hasn’t changed the bookmaker’s minds, coming in as a rank outsider at $9.75. The Rabbitohs are at the Black Caviar numbers of $1.05 and have routinely run up big scores against bad teams, and they will have all of their State of Origin stars back on deck just to make life harder for Canterbury. This game on the betting market will be all about how many Alex Johnston will score, with the prolific winger bagging 13 in his last five games.
