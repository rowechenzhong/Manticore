Police chopper crashes in Meru
A police chopper carrying regional security team to Marsabit has crashed at Kaithe in Meru County.
Meru county police commander Patrick Lumumba says the injured have been rushed to the hospital.
The crashed chopper is an AgustaWestland AW119.
The chopper, which was being flown by Police Airwing Pilot Kemboi, was headed to Sololo for a security meeting.
Airwing Commandant Col (Rtd) Rodgers Mbithi says that Captain Kemboi and himself (Mbithi) left Nairobi with two choppers heading for the meeting.
He (Mbithi) is currently in Wajir. The single-engine AW119 is among the new choppers recently bought for the Police Airwing.
Locals said there were six passengers in the police chopper.Folks need to have to thin for various reasons as very well as to raise their top quality of life and improve their health or even regain a approach of supervision.

This was accomplished with the assistance and support of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and the Vermont Land Trust, as well as numerous foundations, community members and volunteers.
This property, the southern terminus of Putney Mountain, is a key wildlife corridor between the Putney Mountain ridge line, the Connecticut River and large forested areas to the west, into the Green Mountain National Forest. It is accessible to the public through a low gradient footpath that winds up the ridge line, taking hikers from ‚Äúbeauty spot‚Äù to ‚Äúbeauty spot‚Äù. People will continue to enjoy this property, as they have for generations. The ridge line provides much of the view seen driving north on Route 30 from the Dummerston Covered Bridge.
In 2021, the Green Mountain Conservancy purchased a 626-acre parcel that is contiguous to the original parcel. It includes 2.5 miles of undeveloped West River frontage and spans the towns of Newfane and Brookline. This property has been identified by the Vermont Conservation Design (VCD) as a Highest Priority Forest block with Highest Priority Surface Water and Riparian Areas, and a Priority Forest Connectivity Block.
The significant features of this parcel include the glorious views it provides to travelers on Route 30, panoramic views from the highest elevations, topographic benches left behind by a series of glaciations and by more recent flooding events, cliffs created by uplift and continental collisions eons ago, a dramatic and active landslide area, numerous rich forest sites including a cove with incredibly tall trees including shagbark hickories, 45 acres of pristine agricultural fields, 176 acres of deer wintering yard, forests of all ages, large maple, oak, ash, hickory, hemlock, and white pine trees, and grasslands that provide nesting sites for numerous bird species (including species that have been identified as species of Greatest Conservation Need, and corridors for wildlife and species movement, adaptability, and resiliency. It is truly spectacular.
These 2 parcels now make up the 913-acre Deer Run Nature Preserve. The Preserve spans the Dummerston, Newfane and Brookline areas of Windham County, Vermont.
This land is one of the last remaining unfragmented large parcels in the region. It is remarkable for its tall hardwoods, hemlock-filled ravines, stunning views, stone walls and a curious rock structure known as ‚Äúthe monument‚Äù. It includes deer wintering yards and a variety of forest types including hardwood savannas and hemlock ‚Äúcathedrals‚Äù. There are several wetlands and vernal pools that host a variety of amphibians including the rare Jefferson Salamander.
The site is a haven for over 70 species of birds (view bird list here) including birds that are listed ‚Äúin greatest need of conservation‚Äù in the Vermont Conservation Design. Two transmission lines cross the preserve, which ecologists and botanists recognize as valuable early-successional/shrub-scrub habitat that these rights-of-way provide. Birds that have been declining in Vermont ‚Äî brown thrasher, wood thrush, field sparrow, prairie warbler, mourning warbler, woodcock, the red-shouldered hawk, and the bald eagle ‚Äî were among those found in numbers during a preliminary site survey conducted by two ornithologists. Over the summers the Indigo Buntings singing is truly enchanting.
One of the few large forested blocks left in this area, conservation will protect its aesthetic values, biodiversity, natural resiliency, and its ability to sequester carbon. Conservation of this forested parcel will provide for approximately 1,674 tons of carbon sequestration annually.
This is a key watershed area. The Green Mountain Conservancy will protect and improve the quality of surface waters, specifically the West River, by managing the fields and forest lands that have frontage on the river to ensure that the water is kept free of pollutants, to prevent erosion, to ameliorate the effects of flooding, to protect the wildlife, aquatic and botanical species that are native to this river line area, and to eliminate invasive species that may be threatening the riverbanks and the quality of the water. To do this, they will follow the management guidelines described in the Vermont Conservation Design, and take action as directed by the Vermont State Agency of Natural Resources.
This area will be open to the public for hiking, birdwatching, educational activities, and hunting (with written permission). Public trails have been blazed and more are in development
The Green Mountain Conservancy has been supported by Vermont Land Trust, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, the Conservation Alliance, the Nature Conservancy, conservationists, community members and fundraising campaigns to be able to purchase and conserve these wild lands . Donations are gratefully accepted.

Court papers filed Thursday and obtained Monday by Dow Jones said the company's official committee of equity security holders has found a lead bidder who is willing to pay $12.5 million for the Atlantic City, N.J., site.
Upon emerging from Chapter 11 protection, the company changed its name to Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. The company obtained a $500 million senior credit facility secured with a first-priority lien on its assets, and used $150 million under the facility to make payments connected with the reorganization plan.
The new company has $1.25 billion in debt, down from $1.8 billion. It also issued 40 million new common shares, after a 1,000-to-1 reverse stock split.
Shareholders said the current price is $5 million more than the previous value placed on the property. The potential buyer also has made a good faith deposit of $875,000.
The parties are seeking approval of a $360,000 breakup fee for the unidentified lead bidder in the event an auction produces a higher bid for the property.

The Daily Mail explains:
Natural immunity to the coronavirus could be twice as common as experts believed, according to a Public Health England study.
Researchers at PHE found T-cells ‚Äì a key part of the immune system ‚Äì in a far higher number of people than expected.
The cells are vital for destroying human cells that have been infected with coronavirus to stop them going on to infect others ‚Äì antibodies and other parts of the immune system can‚Äôt get to the virus once it gets this far in.
The research, among 2,847 key workers from the NHS, police and fire service in June, found that 25 per cent of participants had high levels of T-cells which recognised Covid.

[Company / organization] TBM Co., Ltd.
Launch of the business
The Yokosuka recycling plant project started on August 30, 2021. The plant is scheduled to be operational in the fall of 2022.
Description of technology and business model
In this project, TBM plans to operate one of the largest recycling plants in Japan (processing capacity: approximately 40,000 tons per year). The plant is equipped with facilities to collect, automatically sort, and recycle used LIMEX and waste plastics, and aims to reduce CO2 emissions and consumption of natural resources through material recycling, which reuses waste as raw materials instead of incinerating them.
With the introduction of an automatic sorting line that we jointly developed with manufacturers, the plant will be able to actively accept and recycle miscellaneous business-related waste plastics from offices and factories, which are often incinerated.
The plant will collect used LIMEX, which is used by more than 6,000 companies and organizations as a substitute material for plastic and paper, and waste plastic, which remains in Japan and is increasingly in need of processing, in cooperation with collection and transportation companies in Yokosuka City to promote material recycling.
The plant has been certified as a "Select Kanagawa NEXT" project by Kanagawa Prefecture, a measure to attract companies to the prefecture with the aim of revitalizing the economy and creating jobs.
Achievements and goals
The outline of the Yokosuka recycling plant is as follows.
- Location: Part of 58-8, Shinmei-cho, Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture
- Site area: 13,693.50 m¬≤.
- Building floor area: 7,859.85 square meters
- Processing volume: Approx. 40,000 tons/year
- Production volume: approx. 24,000 t/year
- Start of operation: Autumn 2022 (planned)

This article talks about some of the best practices to do when someone is stuck in this situation.
Don‚Äôt do this regularly!
While there are some keto options on fast food menus, this still should not be something someone does regularly.
There will be times when someone needs to do whatever they can to get a meal, eating fast food all the time is bad, no matter what kind of diet someone is on.
Fast food restaurants have salads
Yes, that‚Äôs right. Fast food restaurants have salads on the menu. That said, there is probably a reason that many people are not aware of this. These are obviously not going to be the best salads out there. That said, they are usually low carb and can hold someone over until they are able to get somewhere to have a much better meal.
One thing to watch out for in fast food salads is hidden carbs. For instance, many fast food restaurants will load up their salad dressings with sugar. A low carb salad doesn‚Äôt loses its purpose if the dressing has 33 carbohydrates in it.
Obviously a salad from a fast food restaurant isn‚Äôt a delicious option, but that‚Äôs okay. This isn‚Äôt about that. This is about getting enough food in your belly to get you to your next meal. A salad can do that.
Bunless burgers are a great option
Most people think about burgers and they think of a bun and immediately rule out the burger as an option. That‚Äôs a bad move! Many fast food restaurants offer burgers for around a buck. Order two or three of them and either tell them to toss the bun or wrap it in lettuce. This is a good enough meal to hold someone over until their next meal.
One thing to be cautious of when ordering a bunless burger is ketchup. While the meat, cheese, veggies has very low carb, ketchup is loaded with sugar and also loaded with carbs. Putting mayo on the burger is a much better option. Little to no carbs and also helps to fill you up. It brings fat, just what is needed on the keto diet.
Get the fast food mobile apps
The mobile apps at the fast food chains are amazing for people on the ketogenic diet. It makes it easy to customize all of items that are ordered. Instead of being a pain in the neck with the article with ten modifications, simply pull up to the window and let the cashier know you are there to pick up an order from the mobile app. It‚Äôs as simple as that.
Another perk of the apps is that there are many opportunities to uncover hidden gems in the menu. There might be a salad that you didn‚Äôt even know existed on the menu and thanks to having the app and being able to see all of your items you can now discover it on the app.
There is hope with fast food on the keto diet
Don‚Äôt just cave in and eat a burger (with bun) and fries, just because you are hungry and don‚Äôt have anything to eat with you. With the tips above you can survive.
Just to get you started, here are a couple of guides to help people in two of the largest fast food chains in the United States.

As discussed above, there are many low carb fast food options out there. Remember, consider all your options, go bunless and don‚Äôt make this a habit. Stick to those rules and you will be fine.

About the Banggood site
The Banggood site is starting to make a name for itself. And for good reason: this site for the whole world sells electronic equipment, from mobile devices to drones and connected objects, at prices that are often cheaper than the classic giants of Internet commerce.
This is the specificity of Banggood. We know well the well-known resellers in France such as Amazon and eBay, Cdiscount as well as Rakuten (formerly Price-Minister). Banggood is an international e-commerce site whose borderless growth is fully assumed. This is how the prices presented fluctuate subtly overnight. This is caused by the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the euro that an Internet user located in Europe will see and the dollar taken as a reference.

Polk gives data on its first 17 cases
COLUMBUS‚ÄîPolk County officials are releasing more and more information about the Coronavirus, including a recent timeline of positive cases.
The county had its first case on March 26 and since has accumulated 19 positive cases as of Tuesday afternoon.
The first and second case came on consecutive days, with the cases spread out over days. Polk County went from April 10, when it had 9 cases, until April 20 for its 10th case and has added 9 cases since then. The last cases came over the weekend, when the county went from 12 cases last Friday to 17 cases by Monday morning. The county had another 2 cases on Tuesday.
The county has recently opened up a drive-through testing site at the former jail in Columbus on Thursdays by appointment only.
There are still no reported deaths in the county, and nearby Landrum has 1 case, while Campobello has 4 cases.
Polk County officials say they are unable to say how many of its 19 cases has recovered, as it is waiting on guidance from the Center for Disease Control as to what full recovery is defined.
The county is also not yet releasing where the positive patients live.
Polk County officials said this week that the state of North Carolina has stated they will begin releasing information about locations of positive cases soon. Officials said they are not sure if that will be by zip code or other locating factors. The information to be released will also include numbers at long-term care facilities, with county officials saying they will release that information as soon as it is received.
Hospitalization numbers are also not being released at this time.
‚ÄúAt this time we are unable to release hospitalization counts due to the significantly small number of case combined with other public information would potentially be able to reveal an individual‚Äôs identity and violate their confidentiality, or hospital‚Äôs privacy policies,‚Äù states the Polk County Health Director. ‚ÄúIn addition, cases may have unique health issues that could have resulted in their hospitalization prior to being positive or after they were hospitalized.‚Äù
As of Tuesday, North Carolina had 9,568 laboratory-confirmed cases, with 342 deaths. The state has completed 112,752 tests, with 463 people currently hospitalized. The virus has been confirmed in 96 of the state‚Äôs 100 counties.

It is fundamental that all electricians in the production network have a legitimate declaration and there are a few associations out there which guarantee that all quality principles are kept. As a business, an electrical equipment supplier can't depend exclusively on its own representatives. It should have a framework set up which deals with the quantity of licenses that it issues to its vendors.
With so a wide range of sorts of equipment that can be installed, it can some of the time be confusing for a business to comprehend the kind of permit that a permit holder ought to have. To evade this issue, one would have to invest significant time and find out pretty much all the various types of electricians that can be employed at their organization. As well as licensing, an equipment supplier should ensure that its sellers are likewise appropriately trained.
The training interaction of Electrician relies upon the kind of work being finished. Electrical force wholesalers or merchant should go through a particular training course, which goes on for a month. Force wholesalers' permit is unique in relation to other classes of permit as merchants need to realize how to investigate electrical issues using different apparatuses. This likewise implies that the licensees need to have a careful information pretty much a wide range of electrical force and not simply a few.
Finding an electrical equipment supplier can be a daunting errand. Be that as it may, it tends to be made simpler with the assistance of Internet. While choosing a supplier, one can without much of a stretch examination about it and read the tributes given by past customers.

For all the latest updates you can follow @BAMMA on Twitter.I went to visit her today and she once again offered me a cup of ‚Äúfriendship tea‚Äù. The tea is a blend of tea and Tang that she has been offering me for the whole of our forty years of friendship. She is not quite sure of where the name of this blend came from and I have no idea. Even so, even at 90, she had the kettle on waiting for me to arrive for our visit and the offer of tea as always. It has been a tradition with us.
As I reflected on my friend and the tea, I am keenly aware of how precious her friendship has been, how much refreshment and encouragement she has provided me, far beyond the tea she always offers. The tea, served first at her kitchen table, was a welcome to sit and chat. Much of the time she was listening to me. Through the last forty years, she has offered me the most precious of gifts, listening as well as often praying for me.
When we met, I was a young mother of two and she, twenty years my senior, seemed to never mind my chatting on about the season she had already walked through. There were gaps in the forty years where my life seemed to be spiraling off in so many directions that we would not see each other, but when I would be in touch she offered me the grace of never reminding me of the gap or how she had missed me. When we would see each other, it was as if we had talked only last week.
Today as I hugged her before leaving and took a moment to pray for her, I felt so thankful for how much she had reflected Jesus to me all these years. He too has often spent more time listening to me than I have waited to listen to Him. He too has not reminded me of His disappointment for being away from Him at times. He too has offered me continual grace and love.
It matters little what the source of the name of ‚Äúfriendship tea‚Äù was. What has mattered has been the gift of friendship she has offered, the kindness she has never failed to show, and the love that was always offered without any expectation in return.
3 thoughts on ‚ÄúFriendship Tea‚Äù
What a wonderful tribute to our dear family friend! It‚Äôs a rare find, this kind of a friend and one who bestows costly grace even rarer. Her cost as a result of really owning ‚ÄúHis‚Äù cost first. She‚Äôs a reflection of Christ is so many ways. She‚Äôll likely be more surprised than any of us at those rewards stored up for her‚Ä¶ those costly treasures she‚Äôll have to lay at His feet in abundance as a result of her faithful investment here. Grateful you‚Äôve had her and grateful I‚Äôve known her too.
Wonderful story. I am familiar with Friendship tea as my mother kept some in the house and I kept some in my dorm room through college. Your story brought back fond memories of my own over such a tea. it is dear to have a friend that listens, and listens, and listens some more. it is a blessing beyond measure. thanks for the blessing of your story and the reminder of my own.
The seasons of our lives are filled with a great deal of activity but true friends are a rare find. Cherish these friendship moments each day. Thank you for the reminder of God‚Äôs friendship and provision for our lives.Offers young people one-to-one support, training, business mentoring and opportunities to test out the sales of their products in real life market settings.

"Chlorpyrifos is an inexpensive and effective pesticide that has been on the market since 1965."
Since 1965? So the US Government allowed profits to trump the health of its citizens for 55 years already?
Despite the ban on household use and the fact that chlorpyrifos doesn‚Äôt linger in the body, over 75% of people in the U.S. still have traces of chlorpyrifos in their bodies, mostly due to residues on food.
This number is not a joke. 3/4 of the population are infected because of pesticides in their food and several US Governments did nothing about it?
.
I don't agree with the way things are being done. We shouldn't allow Governments and Corporations to spread the use of chemical products until they are proven to be unsafe.
That's backwards.
Instead, we should be prohibiting the use of new products on a massive scale until they are proven to be safe.
That's what a logical human would do.
First, products should be tested and they should only be released for the general population after extensive tests have proven beyond any reasonable doubt that they are completely safe for our health as well as for the ecosystem.
Why do we allow Governments and Corporations to release the products so quickly, turning us all into lab rats?
Oh, that's right. For the Almighty Dollar. How could I forget?.
Oh, look. Independent studies didn't took too long to conclude that these pesticides were harmful to humans. If only the American Government wasn't so corrupt and followed real scientists instead of trusting fake scientists hired by Private Corporations, many Americans wouldn't be infected and poisoned right now.
Instead, this is what the US Government accepted as "science":.
So, this is the kind of testing that the American Government accepts? This is not a test at all. This is mocking with the public and with science. This is making fools out of us. This is turning citizens into lab experiments. It is completely immoral and it should be considered a crime against humanity..
Why am I not surprised that a populist president acted in the interest of the Private Corporations and against its citizens?
Most voters are so dumb that they can't even see when they are being stabbed in the back. Their unconditional love for a Political Party that keeps betraying them makes them blind. Voters are like a woman who's suffered from domestic violence for 20 years and still loves her husband and believes that is real love, no matter how many times she ends up in the ER.
Why do we keep upvoting for these guys, over and over again? Are we humans that dumb that we keep making the choices that hurt us the most? Are we simply a masochistic species?
Wake up America. Wake up World. It's time to take the power back.

The term mother is often given to a woman other than the biological parent, especially if she who fulfills the main social role in raising the child. This is commonly either an adoptive mother or a stepmother (the biologically unrelated wife of a child's father). In lesbian cultures, a non-biological mother, or so-called "othermother" exists.
Currently, with advances in reproductive technologies, the function of biological motherhood can be split between the genetic mother (who provides the ovum) and the gestational (commonly known as a surrogate) mother (who carries the pregnancy), and it is also]
The social role and experience of motherhood varies greatly depending upon location. The organization Save the Children has (controversially) ranked the countries of the world, and found that Scandinavian countries are the safest places to give birth, whereas countries in sub-Saharan Africa are the least safest to give birth[11]..
Mothers are more likely than fathers to encourage assimilative and communion-enhancing patterns in their children.] This is, however a position highly biased by Western world locality: outside the Western world, in-vitro fertilization has far less prominence, importance or currency compared to primary, basic healthcare, womens' basic health, reducing infant mortality and the prevention of life-threatening diseases such as polio, typhus and malaria.,[20] Jews,[21] and Muslims.[22] Some examples of glorification or deification include the Madonna or Blessed Virgin Mother Mary for Christians, the Hindu Mother Goddess, or Demeter of ancient Greek pre-Christian belief. In Islam, the Q'uran dictates the mother occupying an importance and position three times superior to that of the father. However, while the mother is considered the most important member of the family, she is not the head of the family..).
-The giant steel-framed globe, a 31-foot steel structure on a roundabout in front of MOA, also known as the ‚ÄòMOA Globe‚Äô, greeted visitors of the mall since 2006.
Steel structures give the MOA Globe its precise shape. Structural steel is a type of steel building material that is made of a certain shape and chemical composition to meet the project‚Äôs needs.

RELATED: 5 Reasons to Consider Steel as Your Next Construction Material
How are steel structures maintained?
With the Globe‚Äôs whereabouts now put to rest last week, SM Management confirmed the landmark is currently receiving repairs. Here‚Äôs how SM MOA, and other companies, maintain their steel structures:
1. Regular inspection and monitoring.
Steel structures require constant maintenance, inspection, and monitoring to ensure that they continue to provide completely reliable function long after their initial projected life cycle has passed. Well, the MOA Globe gets its regular inspection.
The management implements regular inspection to ensure proper maintenance of these structures. Structure maintenance should ideally comprise both analytical analysis and onsite inspection by a team of personnel who can handle both.

2. Clean the steel framework.
Cleaning the steel framework is also vital to remove any dust that has accumulated and could cause scratches or dull the structure, especially when the MOA Globe has been used for multiple promotions. Any mold that has formed around it because of moisture exposure should be removed.
3. Repair minor flaws.
Carry out minor repairs as quickly as possible, before the steeled structures deteriorate further and cause structural damage. It is preferable not to leave any holes in the steel framework or cracks in the paint for the future if they find them. You never know when minor flaws can turn into major issues that will affect your steel structure‚Äôs complete structure.
RELATED: Here‚Äôs How Stainless Steel Buildings are Maintained
4. Replacement and reinforcement.
Fasteners or fittings that are prone to corrosion are routinely used to connect structural steel piles. This requires regular maintenance. Routine maintenance includes tightening or replacing bolts and replacing cracked or corroded fittings.
Replacement and reinforcement of the base is also part of mooring fittings maintenance. Cast steel fittings of the same size and capacity as the old ones for the replacement.
Keep a stationary or floating object attached to the rest of the vessel when loading or unloading. As the MOA Globe is located close to the seaside, it can endure a variety of factors, including wind, current, tide, and waves.

Corrosion can damage and deteriorate these structures. Reinforcing H-piling by welding steel plates onto flanges and web is suited for localized corrosion. Welding reinforcing rods across the damaged area along the main axis of the restored member is another method of strengthening.
Reinforcing plates should be thick enough to restore the piling‚Äôs previous strength, while being large enough to encompass and extend beyond the corroded area‚Äôs extremities. Clean and hone the old steels to a thickness that allows for a robust weld. Feather cut edges to eliminate cracks, completely welding around the plate.
RELATED: Different types of steel bars used in construction
To summarize, maintaining steel structures involves reinforcing and updating all of its components.
The elements that make up the steel-framed globe of MOA may only require less maintenance and few repairs because of their endurance and capacity to endure. From its inception in 2006 to its current status as a popular tourist site, regular care and maintenance will assure its long-term viability and sustainability.

My question was about this‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt say anything else about it because I didn‚Äôt want to influence the response at all. And I would really like to thank everyone who replied. I so much appreciate the thoughtfulness and consideration that went into all of your responses.
Apart from A Question? I didn‚Äôt blog anything last week because I was so overwhelmed with sadness and I‚Äôm not going to go into that here. I do emotional literacy in the stereotypical English way ‚Äì not often and not well! ‚Äì but I was determined to keep sewing and I thought making something would make me feel better but I was at a loss for what to sew. So I thought I‚Äôd try modifying a New York Beauty block to make something like this image‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶which I drew and began to make a needlepoint piece of (destined to remain a UFO forever, I think) years ago. It was originally inspired by the quotation: ‚ÄòThe person in the heart is is the person in the sun‚Äô which crops a lot in the early Upanshads, particularly the Chandogya, but I modified the idea to have the person juggling rain drops because that struck me as more realistic.
To start with I was aiming for a modern solids look and thinking cushions but when I got to this stage I couldn‚Äôt think how best to quilt it and I thought ‚Äòsometimes you just to give up to the universe‚Äô. That seems an odd thing to have thought out of the blue about the quilt, life and everything but I decided just to go with it. And for some reason prayer flags came to mind. Lately, I seem to keep meeting people enthused about all things Tibet at
And I listened to this You Tube Video of crystal singing bowls, played by Deborah Van Dyke and Valerie Farnsworth accompanied by the art of Jack Haas. It was like a sort of sewing meditation and might be worth doing from time to time just for the peacefullness of it. The sound is extraordinarily beautiful and the images are stunning.
And, beginning with shadow quilting, I listened and sewed in circles and cried a lot ‚Äì which didn‚Äôt help with even stitches and straight lines but gave it a certain character ‚Äì and I made myself a rule not to unpick anything and not to imagine it perfect but just to change direction or colour when I thought it looked like it needed it and to accept however it turned out (life, the quilt and everything!).
And I listened to this wonderful TED TALK:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taught to try to live life without regret. But why? Using her own tattoo as an example, Kathryn Schulz makes a powerful and moving case for embracing our regrets‚Äù
And just kept sewing and doing all the steps of regret just how she describes. Except I still have a way to go before I can genuinely laugh at myself. Perhaps when I can, I‚Äôll be able to write in an entertaining and matter-of-fact way describing what it was all about.
And then I received an email update from Susan‚Äôs Blog ‚Äì Good Disruptive change ‚Äì which I would highly recommend to anyone ‚Äì and she had blogged a post called HOW TO BE YOUR OWN TRUTHTELLER where she says (among lots of other interesting things):
‚ÄúWhen Peter Drucker observed that ‚Äúno one has ever failed to find the facts he is looking for,‚Äù he was talking about confirmation bias, known as the most dependable of all delusions. What is confirmation bias? It‚Äôs when we pay attention to information that confirms what we want to believe, and ignore information that challenges it‚Äù.
So I sewed round in circles some more adding some reflection on confirmation bias into the mix.
And in the end I felt a lot wiser but not much happier and I had pretty much run out space for any more stitching and I realized the flag was finished.
But I‚Äôd noticed the other flags tend to have names and words on them and I had been naming it the ‚ÄòHeart of Sorrow‚Äô, which doesn‚Äôt seem quite right for a wish for all beings to be ‚Äòuplifted and a little happier‚Äô. And I did think it looked quite bright and cheerful and I like the idea that from the heart of sorrow something hopeful and happy and beautiful could emerge but I still didn‚Äôt feel hopeful and happy and beautiful and I was concerned that it might just be sending out vibes of sadness and unstraight lines so I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with embroidering those words on.
So asking for really genuine responses, positive or negative, was a way of testing the response of the universe to see if this could be a prayer flag at all.
I think I will link it up to the The Prayer Flag Project. I think I‚Äôll call it ‚ÄòFrom the Heart‚Ä¶‚Äô and rather than embroidering words on, I‚Äôll leave it to speak for itself.
Edited to add: Thanks to everyone who has commented or emailed I think the whole process was surprisingly helpful and I‚Äôm pretty much back to normal now and somewhat wiser for it :)
Edited to add: This is continued in the following post, here.

What a thoughtful and interesting post, Janine. I'm glad you are feeling better. It's hard to be in those down spots and so important to remember that they will not last. It's wonderful to have such a great project to help work through the sadness. :)

Janine I've been out of the loop because I'm ill but I wanted to comment on this amazing post. The prayer flag is truly stunning and such a great intent. I enjoyed all the links and think you're definitely on the right track. I hope the sadness lifts and I'm sure this positive and beautiful heart will help :)

What a great post, in itself it was soothing and calming, and I haven't even followed the links yet.
I am so sorry that I blatted on about the quilt being such a happy thing, obviously my empathic sensing powers are cr@p, but if you can pour your sorrow out and make something so lovely, it sounds like a great arrangement!
Katie
I'm sorry to have missed this when you orginally posted it. I am still trying to catch up with blog reading across the board.
I absolutely love your prayer flag and that you were able to talk honestly about the process of creating it. I'm sorry that there was sadness at this time, but know that we all go through those times. The fact that you worked through it to create something for the world to benefit from just speaks volumes for your soul.
I have been secretly lurking on the Prayer Flag blog and have yet, only thought about diving in to creating something in that vein. I have long been fascinated by Tibetan practices (as well as religious/spiritual practices around the world) and one day want to travel there. I'm happy to have seen your prayer flag featured on their blog. I hope you create more as they come to you.
I'll cut this short here as I don't want to go on in the comments. I could probably talk about this for days, but will have to return to this post to check out the videos and links you shared. I need to get to bed right now. :)View

Children fleeing violent situations often have to leave home quickly, without the chance to collect basic items.
These children arrive in emergency accommodation with just the clothes they are wearing.

Where did the Buddy Bag idea come from? During a visit to Australia in 2014, our founder, Karen Williams, was inspired by an article about The Alannah and Madeline Foundation () which has delivered more than 60.

How? You will need a rucksack and all the essential items that go into a Buddy Bag per team (toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, underwear, pyjamas, book, teddy bear, bookmark, photo frame, etc. Add more for older groups). Each team must (in relay) run to collect an item for their bag and bring it back to pack it into their bag. The first team to pack their buddy bag wins! How fast can you pack a Buddy Bag? How fast can you unpack it in reverse?
Sock pairing game. How many pairs of socks can you pair in 1 minute?
Make a positive thinking fortune teller and play with friends. You could use this as your craft challenge too. What positive thoughts will you include? What will make others feel good?
Pairs. Can you pair up the signs/symptoms of abuse with their titles?
For Leaders... This is a good way to get young people to learn about the different types of abuse and the tell tale signs. You can play this one of two ways, either with cards describing different abuse scenarios or giving each young person either a type of abuse or the signs. Those with signs should walk around and silently act out their signs (miming having no money (financial abuse), a sore rib (physical abuse)) and those with titles should go and find their pair.

The town hall meeting took place at the Student Resource Building. Nexus File Photo
The panelists fielded questions from around 20 attendees surrounding the Clery Act timely warning system and general frustration about a lack of university action to prevent sexual assault.
The panel was moderated by Marisela M√°rquez, the executive director of UCSB‚Äôs Associated Students, and hosted representatives from university administration, the UCSB Title IX Office, the Campus Advocacy Resources and Education Office, the Clery Act coordinator and the UC Police Department (UCPD).
Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) co-chairs fourth-year biology major Manju Cheenath and second-year cell and developmental biology major Leila Loose, alongside fourth-year political science major and SASA nonprofit President Philippa Villalobos, gave a report on SASA‚Äôs recent work.
Villalobos informed attendees that SASA‚Äôs nonprofit board is continuing work on California Assembly Bill 524, also known as the Greek Accountability, Change, Transparency (A.C.T.) bill. The bill, which was originally introduced into the legislature over a year ago, will be returning for the upcoming cycle with the goal of holding fraternities and sororities accountable for sexual assault allegations.
If passed, the bill would require higher education fraternities and sororities to compile annual and ‚Äúeasily accessible‚Äù reports ‚Äì made up of law enforcement and office of student life reports ‚Äì to inform the campus community about fraternity and sorority misconduct.
The bill would also require fraternities and sororities to report information on membership, average GPA of the chapter, volunteer hours and the chapter‚Äôs standing with its university.
‚ÄúOur hope with this would be that new students who are looking to join fraternities and sororities or go to events [at fraternity houses] who haven‚Äôt gotten timely warning emails or who don‚Äôt know the campus climate are able to easily see which locations have a trend of violence or perpetuate predators,‚Äù Villalobos said.
SASA is also looking to create an anonymous survey for students to report allegations of misconduct or sexual assault against members of Greek life and include the results in the annual Greek A.C.T reports, Villalobos added. The results of the survey would be differentiated from official allegations of misconduct.
Loose then shared SASA‚Äôs statement on UCSB‚Äôs timely warning emails. As mandated by the Clery Act, all universities must work with local police departments to report a variety of crimes ‚Äî including sexual assaults ‚Äî that occur on campus, campus-affiliated or campus-adjacent property in the form of ‚Äútimely warning‚Äù emails.
According to Loose, students have been reaching out to SASA with a variety of issues around the nature of the emails, including their graphic, triggering language, the lack of trigger warnings and the lack of specific locations of the sexual assaults.
‚ÄúPlease note this message contains information that somebody finds upsetting,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy did [the] email sent to UCSB students not give survivors this chance to click away?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe think it would be best if the emails include a trigger warning in the subject line and refrain from reiterating unnecessarily specific details of the assault encounter, in order to ensure survivors on campus are not negatively impacted by receiving these messages,‚Äù Loose said.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a lot of students asking us if we knew where the events happened, as that should be the reason we are getting these emails ‚Äî to protect ourselves,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThis lack of clarity is making students more uncomfortable.‚Äù
On Oct. 4, UCSB issued two back-to-back timely warnings for instances of sexual assault: an Oct. 2 sexual assault that took place in campus housing and a Sept. 28 rape that was ‚Äúat the house of a UCSB-recognized student organization,‚Äù according to the timely warning.
On Oct. 12, UCSB issued a third timely warning for aggravated sexual assault that occurred Oct. 9 at a ‚Äúcampus-affiliated property in Isla Vista.‚Äù
UCPD Lieutenant Dan Wilson later clarified that the recognized student organization from the Sept. 28 assault was a part of Greek life, but none of the timely warnings provided specific locations of the assaults or trigger warnings.
SASA requested that for future timely warnings ‚Äî along with including trigger warnings in the headline and email body as well as fewer details of the assault ‚Äî clearer locations be provided so ‚Äústudents can make more informed decisions about their activities.‚Äù
UCSB‚Äôs Clery Act Compliance Coordinator Jessica Fougere said that a variety of factors go into disclosing a crime‚Äôs location, including if the location would expose the identity of the survivor, if police or the university know the specific location of the crime or if a pattern of crime exists at the location.
‚ÄúAnother thing we consider is the broader picture,‚Äù Fougere said. ‚ÄúWe are always trying to be mindful of the fact that, unfortunately, these incidents can happen anywhere. What we never want to do is send a timely warning where we do name a location and then people think, if ‚ÄòI just avoid one location, that will be okay.‚Äô‚Äù
UCPD representative Matt Bly said that he apologized on behalf of the department for the triggering nature of the timely warnings.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to start off by saying first and foremost I apologize on behalf of UCPD for any triggering emotions or negative emotions that these points have caused,‚Äù Bly said.
‚ÄúI take responsibility for that. UCPD takes responsibility for that. We‚Äôre sorry, we‚Äôre committed to improving and doing better than before and working with the community and listening to the community,‚Äù he continued.
Panelists then responded to questions about repercussions for groups or individuals ‚Äî specifically fraternities ‚Äî that have allegations of sexual assault or misconduct against them.
After allegations of sexual assault are reported, they go to the Title IX Office, according to Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn. She noted that anonymous complaints make it more difficult for the university to impose penalties on offending groups or persons.
‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs an anonymous complaint, it‚Äôs much harder to follow up. We don‚Äôt have an individual to follow up with, and many times we don‚Äôt have a name of a respondent to follow up with, and so that can make it hard to get to the point of being able to take specific action,‚Äù she said.
Klawunn said that a ‚Äúserious allegation‚Äù against a university organization could first warrant an interim investigatory suspension and then, depending on the charges, suspension or dismissal of the organization.
During public comment, students voiced disappointment with the university‚Äôs process for prosecuting offenders and a lack of support for sexual assault survivors.
‚ÄúI am so appalled by the lack of honesty and transparency on this campus,‚Äù fourth-year anthropology major Sarah Hamidi said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not just talking about sexual assault. I‚Äôm talking about the lack of transparency and honesty in housing and the lack of transparency of just anything that‚Äôs going on on this campus.‚Äù
‚ÄúI remember that first [SASA] panel in 2019,‚Äù Hamidi said. ‚ÄúWe had a solution and that solution was the taskforce, and I said, ‚ÄòOK, maybe the taskforce will work.‚Äô Here‚Äôs the problem: You invited the very same fraternities that are accused of committing sexual assault.‚Äù
Hamidi ‚Äî who referenced 2019 allegations of sexual assault against members of the Sigma Pi fraternity which were discussed at a SASA town hall two years ago ‚Äî said that the university should consider the abolition of UCSB‚Äôs Greek life organizations.
‚ÄúI really want us to think about, do we really need Greek life and fraternities to thrive and succeed in life? And to be honest with you? I don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù she said.
Alana Ulloa, a third-year history major, echoed Hamidi‚Äôs sentiments of disillusionment and disappointment.
‚ÄúI am very active in the sexual assault community because I am a survivor. I‚Äôm a multiple-time survivor. And being here at UCSB has changed my life for the worse,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúThis happens every single year, every single year in the beginning of the year in October, there are multiple back-to-back sexual assaults, and we know where they‚Äôre coming from. We know where they‚Äôre coming from,‚Äù Ulloa continued, referencing her belief that the ‚Äúoff-campus properties‚Äù reported in the timely warnings were fraternity properties.
‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve all worked here for many years,‚Äù she told the panelists. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre just doing the same thing. Every single quarter, you‚Äôre saying the same words out of your ass, every single quarter. I understand that there‚Äôs so much bureaucracy and politics to go into this, but these are our lives.‚Äù
After public comment, SASA members discussed their actionable demands for the university, which included including content warnings for all timely warnings, ensuring Clery Act coordinators work with the Campus Advocacy, Resources & Education office to make sure the warnings will not be triggering and making reporting resources for survivors ‚Äî including clarifying the nature of anonymous reports ‚Äî more accessible.
‚ÄúI wanted to say that I have listened very deeply and that even one report of sexual assault is more than I am comfortable having on our university. I care deeply about survivors and about sexual assault. We have listened very carefully tonight,‚Äù Klawunn said to attendees who had expressed frustration and anger with the university.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry to hear the amount of pain that we‚Äôve heard tonight from so many different people. I will be carrying that with me.‚ÄùLover is an unseen character in The Cat Lady.

Kansas
November 10, 2021
On November 10, 2021, an unknown female subject robbed the Wells Fargo Bank at 2000 W. 103rd St. in Leawood, Kansas. The subject approached the teller and produced a demand note. The suspect threatened a weapon, but none was shown. The suspect fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of currency in a grey or silver BMW sedan. There were no injuries.
Anyone with information is encouraged to call FBI Kansas City at 816-512-8200 or local law enforcement.
Field Office:
Kansas CityThe readers of this blog are no strangers to this strategy.
Some are actually trading it; others are not because the margin requirement is quite big at Rs. 14.50 lakhs.
This strategy is the enlarged version of Money In The Bank strategy.
Here we sell out of money PUTS for all the top 10 stocks ( By weight ) and hedge the trades by buying out of money NIFTY PUTS.
Stock puts are about 2-3% out of money and NIFTY put is 4% out of money.
Once set up, we do nothing but wait.
The series began on this blog from May 2020.
Took a break for some months in between due to no reason in particular but then decided to follow it through.
On Friday, the trades for October 2021 series were closed.
A profit of Rs. 58229 for the month.
Few days ago, the MTM profit was about Rs. 97000. The fall in TCS and HINDUNILVR brought it down.
What is done is done.
We move over to November series and review how the strategy has performed so far.
Review of 14 Months:
We go to the numbers straightaway.
The strategy has made a profit of Rs. 614796 in 14 months when the trades were set up.
There are 2 losing months out of 14.
We can say that profits are consistent.
I have mentioned earlier that the capital required is around Rs. 14.5 lakhs. We round off this to Rs. 1500000 for our calculations.
Profit over 14 months is 40.98%.
I will not call it spectacular but it is not bad either.
To have a fair assessment, we need the data for 24 months. So we keep going with this setup and see where that takes us.
For the present, the strategy is working just fine.
New readers will surely have more questions. Answers can be found in the post:
Thanks for reading.
Enjoy the Sunday holiday.

The Best ‚ÄòPacific Standard‚Äô Stories of 2016
This year brought quite a bit of change at Pacific Standard. We moved to Medium, redesigned the magazine, and continued to expand our robust daily news coverage‚Äîall with a full-time editorial staff of only 12 people.
That‚Äôs takes a lot of effort, but it‚Äôs also an extremely gratifying process, the best reward being the work itself. From our look at the people behind a safe-injection facility in Canada, to the tragic story of the Australian serviceman who flew halfway around the world to die alone on the side of a mountain, to an enlightening interview with Ralph Nader, we‚Äôre pushing hard to bring you the most innovative and impactful ideas of the day.
What follows are our picks for the year‚Äôs best Pacific Standard stories. Curating this was somewhat of an exercise in futility: Between the magazine and the website, there‚Äôs way too much to fit on a 15-item list. So click around and explore the site too; I guarantee you‚Äôll find something that piques your interest.
- ‚ÄúHow Can We Treat the Seriously Mentally Ill Before Tragedy Occurs, Instead of After?,‚Äù by Jeneen Interlandi
Like many people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, Thorpe suffered from anasognosia: the inability to grasp the true nature or extent of his own illness.
‚ÄúThese guys have an incredible responsibility, and we as citizens need to remind them of that responsibility.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is, women are twice punished. We are punished once for being women, and then again for not being able to work because we were women.‚Äù
‚ÄúBeing a ‚Äòman of action,‚Äô McKay would try to move through his depression. He would not stop until he was out of the manic mood or otherwise incapacitated.‚Äù
By the 19th century, the search for the Northwest Passage had become an obsession in Britain. Expeditions ventured out for years at a time, and the survivors returned with horror stories of scurvy and starvation, madness and death.
- ‚ÄúAn Election Season Conversation With Ralph Nader, the Nation‚Äôs No. 1 Public-Interest Crusader,‚Äù by Lydia DePillis
Justice means confronting power. It means getting controversial.
- ‚ÄúIn New York City, What‚Äôs the Difference Between a $240 Sushi Roll and a $6.95 Sushi Roll?,‚Äù by Greg Rosalsky
I began to think the restaurant was less a symbol of sushi egalitarianism and more a symbol of a neighborhood in the midst of demographic change.
Like the Kotex sanitary napkin before it, the tampon took off because it made working women‚Äôs lives easier.
‚ÄúThis is the best, most beautiful sign in all of Miskolc! We will win by a landslide with just this sign alone!‚Äù
You have turned over all your decision-making, even on the smallest level, to a set of professionals with an established protocol. That‚Äôs the deal: You do what they say, they save your life.
‚ÄúThey made me feel like a person, and that I was cared for even though I was lost.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is the nexus of climate, humans, and geology, and it is all happening right here.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre treating us like we‚Äôre at war, like we‚Äôre in Iraq right now. We‚Äôre in the United States of America. We‚Äôre in Indian country. And it‚Äôs not right.‚Äù
If the shipping industry were a country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world.
Month after month, sitting on an army camp stool in Iraq, he came to realize that the question was no longer whether he would transition, but how.Toggle navigation

Scope and Contents Note
Scope and Contents Note
The John Hiller Collection contains 216 glass autochromes dated c. 1910-1930. The images cover a wide array of subjects and regions, with many of them showing landscapes and travel destinations. Some show house interiors, flower arrangements, or casual groups of people. Several of the autochromes show historic towns and ruins in Greece and Switzerland along with some in Croatia, Italy, Bulgaria and Austria. Scattered amongst these are slides of various unidentified sites and gardens. It is not known if any of the unidentified images show sites in the United States.
The photographer(s) of these images is unknown. The uniformity of the type of tape used to seal each of the autochromes suggests that the images may be the work of one photographer or photo studio rather than a collection compiled by an individual from multiple sources, but this is speculative at best.
Administration
Immediate Source of Acquisition Note
John Hiller, an employee in the Smithsonian's Office of Exhibits Central, donated the collection to the Archives of American Gardens in 2005. The collection had been on deposit in the Archives for a few years prior to it being formally donated.
Custodial History note
John Hiller, an employee in the Smithsonian's Office of Exhibits Central, acquired the collection from John Wellemeyer sometime in the 1990s. According to Hiller, Wellemeyer was involved with filmmaking and purchased the box of autochromes at a yard sale, possibly in Alexandria, Virginia., John Hiller lantern slide collection.
Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements
While most of the lantern slides are autochromes, there is a possibility that some are dioptichromes.
Original Classification Scheme
Original Classification Scheme
The autochromes in the John Hiller Collection were originally housed in a wooden box divided into ten sections. A sheet of typewritten numbered image captions was pasted to the inside of the hinged box lid. Many of the autochromes bear a hand-written alpha-numeric code on their border (e.g. A-17, D-11, etc.) that is keyed to a specific caption. A few images have a small sticker with a hand-written number affixed to them. The sheet of image captions lists four broad subject categories at the top: House & Garden, Copies, Experimental, and Portraits. Below these are listed individual captions for (87) European sites. While the subject categories are written in English, some of the captions feature foreign words (Suisse for Switzerland, Wien for Vienna, etc.)
The autochromes were found in no discernible order and did not follow the order of the numbered captions.

Chateau Rauzan-Gassies 2016 is a blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot. The wine is matured in barrels, half of them are new.
The 2016 vintage is characterized by extreme weather conditions. Winter was followed by an extremely wet spring. The cool spring gave way to a warm and dry summer. Water retention was avoided, thanks to the quality of the terroir. Harvest began on September 29th and lasted until October 18th.
Chateau Rauzan-Gassies 2016 combines power and delicacy, with very ripe tannins. An incomparable balance between acidity and alcohol. A wine very similar to the 2005 vintage.
The 2016 Rauzan-Gassies has a relatively light, slightly herbaceous bouquet that does not quite deliver the exuberance of its fellow Margaux, although it is not underripe. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chewy tannin on the entry, those typical traits of damp undergrowth and a touch of greenness that leads to a balanced finish that just lacks the fruit intensity of others.Whether you‚Äôre looking for a solution to a pet problem or you just want to see some of the most highly recommended products in the industry, you‚Äôre in the right place.

It's not clear to me how to use this extension. I find a status that I would like to screenshot and click the camera icon below the top-right three dots. Then a blue button with an arrow and the text "screenshot top" appears above the status, but then nothing else happens. It's unclear how to proceed from there. Ideally there should be an option to insert a "screenshot bottom" somewhere, but it's not apparent how this is done? I've tried clicking seemingly everywhere, but nothing happens.EUROPE - Duet Private Equity has achieved a second close on its European Real Estate Debt fund by raising capital from both the private and public markets.
The company has raised ¬£50m (‚Ç¨57.6m) by listing a new entity, Duet Real Estate Finance, on the London Stock Exchange, while attracting a further ¬£25m through direct commitments to the fund from European institutional investors.
Duet Real Estate Finance is the only UK-listed company focused primarily on investing in mezzanine debt for European commercial real estate.
Duet is seeking to generate returns by providing mezzanine finance to existing property owners, thereby capitalising on the current gap in the European lending markets.
Significant falls in asset values, increased capital requirements and the overall need to reduce balance-sheet size are forcing banks to reduce their real estate exposure.
There is currently a significant supply/demand imbalance for real estate debt, and the Duet fund has already provided close to ¬£60m of debt capital through five separate transactions.
This includes providing mezzanine financing for 17 Columbus Courtyard in London, alongside Partners Group.
Dale Lattanzio, managing director at Duet Private Equity, said: "There are many opportunities to be uncovered in the European commercial real estate debt market - knowing where to look and executing them is the key. We're looking forward to investing the enlarged assets of the fund.
"A number of investors continue to show interest in the strategy, and we intend to work with these investors with a view to increasing the overall size of the fund."A few weeks ago, I mentioned to a friend that I had just finished a video interview with NJ‚Äôs Health Commissioner for our Women‚Äôs Empowerment Series and our podcast. ‚ÄúOh, Judith Persichilli?‚Äù she said. Clearly, she was very excited. It was like I interviewed a rock star, which maybe I had.
I was surprised. ‚ÄúHow do you know her name?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been watching her. I love her. She‚Äôs so smart!‚Äù
And that she is.
Judith Persichilli has been managing the state‚Äôs medical response to Covid. Unlike many health commissioners in the country, she‚Äôs a nurse ‚Äì the first nurse to hold the position in NJ. And while she spent much of her career in hospital administration, she started in the ICU. So this government official has a unique professional history to manage this critical disease.
I asked her if being a nurse has helped during the crisis. She talked about the education nurses receive, how they take many of the same science classes physicians take. She said nurses are trained to bring science to the bedside and to the community. ‚ÄúThat makes all the difference,‚Äù she said.
I‚Äôve watched Comm. Persichilli at most of the Governor‚Äôs daily press briefings, but I didn‚Äôt know much about her until I was on another video interview with AtlantiCare‚Äôs CEO Lori Herndon and Inspira‚Äôs CEO Amy Mansue. (This was also for the Women‚Äôs Empowerment Series.) They talked about the Commissioner and became quite passionate when they noted that most people had no idea a nurse was doing so much to help the state. Her department, they said, communicated openly and frequently with all New Jersey hospitals to be sure they had what they needed.
‚ÄúShe pushed us to do things that, candidly, I‚Äôm not sure any of us thought we could do: double our ICUs, double med-surg capacity, train people in 6 weeks on new techniques. She deserves a lot of credit for the fact that we‚Äôre still standing and we‚Äôre moving forward,‚Äù Amy told me.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of her,‚Äù Lori said. Amy agreed, ‚ÄúI am too.‚Äù
My interview with the Commissioner was a day after she returned from a self-imposed quarantine. One of her staff members had tested positive, so she followed guidelines and stayed home. She wore her mask during our video interview, and I was surprised how I was still able to see warmth and kindness even with half of her face covered. Not many people can do that.
I‚Äôve always thought what makes a leader exceptional is when they can combine competence with compassion. You don‚Äôt see it often, and I happen to think when you do see it, the leader is usually a woman. Not always, but often. With Comm. Persichilli, her knowledge was apparent throughout the interview, but her empathy became especially clear at the end of our talk, when I asked what she would say to people who don‚Äôt wear masks.
She started speaking just as she had been, ‚ÄúHelp yourself. It‚Äôs protecting yourself and your loved ones. Right now, our biggest increase in cases is in younger individuals 18 ‚Äì 40.‚Äù
And then she slowed down, and her voice became filled with emotion. ‚ÄúOur largest number of deaths are those in their 70s and 80s. So younger people must be infecting and transmitting this virus to older individuals. Their aunts, their uncles, their grandparents, maybe their own parents.‚Äù She paused. And began to speak even slower. I knew she was feeling every word of what she said next.
‚ÄúThose individuals are dying. Wake up. Wake up and wear your mask.‚Äù
I hope a change that comes out of 2020 is we begin to notice what words matter most and what actions have the greatest impact. Then we‚Äôll understand who our rock stars really are.

What to Look For When Buying Best Tennis Racket for Beginners?
When one talks of tennis rackets for beginners, there must be many points to be considered. If you try to pick the best tennis racket from the market, then things can get very tricky. If you don‚Äôt have an idea about tennis rackets, then there is a high possibility you will end up buying the inferior product.
To help you out, we have mentioned a buyer‚Äôs guide that can help you with buying the best according to your choice. These points will help you to pick up the best fit for you.
Type of tennis racket
There are a number of types of tennis rackets available in the market, out of which they could be categorized into three main categories.
- The power rackets
- The control racket
- Tweener rackets
The power rackets are very special rackets that can help a player to get real power while playing tennis. There is a significant beginner problem seen while selecting the power rackets.
Beginners often don‚Äôt understand the power by which they should hit a ball with these rackets to get the best results. Hence you must lookout for a power racket that generates limited power according to your use.
The control racket gives you excellent control over your stroke and if you are someone who is looking to get better in the game. Probably this is the best type of racket a beginner should use. If you get reasonable control of your game, you can go for other tennis rackets easily.
The third one or the tweener tennis racket is somewhat in between both of these rackets, and it is often used for general practice uses.
Head size
Head size is something significant to be considered while selecting a tennis racket. The manufacturers of tennis rackets basically manufacture rackets according to different head sizes. These head sizes are customized according to gender, age, and size.
If you are a beginner, then always try holding the tennis racket in your hand and swing it to get an idea about the best head size that suits you.
On the other hand, you must consider the transportation of the tennis racket an essential factor. Oversized head-size tennis rackets are very hard to carry to different places.
Grip
The grip of the tennis racket is also something to be considered before you select a racket for use. You never want to get a lousy grip on your tennis racket.
If you get a terrible grip while playing, there are high chances that your tennis racket slips from your hand, and in this case, you won‚Äôt be able to generate the power required in the stroke.
Wire strength
Basically, there are two types of wires or strings used in tennis rackets. There could be natural or synthetic strings used in tennis rackets. Synthetic strings are always preferred, and natural ones are not that great and famous these days.
The synthetic strings are very durable and can sustain a vast amount of pressure. It is a good option for beginners.
Natural wires are not that good with durability, and they are made from cows‚Äô intestines, which could be offensive to a few people, and synthetic is always a better option.
Frame
The frame and its durability depend on the material by which the frame is made. You never expect a plastic frame to play professional tennis; hence you must choose a durable and robust frame.
Many beginners get attracted to funky-looking frames and end up selecting bad frames. But we will suggest getting a frame that will last long.
Conclusion
If you are a beginner, then always look for your comfort in any sporting equipment. The other things to look out for would be the group and the head size of the racket.
The OPPUM 27‚Ä≥ Pro Tennis rackets -2PCS, for Adult Women and Men Students is a perfect tennis racket for beginners. However, all the Tennis rackets mentioned in the article are great, but if you talk of the best, the OPPUM 27‚Ä≥ takes the lead.Erie observer. (Erie, Pa.) 1830-1853, June 05, 1847, Image 1

He who would coittetn-i, plate in all its splendor, the strange and mg nil cett panornMa of- the capital and vicinity (;I.llextco, should ascend, just before sunset, to the top of one . _of ' the timers of the noble cathedral. At sixty leagues distant, bound ing and circling the horizon pn every‚Ä¢side, he pei‚Ä¢ceives the gigantic peaks of the COrdiller asl4 To the south, two volcanoes tower ma jeltically glove the Sierra, their summits cov e ledwith eternal snows, and tinted by the,l rays of the setting sun, with a hue 'of rieb, rosy pur'ple. One of them,..Popordar)ell (the sinokinglmountain) is shaped like a o e, pier cing thelazure heaven with its sh r apex; the othe4 litaczihnall (*whit ' voman) iSi , takes the form of a cotiehing nymph, lifting her shOulders of ice to the last caress s of the departing day. - At the foot Of these v dcannea' i l are three beautiful sparkling lakes r - rom the inirr6r-like surface Of which the cl uds are reflected, and on whose bosom the cy nets re wont to disport themselves.

CC;vering the mountain upon which it is built, in undulations like billows of ver dure, are forest of cedar, of the growth of cen turies, From the summit of this same moun-. ii:in, there gnslies,forth a stream, flowing to the plain over ifiihundred arches of an ague duct, which conveys it and distributes it to the poptilous city. To the : right, to the left, on every side, are villages, steeples; and cu poles, dotting the surface of: )the - , smiling val ley. Dusty roads int.ersecteachpher in ev ery direction, in ‚Ä¢ apnearance kilfe,ribbons of _gold carved i out on the verdufe, orlurther in the distance, like streams of wates There, too, the weeping willow bends its dishevelled branches before the breeze, ,and there, a palm tree rears its isolated trunk, above die masses of odorous orous l Ifoliage, that meets the eye at every point. r But noW turn your gaze from the distant plains and the grander features of the tableau, and fix your attention Upon the city itself, or rather' upon what is at your feet. Mingled arid scattered over the checker board-like ap pearance of the houses, - and the terraces or namented with flowers, rise the turret's ofof the churches, and their domes of yellow and blue porcelain,‚Ä¢ like an immense bourrt. The houses with their gay painted walls and,bal :conies covered with fancy patterned chintz, have ever a sort of festive, holiday ter. The Cathedral occupies one side i,f the Plaza Mayor* towering above the Presidency Pal ace; a low parallelogram, in which is located also, a prison, a botanic garden, barracks for troops, and the two Chambers. The Ayanta mienlo (city hall) forms with the palace a right ,angle, extending to the portal of .the Florian and the Parian, two vast commercial depots. Here grouped beneath the shadow ~of 4he Church, are assembled the Legislative and Exbcutive power, the city government, the coMmerce, in fact all of Mexico, almost, that constitutes the organization of a nation. i'rom the streets of San Domingo, San Fran cisco, Tacuba, de la Monnaie, de la Blood cel a, the populace in one restless, ever-chan gi g and ever-renewing stream, pour forth up in the' Plaza.

Here is r 'the iladre with his great chap au, elbowing the ;'ranciscan in his blue frock circled round his waist 'pith a! silken cord and his great felt hat: therepaiises the Dominiciau in his lugn briou's , white and black costumes, reminding us of thedays of Torquemada and the holy Inquisition, and last, the brown frock of the Capuchin contrasts with the white draperies and flounces of the brother of Mercy. These are scene. and incidents to be observed con tinually among that mottled multitude. . Pres ently,the roll of the drum is heard from the barracks, . the doors of 'the Sanctuari are thrown open, and forth comes a hearse spark ling with Alit. Then the sound of a bell min gles with the roll of the drum, and that im mense crowd uncover themselves, and kneel-' ing, bow their heads before the llost,‚Ä¢which is being borne to some dying person. Thii, before the Or+oni is the general as pect of 'the Plaza Mayor‚Äîthat great forum in which the people ef Mexico‚Äîthe sovereign i`tieople‚Äî(for so their flatterers style them,) in all all their rags and tinsel, seek for and settle upon a new master for the morrow, after de terthining upon the sacrifice .of the one of the day previous. Ignoralit of, or indifferent' to 'any thing like settled principles in politics, and mistaking unbridled disorder for liberty, they seem not even to imagine that those re-. peated attacks of anarchy will soon destroy the worm-eaten body of their strange repub lic which after but twenty-five years of 'exis tence libs already gone to decay. Every night, at the first tinklingof the An gelus, and as if-hy enchantment, all noises are hushed on de Plaza,, and the crowd become motionless as statues. But when the last sounds of the bells have scarce ceased to vi brate in the air, the busy movement is renew ed, and the mob becomes one, in every sense.. The carriages drive off, the cavaliers gallop away, the pedestrians. separate, some fruiter than others, but all with sufficient celerity to escape the sword of the /azo, and the , bold thieves' who rob and assassinate their vi ctims often in the open day, and in sight of aii.o‚Äî By night the square is deserted: a few perhaps '. in the light of the moon promenade the pave ment before the church, while some others ore carelessly balancing themselves upon the iron-, chains which are swung between the granite pillars of th, Sanctuari. The day having ended, the scenes of night‚Ä¢begin, and thole iferos become for a while sole masters of the oity. ,The lepera is one of the strangest pe- ' culiarities of Mexican , society. An.l those wl;c1 would see the city of Mexicans it is,' should not see it only as it appears, when en livened by the gay crowd which promenade the Plaza. It is when plunged in the' sinister 4 -- silence of night, that an.estimate can best be formed of the strange and repulsive character i of the Mexican laze one. The lepero com bines at once the characteristics of a brave man and of p poltroon‚Äîis at once calm and .violeriP‚Äîfahatic and incredulous--never think ing of Gocl‚Ä¢as the Just, hOt eves evincing a salutary terror of the Davil'. He is an eter nal gambler, a Brawler from association, a thief by instinct, is at times sober and at others intemperate, and most 'inveterately lazy and indolent, is careless alike whether of good or bad fortune. At times a porter,'a mason, a coachman, a street paver, or a-trader, you meet with the lepero every where. Yoh %yill find him in all places, pursuihg the vocation which he may prefer‚Äîat the cliiiroltes,.pro eeSsions or the pliblic shoWs‚Äîand always to tge detriment of‚Äòhia 'assistants. Prodigal when he has money, the /epee') is none the less resigned to his poverty'. If he finds himself in the 'morning posses. sufficient ing to serve him Tor the day, he de 'cotes it to idleness. Careless orthe 'morrow, the precariousness 'of his' resources often bring him to a state of ac tual %%ant. Perfectly devoid .of care, and awarethiithe has nothing to fear from thievei, enveloping hip - elf in his rifgged .mantle, he throws himself down in an attitude half lying and half sitting upon the pavement or upon some doorstep. There, touching languidly his jaronu. (a sort of guitar) he contemplates %9.h half closed, drowsy , eyes, the pulqueria (or drinking shop) where his credit is despis ed, or lends a careless ear to the hissing and sputtering of the neighboring frying-pan.: ' By and by; he girds fixound him ingre closely the cord which forins his girdle, breakfa,sts in tho sunlight, and then lazily' puffing his cigar, falls asleep: I have ray foibles, I confess: In contem plating the idle and busy ciowd who are night ly attracted to the Plaza Mayor, my attention neglecting t 4c. more elite of the promenaders, had for some time been attracted to a ragged group, who presented in themselves, one of the most melancholy, and at the same time, truest types of Mexioan society.

As the pandemic upended nearly every single aspect of life, there were countless honeymoons that were postponed along the way.
‚ÄúWhat started out as a two-week shutdown to flatten the curve ended up being a twelve-month rollercoaster that left resort doors shuttered, borders closed and an endless number of flights canceled,‚Äù explains Kayla LeClerc, owner of Whimsical Wishes Travel Concierge. ‚ÄúCouples who had planned honeymoons or destination weddings also suffered as their once-in-a-lifetime trips were canceled. And in some cases, their money remained tied up with tour operators that were trying to survive. ‚Äú
The Future of Honeymoon Travel
The good news is that we‚Äôve come so far, especially in recent months. Thanks to an impressive mass vaccination effort, the future of travel (even international travel) looks very bright. ‚ÄúWe are now finding that fully vaccinated travelers have more options and more freedom (with little or no quarantine). Non-vaccinated travelers have different protocols with more restrictions and longer quarantine, ‚Äùsays Teresa Belcher, travel agent and founder of Honeymoon Islands, Inc.
The demand for travel is at an all-time high. Couples are looking to re-book the honeymoon plans that were canceled. You also have newlyweds looking to finally have the honeymoon of their dreams. The tricky part for travel agents is making up for a year of hardly any business during such a busy time. ‚ÄúThose who were forced to cancel or postpone travel plans pivoted to 2021,‚Äù says Belcher. Now it‚Äôs a challenge to find availability for couples planning for the first time.
Stephanie Goldberg-Glazer, owner of Live Well, Travel Often, has both planned and canceled countless trips during the past year. ‚ÄúOne couple, who was supposed to go to Europe in 2019, had an emergency medical issue and had to cancel, so we rescheduled for 2020,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúNow, we have rescheduled them for this summer in Hawaii.‚Äù Another one of her couples, who married in November 2020, planned a domestic getaway to New Mexico and Arizona right after their wedding, but really wanted to go to Tahiti and New Zealand. ‚ÄúWe planned the big Tahiti and New Zealand trip for late this year, hoping that New Zealand will open their borders in time,‚Äù she says.
Where to Honeymoon Next
Planning your honeymoon and have yet to decide on a destination? Consider these hotspots that travel experts are recommending to their clients.
Hawaii
If you‚Äôre looking to stay in the United States but want a beachy destination that is off the beaten path, consider Hawaii. ‚ÄúPacked with gorgeous beaches and breathtaking sights, Hawaii will be more popular in the next two years because it‚Äôs still considered domestic travel ‚Äî no passport required,‚Äù says LeClerc. ‚ÄúThe ability to hop between islands is unique to Hawaii. It‚Äôs important to note, however, that the islands vary in terms of what they offer travelers. For this reason, LeClerc recommends working with a professional travel agent who can help guide you in the right direction.
WGM Says: Dreaming of a Hawaiian honeymoon? We crafted the perfect 6-night itinerary for Lanai!
The Maldives
This tiny little archipelago in South Asia has long been in-demand for honeymooners. It‚Äôs tropical, loaded with 5-star resorts clad with overwater bungalows and has incredible weather year round. Because overwater bungalows are ideal for social distancing, Goldberg-Glazer highly recommends this spot for 2021 travelers.
Dubai
Ranked safe for traveling by the World Health Organization, this city and emirate in the UAE, has vaccinated more than 85 percent of their population, notes Belcher. ‚ÄúYou can combine Eastern and Western Culture with a Dubai city known for great restaurants and unique shopping at bargain prices with a 2-3 night stay in the desert,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhile in the desert, experience glamping, sandboarding, riding camels, a romantic dessert tent dinner, etc.‚Äù
St. Lucia
This island in the Eastern Caribbean was a popular honeymoon destination before the pandemic. LeClerc anticipates that it will continue to be post-pandemic. ‚ÄúThe landscape in St. Lucia is what makes it so attractive to honeymooners ‚Äî soaring mountains, sweeping rainforest, coral reefs and volcanic sand beaches,‚Äù she says. Since you‚Äôre likely flying into Hewanorra Airport (UVF), on the southern tip of the island, when most of the most popular resorts are located on the northern tip of the island, she recommends skipping the two hour shuttle ride and booking a helicopter transfer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll soar above the island and will likely get to your resort in 15-20 minutes,‚Äù she adds.
Greek Islands
‚ÄúSimilar to St. Lucia, this was a destination that was booming for pre-pandemic honeymooners,‚Äù says LeClerc. Now that Greece is fully open to vaccinated travelers, she thinks couples will feel confident planning their travel there in the next year or two. ‚ÄúI find that most of my couples are enamored by the islands, which are known for their vibrant nightlife and beautiful beaches,‚Äù she says. She recommends planning to visit and stay on at least two islands while you‚Äôre there. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not all the same and you‚Äôll have different experiences; packing up and making the move is worth it, ‚Äùshe adds.
Iceland
If you‚Äôre open to a honeymoon destination that‚Äôs a bit off the beaten path and doesn‚Äôt involve a tropical beach, Iceland may be a great option for you. In fact, it continues to be extremely popular and is gaining interest by honeymooners, according to Goldberg-Glazer. ‚ÄúThere are so many wonderful adventures,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHiking on a glacier, snorkeling between the tectonic plates, the Blue Lagoon, and more. It is a perfect trip for adventure seekers ‚Äù. Bonus: Iceland is currently open to vaccinated individuals.
Italy
For honeymooners looking for a romantic European getaway, Italy has always been a top choice ‚Äî and people are itching to go back! Goldberg-Glazer predicts that Italy will continue to be super popular with honeymooners looking for a part city-part beach, or part city-part wine country honeymoon. ‚ÄúReally, is there anything more romantic than a Tuscan sunset with a glass of wine in hand overlooking a gorgeous vineyard?‚Äù she asks.
Croatia
This gorgeous country situated between central and eastern Europe on the coast of the Adriatic Sea has long been a popular honeymoon destination. ‚ÄúCroatia has a little bit of everything ‚Äî a stunning coastline, national parks, and a rich culture,‚Äù says LeClerc. ‚ÄúCouples who want to lay on the beach and snorkel, hike a mountain or gorge, and take a historical tour on their honeymoon can do all of it in Croatia.‚Äù Currently Croatia is open for fully vaccinated travelers, which is another reason why travel agents are recommending it to their honeymoon clients.
Ready to book your honeymoon? Here are some words of wisdom from travel pros
Hire a professional planner:
‚ÄúTraveling isn‚Äôt as easy as it used to be, even domestically,‚Äù says LeClerc. ‚ÄúMy number one priority as a travel advisor is to listen to my couples. I get a clear vision of their honeymoon and I help them bring it to life. ‚Äù
Book your honeymoon early:
Belcher urges couples not to assume that flights to their desired location will be cheap and available whenever they‚Äôre ready to book it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult to find availability because we are dealing with two years of travel crammed all in one year,‚Äù she says. She recommends booking as early as possible to score the best deals.
Purchase insurance:
This was something that most travel agents recommended their clients do prior to the pandemic, but now it‚Äôs mandatory, according to Belcher. ‚ÄúMany countries are requiring you to purchase cancellation insurance that also covers medical expenses should you contract covid during your vacation,‚Äù she says.
Be flexible:
If you‚Äôre planning to take your honeymoon in the next 6-8 months, LeClerc says couples should still be flexible. ‚ÄúThings are still changing. CDC guidance is being updated almost weekly. Destinations are working on their entry requirements. And as of today, COVID tests are still required for a return to the US when traveling internationally, ‚Äùshe says. ‚ÄúThis is another plug for working with a travel advisor. They‚Äôll keep you up-to-date on everything and make sure you‚Äôre prepared to travel when the time comes. ‚Äú
The bottom line? If you‚Äôre hoping to go on a honeymoon in the next year, start planning now. There are so many wonderful places out there that are yearning for tourists. And really ‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt we all ready for a giant vacation ?!If a charged particle accelerates (moves faster, slower or changes direction), it produces both an electric field (because the particle is charged) and a magnetic field (because the particle is moving).
Does a moving charge particle produce both electric and magnetic.
Does a moving electric field create a magnetic field?
Similarly, every time you change an electric field, you create a magnetic field. This is called the Maxwell-Ampere Law. The interesting thing is that a changing electric field creates a changing magnetic field, which creates a changing electric field, which creates a changing magnetic field, and so on.
Why does moving charge produce electric field?
Moving charged particles create a magnetic force field. Accelerating charged particles produce changing electric and magnetic force fields which propagate as EM waves.
What charge produces electric field?
Electric field is the force experienced by a test charge that has a value of +1 .
Why does a moving electric field create..
Can static charge produce electric field?
A static electric field (also referred to as electrostatic field) is created by charges that are fixed in space; A static magnetic field is created by a magnet or charges that move as a steady flow (as in appliances using direct current).
What happens when an electron is accelerated?
Now, the acceleration of an electron takes place under a voltage called acceleration voltage. If accelerated electrons should lose energy, they would eventually encounter the atomic nucleus, so that the atom would eventually cease to exist.I cannot survive in a 140- or 280-character world, so here are more tweets that grew up to be too big for Twitter‚Ä¶
To say Johnny Manziel‚Äôs debut as a starting quarterback in three-down, 12-man football was a disaster is to say the Hindenburg had a bumpy landing.
Seriously. This was bad. Hermann Goering had a better day at Nurenburg.
As first impressions go, this was your daughter‚Äôs high school prom date showing up at the door with a six-pack and hitting on her mom.
Johnny Football came, he saw, he did not conquer. He became Johnny Four Picks. He spent much of the night in flight, frantically trying to escape the clutches of large, angry men. I swear, we haven‚Äôt seen a man run this much since Forrest Gump decided to skedaddle across America.
Those expecting, or hoping, to see the second coming of Joe Theismann or Doug Flutie instead saw ample evidence that Manziel might be Vince Ferragamo the Sequel.
Ferragamo, in his brief fling with the Montreal Alouettes in 1981, never could quite figure out the 12th man on defence in the Canadian Football League, that guy who kept popping up like an uninvited house guest. That 12th man pilfered 25 of Vince‚Äôs passes. Manziel might toss that many picks by Labor Day.
None of this is to suggest that Johnny Four Picks was solely responsible for the 50-11 paddywhacking the Als absorbed at the hands of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on Friday night at Percival Molson Stadium in Montreal, but let‚Äôs not sugar-coat what went down in his CFL baptism: He was gawdawful. Here‚Äôs the bottom line for the National Football League washout and former Heisman Trophy winner with Texas A&M: 20 tosses, 11 completions, 104 yards, 0 touchdowns, four interceptions.
Manziel finished the game where he should have started it‚Äîon the sideline. He was as unpolished as an old hobo‚Äôs shoes.
Apparently, this all escaped the notice of one TSN gum-flapper. Davis Sanchez, who loses credibility each time he parts his lips to allow unfiltered thought to become words, actually gave Manziel a passing grade in three of four categories.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to equate it to an SAT without really studying,‚Äù Sanchez said before handing out a report card that included a B (composure), a C+ (creativity), a C- (arm strength/accuracy), and one F (decision-making).
That‚Äôs like giving Neymar a gold star for staying on his feet for more than five seconds. Don‚Äôt we all wish we had Sanchez to grade our exams in school?
Sanchez wasn‚Äôt the only talking head at TSN to fluff up Manziel‚Äôs face plant on Friday. Jock Climie and Glen Suitor both tried to apply lipstick to that pig.
Here‚Äôs Suitor: ‚ÄúWe have to temper our analysis. There were flashes. We saw him escape, we saw him create, we saw him improvise.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs Climie: ‚ÄúIs there a positive in this? It looked to me like Manziel was just going out there and learning. It looked to me like he stopped keeping score, which is the right thing to do. It didn‚Äôt matter, one, two, three interceptions‚Ä¶he just kept slinging it, because he‚Äôs learning the game. If he can keep that mentality, I think this could be a growing process. I think he will learn more from doing what he‚Äôs doing here than he will learn from sitting on the bench. I‚Äôm just saying, there could be a positive to this, and we did see some positives. Some of his flashes of brilliance, some of his scrambling around, I thought was impressive.‚Äù
It was left for two former quarterbacks, Matt Dunigan and Henry Burris, to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the unvarnished truth.
‚ÄúAfter four practices, this is what you expect,‚Äù Dunigan growled when it was all over. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a process that‚Äôs painfully long and it takes a lot of effort, more than four practices. This was fully expected. I don‚Äôt think they got anywhere down the road by starting him tonight.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt speed up that process,‚Äù Burris sang in concert. ‚ÄúThat was a bad decision by (Montreal). Vernon Adams should have been the starting quarterback.‚Äù
Most shameful comment about Manziel was delivered by old friend Rod Black, who, in his post-match analysis, said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs faced a lot of adversity, let‚Äôs face it, in his life.‚Äù Oh, FFS, Blackie. Most of Manziel‚Äôs wounds have been self-inflicted, the product of booze, drugs, barroom brawling and leading a frat boy lifestyle. You want to talk about adversity? Talk about Colleen Crawley. That‚Äôs the woman Manziel beat up and threatened to kill.
Terrific piece in the Winnipeg Free Press by Mike Sawatzky about the night the Winnipeg Blue Bombers blew the doors off the aforementioned Ferragamo and a talent-laded Alouettes outfit, 58-2, in 1981. It‚Äôs a lengthy read but worth the time, because Sawatzky talked to all the key players and they provide delicious anecdotal insight.
I note that former defensive tackle Bryant Turner signed a one-day contract so he could retire as a Blue Bomber. Hmmm. I can think of plenty of guys I wish had only signed with Winnipeg FC for one day then got lost, starting with Jeff Reinebold. Actually, Jeff was a fun guy. He just wasn‚Äôt cut out to be a head coach.
Not sure what to make of Daren Millard‚Äôs departure from Sportsnet after 20 years. I remember him as a freshly scrubbed kid broadcaster in Winnipeg, and I believe it was Joe Pascucci who had the smarts to bring him from Brandon to River City. Daren is one of the truly good guys, and there were days when his voice of reason was the only thing that made Hockey Central at Noon bearable. Having said that, there were times last winter when I didn‚Äôt think his heart was in it. Perhaps having Damien Cox as a guest once too often sours a guy.
Also leaving his gig is Scott Campbell, who, for the past couple of National Hockey League seasons, has been scribbling good stuff about the Jets for the Free Press. Apparently Scotty is the victim of budget cuts, or the Drab Slab plans to spend its freelance coin in other areas. Perhaps they‚Äôll use it to cover local sports other than the pro outfits in town.
A week ago, I detailed how both the Freep and Winnipeg Sun had abandoned their own community, vis-a-vis local amateur athletes. Well, Exhibit A would be the July 31 edition of the Sun, which had 16 sports pages (including cover). Here‚Äôs the damning evidence of neglect:
* 5-page feature (including cover) on Tranna Blue Jays prospect Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who‚Äôs with the Triple A Buffalo Bisons.
* 1 page on the trade that sent Tranna Blue Jays relief pitcher Roberto Osuna to the Houston Astros.
* 1 page on pro golfer Brooke Henderson (with a small sidebar on Rink Rat Scheifele of the Winnipeg Jets joining the field for the Players Cup tournament, which tees off at Southwood later this month).
* 2-page feature on now-retired Jarome Iginla, the face of the Calgary Flames for so many years.
* 1 page on Johnny Manziel.
* 1 page on the Saskatchewan Roughriders.
* 1 page on the Tranna Argonauts.
* 1 page on the Ottawa RedBlacks.
* 2 pages of agate.
* 1 page on the Winnipeg Goldeyes.
Do the math and it adds up to seven of 16 pages devoted to athletes and outfits from the Republic of Tranna‚Äîin a Winnipeg newspaper!
Boffo stuff from John Lott of The Athletic Tranna on the Blue Jays unloading relief pitcher Roberto Osuna, who still faces a domestic violence charge: ‚ÄúGood riddance. Whatever their motives‚Äîand the tea leaves present murky messages‚Äîthe Blue Jays did a good thing. Not because of the return they received in the trade, but because they rubbed out an unsightly stain on an organization looking for model citizens to lead their impending youth movement.‚Äù
The Houston Astros, who accepted Osuna in barter with the Blue Jays, claim to have a ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy on domestic violence. As if. What the Astros have is ‚Äúninth-inning tolerance.‚Äù That is to say, as long as Osuna can get batters out in the ninth inning and help them win another World Series title, they don‚Äôt care if he hits women.
This is rich: Jerry Jones has threatened to fire any of his Dallas Cowboys who stay in the lockerroom or take a knee during the playing of the American national anthem prior to NFL games, yet he‚Äôs been observed talking and yukking it up, also wearing a Cowboys ball cap, while the Star Spangled Banner played at practice. Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen called out the Cowboys owner for his hypocrisy.
And, finally, best quote of the week came from former Calgary Flames radio play-by-play guy Peter Maher, a very nice man who had this to say about now-retired forward Jarome Iginla‚Äôs 60-plus fights in the NHL: ‚ÄúI think he won them all. At least he did on the radio.‚ÄùNeo4j is a native graph database that stores data as graphs rather than in tables so you can traverse any depth of data in real time and get your queries executed in milliseconds instead of minutes (or hours!).

I am fantabulously excited to let you know that the ABBA novel, as was its working title, now has not only a launch date (September) but an actual cover (see below). The blurb and a sample chapter is now available here. Thank you Fremantle Press for such an inviting cover to the story of Mel, Shell and Scary Sharon; horses, rollerskating, and puppies; and how we think about the past in the present.
1979 was the year of ABBA‚Äôs Voulez Vous, rollerskating, Skylab (incomparably written about by Meg McKinlay), the Mucky Duck Bush Band, Leela as Tom Baker‚Äôs companion in Dr Who, and the Year of the Child.
[Aboriginal readers please note: the text below contains references to people who have died].
If you were a primary school kid in Western Australia in 1979, it was hard to miss the whipped up enthusiasm around the celebrations of 150 years of white settlement.
Less commonly mentioned in schools was that at 1979‚Äôs New Years Eve concert, Noongar leader Ken Colbung, hired to play the didgeridoo, handed the Governor an eviction notice, wittily reproduced on the same form as those presented to Aboriginal people being evicted from Homeswest properties.
I remember wondering (possibly due to reading the Little House on the Prairie series) what had happened to the Aboriginal people who had been around in 1829, and dug in the banks of the Canning river to see if I could find their artifacts (I didn‚Äôt realise their descendants were all around, despite the government‚Äôs best efforts). I tried to imagine what Perth would have looked like without all the roads and buildings, and felt sad, imagining how those people would have felt, watching the boats come in.
I am so proud of this book, and grateful for the continuing connection I have with old primary school buddies who helpfully supplied memories, anecdotes, cartoon names, and jingle earworms. Thanks to the fun nostalgia of the Perth Reflects Facebook Group (and Warren Duffy). Thanks to the patient staff at the State Library of WA for providing a haven and microfiche self service üôÇ
And most especially, thanks to Dr Nobbly James, to whom the book is dedicated, and whose continuing friendship, wisdom, wit, and ABBA paraphernalia is appreciated beyond words.
Congratulations, Julia! It looks, and sounds, wonderful! x

Congrats on the new book, mate! And check out your memorabilia; what a haul. I think I‚Äôve got a lapel pin somewhere but that‚Äôs the extent of it. So weird that we both zeroed in on 1979, albeit for different reasons. In fact, I ignored the 150th on purpose because it was just getting in the way. Really looking forward to the book ‚Äì it‚Äôs bound to be unreal! üôÇ

At one point in time almost all of us have experienced eye twitches, but for most individuals this eye condition subsides on its own fairly quickly and is not serious. However, for some eye twitching can be persistent and last for several days or weeks, and can be a sign of something more serious.
So, why does your eyelid twitch?
By the time a patient walks into my office, the number one question he or she has is how do I make my eye stop twitching? Well, the key is finding the underlying cause.
Unfortunately, there can be several causes for this eye condition, including:
- Allergies
- Caffeine
- Eye strain
- Alcohol
- Stress
- Tiredness
- Eye dryness
- Nerve issues
All but the last cause, nerve issues, are not serious and come under the umbrella of benign causes. Therefore, you shouldn‚Äôt worry if your eye twitching falls under the benign causes since once the underlying factor is eliminated the twitching should subside.
Those who experience twitching due to neurological issues; however, should seek immediate assistance from an optometrist to determine appropriate treatment.
When to see an optometrist about your eye twitching?
- Twitching which has persisted for longer than a few days
- Severed twitching
- If the affected eye appears to have discharge, redness, or is swollen
If you experience any of the above symptoms you should immediately consult with an eye doctor.
Dr. Sharma always emphasises the importance for regular eye checkups so the health of the eyes can be assessed, and to identify more serious issues like nerve disorders, which can result in the diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs or Tourette‚Äôs syndrome.
The eyes are really the window to the soul and can help identify more than just eye conditions! For more information please feel free to contact Dr. Sharma at 250-920-0755.I found this slide in an investor presentation:

Support diversity scholarships for Earth Activist Trainings! Photo by Brooke Porter Photography
Two dear friends were co-hosting with me. Both were friends of mine, but didn‚Äôt know each other. Marcia Falk, is a brilliant poet, liturgist, author and feminist rooted within the Jewish tradition. She‚Äôs written many books of liturgy in both English and Hebrew, including her latest, The Days Between: Blessings, Poems, and Directions of the Heart for the Jewish High Holiday Season. Kate Raphael is a lifelong, courageous activist for LGBT rights, justice for Palestine, and many, many sorts of peace and justice work, and an author of a great mystery novel set in the West Bank, Murder Under the Bridge.
At that time, a new tradition was circulating in the LGBT rights community, based on a story that two lesbians had approached a rabbi and asked, ‚ÄúWhat is the place of a lesbian in Judaism?‚Äù The rabbi had purportedly answered, ‚ÄúThe place of a lesbian in Judaism is like the place of a piece of chametz on the seder plate.‚Äù
Now chametz, for those of you who don‚Äôt know the tradition, is yeast bread or bread-related substance, and one of the core strictures of the Passover holiday is to banish all bread and anything remotely related to it. The story goes that when the Jews fled slavery in Egypt, they left so quickly they didn‚Äôt have time for their bread to rise. I actually believe the custom is older, and has to do with a ritual purification of the remnants of the old grain harvest before bringing in the new. In any case, Orthodox Jews scrub the house from top to bottom, carry out a thorough search for any stray crumbs of chametz that might have crept in, and burn the crumbs in order to purify for the holiday.
So, at our Seder, Kate wanted to put a piece of chametz on the Seder plate to symbolize solidarity with LGBT rights. Marcia was horrified‚Äînot because she didn‚Äôt support LGBT rights. She was a strong supporter of gay liberation, but putting a piece of chametz on the Seder plate, to her, was viscerally horrifying.
We never really resolved the issue. Kate couldn‚Äôt let go of the symbol, which was vitally important to her. Marcia literally couldn‚Äôt stomach it. The guests were coming, the chicken soup simmering, and we ended up with two Seder plates at opposite ends of a very long table, for the duration of a very long, tense ritual. Decades went by before I dared host another Seder!
But I tell this story to illustrate some of the issues that emerge when we try to work together across our differences. Today I regularly find myself facilitating very diverse groups. I direct an organization called Earth Activist Training, that offers permaculture design grounded in spirit with a focus on organizing and activism. We offer Diversity Scholarships for people of color and differently abled people working in environmental and social justice, and as a result, our groups often span many sorts of diversity‚Äîracial, gender, religion, class, physical ability, age, interests and experience.
Permaculture‚Äîecological design‚Äîteaches that diversity brings resilience. A diverse forest can withstand disease or fire or hurricane better than a monoculture of genetically identical cloned trees. A diverse human system has a greater range of perspectives, a wider intelligence and understanding, than a group made up of people who all share the same background.
But a group with different life experiences and perspectives will also have differing needs, ideas, goals, and responses, that can generate conflict. In the role of facilitator or teacher, our responsibility is to create an atmosphere that welcomes everyone, in the fullness and complexity of the many identities we each carry. But that‚Äôs not always easy to do in a context in which oppression continues and the pain is ongoing.
So what can we do‚Äîwhen the differing needs in a group intersect in painful ways? When a black mother‚Äôs fear for the lives of her boys in a hostile world intersects with a Deaf woman‚Äôs pain at being robbed of all her communication devices by a thief the police suspect is a local black teen? When an Egyptian activist‚Äôs pride in his heritage bangs up against the blacks students‚Äô need to claim Egypt as Black Culture? When a sincere, heartfelt gift of a precious object triggers an indigenous students‚Äô pain at the appropriation of her culture and heritage?
I can‚Äôt answer that in one blog post‚Äîor a dozen. But I‚Äôd like to share some of my own experience‚Äîoften learned by making mistakes‚Äîthe experience of an older, Jewish-American, flagrantly Pagan woman writer and teacher who has been struggling with these issues for a lifetime. I hope to make this the beginning of a small series, and invite the voices of some of the other facilitators and teachers from a variety of backgrounds whom I work with.
So‚Äîlesson number one. Clenching my teeth and muttering ‚ÄúPlease, Jesus, rapture me now!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help.
Remembering the goal is the starting point. If our goal is to create a world of justice, how can we respond in a way that will further that will foster more justice?
When we care about justice in this world, and we experience or hear about injustice, we often feel angry, powerless, afraid. Those feelings are extremely painful‚Äîespecially helplessness. I don‚Äôt know how to get the cops to stop killing black kids and people of color, or how to stop the theft of indigenous land, or how to close down the tar sands. But I might know how to police your language, or shame another white person, or lash out at the messenger who reminds me how dire the situation is and how little I‚Äôve done about it.
But in the role of facilitator or teacher, I can‚Äôt do that. My responsibility is to create an atmosphere where everyone can learn and grow and be heard. I can‚Äôt be responsible to that role and indulge in blaming, shaming, or name-calling. I need to move the group toward learning, by encouraging and modeling listening, and sitting with the pain that arises, naming and acknowledging it.
Pandora Thomas, who is often my co-facilitator in these matters, always reminds us that the goal is to further real relationships, which include the fullness of conflict and disagreement‚Äînot to simply pacify the waters and create a surface harmony.
If we create space in a group to address these deep issues of injustice and discrimination, pain will arise, but so will the opportunity for change and growth and learning on a deeper level. However, the intensity of the pain can also blow a group apart and make other learning impossible if we are not prepared for it.
So I‚Äôve learned, the hard way, to find the right time and space for these discussions. Not too early‚Äîfor the group needs a chance to settle, bond, and build trust. But not too late. Not late at night, or right before the day off, or right before the end.
Conflict can be creative and productive‚Äîwhen it stays focused on the issues. When attacks become personal, and people get locked into defensiveness, the underlying issues get buried and we lose a huge opportunity for learning.
Had I been wiser, at that long-ago Seder, I might have been able to step us back from the content of that conflict and say, ‚ÄúHey, this is really about the deep pain of feeling excluded. The pain lesbians feel at being excluded from the Jewish mainstream‚Äîand the pain we all feel as Jews about being excluded for 2000 years. Once we acknowledge that pain, maybe we can find some common ground.‚Äù
It‚Äôs easy to get locked into something that feels like a solution to the problem, but really might only be one possible way to address it. Whether or not we put a piece of bread on the seder plate, discrimination against lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender folks will continue. In some situations, that symbolic act might strengthen the group‚Äôs resolve to challenge and fight that oppression. In other situations, it might simply create division and deflect attention from the real issues. Once we unpack the hurt, and remember the goal, we might be able to find some way together to create a symbol of inclusion that will work for all of us.

A note on the bread-on-the-Seder-plate story:
In later years, I noticed that the bread seemed to be replaced by an orange, which seemed to me to be a reasonable substitute. But in googling around for this post, I found this article by Susannah Heschel, who originated the orange tradition in the ‚Äò80s, to symbolize inclusion of women, lesbians and gays, the widows, orphans and all who have been excluded. She asks that we eat the orange to remember the juicy contributions all these groups have made, and spit out the seeds of hate.
Rebecca Alpert, whose 1997 book was entitled Like Bread on the Seder Plate: Jewish Lesbians and the Transformation of Tradition, suggests that no lesbians ever actually put bread on the plate. She should have been at our Seder! Joshua Lesser, after a trip to offer solidarity to the Immokalee workers striking for their rights in the tomato fields of Florida, suggests placing a tomato on the plate for all those still enslaved. And Rebecca Vilkomerson places an olive for the Palestinians and all oppressed peoples, in commemoration of the olive trees destroyed by the Israeli army. And Susie Kisber recounted for us the story of a seder where the crust of bread was shellacked so that it could be placed on the seder plate but not actually touch it and compromise its ritual purity!

Itinerary Details
This is a guided downhill bike tour along the slopes of Haleakala, entirely on paved roadways. This 25 mile ride has LESS than 1 mile of peddling, it's safe and FUN!
The company owner, Billy, personally guides "almost" every single tour.
You'll ride on a custom built bike from 6,600 feet all the way down to sea level.
Starting outside of Haleakala National Park, you'll ride through an expansive open cattle ranch with bi-coastal views of Maui (clouds permitting), the quaint towns of Kula, Makawao and ending in the center of Paia Town.
There is a chase van that blocks cars so you are able to ride in the middle of the lane on the roadways. Using our coordinated traffic system cars will never be directly behind you when you are on the bike.
We stop along the way to take pictures, talk about the history of the area, pet horses, snack on local food, laugh, etc.
Although this is a group activity, you will be able to enjoy the ride at a pace you're comfortable with. You're welcome to bring personal belongings and leave them in the chase van for the duration of the tour. We provide you with everything you could possibly need to safely enjoy this tour.1. In a parliamentary system where the prime minister is voted in by a majority of representatives, politicians have no choice but to compromise. At the very least, they are expected to conduct public affairs with the same degree of responsibility with which the general public go about their jobs and private business. Most citizens who are called upon to cast their ballot cannot afford to behave like a whimsical teenager, as so many political leaders shamelessly do. Behaving like grown-ups, responsibly and showing respect for the intelligence of voters, should be the first step towards undoing the deadlock of a political reality that is growing increasingly toxic. Spanish PM Pedro S√°nchez should have never called this election, the same way he shouldn‚Äôt have run such an opportunistic campaign, carried away by spin doctors who are unable to see beyond short-term gains and have given us no indication of the sort of world they would like to build, preoccupied as they are with the latest polls. Overcome by hubris and determined not to compromise and respond to the harsh prison sentences [in the case of the Catalan leaders] sensibly, S√°nchez has done a triple somersault and tonight we shall find out whether he will land on his feet or in ER. So far he has got himself in a muddle during the campaign, revealing his scorn for the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs autonomy and snubbing Unidas Podemos while cosied up to the PP, only to shun them later. The torrent of mixed messages has merely increased the noise and confusion for S√°nchez‚Äôs own voters and those who trusted him on the promise of a left-leaning government.
2. In Spanish politics, lying and using Catalonia does not come at a price and it often brings a reward, even if it means dropping the debate down to the lowest form of politics. Understandably, many Catalan citizens might be tempted not to cast a ballot today in a game that imposes a reality on them which they reject or are unwilling to accept and where they are reserved a subservient role. This election will be a litmus test for Catalonia‚Äôs traditional dual vote. Will today‚Äôs ballot confirm the feeling that a good deal of Catalan voters no longer see the Spanish chessboard as a shared playing field?
3. Spain‚Äôs traditional political parties are reluctant to wave goodbye to bipartisanship and welcome in a new political space that resembles Spain‚Äôs pluri-national reality more closely. As a matter of fact, they even oppose the actual mentions in the Constitution and regional Statutes that refer to Spain as a pluri-national country. The very same executioners of the Spanish Constitution claim to defend it every day with the kind of outmoded bullfighter‚Äôs rhetoric that reeks of mothball.
4. Just like Mitterrand paved the way for France‚Äôs National Front to enter the National Assembly in a move to split the conservative vote, only to see the French far right compete in the second round of the presidential elections today, Spain is witnessing its own brand of far right ambling in the streets and tv studios and taking centre stage. Vox, whose roots run deep into the Franco era, have enjoyed a comfortable campaign unopposed by a democratic combat (republican, French-style) in the public arena, and by news outlets ‚Äîever so pro-monarchy, but scared of pointing out their lies and demagoguery. Vox‚Äôs narrative has permeated the general debate, shifting the rest of the political spectrum.
5. The apathy experienced by a segment of the electorate is tempting in the face of such negative political discourse, when what prevails is conspiracy paranoia and calling out traitors, gripped by emotion and forgetting the rationality that managing public affairs requires. It is disappointing to see how party policies ignore the day-to-day running of affairs amid a general feeling that the political leadership has been overwhelmed. Furthermore, the new leadership in Catalonia‚Äôs pro-independence camp will need time to take hold and show its true value, after their predecessors were sent to prison or exile.
One (and a half) reasons to go out and vote
Democracy is fragile and the right to vote should not be taken for granted. Many have sacrificed their lives or spent time in a prison cell to build a system that is subject to improvement and may be reformed, but is a democracy nonetheless. In this system the penalty for abusing power, the absence of justice and the inability to engage in a dialogue is effectively meted out at the polls, by favouring wide, effective majorities in parliament. We are all individually responsible for the world that we are building. The ephemeral glory of hoping for the worst and choosing the path of conflict fades away with the cry that accompanies it. A ballot that is not cast does not offer a shortcut to one‚Äôs dreams, but a waste of the capital accumulated thanks to the sacrifice of so many. If you don‚Äôt like the current state of affairs, you should muck in. Badmouthing politics merely feeds fascism, just like the quality of a democracy is diminished by a lack of criticism.
Plus half a reason: it is not true that everybody is the winner on election night. Elections are won by some, lost by others. Oftentimes it is more rewarding to see who is the loser than who is the winner and it is only human to feel an intimate satisfaction when you see someone up close who has just ruined their career, drunk with rage.Meet the Platform: SteamOnline

Southport | South<<A Look at the History of the NYC Subway on Its 112th Birthday
Here we celebrate the Metropolitan Transit Authority with one eye on the past and another towards its ever-growing future.
The Second Avenue Subway
The Second Avenue subway line has been in the works since 1920. When construction on the line is fully completed, it will have added 16 new stations to the city system. The line is expected to be partially operative by the end of this year. New Yorkers will believe it when they see it.
Women Who Worked on the Subway
During both world wars, women stepped up to become train conductors, engineers, chemists, ticket booth clerks and track workers. Most women left these jobs when veterans returned from work. Although women have since re-entered transit service, there is still not gender parity in the workforce. In 2011, only 17% of MTA employees were female.
Times Square
The 42nd Street-Times Square station is filled with secrets. There‚Äôs a mural by Roy Lichtenstein and a life-questioning poem called ‚ÄúThe Commuter‚Äôs Lament‚Äù painted throughout the station. At one point, the famous Knickerbocker Hotel had its own secret basement entrance to the station, used by the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald and friends.
469
There are currently 469 subway stops and 24 lines in operation. When the system opened in 1904, there were only 28 stops and service was strictly limited to Manhattan.
Ghost Stations
The NYC Subway has nine ‚Äúghost stations.‚Äù These formerly-functioning stations now sit vacant. The most beautiful of the stations is often considered to be the City Hall stop, which was operative from 1904 to 1945. The Romanesque Revival-style station can be glimpsed in scenes from the upcoming movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.STEM Academy builds Career STREAM Program to bring positive change in STEM workforce
KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, N. M. (AFRL) -The National Defense Education Program awarded funding to the Air Force Research Laboratory‚Äôs STEM Academy to bring life to a program that hopes to increase diversity in the science, technology, engineering and math workforce.
The NDEP is a DOD-funded organization that provides assistance and opportunities for organizations with DOD ties to conduct innovative endeavors that promote the growth of STEM and biotechnology education.
‚ÄúWe wanted to bring students that grew up in rural parts of New Mexico ‚Äî who maybe thought that college wasn‚Äôt for them ‚Äî onto college campuses,‚Äù STEM Academy Director Ronda Cole-Harmon said. ‚ÄúWe wanted them to see that, ‚ÄòWow, these are people just like me. They come from families like mine. They‚Äôve had struggles similar to what I‚Äôve had.‚Äô It‚Äôs a matter of reaching into the untapped pool of the STEM workforce and showing them that they have a place here too.‚Äù
In November 2020 NDEP sent out an internal call for funding to government organizations. The call offered up to three years of funding with the goal of building the future workforce with a focus on highlighting DOD modernization priorities. The AFRL STEM outreach program, STEM Academy, sent out a bid to build their Career STREAM Program, which provides a curriculum that combines science, technology, reading & writing, engineering, art and math. After vetting and review against other competing national organizations, STEM Academy received the award.
‚ÄúWe wanted to complete the puzzle of STEM outreach that STEM Academy has been building ‚Äî we have great programs for elementary age students, but we wanted to fill the missing piece for high-school-age students,‚Äù Cole-Harmon said.
The program will not only teach students basic STEM tools to use while working on their projects, but it will also implement project management tools to give participants a feel for what they will see when they enter the workforce. Students will use a program management system to accomplish tasks and meet deliverables.
Cole-Harmon and her team have set up regional sites ‚Äî at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the University of New Mexico ‚Äî where high school students can work with collegiate mentors on a STEM-related project to collaboratively research and develop an innovative idea, all while earning a paycheck.
With all of the steps taken to ensure participants are offered the tools to develop their STEM skill sets, this then poses the question: how will the Career STREAM Program add diversity to the STEM workforce?
‚ÄúIf we really want to build workforce diversity, we need to find a way to attract diverse candidates to this program,‚Äù Cole-Harmon said.
The team at STEM Academy built a marketing strategy tailored to reach students that were of a minority background, that possessed ties to STEM skill sets that they may have not previously realized.
All student apprentices belonged to at least one of the following categories: race and ethnic minorities historically underrepresented in STEM, military-connected, students with disabilities, female learners, first-generation college students, students with English as a second language and students in rural or other Federal targeted outreach schools, such as Title 1 or high-need school district.
Students chosen for the program will get to see how they fit into STEM careers and understand how their cultural and everyday problem-solving experiences can serve as a foundation for their future success.
Four projects were chosen and fleshed out by mentors for the Career STREAM teams to work on: building a cube satellite, creating a portable farming system and growing plants on Mars‚Äô harsh, rocky surface.
‚ÄúA lot of the projects are concepts that have been studied before, but we want our team to learn that it‚Äôs the fundamental questions that can lead to revolutionary answers,‚Äù Cole-Harmon said. ‚ÄúUnderstanding it‚Äôs the innovation and creativity that you bring to the scene that can solve a problem that has been plaguing us for a long time.‚Äù
The projects will be staffed by culture and career mentors, mentors and apprentices. Each had their own specific roles and responsibilities related to the success of the project and the overall program goals.
‚ÄúCulture and career mentors are doing things like helping to develop a sense of professional identity,‚Äù Cole-Harmon said. ‚ÄúCultivating the mindset that, ‚Äòas a high school student, I belong on a college campus,‚Äô or ‚Äòas a student from an underrepresented group, I belong in STEM.‚Äô They also help to find ways to connect them with student groups and support networks to help students through the difficult times.‚Äù
Along with teaching students about how to succeed in STEM careers, the teams will be showing apprentices how to find resources to help them reach their goals, despite the hardships they may encounter along the way.
‚ÄúWe want to show students that there are resources to help them succeed in this realm,‚Äù There are support groups for underrepresented communities, and there are scholarships to help fund your dreams,‚Äù Cole-Harmon said.
Culture and career mentors will also introduce guests that may help ignite perseverance based on their own successful and similar journeys. Cole-Harmon believes students should be given tools as well as inspiration for success.
‚ÄúThere are some really compelling stories of scientists and engineers that have faced setbacks and tribulations getting to where they are today,‚Äù Cole-Harmon said. ‚ÄúWe want students to know that their journey to success doesn‚Äôt have to be a straight line. The detours in life are enriching and often make you a better person when you reach what it is you turn out to be.‚Äù
The Career STREAM project is a paid program that began in June 2021 and ends in August 2021.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool to have a program that is nationally recognized here in New Mexico,‚Äù Cole-Harmon said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre blazing trails and with that comes mistakes and learning great things ‚Äî hopefully we‚Äôll be building something that is useful to students now and in the future.‚Äù
Meet the Mentors:
The following are quotes from the collegiate students taking part in the Career STREAM Program to further not only their own STEM careers but that of their apprentices as well.
‚ÄúThis program is astoundingly useful for the future of STEM. These apprentices, these innovators and creators, are the future of STEM. We‚Äôre just making sure they have their voices heard and they know that they have a place in whatever field they choose. The world is better off when they speak up, innovate and be creative.‚Äù ‚Äî Alexandria Wiesel
‚ÄúSTEM is a challenging community to feel comfortable in. Often, there is a constant feeling of not being ‚Äòsmart enough‚Äô or ‚Äògood enough‚Äô to be a part of it. This is perpetuated when there is a lack of communication, making it seem as though you are the only one feeling that way. A program such as this reinforces the idea that anyone with a passion and a drive can make contributions in STEM, and [it] builds confidence in students who have perhaps been overlooked in the past. The bigger and more connected the STEM community is, the more people are served, as students become leaders in fields at the forefront of technology and science.‚Äù ‚Äî Karina Adam
‚ÄúI want to help people. It‚Äôs a crucial and ethically driven part of my life. I grew up with various disadvantages in life, and, fortunately, I now have the opportunity to accomplish projects I never thought there were possible. This prospect has shown me that everyone can be successful in life, as long as we have a helping hand by our side.‚Äù ‚Äî Carmin Vazquez
‚ÄúMany students from various backgrounds have little-to-no experience with STEM academia, but they have plentiful experience with what is known as everyday STEM. Everyday STEM includes using a butter knife as a screwdriver or a skateboard as a dolly. These connections are crucial problem-solving abilities that STEM fields require, so embracing these aspects can help build a STEM foundation for those who never thought they belonged.‚Äù ‚Äî Daniel Berenger-Russell
‚ÄúIt is a common misconception that the STEM field is only for certain types of people. Programs like this make it known that STEM is for everyone. I imagine a future where the STEM field is composed of people of every background who are able to use their own life experiences to create a better world. I am confident that by the end of this program, each apprentice will not only have new STEM-related skill sets but will also have a new outlook on what STEM is and how anyone can do it.‚Äù ‚Äî Frank Lora
‚ÄúSome days, I forget that STEM is so much more than my glowing computer screen. I‚Äôm here because I want to remind myself there is a bigger picture to engineering ‚Äî we are literally shaping the future with our inventions and projects, and that is something to be excited about! I hope to instill this in my apprentices. The idea that yes, right now ‚Äî maybe in high school ‚Äî it seems like school is just busywork, but the amount of influence you can wield in life someday once all this busy work finishes will make the struggle well worth it.‚Äù ‚Äî Ella Sinha

I'm thinking it's because they have too much goods on his ass with mail in ballots and shit! Don't wanna bite the hand that feeds ya! Fuck fear and fuck communism!!!!!
Because they'd all quit and nothing would be delivered.
And what corporate executives would that affect the most? This could be an arrow pointing at who is behind this garbage.
This is yet more data that the government doesn't actually care about controlling any virus or an admission that the vaccine doesn't work. They aren't requiring the people who touch with their bare hands objects that will enter everyone's homes to get vaccinated, the people who walk around our neighborhoods all day breathing on everything. This movie is comical at times.
That‚Äôs because their Union stopped that crap. I‚Äôm willing to bet other federal unions will also. I know quite a few civilians in my federal agency pissed.
The people that touch my mail aren‚Äôt required to be vaccinated???????!?
Equal discrimination under the law or something...

And they handle all the mail, go door to door delivering mail, and would be "most exposed" group in my opinion, if this were truly about health, which it isn't.

Talking to many music fans out there, the response is overwhelming. Give me something new, something raw, something that‚Äôs pushes hard & is going to kick me in he ass. Something that doesn‚Äôt sound like ‚Äî well Nikelback. Give me band similar to The White Stripes, Nirvana, Foo Fighters with a jagged edge, a bloody tip & a no holes barred musical delivery. Give me something real!
So across my desk slides the new CD by California‚Äôs own The Good Evol entitled Butterfly Crush headed up by infectious singer/songwriter Natalia Bartolotti. What I heard put a smile on my face, finally a band that gets it with music in the vein of Pink, No Doubt, and Garbage. Butterfly Crush is some of the best new music I‚Äôve heard in quite a while & delivers many of the aforementioned items I spoke about. You want full tilt rock, you want punk, you want music that is packed to the hilt with energy and is entertaining to listen to? Well look no further. This CD covers all the bases delivering solid playing & amazing songwriting & a musical flair that just lets it all hang out.
Butterfly Crush by The Good Evol is what we‚Äôve all been waiting for. It‚Äôs a polished sounding musical production from start to finish served up hot with great playing, solid writing, & and is fun filled musical experience akin to a party that‚Äôs out of control. It‚Äôs definitely a musical production that gives us a fresh glimpse at a hot new artist & takes us back a few years ‚Äî before everything started sounding like ‚Äî well Nikelback.

This article was originally published in The Notebook. In August 2020, The Notebook became Chalkbeat Philadelphia.
Gov. Wolf is attempting to reframe Pennsylvania‚Äôs budget debate in preparation for a tax vote planned for Wednesday in the House.
Calling it a "once-in-a-generation vote," Wolf said Monday that he continues to try to cobble together support for broad-based tax increases.
"Doing nothing now is going to result in a huge cut for education. I think that probably is the key element here," said Wolf at a press briefing at the Governor‚Äôs Residence in Harrisburg. "And if people didn‚Äôt like what they saw four or five years ago, they‚Äôre going to hate next year. Because we simply have come to the end of the line using these one-time fixes."
During the briefing, Wolf methodically outlined the state‚Äôs growing mandated spending, which he said has created a structural deficit of at least $2.3 billion ‚Äì and that‚Äôs before the additional spending the governor wants for education and other programs.
He said broad-based tax hikes are needed now to make up for years of what he called dishonest budgeting on top of inadequate funding of schools.Best Honeymoon Destinations For Couples

Here are 5 important takeaways from the Texans loss to the Bengals
In the Texans' 37-31 loss to the Bengals, there was more of the same old Texans. There was also a couple bright spots and some causes for concern. They didn't quit and kept fighting, but they also made crucial mistakes that led to the loss. A play here and a play there, the outcome could've changed. Or, maybe it was meant to turn out the way it did.
1) One thing that reminded me of the same old Texans was their slow start on both offense and defense. Their first possession on offense ended in a three and out. It was the eighth time this season they've started a game with a three and out. Starting half your games by giving the ball right back to the opponent isn't ideal. Neither is allowing your opponent to score on their first possession of the game. This was the ninth straight game the Texans have allowed an opening possession score which is the longest single season streak in the last 20 years. Slow starts are a surefire way to put a lesser talented team at a disadvantage.
2) Keion Crossen played a good game at corner. At 5'10 185lbs, Crossen did his best to slow down the Bengals' twin towers at receiver. A.J. Green and Tee Higgins are both 6'4 and weigh 210lbs and 215lbs respectively. Not an easy task to shut them completely out or contain them for that matter, but I thought Crossen did an admirable job. He should be on this roster next season for sure because he's cheap labor and could use the reps to get better before being offered an extension.
3) Brandin Cooks and David Johnson both showed flashes of their past selves in this game. Johnson had 15 touches for 139 yards and two touchdowns, while Cooks caught seven passes for 141 yards and a touchdown. Was their performances worth keeping them? Maybe, maybe not. I'd be more inclined to keep Cooks, but Johnson can't do anything to make me think he should stay on this team past this season.
4) Watson piled up more impressive passing numbers again this week. However, he took a couple shots that gave everyone a scare. While he's been on fire lately, I've seen a couple instances in which I wish he had a tad more accuracy. On Cooks' 50-yard reception, he had the corner beat and Watson threw a Matt Schaub-esque deep ball in which Cooks had to wait for. They settled for a field goal on the drive, but that could've been a touchdown with more air time leading Cooks. On another deep ball to Cooks, Watson overthrew him. He did the same to Steven Mitchell on a key 3rd down before halftime. These are things Watson will get right. One can hardly blame him considering he was playing behind another makeshift offensive line.
5) Another week, another one score loss for the Texans. This now makes seven one score losses of their 11 on the season. The optimist would say "this team is a few plays here and there away from being 11-4 instead of 4-11." The pessimist would say "this team is trash and will be trash for years to come wasting Deshaun Watson's prime years!" One could argue either side and make valid points. I'd tend to side with the pessimist at this point, but could make a slight case for the optimist. Let's hope the new head coach and general manager can change the culturePop - Rock - World music
JoMo - Tournefeuille (Toulouse, Occitania/France)
JoMo (Jean-Marc Leclercq) began his musical career in 1977 (Caniveau, Les Diam's, Queen Bees, etc...), and learned Esperanto in 1988.
It wastherefore perfectly natural for him to write and sing in the International Language.
He created his own band, The Rosemary's Babies, which became famous in the French alternative rock world in the early 90's. The band toured in many countries (including China), produced two albums, and even performed on the stage of the famous Parisian music hall Olympia.
After the separation of Les Babies, jOmO created a new group, Liberecanoj, with which he recorded a seven-title libertarian-themed album at Vinilkosmo, and set the first record of a multilingual concert (22 songs in 22 languages), which appeared in 2000 in the Guinness Book. Later and alone, he recorded at the new Vinilkosmo Studio an all-Esperanto album, entitled "jOmO Friponas", which appeared at the end of 2001. His next album, "jOmO Slavumas", appeared in the spring of 2006 with a group of Slav-style musicians, with whom jOmO plays. Since the 1st of April 2016, his 4th Esperanto album, "jOmO Okcitanas", is available, dedicated to traditional Occitan music with the traditional instrument "bodega", which is a bagpipe from Languedoc. jOmO performed with a whole group of bodegas during the World Esperanto Congress in Lille, France, in July 2015.
He still performs in Esperanto and in many different languages, alone with a guitar, singing joyous and toe-tapping songs. He travels all over the world, we have seen him in Japan and Australia.
He is now working on a crazy new project: performing without an instrument, but singing with a "virtual choir" thanks to sound-loop technology. Besides music, he published with a French publishing company a conversational primer of the Gascon language, in which he also writes. In May 2006 he published his first novel, "Ucra√Øna", in Gascon, for which he received a literary prize. In 2012 he published a rhyming dictionary of Occitan. He is now writing a textbook of Occitan for Esperanto speakers. Besides that, he has a Polish wife, a twenty-year-old daughter, does not smoke, does not drink alcohol, does not eat meat, but has one vice: he loves to talk.

Christ experienced the full weight of every conceivable temptation that the ‚Äúprince of this world‚Äù (John 12:31) could place upon Him, but without falling for any of them (John 14:30). Satan found nothing in Jesus that responded to his temptations (Hebrews 2:18). He ‚Äúwas in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin‚Äù (Hebrews 4:15).
Christ was tempted and overcame the temptations by the same grace (Romans 3:24) that the Father has made available for us (Ephesians 1:7). If Christ overcame because He was divine, He would not have been a perfect example for us (1 Peter 2:21). But being a human, like us, He fought the devil by God‚Äôs grace.
It is this grace that transforms sinful humans by ‚Äúthe power of God unto salvation‚Äù (Romans 1:16). Grace is not merely God‚Äôs mercy and willingness to forgive, it is an active changing power for victory over all sin. Instead of vain attempts to earn salvation by human efforts, the Christian has the privilege of free access to unlimited resources of grace. ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me‚Äù (Philippians 4:13).
Because of Christ‚Äôs victory over sin, we too may triumph over it (Romans 8:1‚Äì4). In Him we can be ‚Äúmore than conquerors‚Äù (Romans 8:37), for God ‚Äúgiveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù (1 Corinthians 15:57), over both sin and its wages, death (Galatians 2:20).

EachArchaia Summons a New Type of Witch in Jim Henson‚Äôs The Storyteller By Sean Edgar | November 17, 2014 | 9:00am Books Features Share Tweet Submit Pin Archaia has published some undeniably gorgeous work with its Jim Henson licenses over the past few years, adapting lost scripts including Tale of Sand and The Musical Monsters of Turkey Hollow with talent and passion. Jim Henson‚Äôs The Storyteller: Witches takes that partnership to a new high. The original Storyteller show, which began in 1988 and wrapped in 1991 with a Greek Myth-inspired spinoff, recast little-known fairy tales into pure, magical escapism enhanced by sharp writing and exemplary production. Framed by the titular storyteller (a barely-recognizable John Hurt, accompanied by his muppet dog voiced by Brian Henson), the series survived as a cult sensation even if it never reached the ubiquity of The Muppets or Fraggle Rock. Halfway into its 4-issue run, the comic series Jim Henson‚Äôs The Storyteller: Witches has captured the innovation, escapism and allure of its TV inspiration, driven by a host of creators hellbent on suspending reality for 22 pages. Four individual cartoonists contribute to each of the four issues, save the finale, which uses an unaired teleplay about the child-eating witch Baba Yaga. Taking an international approach, the first issue by S.M. Vidaurri presented a charming European fable of princesses and vengeful forest lords, while Kyla Vanderklugt‚Äôs follow up immersed readers in a bittersweet love story set in historical Japan. With issue three, ‚ÄúThe Phantom Isle,‚Äù set for release Wednesday, Paste chatted with series editor Rebecca Taylor on how the project began, the role of sympathetic witches in fiction, and female agency in the comic industry. Paste: After reading quite a few fairy tales and some classic mythology literature, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that if you‚Äôre female and overly thirty, there‚Äôs a decent chance you‚Äôre inherently evil. Have you noticed this? Rebecca Taylor: [laughs] I think that does tend to happen. Paste: The one factor that I‚Äôve found really interesting about the first two issues of Jim Henson‚Äôs The Storyteller: Witches is that the witches are incredibly sympathetic and understandable. Was that a coincidence among the creators, or was there an editorial direction to express that sentiment? Taylor: It came from the creators, ultimately. For Shane-Michael Vidaurri, who did the first issue, I know something that was really important to him was to not have the typical evil witch in his story, and to throw a curveball at the end. For the other creators, I think it follows the same rules. They not only wanted to break out of the mold of witches, but also tell their own spin on a fairy tale. Evil witches have been done before, but complex, sympathetic witches‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a little bit new. So I think they all wanted to put their flair on it, and add a new take on their idea of a witch, which I think they all did very successfully. Paste: So was there any thematic coordination between the four stories and the four creators at all? Taylor: When they all started pitching stories, each of them came to us with a couple of different ideas. We worked with The Henson Company to curate the best ideas out of all of them. The only thing we did to make sure that the stories were comparable was to make sure we had a lot of different cultures represented. Oftentimes with fairy tales, especially coming from Western artists, they tend to be set in England. So we wanted to make sure that we had witch stories from all over the globe. That was an important element of the show and of Jim Henson‚Äôs work, so we wanted to make sure that was represented. We brought in Kyla Vanderklugt‚Äôs story, which is a Japanese tale, and the Baba Yaga story is obviously from Eastern Europe. So we had a bunch of different cultures represented, which was fun. Paste: So the Baba Yaga issue is going to be issue #4. Who‚Äôs the creator behind that entry? Taylor: That one‚Äôs a little bit different from the other issues, in that it was originally an unproduced teleplay from the actual show, The Storyteller. It was a script that was never made into an episode and it was in the Henson Archives. We work with The Henson Company, and when they find things like that they‚Äôre wonderful enough to share it with us. So we gave the screenplay to Jeff Stokely, who is an incredible artist. He did Six-Gun Gorilla for BOOM! and The Reason for Dragons for Archaia. He‚Äôs wonderful, and adapted the screenplay into a comic book. Paste: What were some of your favorite entries from the original show? Did you watch The Storyteller as a child? Taylor: I actually missed it when I was a child. It wasn‚Äôt one of the Henson properties I was familiar with when I was growing up. I watched some episodes since as an adult, just working on the project. My favorite one is ‚ÄúHans My Hedgehog.‚Äù It‚Äôs amazing; the makeup and costume design they do for the actor who plays the hedgehog is incredible. Very Jim Henson. Paste: When I first saw the comic, I figured it would go on infinitely, but it‚Äôs only four issues. What was the thought process behind making this a miniseries? Taylor: Well, we had done a trade anthology in 2011 back at Archaia, and we loved the anthology feel of that because you get to have a lot of different creators interpreting stories in their own way. And the whole idea of the show is storytellers ‚Äî we want to have a whole lot of storytellers who have different takes. So we liked that angle. But what was great about bringing it to single-issue form was that we get to do slightly longer stories than shorts, that really feel like episodes of the show. And we wanted to have it be a miniseries so that we could have a finite way to tie them all together. But we brought in the Baba Yaga, and since that one was focused on a witch, we decided to make witches the theme of this particular miniseries. And hopefully if we get the opportunity to do more miniseries with Storyteller in the future, we can do a new theme and have the new tales be centralized around that. Paste: From an aesthetic perspective, Kyle and S.M.‚Äôs issues complement each other very, very well. You can definitely see their work harmonizing together in a trade paperback. Did you initially seek creators who‚Äôs approaches would flow together when seen in a larger context? Taylor: For Jeff, we wanted him to adapt the teleplay, and he‚Äôs an incredible artist who we‚Äôve worked with a lot. For the other three, we wanted to go after writer/artists mostly, because we wanted to have styles and voices that were really, really strong, coming from one person ‚Äî really focus on that theme of storytellers. And we wanted to have different creators who had different styles, not only from what you would typically see in a single-issue comic series, but from each other. So, they‚Äôre similar in the way we wanted to make sure we had stories that were all very different from each other and from all around the globe, but we also wanted to make sure we had styles that were unique and different from each other, so you got four realized, different interpretations of the witch mythos. Paste: Witches in general seem to seeing a bit of a resurgence in popular culture and the media. In tandem, we‚Äôre also seeing large social movements to empower females in the media, whether its through Gamegate or other comics under the Archaia/BOOM! umbrella like Lumberjanes. Do you think it‚Äôs a coincidence? Taylor: It‚Äôs interesting. There has been a whole bunch of witch stuff in pop culture, not only just in comics, but in TV and all over the place. I think for us, it did happen to be a happy coincidence. The reason why we did witches was the (Baba Yaga) teleplay, but it was a happy coincidence because we were there with all of these other series that focus on witches, so we got right in the middle of the zeitgeist. I think for us here at BOOM!, diversity and diversity in comics is something we really value. I think it‚Äôs represented in the titles we do, the kind of creators we work with, our staff‚Ä¶everyone. So getting behind female empowerment, whether it‚Äôs from staff members or creators or characters or readers, I think that‚Äôs something we just value overall as a company. I think it‚Äôs great that that‚Äôs a thing that‚Äôs happening in comics overall and in pop culture. But I know here at BOOM!, it‚Äôs something that we‚Äôve always cared about, and will continue to care about. That‚Äôs why. We love witches. [Laughs] Paste: It was definitely cool to see the ‚ÄúSnow Witch‚Äù chapter presented in landscape format. Did you initiate that, or was it something Kyla came up with? Taylor: It was a little bit of both. Coming out of the Archaia imprint, one thing we really like to do is to try to experiment with production. We‚Äôve always had a big focus on that, whether it‚Äôs covers or single issues. We always try to innovate. For these stories, since each one is so self-contained, we wanted to see what we could do to make each one interesting and unique. So we posed it to Kyla: we said if you could do something weird with the production of your single issue, what would you do? Since hers was a Japanese story, she wanted to do it in landscape form to mimic the old Japanese style of actual landscape art. So that‚Äôs why she went for that feel, and I think it worked really, really well for her story. Paste: What can you tell us about the third issue, ‚ÄúThe Phantom Isle,‚Äù which comes out Wednesday. Taylor: ‚ÄúThe Phantom Isle‚Äù is from creator Matthew Dow Smith. He‚Äôs actually been in comics for quite a while; he‚Äôs done a bunch of Doctor Who and X-Files comics. He has a creator-owned comic called October Girl that‚Äôs absolutely beautiful and beautifully written, and that was what grabbed us. The story focuses on an Irish sailor who gets ship-wrecked at sea, and finds himself on an island reminiscent of Avalon, where there‚Äôs a council of witches who live there. They offer him immortality in exchange for telling stories, because their island is built off of imagination. He‚Äôs tempted by the immortality, and we find out how much he has to sacrifice for it. So it‚Äôs a story about storytellers from a storyteller series, which is a little bit meta.

Of course, the pages linked to are stuffed with exploits which are used to turn the victim machine into a malware menagerie.
There‚Äôs nothing new in these mailings. But today we got another example of a mailing that‚Äôs been going on for the last three weeks or so ‚Äì every day, millions of ICQ users are being sent the following message:
SIP:
The add-on includes options such as:
*hide/ fake your number
*hide/ fake your primary email
*eavesdrop on other users (requires qip 8020 or higher)
*check user status
*view user‚Äôs contact list (requires paid plug-in enquiries to UIN# ****016)
Requirements:
*qip 8000 or higher can be downloaded from _
*Internet access
*Windows 2000/2003/XP (Vista not supported)
Installation:
Unpack the archive, launch the Install file remaining files should be located
in the folder together with install.
Download: _ (656 kb)
Although the link does change, sometimes the same link gets sent twice in one day ‚Äì it depends how quickly antivirus companies react to the latest malware that‚Äôs placed on the link. If the user is incautious or uninformed enough to click on the link, his or her machine ends up infected with a variant of the ever popular Trojan-PSW.Win32.LdPinch.
We took a look at all the different variants that have been downloaded, and discovered that:
- An old version of Pinch is being used, and this version is freely available ‚Äì for each wave of mailings, the malware simply gets packed with different packers.
- To start with, Pinch sent its log files off using public SMTP servers, but then moved to using a script gate on a free hosting site.
- The recipient‚Äôs email is the same in all cases.
Pinch is a true omnivore ‚Äì it grabs just about everything it can from the victim machine: the Windows license number, system information, a list of programs installed, as well as ICQ, email and FTP passwords, and passwords saved to Windows Protected Storage.
On the most productive days, the person behind the mass mailings managed to collect up to a hundred logs. And his e-store has a whole bunch of ICQ numbers for sale, presumably stolen from victim machines. He‚Äôs clearly out to make money ‚Äì given that malware writers have made the shift from simple disruption to clearly criminal activity, that‚Äôs no surprise. However, what he maybe doesn‚Äôt realize is that a careful analysis of Pinch leads to a wealth of information about the author ‚Äì name, date of birth, town, mobile number and various other personal data.
Good news for those fighting cyber crime, but not so great for those involved in illegal activity.

The Ainu (Aynu) people and culture are very fascinating, but unfortunately not many know about it or how is it related to Japan.
Recently, due to the anime series Golden Kamuy, that has grown in popularity overseas, as well, Ainu Culture is starting to gather more attention worldwide and many visitors are now including the Ainu sites and tourist spots in their itineraries.
Who are the Ainu?
Ainu people have been also known under the name of Ëù¶Â§∑ (Ezo) and are an indigenous population with interesting customs, culture, and history that is said to have originated by combining Jomon, Okhotsk cultures and Satsumon, the post-Jomon culture together.
It is said they are the descendants of the Jomon population, but their genetics are still not clear.
Compared to Japanese people, Ainu have more body hair and a light skin tone, in case of full blood Ainu. Many have broad faces and men are said to be very hairy.
Some studies say Caucasians, some Northern Asia, many find similarities between the Mongoloid traits and Ainu features, but the most similar resemblance is with Chukchi population of the Arctic area.
Ainu were based in Hokkaido and the Northeast region of Japan, but unfortunately nowadays many don‚Äôt know about their origins as a result of being assimilated in Japanese society.
Language and Culture
Their Language and culture are very different from Japanese and unfortunately, there are not many people who can speak Ainu language anymore.
As they are an important part of the history, there have been efforts made to keep the language from being extinct and revive it, but the people who can speak and understand Ainu language are so few you can count them on two hands.
What is interesting about the Ainu customs and personally left me in awe was the tradition of tattooing your mouth and forearms as a woman.
I mentioned above that Ainu men were hairy, but one of their traditions was not to shave after reaching a certain age, so seeing the men with big beards and long mustaches was something normal for their people.
While men used chopsticks, women used spoons made out of wood.
Hunting for wildlife (bears, deer, etc), fishing and making ornaments as part of their culture.
If you read or watched Golden Kamuy, you already know that Ainu used to hunt bears that hibernate and they were all animists of religion.
The Ainu population used to believe everything has a spirit, therefore the word Kamuy, which means God in Ainu language.
Ainu Culture Nowadays
Here are a few of the locations I recommend to visit if you want to know more about the interesting culture of the Ainu population:
In Japan, especially Hokkaido, you can also taste Ainu Cuisine or try out their sake.
For those interested in purchasing the traditional Ainu drink, you can do so from Tanakashuzo Japan Shop.
Golden Kamuy and Ainu
¬© PR Times, Inc.
Golden Kamuy is a manga, based on a real story, recently adapted into an anime recognized worldwide, currently with 2 seasons out and the third season to be released.
The manga and anime grew in popularity not only in Japan but internationally and made people more aware of the unique Ainu culture that has started to fascinate people all around the world.
One of the characters of Golden Kamuy, the girl of Ainu origins, Asirpa has been featured in the British Museum Exhibition banner poster (link here).
The manga/anime have been so popular in Japan that beer cans and soft drinks have the characters imprinted on and the Japanese market even used the series to promote Marvel‚Äôs SpiderMan: Far From Home Movie to the audience.No know who the father was, they said I did it for child support, they said they felt bad for my daughter and that she would be ‚Äúworse‚Äù than me. I automatically turned into the world‚Äôs biggest slut, I guess, since they all assumed I slept with a million guys by then.
They never cared to ask me what really happened. I guess it‚Äôs because to them, there was no excuse. Because they held me fully accountable, since I was fourteen, and apparently at that age I was supposed to know better, right ?
You know, to be honest, for many years I‚Äôve felt ashamed to speak on this topic. I‚Äôve been stigmatized all my life because of my teenage pregnancy, so I guess I figured‚Äìwhat‚Äôs the point ? I‚Äôll always be less worthy to them anyway, and they‚Äôre going to think what they want. But now, thirteen years later, I‚Äôm brave enough, and without a damn shame, I got a lot to say.
I‚Äôm twenty seven years old today. And as a grown woman and as a mother, I just can‚Äôt fathom why they held it all against me ? I am not asking for pity, I am not asking for justification, I am not putting excuses, and I for sure do not and will not, ever, change the happening of my babygirl, but I‚Äôm saying, at fourteen years old, with no mother around, with no mentor or positive example to look up to , with no type of guidance, why did I deserve all the social punishment, the harassment, and the fingers pointed at me ? Why was I the horrible girl, and the liar ? Was it because I was fourteen years old and he was eighteen years old ? I should have known better compared to him? Why ? Because I was the female ? Like, really, how the fuck was I supposed to know any better ? I didn‚Äôt want to sleep with him, and I knew he knew I was uncomfortable, but I did let him. I let him because I felt like a somebody. I didn‚Äôt know who, but I felt like somebody important and special, like someone that was actually wanted. I wanted to give him what he wanted in order to please him. I wanted to please him to be accepted by him, because I wanted to be accepted by someone.
Before my pregnancy, the last time I felt truly loved and cherished was by my mother, and I lost her to a prison system at nine so after that, I just always felt so lonely. I became so lost without her. I lived day by day with confusion and lingering pain. At the time I was still building a bond with my father so besides my little brother, I had no one else.
You see, when I first moved from Houston to Rhode Island with my father, those first couple of years were a real struggle for me. I was in a new state, around a new crowd of people and family, around different cultures, new norms, etc. It took some time to fit in with the others. Although I‚Äôve always been independent minded with my own personal views and opinions on things, I often did what everyone else did. Even if it made me feel uncomfortable, I‚Äôd still do it because I wanted to be ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I wanted to be look up to. I wanted to fit in so bad because I was just so sick of always being picked on. I got picked on for everything. Even for the way I dressed. My father would always put big church dresses on me, and little tiny heels or sandals. They‚Äôd laugh at me and laugh at my shoes and at my toes. They‚Äôd make fun of me because I was half Guatemalan, too. They‚Äôd call me a bastard and throw my mother being in prison at me all the time. I fucking hated going to school. I‚Äôd eat my lunch in the bathroom or skip lunch in the bathroom because no one would want to sit with me, or because I was too anxious to even try to sit with others. I‚Äôd lie about my nationality and say that I was full Puerto Rican (I‚Äôm really half). I‚Äôd steal clothes and hide it in my backpack and sneak it to school and change in the bathroom so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to wear the dress. That‚Äôs how it was the first year or two living with my dad. All the kids wanted to play follow the fucking leader so all it took was one person to fuck with me, and then all the rest followed along. I was intimidated by everyone so I never said anything. I just dealt with it until one day some girl said something about my mom. I was in fifth grade at the time. She said something about my mom and it triggered the fuck out of me. I‚Äôll never forget it because it was my first school fight. She said something like, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why your moms in jail‚Äù. I dealt with my father and others talking shit about my mom already, I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore, and especially by no stranger, so I punched her. I punched her in the face and boom, we fucking went at it ! I let out so much rage on her. The principle and one other teacher tired to break it up but I wouldn‚Äôt stop. I blacked out and I hit them too.
I got suspended of course but when I returned to school, man was I popular. Everyone began to approach me and tell me that they heard I ‚Äúbeat her ass‚Äù. Others said they head she beat mine. It didn‚Äôt even matter though. All I know is that after that, they all wanted to be my friend, they thought I was cool and tough‚Ä¶After that I literally stopped taking shit from people. That fight was like breaking the ice for me. I turned into a little savage after that. Anyone that spoke shit to me, I‚Äôd talk shit right back. Anyone that put a hand on me, I‚Äôd fight them. I ended up getting kicked out of the school I was in, and then I got kicked out of the next one, and then the next one after that. Academically, I would get the best grades always. But those grades meant shit when measured against my behavior. And I didn‚Äôt even care about them at the time, to be honest. I loved being bad. It was the only time I felt important and noticed.
Life was different at home, compared to how it was in school. It was just my dad, brother and I at first. Being the only girl in the house, I‚Äôd just always stay in my room. I‚Äôd stare out the window at my neighbors who I called my cousins, everyday as they hung out on their porch. I wanted to be just like them. I admired them for everything they had, including their freedom. They had their mom and dad, the flyest clothes, the newest sneakers, the dopest jewelry, the newest phones, and everyone wanted to hang out with them. They had cars, they went out to clubs and parties whenever they wanted. I wanted to hang out with them so bad but my father wouldn‚Äôt let me. Eventually he did but until then, I sneaked out the window and hung out with them on my own. They were so cool and so nice to me. They would always tell me how pretty I am, and how I had a nice body, and they‚Äôd dress me up and do my hair using their clothes and accessories. They‚Äôd take me out with them and show me off to their friends. They made me so happy. I bragged to everyone about them.
I met my first daughters father through them. He hung out with them all the time and was best friends with my male cousins. One day I went to an all age club with my cousins and that‚Äôs the night that my daughters father and I first spoke. He tried to dance with me but I couldn‚Äôt because my cousin liked him at the time. I almost did but she pulled me back by my hair and told me that I better not. I knew she liked him so I don‚Äôt know why I even listened to him but I honestly just liked the attention. I was fourteen at the time, but my hair and body made me look older, I guess. I had long black hair down to my ass. I had a little waist, bigger hips and ass, and my cousins dressed me up with some nice tight jeans and cute top. I felt sexy, I felt grown, I felt a lot of attention on me, everyone was telling me how pretty I was.. I was around a lot of older people and people that to me at the time, were just so cool. I felt like one of them and at the time it was all I wanted. After the club we met up with the guys and my daughters father continued to try to talk to me. God knows I told him my age, and my female cousin also told him my age. She told him to leave me alone because I was only fourteen. He responded, ‚Äúage ain‚Äôt nothing but a number‚Äù. I‚Äôll never forget it because it gave me butterflies. I felt like he really wanted me and it made me feel good.
To shorten all of that up, months after, he continued to pursue me. I eventually gave in and hung out with him. He told me many sweet things and told me that he would protect me. He told me that guys talk and that no one considered me a hoe for talking to him. He told me my cousin was just jealous of me because I was very pretty. I fell for him and I gave in. That‚Äôs the raw truth. I became so obsessed with him because he was older and had a car and took me around with him, and I loved it. I thought I loved him for whatever I knew love to be at the time. I easily gave in to having sex with him and became even more attached to him. No one knew about us until I became pregnant.
Believe it or not, I was so damn naive, that I wouldn‚Äôt even pay attention to my period. I didn‚Äôt even think of the fact that I could get pregnant, and I didn‚Äôt find out I was pregnant until I was about four and half months. I found out because my daughter kicked and I felt it. That‚Äôs when it really kicked in. I had my doubts weeks before. But I was in complete denial. Everything started to fit me so tight, my dad would call me a ‚Äúpansona‚Äù, and I was always so nauseous. I‚Äôd brush it all off though. I ignored it all until one day I put a sandal on my stomach and stared at it until it shaked. Each time my daughter kicked, the sandal shaked. I couldn‚Äôt deny it any longer. I had no choice but to accept it.
I remember not being able to sleep that night. I was so scared and nervous, that I even threw up a couple times throughout the night. I was in complete shock, I was so afraid for my father to find out, for my kids father to find out (because we stopped talking about a month or two before), and for the entire world to find out, really. I couldn‚Äôt even stay still. I cried all night. I didn‚Äôt know what to think.
From that day on I swear, everything just got crazier. The next day I went to school and some girl approached me at my locker and asked me if I was pregnant. I told her no and she told me that everyone thinks I am because of ‚Äúthe way I walk‚Äù. I was in ninth grade at the time. I remember feeling so embarrassed‚ÄìI said fuck this. I walked out of the back door and I never went back. I didn‚Äôt belong there. I wasn‚Äôt like them. I was nothing but a bad example.
Time went by and I ended up dropping out of school. I gave birth to my daughter and that little girl made me the happiest girl in the world. She was all the reason I needed. People would still talk shit about me, call me a bum, say that my life was over, my daughters father told everyone I lied about my age and they believed him. He was the second man I ever slept with but according to others, ‚Äúif I let him easily hit, of course I let many others hit as well‚Äù. That wasn‚Äôt true but fuck them. After so much of it, I just didn‚Äôt give a fuck what any one else said anymore. I expected everyone to talk shit about me. I mean, it was rare as fuck for someone as young as me to have a child. I get it. I just didn‚Äôt expect the ones I thought cared about my daughter and I to turn on me and degrade me as well. It‚Äôs cool though. Like I said, I was just focused on my daughter. She motivated me so much. I knew she counted on me for a better life and I was determined to provide it for her. I didn‚Äôt know how, but I made moves in efforts to find my way through it all. Whatever I felt benefited me, I did. That‚Äôs how I ended up selling drugs. I wanted to make money and move away with my daughter. That was the fastest way so I did it. I hated doing it and they spoke even more shit, but I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I couldn‚Äôt just sit back and expect shit to come to me. I couldn‚Äôt sit back and settle for less or depend on someone to come save me. I wanted my own shit, I had my own plans, my own goals and dreams, and I believed in myself. The more they said no, the more I wanted to prove them wrong. My dad would say shit like, ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm babysitting because I am not‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to take care of her because I didn‚Äôt sign up for this, you did. So figure it out.‚Äù Others would say, ‚ÄúYou wanted this so you now you deal with it‚Äù. My dad said those things before my daughter was born but then fell in total love with her the moment she was born. It was hard for him, I get it. But his love for us conquered all the rage and pain he had. Still, those type of comments motivated me. The more they said they wouldn‚Äôt help, the more I‚Äôd repeat that I didn‚Äôt need them. My daughter was born and I learned how to care for her all on my own. I was so obsessed and in love with her, I didn‚Äôt want anyone to get near her anyway.
I wasn‚Äôt like the rest, obviously. I was the only one I knew in my shoes. There was no one for me to relate to or to ask guidance to. But I didn‚Äôt seek for help anyway. Being let down by so many, being bullied and harassed and witnessing inhumanity at first hand, from even my own family members, realizing that I‚Äôm all on my own and that it‚Äôs up to me to do something about it‚ÄìI simply gave up on everyone. I started believing in myself over them. I didn‚Äôt want to be like them. I wanted to be better. I wanted to be kinder. I wanted to be big. I knew I was destined for more because I swear I could always feel it. I felt loved and cherished by God and out of every mistake, I gained so much wisdom and little by little, I trusted in myself and in life, more and more. After every down fall came a blessing and I never once looked past them. I realized and appreciated each and every one of my blessings. So much, that I eventually felt invincible and developed such a self-esteem and train of thought in which I began to believe in the impossible. I stopped believing in people so their words and opinions stopped affecting me. I stopped being controlled by them because I took control of my own life. I remember writing a letter to my mom, telling her that I‚Äôm sorry for hurting her, that I‚Äôm pregnant, but that I promise to become the best mother and I promised her I‚Äôd go to college and become somebody. She responded, ‚ÄúI never doubted you‚Äù, and man what that did to me! A lot. Her, God, my daughter, my father, my siblings and myself, was all I needed.
I dream the kind of dreams that others say would never come true, still today, because I did before, and they came true.
I was so lost and through every mistake and bad choice I made, through every betrayal, abuse, and painful encounter, I found my way. The foundation of it all was the belief and confidence I had in myself, and the love I have for my daughter. I took many risks and many leaps of faith, and everything, ultimately, led me to where I am today. I created a bond with God and ever since then, I‚Äôve literally felt guided and protected. Today I feel untouchable because like I said before, I wished and prayed for moments like today, and they all said it was over, but I proved them all wrong. I proved myself wrong because I, to a certain degree, doubted myself as well. I was always in denial of my mental gifts and capabilities, but the more and more I elevate, the more and more my self-esteem rises. The more I accomplish, the more I reach for the stars.
I literally went from being pregnant at fourteen years old, broke, on welfare, harassed, bullied, laughed at, abandoned, abused, degraded, devalued, spit on , going to jail, losing my daughter to a foster system, dropping out of high school, and more.
To,
Today,
A proud mother of two beautiful smart and sweet girls. They are twelve and eight years old and they have never hit each other. They can‚Äôt even talk back to me without feeling bad because I‚Äôm literally their soft spot. They look up to me. I‚Äôve had them in private school for the past four years, I am entering my senior year of nursing school, on my way of obtaining my bachelors in science degree in nursing, to become one of the best registered nurses in history, I have a cum laude gpa of 3.35, I am minoring in behavioral neuroscience, I have been a valued employee at a level one trauma hospital as a certified nursing assistant for a little over seven years, around the most amazing men and women professionals that inspire me everyday, I‚Äôve always had my own car, I‚Äôve been living on my own with my children so I‚Äôm the sole bread winner of the house, I live in a nice quiet beautiful apartment and area, and I am respected and loved by so many. I hear congratulations and that I‚Äôm an inspiration instead of ‚Äúyour life is over and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a loser‚Äù. Every year things get better and better for me. I of course still struggle, I have my moments of doubts, I break down kind of often, I continue to make mistakes, etc., but I have now learned that life is about living it, and living it to me, is taking advantage of every opportunity it offers. Even when times get difficult, I learned to find opportunity through them. Even if it‚Äôs enhancing my strength‚Äìthat does a lot for me. Anytime I‚Äôm hurting and feel like I‚Äôm falling apart, I think back at where I used to be and it makes me even stronger. I fall but then I get back up with a bang. I‚Äôm still trying to figure myself out, but I think I‚Äôm heading in the right direction. My father is already so proud of me, my children look up to me, my mother shows me off to everyone, others look up to me , and honestly‚ÄìI‚Äôm just so humbled. Although I recognize my blessings and will never take them or my life for granted, I struggle loving myself and with remaining composed, but through you all, through love of humanity, I rise and remember that I too, matter. I surround myself around admirable, beautiful hearted, good souled , people and professionals, and there is just no better medicine. I stopped believing in people, but not in the world. I believe that the more people like me share their story, and the more we spread love instead of animosity, and the more we accept instead of deny‚Äìthe more uplifted we‚Äôll all be, the more life we‚Äôll all live, and the more dreams we‚Äôll all dream.
I‚Äôm not perfect, and I‚Äôm humble enough to know that I am not better than anyone, but I am wise enough to know that I am different from the rest.
If I could have things my way, I‚Äôd make us stop beating each other down, I‚Äôd eliminate the unkind judgements we make upon each other, the dominating assumptions, the limited beliefs and low self-confidence that too many of us have, and I‚Äôd eliminate the social pressure that controls us. It took so many years to find the strength and bravery to even speak on this subject, as I always felt ashamed of myself for the way my life played out. I am grateful to have made it this far, especially considering the fact that many commit suicide in the face of bullying, inequality, injustices, abuse, trauma, hardships, loneliness, depression, hopelessness, inhumanities and more.. I could have gave up and ended my own life years ago. God knows I thought about it. But I persevered instead.
I don‚Äôt know how the rest of my life will turn out, but incase God decides to take me before I‚Äôm able to accomplish the rest of my goals and dreams, I want my daughters to know that my biggest and most beautiful dream come true and blessing, was being able to love and be loved in return by them. Everything else is just a part of living my life, but my very best and most defining moments, where the ones that included them. I want my daughters and the rest of the girls and boys out in the world to know that I believe in them, because I am proof that believing in yourself is enough to conquer the world. Never stop fighting and believing in yourselves, and believe and fight for who and what you love.
Thank you all for taking the time to read this part of my story. I appreciate it more than ya‚Äôll can ever imagine and because of you all, I am so proud to also be a writer.
Love,
Denisse ‚ù§

Broadway struggles to take steps into the future. But thankfully, there are a few orgs out there that are grabbing its hand and pulling it, kicking and ‚Äústreaming‚Äù into the 21st century.
And in the past few days, we‚Äôve made some headway on the subject of filmed theatrical productions, which is near and dear to my handheld device.
On Monday, Tony Award winners Stewart F. Lane and Bonnie Comley announced that BroadwayHD, a company they started dedicated to capturing Broadway content, was now in the business of streaming theater to anyone with access to the web. You can join and watch Orlando Bloom in Romeo and Juliet, the Tony Award-winning Memphis, Jekyll & Hyde and a ton more. Of course, the majority of the titles in their online catalog are from UK productions (click here to read my take on that), but it‚Äôs a step . . . and more than a baby step . . . to educating our audiences and more importantly, us content creators, that there is another distribution method for our shows. And this distribution method means additional revenue for the artists, and for the investors . . . and is a massive marketing tool for the specific productions (licensing anyone?) and for theater as a whole.
And last night, Lincoln Center and Playbill offered a live stream of Songwriters, a concert performance of songs by Robert L. Freedman (A Gentleman‚Äôs Guide to Love and Murder), Ryan Scott Oliver, Kerrigan and Lowdermilk, Nick Blaemire and more, featuring Broadway A-list talent like Alice Ripley and Jeff Blumenkrantz.
Not bad, right? Anything to give theater fans something to watch besides another rerun of SVU.
Seriously, when we can start competing with television and Netflix, we will get a massive leg up on our competition. And no, I‚Äôm not worried about losing our audience. Movies from musicals (even the bad ones) have proven over and over that grosses always go up when there is a movie in the market.
I‚Äôd expect both BroadwayHD and Lincoln Center/Playbill to offer more and more titles in the future. And I‚Äôd expect other orgs to follow the lead of these innovators and offer streaming of their own.
In fact, they say things happen in threes. So maybe there‚Äôs another big announcement coming soon.
And maybe it will be from me.

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) refers to the scarring of the interstitium (the supporting framework of the lungs as well as the pulmonary tissues), with fibroblast proliferation, deposition of extracellular matrix and progressing fibrosis of the tissues. It is a debilitating, lethal condition which worsens progressively, leading to decreasing lung volumes and hypoxemic respiratory failures, and eventually death if left untreated. It has a mean overall survival time of 2 to 3 years. Around 7 to 16 cases of IPF are reported every year per 100,000 in the USA.
Stem cell therapy has been shown to have the ability of regenerating damaged organs and tissues totally or partially, depending on their potential and source of extraction. Totipotent stem cells (TSC), which are found during the placental stage of development of newborns within the mother‚Äôs womb, are considered to be the ones with maximum potential and have been shown to possess the ability to totally regenerate an organism.
Read more about it:The 2016-11A and 2016-11B cells produced the overlapping red and green curves, with the gritty section due to crappy battery pack connections:
The lower curve comes from an old unprotected cell harvested from a defunct media player and retrieved from the to-be-recycled pile.
I picked 1 A as a reasonable value for their intended use in flashlights and maybe a helmet camera. Unlike some other cells in the recent past, these deliver 3.0 A¬∑h, reasonably close to their rated 3.4 A¬∑h capacity at a (presumably) lower current.
Replotting the voltage vs. energy delivered doesn‚Äôt show any surprises:
The voltage declines more-or-less linearly, without the relatively flat discharge curve for smaller cells, which explains why the J5 V2 flashlight becomes seriously dim after a few hours. On the upside, that allows a reasonably accurate state-of-charge display.
Assuming the Sony HDR-AS30V camera burns 0.1 W¬∑h/min while recording (which is a fancy way of saying it dissipates 6 W), then it should run for (10 W¬∑h)/(0.1W¬∑h/min) = 100 min from one of these cells fitted as an outrigger. The best of the NP-BX1 cells for the camera delivers something like 90 minutes from a measured capacity of 4 A¬∑h at 500 mA; I don‚Äôt know what to make of those numbers. Perhaps the camera runs the NP-BX1 cells below the 2.8 V cutoff I‚Äôve been assuming?As its name suggests, Ghost Bubba is a mysterious Indica-Dominant strain%.Welcome to the IMN Tribute Site!

who took that picture? love it!!FountainBlue‚Äôs March 15 When She Speaks event was on the topic of ‚Äò Difficult Conversations ‚Äì Bring Them On‚Äô.
We were fortunate to have such a diverse and powerful group of panelists who so succinctly and candidly shared their thoughts on how and why to conduct difficult conversations. It was also amazing to have such a strong showing of executives ‚Äì male and female ‚Äì representing a top-down, bottom-up support for diversity, inclusion and leadership from our host company!
We began by talking about why difficult conversations are needed, and how having a diverse population and an open leads to better business results.
But change takes time, and having those ‚Äòdifficult‚Äò conversations to facilitate necessary change is not an ‚Äòeasy‚Äò task, by definition. Below are some thoughts on how we can each find a comfortable way to have that difficult conversation:
- There‚Äôs no magic formula for being confident and courageous. Each of our panelists had different backgrounds and upbringings, but we all had to overcome some kind of adversity at an early age.
- In the examples provided, it was often the case where others did nothing, yet the panelists chose to think, say or do that difficult thing. Sometimes that brought the desired result in short order. Often it did not. But regardless of the result, it was a learning and a step forward.
- Choose to be assertive, but only when it makes sense. But be plan-ful when you make that choice as there will certainly be consequences.
- Build a network of supporters and mentors and sponsors who will support you through easy and difficult conversations.
- Understand the motivations and mindset of those who don‚Äôt think like you ‚Äì regardless of whether there will be a difficult conversation.
- Along those same lines, even when you think someone is very similar to you, there may at some point be a difficult conversation at some point.
- Focus on the facts and data rather than on the feelings and emotions.
- With that said, with difficult conversations, emotions will likely run high ‚Äì either yours or others‚Äô! So know yourself and your own buttons and triggers and proactively manage that. Know where the other party is coming from and manage from there.
- Practice the 90-second rule ‚Äì if you let someone vent emotionally for 90 seconds, they may feel heard and you may get real information to help you plan. The trick is to not get angry and defensive during the tirade.
- Make, grow and maintain relationships before, during and after the necessary difficult conversations.
- Be your candid, authentic, unique self. It‚Äôs good enough.
- Be humble and inquisitive, especially when that other person makes you feel uncomfortable.
- Be open to a reality you didn‚Äôt consider when you adopted your current position.
Sometimes, having a difficult conversation is not enough. Walking points include:
- Lack of respect for the other party
- Loss of trust between the parties
- Mis-alignment on goals
- Too much delta between the parties
We closed with the full topic of the conversation ‚Äì Difficult Conversations ‚Äì Bring Them On. For they are a necessary part of our personal growth, and the growth of our team, company and industry. Lead On!

And while the ruling doesn‚Äôt change my life in any real way, it does give many of my friends the same rights that many of us take for granted simply for having been born straight.
I decided that I had to do something to help celebrate this day. I didn‚Äôt know what might happen, given gay marriage has been legal in California in June 2013, but I had the idea to go to the Santa Clara County offices and hand out cupcakes to newlywed couples. If someone was eloping today in celebration, they deserved the best part of weddings: cake.
Given that the SCC Wedding Chapel was going to close at 3:40, I realized I didn‚Äôt have time to bake the cupcakes myself, so I got a tray of beautiful rainbow-colored cupcakes from Safeway, grabbed my camera in case anyone didn‚Äôt have someone taking pictures, and headed to downtown San Jose.
With the help of some employees, I found the wedding chapel, located adjacent to the cafeteria. The first thirty minutes or so were rough‚ÄìI almost gave up. honestly. A news crew from NBC Bay Area showed up, thinking like I had that there would be a line of people getting married. They left within a few minutes.
I decided to give it fifteen more minutes, and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I got to witness four couples getting ready to get married yesterday (I didn‚Äôt actually enter the chapel). I had positioned myself near the entrance of the chapel at one of the cafeteria tables. It was a little awkward at first‚ÄìI was just sitting there, and several people just assumed I was waiting for another wedding.
Eventually, the universe smiled and someone asked me what the cupcakes were all about. And I explained to them what I was hoping to do: bring a little wedding cake joy to anyone getting married on this historic day.
The idea was a hit, and I almost started crying. After that, everything just kind of flowed perfectly. I met four couples yesterday, some opposite-sex, some same-sex, all super happy to be getting married that day. I‚Äôm actually on the official camera rolls of one of the couples, which was so fun.
I wanted to share this with you all simply because it was fun. And appreciated. Small gestures as allies can go a long way toward showing people how much others care. Pride is happening up in San Francisco this weekend, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be one of the most amazing on record. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm going to be able to take part, but being around yesterday‚Äôs couples totally filled a need to be outside doing something that I didn‚Äôt realize I had been missing. It‚Äôs been a whirlwind couple weeks of events for our nation, between the events Charleston and SCOTUS‚Äô decisions on the ACA and FHA. I‚Äôve been outside my bubble of close friends and family, so going out and doing something fun simply for the sake of doing it was refreshing. And seeing the joy of the happy couples getting married (and enjoying cake‚Äìwho doesn‚Äôt love cake??) was so worth it.
Let‚Äôs be real, the upholding of the constitutionality of same-sex marriage (or, as we should probably call it, marriage) isn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the discrimination LGBTQIA individuals face on a daily basis, in the same way that having a black president didn‚Äôt end racism. Multiple states still have no laws protecting the aforementioned individuals from being fired based on their sexual orientation. But yesterday was a step toward making a large portion of the US population feel like accepted citizens of our country. One good friend expressed her feelings as ‚Äúoverwhelming,‚Äù that she now felt like a full citizen of our country by being given the legal ability to marry the woman she loves. And yes, this friend is in California, where she could legally have done this since 2013. But there is something amazing about the knowledge that your marriage options aren‚Äôt limited by the state you live in, that all people who feel as you do have the same right to marriage as any heteromonogamous couple.
This isn‚Äôt the first major decision on who can marry whom this country has gone through. Anti-Miscegenation laws in the United States weren‚Äôt officially deemed unconstitutional until 1967 in Loving v. Virginia. Spanning from all non-whites in several southern states, to laws specifically including Blacks, Asians, and Native Americans in countless others, anti-miscegenation laws are generally recognized as racist today (though trust me, there are many exceptions). But these laws were justified with the Bible in the same way that laws against same-sex marriage have been justified my whole life.
I can‚Äôt fully understand the joy so many of my friends yesterday. And while yes, my partner and I do sometimes get dirty looks when we‚Äôre out together, I generally go from day-to-day without my current relationship being questioned by anyone (in fact, generally it‚Äôs pretty encouraged). But knowing that even fifty years ago, that wouldn‚Äôt have been the case (hell, it wouldn‚Äôt have even been legal), breaks my heart.
I could talk about the separation of church and state, or Judao-Christian values. I could be an utter snob and translate some biblical Hebrew or Greek to show off my MA knowledge. But trust me, it doesn‚Äôt work. Instead, I‚Äôm choosing to focus on the looks on the faces of brides and grooms I saw yesterday, the joy that literally radiated off of them. I‚Äôll focus on those friends who expressed relief for finally feeling a part of this crazy project we call America. And I‚Äôll feel grateful that a small step was made toward improving the quality of life of so many families across our country, families who will now have inheritance rights, death benefits, health insurance, and access to most of the basic economic and social rights so many of us take for granted.Despite."
The rapper noted on Twitter that he would prefer a little creativity be used when determining the cause of death the next time the Internet proclaims him dead.
‚ÄúWho ever started da rumor dat I was dead is funny as hell,‚Äù Game tweeted Monday. ‚ÄúIf u gone spread rumors, b more creative. Say, I had a fight wit the Toy Story cast or sumn & it turned fatal ha ha."
Ya'll need to stop hating....he one the realist rapper's out there!! can't wait for the album to drop.
Ever since grey school I pushed the Coke like Pepsi! Wow! That is some good ish!! Keep it up!! He is one of the best rappers!
Come on son ... Game will shine always !! Next Album drops 08/24/10 R.E.D
This guy is fake.....
[youtube=]
Who?
one of the realest rappers alive..........he'd better stay alive and keep hip hop alive as well.....big fan
nothing against the guy personally, but if he was dead, neither the rap world nor the world at large would take it as a big loss ‚Äì he's not very influential in rap and certainly not a good role model for the world ‚Äì judging from his twithead post, the guy can't even spell
I just heard the Game was over. It ended in a draw. They're going to do it over.
Relax. Most women aren't that obvious when breastfeeding.
But baby's gotta eat, too.
wrong article
every time he looks in the mirror in the morning he loses the game
LOL!!!
Ah man...I though they were talkin' about the show The Game...The one with the twin from Sister, Sister...I hate that they took The Game off, that show was really good.
After reading this statement where he's telling everyone the name of his album AND telling them to get it, it's clear that this death rumor was a publicity stunt pulled by him and his people to promote his lame wannabe gangsta music. The next time he tries to pull a stunt like this, someone should tell him to be smart about it. Do not to promote your album while clearing up the death rumors, you made it a little bit too obvious that it was a publicity stunt.
If you're a fan of this clown, you're stupid and you deserve to be shot for supporting this nonsense.
Why do you think that you are the one that gets to decide what music is good? Do you know what the word "opinion" means? Not everyone has the same thoughts, ideas, or opinions that you do. Just the fact that you think you know best, makes you the stupid one, not Game fans. I think you should be the one that should be shot. Your comment probably sounded really cool in your head, made you feel superior, but just the fact that you think YOU decide what music is good makes me sick. You are an idiot. What do you listen to, country music? Country music sucks, but that's just my opinion, so I wouldn't hold it against you or call you stupid if you really do like that cowboy crap.

I am predicting a whole lot of "Who cares?" and "Who?" comments. Let's not forget the "Rap Sucks" comments, too.
I do know this guy, though, and I'm not a big fan. He's a little too narcisisstic for my tastes. He has a lot of lyrical flow, but that's about it. "Hate It Or Love It" was his best work, and that's about it... just my opinion.
Good thing your opinion doesn't mean much.
Originally, I wasn't going to comment because mine would have been a Who? comment...but since you posted this...
My first thougth when I saw the headline was "GAH! I just lost 'THE GAME'! I had been doing so well for a few weeks now. And now, if you hadn't already thought that-you all just lost 'THE GAME' too.

Some brief overview of book
The life of a mother was supposed to bring new adventures, not halt the old ones. However with Maria it was just that. All she ever wanted was to enjoy life with everyone around her.
Getting married and having children brought so much to her life but consequently robbed Maria of herself. As she seeks to feel that relentless spark in her mundane life, Maria crosses paths with another man tempting to revitalize all that she has lost. It only takes one choice to change everything she once knew, transforming the ordinary into the adventure she always dreamed of.
However Maria learns that everything comes with a price and that cost could be her family. This book is intended for mature audiences.Multi-functional Modular Foam Furniture

NOBLE COUNTY, Ind. (WOWO) ‚Äì Two people face preliminary charges after several break-ins in Northern Indiana, according to our partners in news at ABC 21.
The Avilla Police Department said over 20 vehicles in three counties were broken into in a short period of time, which led to the arrests.
The Group Dekko Plant reported several vehicles that were broken into. A victim of the report told police her credit card was used at a quick mark to purchase gas.
After obtaining security footage, police were unable to identify the persons of interest.
The stolen vehicle used at the quick mark was spotted in Kendallville and officers were able to make contact with the suspect.
Officers found numerous stolen items in the vehicle along with methamphetamine and other drug paraphernalia.
Stolen items range from Avilla, Rome City, LaGrange County and Elkhart County.
30-year-old Boni Coffelt of Albion was arrested on preliminary charges of theft and possession of meth.
The Avilla Police Department also obtained a search warrant for a home in the 110 block of South Riley Street in Kendallville.
Officers searched the home for stolen property or drug-related paraphernalia.
The officers found prescription drugs, methamphetamine, paraphernalia and other stolen property.
The resident of the home, Timothy Sillaway, was arrested.
Sillaway faces preliminary charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession of paraphernalia and maintaining a common nuisance.
The case remains under investigation.New LA Program To Divert Certain Low-Level Arrestees Away From Jail And Into Treatment
This week L.A. County launched a pilot program that aims to divert certain people arrested for low-level crimes away from the jail system and into treatment.
People with a mental illness or a substance use disorder or who are unhoused will be eligible for the program if they‚Äôre arrested for certain misdemeanors and non-violent felonies and headed for processing at LAPD‚Äôs 77th Street Regional Jail.
Instead of having charges filed against them, they will be connected with someone from the nonprofit Special Service for Groups‚Äô Project 180. Staff from that group will be present around the clock at the 77th Street station to do assessments and find services and housing for people who qualify.
‚ÄúThe idea is to give people as many off-ramps throughout the entire process ‚Äî as humanly possible and as early as possible ‚Äî that they land back into a safe community for them and their families,‚Äù said Ret. Judge Songhai Armstead, executive director of LA County‚Äôs Alternatives to Incarceration Office, which is overseeing the pilot.
She said L.A.‚Äôs District Attorney and City Attorney jointly came up with the list of charges that would be suitable for diversion. Those who commit a serious offense, such as a violent felony, or who have a prior serious offense, will be ineligible for the program.
Judge Armstead said she sees the pilot as one step towards addressing the over-incarceration of unhoused people and those living with a substance use or mental health disorder.
L.A. County Jail's mental health population has reached more than 6,000, the highest it's ever been.
The plan is to expand the program to nine additional police and sheriff‚Äôs stations throughout L.A. County, with the Long Beach and Pomona Police Departments expected to join the effort this summer.Abstract
Proof of concept measurements are presented demonstrating a femtosecond localized E-Field measurement for species independent measurements. The measurement method utilizes electric field induced second harmonic generation for localized E-field measurements with a sub-picosecond temporal resolution possible. In the current work, a CCD camera is used as the detector and calibrations have been completed showing a minimum sensitivity on the order of 500 - 800 V/cm for the given experimental setup. Work has been completed to image the beam for several gases in order to demonstrate the versatility of the measurement method, as well as measurements verifying the expected dependence upon both electric field strength and pump beam intensity. Using a camera as the detector allows for the ability to look at the beam modal structure to better understand the polarization dependence of the nonlinear susceptibilities in the four wave mixing process.

- 427The classic road race movie The Cannonball Run was released on Jun 19, 1981, 30 years ago today. It starred Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, Roger Moore, Jamie Farr and a host of other celebrities like Jackie Chan, Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Terry Bradshaw and Adrienne Barbeau.
Watch the trailer:
Some interesting trivia about the film:
The film was originally going to be a straight up action flick starring Steve McQueen. After McQueen‚Äôs death, the lead was given to Burt Reynolds and the script was re-written as a comedy.
The race in the movie is based on an actual, real life race that took place over several years in the 70s. I discuss the origins of the real race; The Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash here.
Many of the vehicles, including the ambulance driven by Reynolds and Deluise, were actually entered and run in the real life Cannonball races in the late 70s.
Roger Moore plays Seymore Goldfarb, Jr, a spoof of James Bond, who he was portraying at the time. In the race, he drives an Aston Martin which is famously linked to the British secret agent. However, Moore never drives an Aston Martin in the seven movies he appeared as James Bond. This movie is the only on-screen pairing of Moore and the famous car.
This movie features one of Jackie Chan‚Äôs first US appearances. His character is Japanese, even though Chan himself is Chinese. Chan was inspired by director Hal Needham‚Äôs use of bloopers during the end credits and from this point on would do the same in all of his own movies.
Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise appeared together in Smokey and the Bandit Part II the previous year. This movie makes several references to that earlier movie including Reynolds mentioning the black Trans-Am and Deluise referencing his doctor character.
Watch the end credit outtakes
The Cannonball Run had two sequels. The first was The Cannonball Run II in 1984. Part II reunited the majority of the cast from the first movie. The second sequel was Speed Zone in 1989. The only returning character in the third movie was Jamie Farr‚Äôs The Sheik. The two leads were John Candy and Eugene Levy, friends who appeared together on SCTV and in the movie Armed and Dangerous. Their casting was an attempt to recreate the chemistry of original leads, and friends, Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise.
This movie still holds up today. Reynolds and Deluise are hilarious and it seemed the entire cast had a blast filming the movie. Part II also holds up very well and fans may actually remember more scenes from Part II than the original.Posted By

Suren Moodliar (1991) Back in the USSR: Shopping for a Theory, Free Association, FallAt the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, directed by Andrei Belgrader
The Master Builder, the 1893 play by the great Norwegian dramatist, Henrik Ibsen, begins with this complaint from a character: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take it anymore!‚Äù These words set the mood for strife and unhappiness among the various family members and employees of architect Halvard Solness, which ends in tragedy for the ‚Äúmaster builder‚Äù himself.
A production of Ibsen‚Äôs work was staged at BAM‚Äôs Harvey Theater in Brooklyn earlier this summer.
Solness (John Turturro) has built up a practice and achieved a degree of fame by seizing on opportunities to build based on his premonitions of disasters. He employs Knut Brovik (Julian Gamble), who was once his competitor, Brovik‚Äôs son Ragnar (Max Gordon Moore) and Kaja Fosli (Kelly Hutchinson), his bookkeeper.
The elder Brovik is ill and begs Solness to give his son professional approval and allow him to design a new house so that he can begin his career and marry Kaja. Solness won‚Äôt hear of this because he is terrified of competition from the young. Moreover, he is romantically involved with Kaja, a fact that Solness‚Äôs wife, Aline (Katherine Borowitz), suspects.
John Turturro, a fine actor with many television and film credits, including Do the Right Thing (1989), Barton Fink (1991), Quiz Show (1994) and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), supplies the play with energy and vibrancy. He lets the audience feel that Solness is brusque and selfish, but not cruel, as he strides up and down in his knee-high boots.
Early in the play, Solness‚Äôs wife Aline moves onstage in a gentle, understated manner, blinking in denial at the intimacy between her husband and Kaja. Borowitz‚Äôs Aline makes the audience laugh, and one senses almost immediately that director Andrei Belgrader is undercutting a more somber tone in the play, intentionally or not.
A potentially comic moment, though, is handled well, as Solness bemoans his inevitable downfall when, he fears, he will hear ‚Äúyouth knocking on the door.‚Äù Just then, such a knock is heard (this is in Ibsen‚Äôs original script) and a young woman, Hilde Wangel (Wrenn Schmidt), enters. Turturro does not play this for laughs.
Hilde explains that 10 years ago, when she was 14, she watched him set a wreath on the steeple of a church he had designed in her village. She tells Solness that he kissed her and promised her a kingdom, and that she has returned to have him make good on the offer.
Hilde plays a decisive role in Solness‚Äôs life from that point on, functioning as a dreamlike, emotional provocateur, an ardent admirer and bird of prey all in one. Ibsen is bending the realism of the play here toward an illustrative symbolism. Hilde clearly represents youth and temptation, but Ibsen does succeed in individualizing her.
Wrenn Schmidt‚Äôs Hilde wears a light, revealing gown (the other female characters are more covered up). She plays up the ‚Äúgroupie‚Äù more than the admonishing ghost. Her body language and tone of voice are seductive, but they seem to downplay the kind of seduction Ibsen may have had in mind. It is clear that with her presence Ibsen intends a sexual element to have entered the drama, but Belgrader chooses to overemphasize it.
Knut Brovik takes to his deathbed, but Solness still will not relent and sign Ragnar‚Äôs drawings. Solness reveals to Hilde the horrible accident that befell his family, but which also granted him success in his career. He gets to the heart of the matter, perhaps the essential tragedy of the play, when he calls himself an artist who must sacrifice to create.
It is finally through Hilde‚Äôs influence that Solness signs the younger Brovik‚Äôs designs and lets him get on with his life, although even that also has an unhappy result. Hilde then pushes Solness toward a full embrace of his fantasies of breaking with this life and going forward, with deadly consequences. The Master Builder treats a situation that is unsatisfying to everyone involved. The characters struggle with complexities of life beyond their control and try to find solutions, but they are unable to remake their world.
There is a certain resonance today in the condition of the relatively small-scale master builder Halvard Solness. One cannot help but be reminded of a principal in a Manhattan architectural firm, who is materially well off, but whose creative ambition has been frustrated by the demands of the market.
Turturro‚Äôs determined voice could just as well belong to the designer who has never seen another plan of his completed after an initial great success. The figure of the artist who has major accomplishments to his credit, but has encountered profound limitations remains in the social landscape today.
Staging the play and unpacking, or at least suggesting, its meaning to a contemporary audience must have been a difficult task. Overall, the BAM production was an artistic success. Actors, script, design and direction worked together to produce an impact.
The sets were spare. The rooms in all three acts were framed by sloping beams arranged like the scaffolding of a house. Within this overall theme, the set in the opening scene realistically represented an architect‚Äôs offices with plans in folders, desks and lamps, though most of the office in the back was hidden in shadow. In the second scene, a living room was depicted with more light, and in the third, a garden with still more, but the architectural motif remained throughout.
The acting in the play was excellent, although director Belgrader seems to have given Turturro the most latitude to explore his character. Borowitz‚Äôs Aline‚Äôs was somewhat too muted, and the director, as we have already noted, overemphasized the sexual element in Schmidt‚Äôs portrayal of Hilde, though that is hardly surprising in today‚Äôs cultural climate.
For almost a century and half, Ibsen‚Äôs plays have been renowned for displaying a fierce and principled type of middle-class revolt of the individual against an oppressive society. Ibsen dramatized the status of women ( A Doll‚Äôs House [1879]), the individual who strikes out against corruption and conformity ( An Enemy of the People [1882]) and the son who challenges the hypocrisy of his family ( The Wild Duck [1884]). His work exercised an enormous intellectual influence in the latter part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Important figures in the socialist movement played a major role in shedding light on Ibsen‚Äôs significance‚Ä¶and his limitations. Frederick Engels, Georgi Plekhanov, Franz Mehring, Anatoly Lunacharsky and Leon Trotsky all commented or wrote about the Norwegian playwright. The Russian Marxist Plekhanov noted in his famed 1891 essay, ‚ÄúIbsen, Petty Bourgeois Revolutionist,‚Äù that ‚ÄúHenrik Ibsen is unquestionably one of the greatest and most sympathetic figures in modern literature. As a dramatist he probably has no peer among his contemporaries.‚Äù
Plekhanov and Mehring in particular traced the quality of Ibsen‚Äôs revolt‚Äîwhich often included contempt for working people‚Äîback to the social conditions of Norway in the late nineteenth century, a country in which the middle class maintained a stronger social position and independence than in almost any other European nation.
There is a continuity with Ibsen‚Äôs previous theater work in The Master Builder. Like the characters in his earlier plays, Solness is engaged in a revolt against the conditions of his existence. He doesn‚Äôt set himself against the complacent and philistine conventions of his society, but rather against himself, his own arrogance and selfish fear. As with many of those earlier characters, there is a certain triumph, but for Solness, it also spells his downfall.
Mehring felt that Ibsen had become ‚Äúreally enigmatic‚Äù in The Master Builder, and there are certainly symbols in the play that are not easy to interpret. Nor do they combine to drive forward or produce a unified artistic meaning. But this performance of the play, particularly with the remarkable efforts of Turturro, and the excellent stage design and the overall direction of Belgrader (with a few troublesome slips), drove home something powerful and enduring.Audit

How To Get Your Outdoor Area Ready For Fire Pit SeasonTara Bradley Connell, Writer
Fall is the best time of year to gather friends around a fire. Fire pits don't just provide warmth, they also add ambiance. And you don't have to build an elaborate structure to have a relaxing area to enjoy throughout the year. Bonus: Some permanent installations can increase the value of your home.
From structures made of stone or metal to gas- or wood-burning setups, here are the different ways to add a fire pit to your outdoor living space.
Propane
People who like convenience often turn to a gas-burning fire pit. Anyone can appreciate turning on a fire pit with the flip of a switch. And lighting a fire pit doesn't get easier than using propane, which is available at almost every supermarket and gas station.
Propane creates a powerful flame, but adjusting the supply of fuel easily controls the intensity of the burn. Completely cutting off the propane safely extinguishes the fire. Concerning aesthetics, propane works with fire glass, lava rock or faux wood. Some styles, such as the Outland Firebowl, are so compact that you can transport them to other locations in the yard or to a tailgate or ball game.
Gel Fuel
Gel fuel burns clean and doesn't create any smoke or scent. Fire pits that use this fuel, such as the Southampton Gel Fuel Tabletop Fireplace, also don't give off much heat so they can be placed almost anywhere. Gel fuel comes in cans that are readily available and easy to switch out when you need a refill.
Natural Gas
For a more permanent ‚Äî and budget-friendly ‚Äî source, consider natural gas. As with propane, turning on the fuel supply ignites the fire; turning it off puts it out. Structures such as the Montego Gas Fire Table can also serve as attractive focal points to your gatherings. The only difference between propane and natural gas is the initial installation and hookup to the gas lines, but after that, worries about running out of fuel will go up in smoke.
Wood
Traditional wood fire pits bring back the scents and sounds of a good old-fashioned campfire. Wood fire pits can be metal, marble, brick or steel ‚Äî one of the most popular and compact options.
Sizes vary, but in the fire pit world, the bigger the bowl, the larger the flame. A fire pit like the Savannah Garden Light Fire Pit needs to be level and high enough off the ground that it doesn't burn the floor or patio. Proper placement also lets guests seated nearby stay warmer.
Wood-burning fire pits work in almost any open space. The only downside is hauling the actual wood. But once you do, you can relax in the natural glow and comforting scents. Throw in some s'mores and you can officially call yourself a fire pit master!In case some of you were getting a little worried about my psyche, this will reinforce those concerns.

During an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday morning, the actor and former football player said that Venit, one of the senior talent agents at William Morris Endeavor, touched his genitals at an industry party in February 2016.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at him and he‚Äôs basically staring at me, and he‚Äôs sticking his tongue out ‚Äî just overtly sexual kind of tongue moves‚Ä¶ He comes over to me. I stick my hand out and he literally takes his hand and puts it and squeezes my genitals,‚Äù Crews said. ‚ÄúI have never felt more emasculated, more objectified. I was horrified.‚Äù
Earlier this month, Crews filed a police report, which the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating, and dropped WME as his agency. Variety reported that Venit was on leave from the company pending an investigation into Crews‚Äô allegations. Venit and a spokesperson for WME did not immediately respond to TIME‚Äôs request for comment.
Crews said Wednesday that he immediately told comedian Adam Sandler, who was represented by Venit, about the encounter. Sandler‚Äôs spokesperson did not immediately respond to TIME‚Äôs request for comment. Venit has also represented Emma Stone, Diane Keaton, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Brett Ratner, who also faces allegations of sexual harassment (which he has denied.)
Crews, who has appeared in White Chicks, The Expendables and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, said he didn‚Äôt plan on coming forward with his story until the public allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein prompted women to discuss their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault using the viral hashtag #MeToo.
‚ÄúI will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong,‚Äù Crews said. ‚ÄúWhat kind of man would I be to tell my kids, ‚ÄòIf someone touches you where you don‚Äôt want to, tell someone,‚Äô if I‚Äôm not doing it myself?‚Äù

Out of Time
Since Charlie Watts passed away last month, I have really struggled to live my life. I realize this sounds crazy. The Stones are already on tour without him, and while that‚Äôs not right, the show must go on. The music must go on.
Charlie Watts was the best Stone. He was certainly the most English of them all. He kept maybe the least disciplined musicians in show business for 50 years.
What if his beat wasn‚Äôt just keeping the Stones together? What if he was keeping our universe together? What if there is only wrongness left for us all?
What can restart me, Dr. Perfect?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I‚Äôve long suspected Watts of tying the universe together through his drumming. Like the earth spinning on its axis, it‚Äôs one of those things we don‚Äôt entirely acknowledge or appreciate.
We can‚Äôt very well shunt the burden of our existence on a drummer of a rock band, but a post-Charlie Watts world is an undeniably scary place. I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôll be in the next few years.
If I could have only seen them one more time as a complete ensemble. I saw the Stones play Central Park in 1975, blitzed out of my mind on Italian ice. Brain freezes were all the rage.
Years later, I caught a Tampa show in the early 2000s. They sounded sharper than ever. Watts was on stage, smiling n the jumbotron, effortlessly drumming. They ended their set with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Spend the Night Together,‚Äù amid fireworks and an explosion of confetti. I never met the man, but at that moment, everything was right in the world.
Charlie is somewhere in a higher dimension, still keeping the beat, still letting all of us spend the night together. We‚Äôll all just have to listen a little harder.
Dr. Perfect has slung advice across the globe for the last two decades due to his dedication to the uplift of the human condition.The Fijian Dollar has been the currency of Fiji since 1969, when it replaced the pre-decimal Fijian Pound. It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively FJ$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.
Apart from the regular circulating coinage, the country has also authorised some foreign mints to issue commemorative and bullion coins under its jurisdiction. These are typically in standard bullion sizes, such as one ounce of silver (abbreviated as 1 oz Ag, where "Ag" comes from the Latin word for silver, Argentum).
The obverse of the coin shows at its centre the Coat of Arms of Fiji, as adopted in 1908 by a Royal Warrant, consisting of a shield divided quarterly by the Cross of St. George and charged with lion at the top, supported by two Fijian warriors, one on each side - one clutching a spear and one holding a totokia club, and topped with a takia - a traditional Fijian outrigger canoe, in full sail.
The objects on the Coat of Arms carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The Cross of St. George and the lion at the top represent the United Kingdom, the former colonial power that ruled over Fiji. The cacao pod held in the lion's paw, along with the sugarcane, coconut palm and bananas occupying three of the four quadrants, represent the country's natural resource. The bottom left quadrant contains a dove that symbolises peace.
At the bottom is the country's motto: Rerevaka na kalou ka doka na Tui; translated from Fijian: Fear God and honour the Queen.
Various designs as listed individually below.

my personal favorite:Since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office in 2017 ‚Äì after Park Geun-hye was impeached from the presidency for several charges, including bribery and abuse of power ‚Äì the Moon administration has taken a radically different stance on historical conflicts with Japan.
In 2015, under Park‚Äôs administration, South Korea reached a deal with Japan to compensate South Korean ‚Äúcomfort women,‚Äù the euphemistic term for women who were forced to sexually service the Japanese military during World War II. Seoul‚Äôs foreign minister, as well as Ban Ki-moon, the former U.N. secretary-general, touted the Park administration‚Äôs efforts to make the deal with Japan at the time. However, the agreement has ultimately broken down since Moon took office, as he made clear that he would not keep the agreement once he became president. The agreement was never popular among the South Korean public, largely because the comfort women victims themselves had not been consulted during the negotiation process.
Since then, Tokyo has explicitly condemned the Moon government‚Äôs efforts to overturn the comfort women agreement, concluding that Moon has no interest in cooperating with Japan. However, Moon has expressed his willingness to improve ties with Japan since he took office, by suggesting that the two countries can pursue a ‚Äútwo-track‚Äù approach to separately handle historical disputes and cooperation on common interests that could strengthen relations.
Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Party, once said that he is not ‚Äúan anti-Japanese‚Äù politician after some Japanese media introduced him as hawkish toward Japan. Ultimately, his stance on Japan is no different from Moon‚Äôs. Lee has made clear that he would seek to improve relations with Japan ‚Äì as Moon has repeatedly said ‚Äì but pointed out that such improvement can only take place when Japan shows a different approach to historical issues. Lee has particularly urged Japan to change its stance on the territorial dispute over Dokdo, which Tokyo calls Takeshima.
Lee has also called for South Korea to do more to punish pro-Japanese Koreans who had cooperated with the Japanese military to inform on the Korean Independence Army and suppress their activities during the Japanese military rule from 1910 to 1945. In this context, Lee emphasized the necessity of investigating and documenting the pro-Japanese activities of all chief officers who served at government agencies, not only during the colonial period but throughout the Republic of Korea‚Äôs history, up until today.
Yoon Seok-youl, the presidential candidate of the conservative People Power Party, however, has shown a different perspective on Japan. Yoon once told reporters that it is time to improve relations with Japan through a ‚Äúfuture-oriented‚Äù perspective, adding that Moon completely destroyed Japan-South Korea relations. Yoon cited the ‚ÄúKim-Obuchi declaration,‚Äù a joint declaration issued by former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and former Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi Keizo in 1998, as an example to show his will to improve relations with Japan. As the PPP‚Äôs party leader has promised to negotiate with Japan more actively than Moon, Yoon seems trying to make room for future negotiations with Japan should he become the president.
However, Lee countered that Yoon has a lack of understanding on the Kim-Obuchi joint declaration, which was based on the Japanese leader‚Äôs sincere apologies and willingness to take full responsibility for historical conflicts to move forward.
Experts in Seoul predict that it would be challenging for South Korea to seek ways to improve ties with Japan, regardless of who wins the presidential election next year. With Japan under the leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party, which takes a hawkish stance on the historical disputes, it seems impossible for Seoul to convince Tokyo to make a sincere apology directly to comfort women and forced laborers, much less to take legal responsibility to solve the issue.
‚ÄúI think making sincere apologies to Seoul by taking a forward-looking stance on the historical disputes is off Tokyo‚Äôs table,‚Äù Nam Ki-jeong, a professor of Japanese studies at Seoul National University, told The Diplomat.
The Moon administration has urged a two-track approach, which would separate out historical issues while finding momentum to cooperate with Japan on shared interests of the day, including North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and missile threats and the challenge of China‚Äôs rise. However, after several court rulings awarding compensation to Korean forced laborers, Japan is urging South Korea to handle the historical disputes first if it wants to improve ties.
Park Ji-won, director of South Korea‚Äôs National Intelligence Service, last year proposed that then-Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide make a joint declaration in a similar format to the Kim-Obuchi declaration in a bid to improve relations. According to media reports at the time, Suga refused to accept the proposal due to the two countries‚Äô disputes over historical conflicts.
The presidential election next year will naturally impact Seoul‚Äôs Japan policy, ‚Äúas the two major parties have different overtures and policies on North Korea on the basis of ‚Äònationalism,‚Äù Nam said. ‚ÄúThe relationships Moon and Park formed with North Korea and Japan are different. Therefore, it is important for the next government to reconcile these two important issues in a balanced manner.‚Äù
Meanwhile, the vice foreign ministers of South Korea, the United States, and Japan held a meeting on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. to discuss regional issues, including North Korea. The representatives said they had a productive meeting and were satisfied with the results. However, they failed to hold a joint press conference due to Japan‚Äôs complaint over the South Korean commissioner of the National Police Agency‚Äôs visit to Dokdo on Tuesday during the meeting, according to Choi Jong-kun, Seoul‚Äôs first vice foreign minister. Choi added that the commissioner‚Äôs visit was not on the official agenda to discuss.Zain KSA launches special bundles with free browsing for teachers and students

.Ever heard of the town of Portland, Tennessee? Show of hands?
Yeah, we thought not. Well folks, after tonight this tiny little metropolis is going to be very much on your gaydar, and not for any of the fun reasons. This town is, in fact, pulling a ‚ÄúFootloose‚Äù but for drag shows instead of dancing.
Yup, you heard me. They‚Äôre trying to make drag shows illegal.
Why, you ask? Are the good citizens of Portland, Tennessee allergic to FUN? Because that‚Äôs quite honestly the only reason I can think of it to make such a thing seem like the logical option. But no. It would seem that the people of Portland, Tennessee (because God forbid we confuse it with that other, fun Portland) are laboring under the misapprehension that drag shows are ‚Äúadult entertainment.‚Äù
Okay.
I mean,‚Ä¶
And that‚Äôs putting it politely.
After a Monday night town meeting, citizens and town officials spent over an hour discussing:
‚Äúa proposed amendment to a zoning ordinance that would effectively outlaw drag shows from happening in the downtown‚Äôs business district.‚Äù
To which we simply have to ask
We wish that this were not an actual thing that was happening in Trump‚Äôs America. But surprise! We‚Äôre living in Trump‚Äôs America, where drag is considered just below bestiality on the morality scale by some people in the middle of Tennessee.
We have but one thing to say. You can try to take the Tennessee out of drag, but you can‚Äôt take the drag out of Tennessee.
The sad news of 2016 got even sadder on Wednesday when the news came out that Debbie Reynolds, 84-year-old Hollywood legend, died after suffering a stroke, one day after her daughter, actress Carrie Fisher, died after suffering cardiac arrest. The sudden loss of the famous mother/daughter pair at the end of the same year that has seen the deaths of Prince, David Bowie, George Michael, Garry Marshall, Curtis Hanson, Florence Henderson, Leonard Cohen, Anton Yelchin, Gene Wilder, Muhammad Ali, Garry Shandling, Patty Duke, and Alan Rickman has felt especially cruel.
In the wake of this sudden loss of yet another of our entertainment icons, we should take a time to remember some of the movies that made Debbie Reynolds into the beloved actress she was. She came of age in the old studio system, working for names like Louis B. Mayer and Jack Warner, singing and dancing in musicals, stepping into the role of America‚Äôs sweetheart, going through one of the great Hollywood scandals of its time when her husband, Eddie Fisher, left her for Elizabeth Taylor. It‚Äôs the films, now, that will endure for her.
These five are some of her best and most emblematic, though it should be noted that some of Reynolds‚Äô work ‚Äî like the horror film she made with Shelley Winters, What‚Äôs the Matter with Helen?; or her multiple episodes playing Grace‚Äôs mother, Bobbi Adler, on Will & Grace ‚Äîisn‚Äôt currently available to stream. Here‚Äôs hoping that changes soon.
'Singin' in the Rain' (1952)
Before she was cast in Singin‚Äô in the Rain, Debbie Reynolds didn‚Äôt know how to dance, if you can believe that. She learned on the job, keeping up with the titanic talents of Gene Kelly and Donald O‚ÄôConnor. Together, the trio sang and danced their way into Hollywood history. Singin‚Äô in the Rain is universally acknowledged as being one of the best movie musicals ‚Äî if not the best ‚Äî in film history. It‚Äôs made the top 10 of the American Film Institute‚Äôs list of best movies of all time. It is emblematic of old Hollywood and classic musicals and the star system at its finest. And it made Debbie Reynolds a star.

'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' (1964)
The second of Reynolds‚Äô two signature roles came in this 1964 MGM musical about the real-life Maggie Brown, who enjoyed a rags-to-riches success and was a passenger aboard the Titanic who survived the historic sinking. Reynolds charged into the role with the kind of energy that earned raves, and the film has been synonymous with her ever since. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Debbie Reynolds‚Äô only competitive Oscar nomination (she won the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award last year).

'Divorce American Style' (1967)
Norman Lear ‚Äî creator of landmark TV series like All in the Family and Maude ‚Äî wrote this dark comedy that served as the sign of the times as the ‚Äô60s began to give way to modern concerns like infidelity, sex, and divorce. Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke starred as an unhappily married couple who separate, only for Van Dyke and his similarly divorced friend (Jason Robards) to hatch a plan to get Reynolds married off to someone else in order to get out of alimony payments. The sexual revolution, folks!

'Charlotte's Web' (1973)
Many don‚Äôt know that Debbie Reynolds provided the voice of Charlotte, the benevolent, maternal, friendly, and industrious spider whose efforts end up sparing the life of cheerful pig Wilbur. The book was a children‚Äôs classic, and the animated film quickly became so as well, if only because it‚Äôs the biggest guaranteed cry in the children‚Äôs literary canon.

'Mother'
Not counting TV guest appearances and cameos, Debbie Reynolds had only been in one movie (Oliver Stone‚Äôs Heaven & Earth) between 1971 and 1996. That 25-year drought was ended in a major way with Albert Brooks‚Äô comedy Mother. Reynolds plays Brooks‚Äô titular mom, a hall-of-famer in the fields of passive aggression and strategic obliviousness. Reynolds got raves for her comeback performance, a Golden Globe nomination, and came within a hair‚Äôs breadth of an Oscar nomination. Moreover, the film re-ignited her career, with subsequent roles in In & Out, Halloweentown, Will & Grace, and Behind the Candelabra.

While you‚Äôre at it, why not stream Postcards from the Edge, the Mike Nichols-directed 1990 movie adapted by Carrie Fisher from her own novel of the same name. Meryl Streep plays a fictionalized version of Fisher herself, an actress plagued by substance abuse and emotional distress, partially due to a complicated relationship with her Hollywood-legend mother, played by Shirley MacLaine. The movie itself is needle-sharp and very funny, and for decades the on-screen relationship between Streep and MacLaine has been a stand-in for Fisher and Reynolds‚Äô real-life relationship. Watch it for if nothing else the scene where MacLaine performs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Still Here‚Äù and takes up all the oxygen in the room.

I started this blog in part because some of my friends were sick of me constantly telling them about the history of Buffalo. I needed an outlet to share the stories, so the blog was born. My little hobby has grown and I love the community we have built.
Here are some stats from the last five years:
- The blog has covered 144 streets.
- There are 5,627 people who follow the blog.
- The blog has had 181,839 views. That is an average of about 100 views a day!
- I was able to purchase the buffalostreets.com domain.
- Early in 2014, I started giving presentations of the streets research. I have presented at Forest Lawn, to church groups, at Senior Centers (via Erie County University Express), on Winging It on WIVB-TV, on the Penny Wolfgang show on the radio, and to other various groups.
I appreciate all of you so much! Thanks to everyone who sends me comments and emails, and everyone who shares their stories with me. I hope you all know how much I appreciate hearing your ideas and memories of things just as much as I love giving you the facts. One of the highlights of my life as a history blogger was when I was recognized as the streets girl by a former congressman!
I may not have time to reply to every single comment ‚Äì but I do read and appreciate them all. I notice when you share blog posts on facebook or twitter, and I appreciate that as well. Sometimes, if I don‚Äôt reply, it‚Äôs because you piqued my interest and I‚Äôm trying to do some research for you before I reply. Buffalo‚Äôs history is a rich fabric and it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll never completely know everything. But I‚Äôm happy to be a part of it all and sharing what I can. I wish I had time to post more often, but this is still just a hobby for me. A wonderful, rewarding, satisfying hobby that I will keep up for a long time.
A question I often get is ‚Äúwill you write a book?‚Äù This is on my long range plan. It may be a long, long, long range plan, but hopefully eventually I will find a way to make it happen. Until then, I‚Äôll keep plugging away, and discovering Buffalo, one street at a time.
Lots of Buffalove,
Angela Keppel

Congrats on reaching the 5 year mark! As a South Buffalonian (Dismonda Street), I have to tell you, I just returned from a visit to Dunkirk NY where streets have names like Gazelle, Ocelot, Leming, and Jerboa. I wonder why they choose such names? Thanks for this blog. As a Buffalo ex-pat, I appreciate every post!

Home Remote dashboard app and MSR HTTP API
For those using the Home Remote dashboard app, this maybe of interest, Bill has just shown me how to more easily either create buttons on your own custom pages or "Scene" devices / tiles on Group pages, that when pressed will send out HTTP commands to MSR, to then run either a Global Reaction or a Rule Set that is triggered via a Global Expression value change.
Been wanting to be able to do this for a while now.
This is a custom page with regular buttons, these two test buttons are initiating Global Reactions in MSR:
This is a GROUP page with "Scene" tiles, these are initiating Rule Sets in MSR:
I recall from earlier Home Remote tutorials that you can round-trip device status pretty easily FROM the dashboard (you press a virtual button) TO Vera/other controller, which UPDATES Reactor/MSR (via entity status watches), then BACK to Home Remote (via MSR rule sending HTTP in this case), which UPDATES the dashboard (same button you initially pressed or any other receiving element).
In light of that, have you attempted to create any "ganged" switches whereby turning ON/OFF A causes B, C, and D also to turn ON/OFF?
That's always been a topic of interest for me -- all the more now that you've brought HTTP GET into the picture (since, for example, you can send/receive such commands with EventGhost running on a PC, which opens up lots of possibilities there...). It becomes a question of "Where to 'gang' them?"
HR has internal logic, so it could theoretically happen there. MSR obviously has built-in logic. Vera can group or gang things together using the Switchboard plug-in, as one prime example. (Especially if you use the purpose-built "multi" switch type and use binary inputs to drive each toggle on/off!) And surely other options I'm not even thinking of at the moment.
I'm eager to hear more about what you do with this type of construct.
I am not using any of Home Remotes own internal scenes / logic, I couldn't see the point of that
For me all logic should be done from one master controller which is MSR.
Once I have moved my remaining Vera scenes that have logic (LUA code) to MSR then MSR will be doing everything. As you know I am no longer using PLEG.
Home Remote for me is just that a dashboard remote control app.
Home Remote is connected to my Vera Plus hub and Philips Hue Bridge, so all those devices and scenes I can control in the Home Remote dashboard.
I am not grouping any lights really nothing to speak of other than my side table lamps.
I have two in my lounge room for example and I created a "Master" virtual dimmer device in Vera and then a rule with an expression in MSR that groups the control of the two lamps.
So when I turn On / Off or Dim the "Master" virtual dimmer device, then both real lamp devices follow suit etc.
Now, here comes my essential question: How does Home Remote "know" to update its dashboard symbol for LIGHT A after you've tapped its button on the screen? Does it receive an update (via HTTP I presume) from Vera letting
HAHR know that "It's on now"?
I guess I could ask more simply, "How does
HAHR stay 'in sync' with devices on Vera?"
I don't know exactly how Bill is doing the Vera integration with Home Remote.
However I do know he is using the SDATA output stream from Vera
So presumably it's the status of devices from SDATA, that updates the icons / states of the devices in the Home Remote GUI.
As for control I assume he is using the Vera HTTP API (Luup Requests).
As for what I am doing here creating buttons in Home Remote to run MSR actions (scenes), I don't really need any status feedback, they are just manually initiated scenes for basic things.
Okay, roger that, and thanks. It's great that HR (I think I called it HA for some odd reason earlier, sorry) and Vera "talk" that way. I'm now recalling that the lengthy tutorial I watched of his -- where the user had to essentially "code" all the feedback from actual devices -- involved a WiFi-connected amplifier. Unlike Vera, that device didn't "push" updates to HR in real time, so it had to be polled on every change.
I am using Group pages in HR rather than building my own custom pages from a blank slate.
Group pages are auto generated for you. You just create a Windows Explorer folder like structure in the designer application, for your desired menu structure / layout and add Vera devices and scenes to them from the list it already imported.
Doing it that way I haven't needed to manually code anything for device Status feedback it just happens.
Have a look at my HR thread on the Vera forum, I covered the basic concept of using Group pages in HR.
Creating your own custom pages looks much more involved like what @Tarkus has done and his project looks amazing but beyond my skills I think.
This is how my dashboard looks
Thanks, guys, this has me excited to try something with HR (or, later MSR's own Dashboard) which completely sidesteps Vera. Namely, creating "virtual devices" that live entirely on MSR (probably as Expressions at first, but conceivably as fully-blown Rules standing in place of virtual devices).
I'd love to have a Group page in Home Remote, where each square represents a corresponding entity on MSR. As @cw-kid proposes above, the back-and-forth could be wired up entirely via HTTP requests.
(My next question was going to be, "Does anyone have HR running in a Docker container?" I recall it runs on various platforms.)
Home Remote the designer application is Windows only. This is the application used to create your project.
The front end dashboard apps are Android, iOS and Windows.
Once you have created your project file you can publish it. I publish my project file to my internal ftp server then every mobile device phones and tablets look at that location for any new project file updates.
So the mobile apps just auto update to the latest version of my project when the app is launched on that device.
So no more running round to each mobile device to update it like with Imperihome.
No need for Docker.
@librasun said in Home Remote dashboard app and MSR HTTP API:
Namely, creating "virtual devices" that live entirely on MSR (probably as Expressions at first, but conceivably as fully-blown Rules standing in place of virtual devices).
Your the expressions expert, I wouldn't know where to start!
But virtual devices on MSR could be a good idea.
@librasun here is a demo I put together on Home Remote utilizing my personal project. I also use MSR for a majority of the conditional logic. The demo runs about 9 minutes.
Awesome, will check it out! Meanwhile, here's @toggledbits ' official stance on "Virtual Devices on MSR".

The Dark Grey Block is one of the variations of the Dark Colored Blocks.Haven‚Äôt gotten the Christmas choral music fix by way of WCN the past couple (few?) years now, which I sorta missed, but not enough to make a point to find any. Then somehow I heard that All is Calm would be in the Bay Area. This work tells the amazing story of the Christmas truce of 1914 through song and the words of the soldiers. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the event.
The venue was the First Congregational Church in Berkeley, which I‚Äôd never been to before, but seemed a very fitting location. Although I‚Äôm not religious, many of the songs are obviously celebrating the Christian holiday, but beyond that, the subject of ordinary people being able to see past the labels of enemy and step outside war is appropriate for a space of worship and reverence. I was last-minute in getting a ticket, so the only seats available were in the balcony, but it‚Äôs not overly huge, so they were still quite good as far as hearing and seeing the show. The seats are pews, but upholstered, so they were comfortable as well.
The singing was by Cantus, a nine-man vocal ensemble, with three actors from Theatre Latt√© Da voicing the words from letters, journals and other documents of the day. Cantus came out first, and did a selection of carols as a prelude. They exited, then returned to the stage, this time on the riser, joined by the three actors on stools on the stage level for All is Calm. (Which I keep wanting to write as All is Quiet, I suppose from All Quiet on the Western Front, which I think I did encounter at some point in my education. Like the creator of All is Calm, I don‚Äôt recall hearing about the Christmas Truce.) The piece commenced with enlistment, progressed into war, the truce, and then the resumption of hostilities, holding the audience spellbound for the duration.
The power of unaccompanied voice never ceases to amaze me, the arrangements were really wonderful and well done. O Tannenbaum, and then Silent Night at the start of the truce gave me the goosebumps. The singing was beautiful, and evoked the scene of frozen trenches, lonely men far from home. German lyrics to the familiar songs. Mind putting in the English words I grew up with, as many of the troops would have been, yet knowing that German was the original, what I would be singing had an ancestor of mine made a different choice. Those twists of fate, instead of being neighbors you are shooting at each other.
For a day they were able to see that. The common humanity. They came out of the trenches and sang and celebrated together. One can‚Äôt help but wonder, if they could stop war for a day, why can‚Äôt we stop it forever?Meconomica

The pandemic has already made tan- gible changes in cashless behaviours, as evidenced by retailers and payments pro- viders increasing the contactless limit on April 1 to ¬£45. The last contactless limit increase to ¬£30 took two years to imple- ment, but this rise was rolled out in a mat- ter of weeks. For consumers, the value proposition of a cashless UK is clear: convenience. "Car- rying cash is just no longer convenient," says Laura McCracken, global executive vice president at Wirecard. "In the near future, f lexibility around payment along the customer experience will explode." McCracken sees a future in which tech- nology will emerge that lets customers pay in the changing room or automati- cally as they leave the shop. "Integration of ecommerce and physical retail spaces will make payments a frictionless and even invisible part of the shopping expe- rience," she says. Some of the loudest champions of cash- less societies are cryptocurrency play- ers. Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum and chief executive of block- chain giant IOHK, hopes COVID-19 will result in a permanent move towards a cashless society. "The pandemic and associated lock- down will drive a revival of interest in the decentralisation and democratisation of financial transactions through 'chal- lenger banks' and technologies such as big data and blockchain," says Hoskinson. Kickstarting the cashless revolution The nationwide lockdown, which has sparked a surge in online shopping and cut cash machine usage by half, could accelerate the UK's shift towards a cashless society hen the UK government announced closure of non-essen- tial retailers on March 13, chef Ed McIlroy had to work out how to keep his business, a burger bar in a north London pub, going. Like many food outlets, Four Legs became a cashless, delivery-only business overnight. "I didn't want my delivery staff han- dling cash," says McIlroy. "It didn't feel safe." Instead, he implemented an ana- logue cashless payments system. Custom- ers who want delivery place their orders through a Google Form and then pay their bill via bank transfer. While rudimentary, the cashless system has enabled Four Legs to continue operating through the crisis. It has also shown McIlroy the potential for permanently shifting to a cashless model. "It's been a dream for us," he says. "Before this happened, we weren't in con - trol of the money coming in because we were using the pub's point of sale. It's never ideal for there to be a middleman between the customer and your money." Prior to the pandemic, the UK was ten- tatively edging towards becoming a cash- less society, with one in six millennials living a cashless life. While in lockdown, cash usage across the country has halved, according to LINK, the UK's largest ATM operator. A rise in online shopping and increased use of contactless payments, amid fears of the virus spreading via coins and banknotes, all contributed to the fall in cash transactions. It raises the question: will this step- change in both consumer and retailer behaviour be the tipping point that pushes the UK into becoming a cashless society? "The current crisis has accelerated the shift towards cashless payments among small community-based businesses," says Lu Zurawski, retail payments lead at payments systems company ACI Worldwide. "Once the crisis has passed, going cashless will not only become the norm for many small businesses, but also pave the way for the adoption of new, innovative payments services to capitalise on the shift away from cash." Oliver Balch Journalist specialising in sustainability, business and travel, and author of travelogues on South America, India and Wales. He sees digital payments as the only way of ensuring remote access to services that can withstand any disruption to tradi- tional banking systems. "The lockdown will continue the drive towards a 'new normal' based around the decentralisation, democ- ratisation and digitalisation of finance so people no longer depend on a financial mid- dleman for their services," he says. Proponents of cashless societies often look to Sweden as evidence of what's pos- sible. Sweden is one of the countries in which its citizens use the least amount of cash in the world. According to research from the Swedish Central Bank, only 1 per cent of Sweden's GDP was circulating in cash in 2018 compared to 4 per cent in the UK and 3 per cent in the Eurozone. While businesses and consumers alike herald Sweden's shift towards cash - less payments as a more secure and con- venient way to pay, it has also sparked a national debate about what happens to those who can't, or don't want to, go mobile. The same questions are now being raised here in the UK. "It is now more important than ever to ensure no one is left behind," says Jeni Mundy, UK and Ireland managing direc- tor at Visa. There are currently 1.5 million unbanked citizens in the UK, who by defi- nition are completely dependent on cash. But Hoskinson believes the worry is overplayed as groups such as the elderly and unbanked can also see the benefits of a cashless society. "New fintech innova- tions such as app-based challenger banks and blockchain technologies can give peo- ple far greater ownership over their own identities and assets without depending on large financial institutions," he says. "The poor performance of many large institutions during the current pandemic is creating a consumer culture more con- ducive to decentralisation." Other experts say the gains in contact- less payments technologies should not come at the exclusion of improving access to cash for those who continue to need it. Earlier this year, Visa launched a scheme with its partner banks to incentivise retailers to offer cashback to consumers using their Visa debit cards in areas where access to cash is limited. "For some, cash remains the only option and as availabil - ity of cash reduces, we need to find ways to avoid excluding these individuals from the financial system," says Visa's Mundy. McIlory sees this in his own business, which pre-COVID-19 operated out of a pub, where he says he wouldn't have made the call to go entirely cashless because a per- centage of his customers still expect to be able to pay with cash. But now the situation looks different. "The plan was to grow into our own premises," he says. "If that still happens, then we'll also go cashless."

No, just that sRGB is approximated with RGB primaries and a 2.2 gamma curve vs. the official ICC profile, or using the CalRGB/CalGray colorspace. Similarly, AdobeRGB can be approximated using its primaries and the 2.2 gamma curve vs. the official ICC profile.

Like the Vanderbeekers, the Glaser live in Harlem, in a two-bedroom co-op where most families know each other. Much like the Vanderbeekers, the Glaser‚Äôs have a lot of pets, five to be exact: Addie, Annabelle, and Nala are rescue cats. Ginger Pye is a rescue dog and Lalo is a 7 month old Corgi.
Cats and dogs complete the home Ms. Glaser, 41, shares with her husband, Dan Glaser, 49, a Salesforce Cloud Sales Architect, and their daughters, Kaela, 13, and Lina, 11. Ms. Glaser‚Äôs fifth book in the popular young adult series, ‚ÄúThe Vanderbeekers Make a Wish,‚Äù was published this fall.
UP WITH BABIES FUR I get up around 6:30 a.m. If I had a choice, I would sleep later, but since we have animals to feed and walk, I get up. Some also need medication. Since Ginger Pye is 13 years old, and she has frequent urinary tract infections, she needs an antibiotic. And Nala needs eye drops. This is one of the reasons it has been in the system for years and not passed that long. But I‚Äôm glad no one got it. When people meet her they think she looks very old, I guess because she is sort of shaggy and unkempt. Maybe other cats are better at grooming themselves, I don‚Äôt know. But she is just adorable and she acts very young.
CHIEF LIBRARY If the weather is nice, Dan and I will take the dogs for a walk. We‚Äôre right by the Harlem River, and there‚Äôs this little path over there. Then after trying to wake my kids up, I walk through the apartment doing things that I haven‚Äôt had a chance to do during the week, like sifting through the boxes of books sent to me by the publishers. . As part of my job, I review children‚Äôs books. If there are any books that I have already read or do not need, I will bring them to the free library in front of our building. I started it seven years ago, and it‚Äôs great. A lot of people are now putting it in their own books. Sometimes there is garbage in there. I‚Äôll go downstairs and clean it up.
GREEN LEAVES My husband doesn‚Äôt do a lot of cooking, but he makes really good pancakes. While he is cooking, I will water the plants. During Covid, I acquired quite a few houseplants, like double the amount we had. We have about 60 now. Our super drilled a bunch of hooks in the ceiling so a lot of them are hanging.
DIGITAL WORSHIP We go to church on a small laptop because we don‚Äôt have a TV and during the pandemic our church, All Angels‚Äô Church on the Upper West Side, got online. Girls can go in and out or read while on duty, but I don‚Äôt blame them. It can be difficult to focus on a digital platform.
DUMPLINGS On Sundays, I like to cook something a little harder to do on weekdays, which takes a little longer. I could bake bread, or the kids could help me bake dumplings. We buy 150 Won ton packs in Chinatown, usually four or five at a time, then I‚Äôll make the ground pork, tofu and garlic filling and different spices and they‚Äôll pack them.
OVERVIEW My oldest daughter plays the violin in the New York Youth Symphony. They rehearse on Sunday afternoon a little east of Penn Station. We take the metro there. I‚Äôll walk and think while she rehearses. She‚Äôs funny because she doesn‚Äôt like to be seen as I drop her off or pick her up, so I will surreptitiously walk by the entrance at pickup time.
QUILTED CLOTHES We have dinner together at home. If we made dumplings that day, we will have dumplings. And we will have to walk again and feed the animals. After that, I prepare for the week ahead and do my favorite leisure activity, which is hand quilting. At the moment I am working on a quilt which is a pattern of flying geese. It is made of scrap metal that I have been collecting for years. Until the girls were 3 or 4, I made all of their clothes. This quilt takes all of those pieces that they wore or recognized, so that makes it fun. I will do this by sitting on the couch and talking to Dan.
BODY I‚Äôm not a super digital person. I feel like a person who enjoys tangible things like physical books, cooking, gardening, and quilting. With my daughters, I‚Äôm really happy that they are both avid readers who also grew up with a lot of books around them. They also like physical books. They go to bed around the same time as I do, 10:30 a.m., but I think both are night owls. They like to keep reading.

Yet this ended up as a decent test of Manchester City‚Äôs staying power, as Arteta‚Äôs Arsenal made them sweat for an 18th straight win.
City remain 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League, thanks to a headed opener from Raheem Sterling inside 90 seconds.
And mid-table Arsenal have just one win in six as Arteta struggles to convince as the main man, having left his position as Guardiola‚Äôs Etihad No 2 last season.
But this was a day to appreciate the outstanding central-defensive duo of Ruben Dias and John Stones, as well as the midfield tenacity of veteran Fernandinho, rather than to purr at another dominant attacking display from the champions-elect.
Having skewered Everton and Tottenham in the previous eight days, City had to dig this one out - dominating for 30 minutes, then being drawn into an even contest for the final hour.
Guardiola‚Äôs men head to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday, in pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple, after this reminder that they will not be able to swagger away with each and every match.
City had achieved their previous eight victories without their best player, De Bruyne - the Belgian returning from a hamstring injury as a late sub after Wednesday‚Äôs win at Everton had been sewn up.
De Bruyne had already been involved in a saucy exchange of passes with Bernardo Silva, and Sterling had taken an air-shot at a decent chance, before City took the lead inside 90 seconds.
Reuben Dias played a delicious long diagonal pass for Riyad Mahrez, who teased Kieran Tierney and crossed left-footed from the right, Sterling peeling away from Rob Holding and heading inside the far corner.

Sterling had a third scoring opportunity within five minutes when he was released by De Bruyne, only to stumble and allow Bernd Leno to collect.
City continued to move it with speed and conviction, the echoes of their thumping passes pulsing like a drumbeat around an empty Emirates.
Arsenal, who had started off wondering whether they could nick a result against City, had been reduced to imagining getting the ball off them.

Dias, the best player on the pitch to human eyes, was being constantly berated by Guardiola - presumably demanding something that the Portuguese did something from another dimension.
Yet around the half-hour mark, Arsenal decided to join in and this became a genuine contest - Dias and John Stones, who had been Beckenbauering around, were suddenly asked to do some defending.
Kieran Tierney even asked a save from Ederson, Nicolas Pepe drilled into the side-netting.
After the break, City were back in their stride - De Bruyne almost finding the top corner with the sort of feathered chip Tiger Woods might attempt by a glassy putting green.
Ilkay Gundogan, the goal-scoring form horse who had missed the Everton win, tested Leno with a curling shot and De Bruyne volleyed over from long range.
De Bruyne, who had not been totally up to speed as a false nine, was replaced by Gabriel Jesus on 63 minutes.
There was a bizarre moment of over-confidence when City keeper Ederson sliced a wild volleyed clearance to Mohamed Elneny, who thumped wide.
Sensing the chance to seize a point, Arteta sent on Alex Lacazette and Emile Smith-Rowe.
But Joao Cancelo almost added City‚Äôs second, the free-wheeling full-back recovering from a clobbering challenge by Holding, to collect a pass from Jesus, cut inside and dink narrowly wide of the far post.

NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - New Orleans police are searching for a woman who allegedly stole a $100,000 watch from her victim's hotel room early in the morning on June 21.
The victim met the woman in the 400 block of Bourbon St. around 2 a.m. They returned to his hotel in the 1200 block of Poydras St.
Police said that is when the perpetrator took the watch.
The unknown female identified herself to the victim as "Kristen." She is described as having a tattoo on her right shoulder and a tattoo on her left thigh with the word "money."
Anyone with any information on the below-pictured suspect or property should contact any Eighth District Investigative Unit (DIU) at 504-658-6080 or 504-658-6723. Citizens with information that can help solve a crime are asked to call Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111 or toll-free 1-877-903-STOP.It is easy to love those just like us. I get along with people who look like me, think like me, have the same interests and beliefs as me. It‚Äôs easy to love people who love me back. I can help a friend up because I know when I fall, she‚Äôll do the same. It‚Äôs easy to sit with a friend during her pain and suffering, because I know she‚Äôd do the same for me.
You know when it‚Äôs hard to love?
When people don‚Äôt love you back.
Or even worse, when people reject your love and push you away.
When people hate you or aren‚Äôt like you, and take from you, and oppose you.
The hardest place to love is on enemy territory.
Remember just a few verses before in the Sermon on the Mount, we‚Äôre getting slapped in the face and our coats stolen, and Jesus tells us turn the other cheek and give up your stuff willingly? Now he‚Äôs telling us not only to walk the extra mile, but also to do it in love.
Lean into that for moment.
You‚Äôve been slapped in the face, robbed, and forced to walk a mile with that person. Jesus doesn‚Äôt say at the end of this, good you‚Äôve done the right thing you can now return. He takes it to the next level and says: ‚ÄúNow, love them.‚Äù
There was a season of such difficulty in one of my relationships; I just didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I felt so broken, and at times so hardened, over how to make it right and had no answers. I sought the LORD, and His response was simple: ‚ÄúLove her‚Äù. I thought, ‚ÄúI do! I am loving her!‚Äù Again, He whispers to my heart ‚ÄúLove her‚Äù.
I realized God‚Äôs definition of love, and my definition of love was
My definition of love is conditional. God‚Äôs definition of love is unconditional.
Love is long suffering, and it doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúlove‚Äù those that love you back. It loves those that have slapped you in the face and stolen from you. It loves those that have hurt you, gossiped about you, utter false things about you, broken trust, even declared you an enemy. Love, even looks it‚Äôs betrayer in the eyes, bends down, and washes his feet.
I don‚Äôt love like that. Apart from Christ and His kind of love, I will never love my enemies. At best, I barely love the lovable. It is only through the perfect love of God, that I can attempt to love my enemies. That is an other worldly kind of love.

you see a space with life-size photographs of her living room projected on each wall.
If you walked into the room, you would find yourself
inside Gertrude Stein‚Äôs living room.

I was living in Paris when I first read Stein‚Äôs The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.
I walked to her apartment building on 27 Rue de Fleurus.
Stood in front of it.
Read the commemorative plaque.
Her living room is long gone, now just a photographic shadow.
What do I gain by seeing the room itself?
Or any author‚Äôs room, for that matter. Does it change how we read their work?
I think about whose home I would like to visit, real or fictional.
Homer‚Äôs study? Plato‚Äôs bedroom? Madame Bovary‚Äôs kitchen?
I once went to the beach in Dollarton (outside Vancouver, B.C.) where Malcolm Lowry lived in a squatter‚Äôs shack during the 1940s and wrote some of his finest work, including Under the Volcano. The shack is long gone and the place is now a public park with boat ramps and bicycle paths, but you can still see the Shell oil refinery on the opposite shore of the inlet that at night became his own vision of hell (the ‚Äús‚Äù was missing from the neon sign). It felt like I was connecting with his spirit even though I don‚Äôt believe in such things. The truth is, it was his words, those slivers of his imagination, that I had connected with. Still, I picked up a rock from the beach and keep it as a talisman.
Nice entry, and thanks for following my blog.
I agree with you, it‚Äôs probably the words (the ‚Äòslivers of imagination‚Äô as you so beautifully put it) that we are searching a connection with. I love your writing style and am enjoying reading your posts.
oh, and I would have taken the rock too üôÇ
Thank you for following my blog.
You‚Äôre welcome üôÇ I like your writing style, very engaging!
I visited Maison de Hugo in Paris and felt awed standing at the desk where he wrote. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to anyone who doesn‚Äôt write, but I seek out author‚Äôs homes and writing spaces hoping that I‚Äôll see things through their eyes for a moment and be inspired by being in the same atmosphere that they were.
I did feel very inspired in Hemingway‚Äôs House in Key West. But not as much when I went over to his writing studio/office. The house was so much more inviting to me.
That‚Äôs so interesting that you felt something powerful at Hugo‚Äôs desk but not at Hemingway‚Äôs desk. Maybe it‚Äôs something about the writing itself or what we know of the author? (I find it easier to imagine Hemingway in his living room than in his office for some odd reason). Hmmm, not sure!
Great post!

The UK‚Äôs monetary regulator, the Monetary Behavior Authority (FCA) has warned customers in opposition to 111 crypto firms which can be but to sign up with the FCA.
Since Jan. 10, all U.Ok.-based crypto companies have needed to conform to Anti-Cash Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing rules, in addition to to sign up with the FCA as a way to perform legally. Many are but to take action.
Mark Steward, FCA‚Äôs head of enforcement asserted on the ‚ÄúTown & Monetary‚Äôs Town Week‚Äù tournament on June 22, that the unregulated crypto entities pose a risk to customers, banks, and bills companies who do trade with them, noting that:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got quite a few companies which can be obviously doing trade in the United Kingdom with out being registered with us and they‚Äôre coping with any person: banks, cost products and services company, customers. This can be a very actual chance so we‚Äôre frightened about that.‚Äù
The FCA has compiled an inventory of greater than 100 crypto companies that seem to be running unregistered, in order that buyers can double take a look at if a company the intend to maintain is non-compliant.

In line with the FCA‚Äôs personal fresh survey 2.3 million UK adults now hang crypto. On the other hand, there was a notable downward pattern in buyers‚Äô general working out of the crypto property they personal.
Steward likened the expansion of crypto business to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s, noting that worry of lacking out (FOMO) is riding many to take a position on extremely unstable property:
‚ÄúThe explanation many are making an investment now could be as a result of they‚Äôve a terror of lacking out on what may well be a growth. Leaving apart how unstable those tools in fact are, it has tulip mania written in all places it.‚Äù
The operational hurdles from the U.Ok.‚Äôs stringent anti-money laundering rules could also be eliminating a large number of those unregistered companies, with Cointelegraph reporting on June 4 that thus far 51 crypto companies have withdrawn their registration packages to the FCA.
The U.Ok. executive is actively looking to curb felony habits the makes use of crypto corresponding to cash laundering and terrorism financing.
In line with The Occasions UK, previous this month the London Metro Police known as for legislative adjustments that may allow government to manner crypto similarly to cash-based crime.

The FCA used to be appointed the manager of Anti-Cash Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing measures on Jan. 10, 2021, and from that date, all U.Ok.-based crypto-asset companies have needed to conform to AML laws and sign up with FCA.

We have heard sad stories of star crossed lovers who never ended up together, and somehow that has warped our sense of true love. We have come to believe that there are things true love cannot withstand, but here is the truth: If two years are meant to be together, they will. There are, of course, factors that arise against true love, but there is an assurance of those factors being overcome. It takes a lot of sacrifice on the part of the two persons involved, but it is worth it. When it comes to true love, distance only serves to make the heart grow fonder. Time and distance are inconsequential when it comes to two hearts that are meant to be together.
Life happens, and sometimes we get discouraged from fighting for what we want. People move, get new jobs, extreme circumstances can even cause two persons who are meant to be to be on opposite sides of the world. There are no limits to true love, and the earlier we understand this, the easier it becomes for us to know if what we have is true love or not.
Distance and sacrifices
Some people who are meant to be together will not have to struggle for their love. They meet each other, fall in love, and remain together till death. Not so for everyone, some persons will have to struggle for their love. They will have to fight to be together. They might have to fight against society, culture, tradition, race, family, beliefs, class, and sometimes even themselves. When this kind of situation arises, the power of true love comes to play. In such cases, all the couple has is their love, and when they remain true to that love, it will always excel. Take, for example, a couple who come from different backgrounds. Everything about them is different: country, culture, beliefs, e.t.c. They meet and fall in love because their hearts are meant for each other. Perhaps, they meet in school, and now it is time to return home. There is a high possibility that both of them will face challenges from their families. There are several cases where parents pay off their child‚Äôs partner to stay away. Some families will go as far as threatening the person or attacking them. They will forbid them from seeing each other‚Äîunfortunately, too cant stand in the way of true love. Even if they end up with different people, their hearts will pine for each other. They will never be happy until they are together. Life has a way of bringing two hearts that aren‚Äôt to be together. No matter how many forces are against them, they always find their way to each other. We should also try to lay aside our beliefs and mindsets and allow love to thrive. We should not try and come between true love, regardless of our personal opinions. Everyone desires to be loved, so why should you come in between others.

While some hosts will certainly have the ability to offer far better performance as well as high degrees of security. Best Web App Hosting Service
Listed below we dive deep into the best low-cost web hosting plans out there. You‚Äôll learn what core organizing features are crucial in a host and also just how to evaluate your own holding requirements so that you can pick from one of the most effective inexpensive hosting carriers listed below.
Disclosure: When you buy a webhosting bundle through web links on this web page, we make some compensation. This helps us to maintain this website running. There are no added costs to you in all by using our web links. The listed here is of the very best affordable web hosting plans that I have actually personally used and evaluated.
What We Consider To Be Affordable Webhosting
When we define a host bundle as being ‚ÄúCheap‚Äù or ‚ÄúBudget plan‚Äù what we indicate is hosting that falls under the cost brace between $0.80 to $4 monthly. Whilst investigating inexpensive organizing suppliers for this overview, we considered over 100 various hosts that came under that cost array. We then evaluated the high quality of their least expensive holding package, value for cash and customer service.
In this article, I‚Äôll be going over this first-rate site organizing firm and also stick in as much pertinent information as possible.
I‚Äôll review the attributes, the rates options, and anything else I can consider that I believe could be of advantage, if you‚Äôre determining to sign up to Bluhost and get your web sites up and running.
So without further trouble, let‚Äôs check it out.
Bluehost Evaluation
Bluehost is just one of the biggest webhosting companies worldwide, obtaining both substantial marketing support from the business itself and associate marketing experts who promote it.
It truly is a substantial firm, that has been around for a very long time, has a large track record, as well as is certainly one of the top options when it comes to webhosting (certainly within the leading 3, at the very least in my publication).
Yet what is it precisely, as well as should you obtain its services?
Learn More About Best Web App Hosting Service Here ->
Today, I will answer all there is you need to understand, provided that you are a blog writer or a business owner who is trying to find a web host, and also doesn‚Äôt know where to get going, considering that it‚Äôs a great option for that target market in general.
Allow‚Äôs visualize, you wish to host your websites and also make them noticeable. Okay?
You already have your domain name (which is your site destination or URL) now you intend to ‚Äúturn the lights on‚Äù. Best Web App Hosting Service
You need some organizing‚Ä¶
To achieve all of this, and to make your website noticeable, you need what is called a ‚Äúserver‚Äù. A web server is a black box, or tool, that keeps all your web site data (documents such as images, texts, videos, web links, plugins, and also various other details).
Currently, this server, needs to be on all the time and also it has to be linked to the net 100% of the moment (I‚Äôll be stating something called ‚Äúdowntime‚Äù in the future).
In addition, it also requires (without obtaining too fancy and right into information) a file transfer protocol commonly known as FTP, so it can show web internet browsers your internet site in its designated form.
All these things are either expensive, or require a high degree of technological skill (or both), to produce and also preserve. And you can completely head out there and learn these points by yourself as well as set them up ‚Ä¶ however what concerning instead of you buying and also maintaining one ‚Ä¶ why not simply ‚Äúleasing holding‚Äù rather?
This is where Bluehost is available in. You rent their servers (called Shared Hosting) and you introduce a web site making use of those servers.
Considering that Bluehost keeps all your data, the business additionally permits you to establish your web content administration systems (CMS, for brief) such as WordPress for you. WordPress is an extremely preferred CMS ‚Ä¶ so it simply makes good sense to have that alternative available (virtually every hosting company currently has this alternative as well).
Simply put, you no more need to set-up a web server and afterwards integrate a software application where you can develop your content, individually. It is currently rolled right into one bundle.
Is it safe to have Bluehost deal with your web sites?
Well ‚Ä¶ visualize if your server is in your residence. If anything were to happen to it at all, all your data are gone. If something goes wrong with its interior procedures, you need a specialist to repair it. If something overheats, or breaks down or obtains corrupted ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs no good!
Bluehost takes all these hassles away, and also looks after every little thing technological: Pay your server ‚Äúrent‚Äù, and they will certainly care for everything. And also as soon as you buy the solution, you can then start focusing on adding web content to your site, or you can place your initiative right into your marketing projects.
What Services Do You Get From Bluehost?
Bluehost offers a myriad of various services, but the primary one is hosting naturally.
The holding itself, is of various kinds incidentally. You can rent a common server, have a specialized server, or likewise a digitalexclusive server.
For the objective of this Bluehost evaluation, we will focus on hosting solutions and also various other solutions, that a blogger or an online business owner would certainly need, as opposed to go unfathomable right into the bunny opening and also speak about the various other services, that are targeted at even more knowledgeable folks.
- WordPress, WordPress PRO, and also ecommerce‚Äî these holding solutions are the bundles that enable you to organize a web site using WordPress and WooCommerce (the latter of which permits you to do ecommerce). After acquiring any of these plans, you can begin constructing your site with WordPress as your CMS.
- Domain Marketplace‚Äî you can additionally buy your domain name from Bluehost as opposed to various other domain name registrars. Doing so will certainly make it simpler to point your domain to your host‚Äôs name web servers, given that you‚Äôre using the same marketplace.
- Email‚Äî when you have actually acquired your domain, it makes good sense to additionally get an e-mail address linked to it. As a blog writer or on-line entrepreneur, you must practically never utilize a free email service, like Yahoo! or Gmail. An email similar to this makes you look amateur. Luckily, Bluehost provides you one totally free with your domain.

Bluehost likewise supplies committed web servers.
And you may be asking ‚Ä¶‚Äù What is a dedicated server anyway?‚Äù.
Well, the thing is, the fundamental webhosting bundles of Bluehost can only so much web traffic for your internet site, after which you‚Äôll require to update your organizing. The reason being is that the usual web servers, are shared.
What this indicates is that one web server can be servicing 2 or even more sites, at the same time, one of which can be yours.
What does this mean for you?
It means that the single server‚Äôs sources are shared, and also it is doing numerous jobs at any type of offered time. When your website begins to hit 100,000 site visits monthly, you are mosting likely to need a dedicated server which you can also receive from Bluehost for a minimum of $79.99 each month.
This is not something yous must bother with when you‚Äôre beginning however you need to keep it in mind for certain.
Bluehost Prices: Just How Much Does It Price?
In this Bluehost review, I‚Äôll be focusing my focus primarily on the Bluehost WordPress Hosting plans, because it‚Äôs one of the most popular one, and very likely the one that you‚Äôre trying to find and that will certainly suit you the very best (unless you‚Äôre a big brand name, company or site).
The three readily available strategies, are as complies with:
- Basic Strategy‚Äì $2.95 each month/ $7.99 regular price
- Plus Plan‚Äì $5.45 per month/ $10.99 regular rate
- Selection And Also Plan‚Äì $5.45 per month/ $14.99 normal cost
The initial price you see is the cost you pay upon subscribe, and the second cost is what the expense is, after the very first year of being with the business.
So basically, Bluehost is going to bill you on a yearly basis. And also you can additionally choose the amount of years you wish to organize your site on them with. Best Web App Hosting Service
If you pick the Fundamental strategy, you will certainly pay $2.95 x 12 = $35.40 beginning today and also by the time you enter your 13th month, you will currently pay $7.99 per month, which is likewise charged per year. If that makes any feeling.
If you are serious about your web not much, but it‚Äôs still something.
If you wish to get more than one web site (which I highly advise, and also if you‚Äôre major, you‚Äôll possibly be getting more at some point in time) you‚Äôll intend to utilize the option plus plan. It‚Äôll allow you to host endless internet sites.

What Does Each Strategy Deal?
So, in the case of WordPress organizing strategies (which are similar to the shared organizing strategies, however are more tailored in the direction of WordPress, which is what we‚Äôll be focusing on) the features are as complies with:
For the Standard strategy, you obtain:
- One web site just
- Guaranteed internet site using SSL certificate
- Maximum of 50GB of storage
- Free domain name for a year
- $ 200 marketing credit
Bear in mind that the domain names are purchased individually from the hosting. You can get a free domain with Bluehost right here.
For both the Bluehost Plus hosting as well as Choice Plus, you get the following:
- Unlimited number of web sites
- Free SSL Certification. Best Web App Hosting Service
- No storage space or transmission capacity limit
- Totally free domain for one year
- $ 200 advertising credit score
- 1 Workplace 365 Mailbox that is free for 30 days
The Choice Plus strategy has actually an added advantage of Code Guard Basic Alternative, a back-up system where your documents is conserved and replicated. If any type of crash takes place and also your web site data goes away, you can recover it to its original kind with this attribute.
Notice that even though both plans cost the same, the Choice Plan then defaults to $14.99 per month, routine rate, after the set quantity of years you have actually selected.
What Are The Advantages Of Using Bluehost
So, why choose Bluehost over various other web hosting services? There are thousands of webhosting, many of which are resellers, but Bluehost is one pick couple of that have stood the test of time, and it‚Äôs probably the most popular out there (and forever factors).
Right here are the 3 primary advantages of picking Bluehost as your host provider:
- Server uptime‚Äî your site will not show up if your host is down; Bluehost has greater than 99% uptime. This is exceptionally vital when it concerns Google SEO and positions. The greater the much better.
- Bluehost rate‚Äî how your server feedback figures out just how quick your internet site reveals on a web browser; Bluehost is lighting quickly, which suggests you will certainly lower your bounce price. Albeit not the most effective when it comes to loading speed it‚Äôs still hugely essential to have a quick rate, to make user experience better and far better your ranking.
- Limitless storage‚Äî if you obtain the Plus strategy, you need not worry about the number of data you save such as video clips‚Äì your storage capacity is endless. This is truly important, since you‚Äôll probably encounter some storage concerns later down the tracks, as well as you do not want this to be a headache ‚Ä¶ ever before.
Last but not least, client support is 24/7, which indicates regardless of where you are in the world, you can speak to the assistance team to repair your web site problems. Pretty common nowadays, but we‚Äôre taking this for provided ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs also very crucial. Best Web App Hosting Service
Likewise, if you have actually gotten a cost-free domain with them, after that there will be a $15.99 cost that will certainly be subtracted from the amount you initially bought (I picture this is since it kind of takes the ‚Äúdomain name out of the market‚Äù, not sure about this, however there probably is a hard-cost for registering it).
Lastly, any type of requests after thirty day for a refund ‚Ä¶ are void (although in all sincerity ‚Ä¶ they should possibly be rigorous right here).
So as you see, this isn‚Äôt always a ‚Äúno questions asked‚Äù plan, like with some of the other holding choices around, so make certain you‚Äôre okay with the policies prior to proceeding with the organizing.READ/DOWNLOAD& The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism FULL BOOK PDF & FULL AUDIOBOOK

Objective: Uterine carcinosarcoma (CS) is an aggressive malignancy and the optimal adjuvant treatment is not well-established. We report outcomes with vaginal brachytherapy (VB) for women with early-stage CS. Methods and Materials: A multi-institutional retrospective study of Stage I-II CS treated with hysterectomy, surgical staging, and adjuvant high-dose-rate VB without external-beam pelvic radiotherapy was performed. Rates of vaginal control, pelvic control, locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: 33 patients were identified. Prescribed VB dose was 21Gy in three fractions (n= 15 [45%]) or 24Gy in six fractions (n= 18 [55%]). Eighteen patients (55%) received chemotherapy. Median followup was 2.0years. Twenty-seven patients (82%) underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy, 5 (15%) had nodal sampling, and 1 (3%) had no lymph node assessment. Relapse occurred in 11 patients (33%), all of whom had lymph node evaluation. Locoregional relapse was a component of failure in 6 patients (18%), of whom 3 (9%) failed in the pelvis alone. Three patients (9%) had simultaneous distant and locoregional relapse (two vaginal, one pelvic). Five additional patients (15%) had distant relapse. Six of the 11 patients (55%) with disease recurrence received chemotherapy. Two-year vaginal control and pelvic control were 94% and 87%. Two-year locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 81%, 66%, and 79%. Conclusions: Despite having early-stage disease and treatment with VB, patients in this series had relatively high rates of local and distant relapse. Patients who undergo lymphadenectomy and VB remain at risk for relapse. Novel treatment strategies are needed.

Team 309 says
Tried two of the donuts at Blue Star: the orange glaze with pistachio & cocoa nibs and the hard apple cider fritter. They were surprisingly HUGE! Very sweet (of course, they are donuts), very big, fresh and overall pretty good. Much better than Voodoo, but I‚Äôm not sure if I like the Krispy Kreme more. It‚Äôs close, but I liked the fresh and made to order. I could probably eat about 1/2 of the donut though since they are so big. I would prefer a smaller donut (and slightly lower price) so I could have two different at a time. I‚Äôll go back when I‚Äôm in the mood for a donut, which is about twice a year.
Food Dude says
Thanks Team 309!

- A multinational pledge to ‚Äúkeep the grease in the ground.‚Äù
- A multinational pledge to transition out of the capitalist system.
- Basic guarantees of fundamental human need.
After explaining why these things ought to happen, Cassiodorus explains why they won‚Äôt:
‚ÄúAs long as the politicians are mere handmaidens of the 1% and their lovely capitalist system, things will get worse. Why, the folks are probably having a meeting in Doha this week for the mere purpose of insulating themselves from criticism ‚Äî so they can say ‚Äòlook! We had a meeting!‚Äô when an outraged global public finally realizes that planet Earth is transitioning to something along the lines of planet Venus. ‚Äú

‚ÄúLes espaces de la parent√© en mouvement. Parent√© transnationale et nouvelles migrations italiennes‚ÄùYou may know someone who has had a pin, screw or rod placed in a broken or otherwise damaged bone. Generally, these implants are necessary to hold bone pieces in place while healing occurs. In some cases, they can be removed, but in other cases, they become a permanent part of the patient‚Äôs body.
An interbody cage is a type of metal implant used during some spinal fusion surgeries. It stays in place after the healing process is complete, so it will be a permanent part of your body.
What Does an Interbody Cage Do?
During spinal fusion surgery, a bone graft is placed between two (or more) vertebrae. The end goal is for the bone graft to stimulate the patient‚Äôs own bone to grow and harden, fusing the two spine segments together. There are various methods of making sure that the graft stays in place, and an interbody cage is one of them. This device acts as a containment device to keep the bone graft where it‚Äôs supposed to be. It is shaped and designed to allow the graft to form bone around the cage, acting as a bridge of sorts between the two vertebrae. It also maintains the proper spacing between vertebrae.
Videos of Spinal Fusion
It can be difficult to picture what happens during spinal fusion. Spine-health.com has put together several excellent videos to help patients visualize what will happen during their spinal fusion procedures.
A procedure called Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion, or ALIF, takes place through an incision in the abdomen. You can watch a (non-graphic) video on this here. You‚Äôll see in the video how the cage fits neatly between the two affected vertebrae.
Another common procedure, the Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion, or PLIF, is done through an incision in the back. Here is the (also non-graphic) video for this surgery. This type of procedure can sometimes be done in a minimally invasive way; talk to your spine surgeon about whether this is an option for you.
Having spinal fusion surgery can be an overwhelming experience, but knowing what will happen will take away a lot of your fear and apprehension. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions about the procedure, how it will be performed, what your recuperation will look like, and so on. Your spine surgeon wants to help you, and time for answering your questions is built into your consultation appointment.
If you have been told that you need spinal fusion surgery or you think you might be a candidate, please give Dr. Kornel‚Äôs office a call at (914) 948-0444. We would be happy to schedule you an appointment for a consultation so you can learn more about interbody cages and spinal fusion.Where to Shoot: On Site in Ibiza, on the Best Rated Beach Photo Locations

Louise Gluck (Author)
Available
DescriptionLouise Gluck has long practised poetry as a species of clairvoyance. She began as Cassandra, at a distance, in league with the immortals. To read her books sequentially is to chart the oracle's metamorphoses into unwilling vessel, reckless, mortal, down-to-earth. "The Seven Ages" is Gluck's ninth book, one of her strangest and certainly her most bold. In it - like William Blake's mystical Thel - she gazes down at her own death and in so doing forces endless superimpositions of the possible on the impossible. Her act at once defies and embraces the inevitable and is finally mimetic. Over and over, at each wild leap and transformation, flames shoot up the reader's spine. In an essay she writes, "one of the revelations of art is the discovery of a tone or perspective at once wholly unexpected and wholly true to a set of materials". This truth to materials -language, occasion, antecedent - is the proof of a poem.

When writing templates, much of a developer's time is devoted to forms. Despite this, forms are generally poorly designed. Since much attention is required to deal with default values, formatting, validation, repopulation, and form handling in general, some developers tend to skim over some important details in the process. Accordingly, symfony devotes special attention to this topic. This chapter describes the tools that automate many of these requirements while speeding up forms development:
- The form helpers provide a faster way to write form inputs in templates, especially for complex elements such as dates, drop-down lists, and rich text.
- When a form is devoted to editing the properties of an object, the templating can be further accelerated by using object form helpers.
- The YAML validation files facilitate form validation and repopulation.
- Validators package the code required to validate input. Symfony bundles validators for the most common needs, and it is very easy to add custom validators.
Form Helpers
In templates, HTML tags of form elements are very often mixed with PHP code. Form helpers in symfony aim to simplify this task and to avoid opening
<?php echo tags repeatedly in the middle of
<input> tags.
Main Form Tag
As explained in the previous chapter, you must use the
form_tag() helper to create a form, since it transforms the action given as a parameter into a routed URL. The second argument can support additional options--for instance, to change the default
method, change the default
enctype, or specify other attributes. Listing 10-1 shows examples.
Listing 10-1 - The
form_tag() Helper
<?php echo form_tag('test/save') ?> => <form method="post" action="/path/to/save"> <?php echo form_tag('test/save', 'method=get multipart=true class=simpleForm') ?> => <form method="get" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="simpleForm"action="/path/to/save">
As there is no need for a closing form helper, you should use the HTML
</form> tag, even if it doesn't look good in your source code.
Standard Form Elements
With form helpers, each element in a form is given an id attribute deduced from its name attribute by default. This is not the only useful convention. See Listing 10-2 for a full list of standard form helpers and their options.
Listing 10-2 - Standard Form Helpers Syntax
// Text field (input) <?php echo input_tag('name', 'default value') ?> => <input type="text" name="name" id="name" value="default value" /> // All form helpers accept an additional options parameter // It allows you to add custom attributes to the generated tag <?php echo input_tag('name', 'default value', 'maxlength=20') ?> => <input type="text" name="name" id="name" value="default value" maxlength="20" /> // Long text field (text area) <?php echo textarea_tag('name', 'default content', 'size=10x20') ?> => <textarea name="name" id="name" cols="10" rows="20"> default content </textarea> // Check box <?php echo checkbox_tag('single', 1, true) ?> <?php echo checkbox_tag('driverslicense', 'B', false) ?> => <input type="checkbox" name="single" id="single" value="1" checked="checked" /> <input type="checkbox" name="driverslicense" id="driverslicense" value="B" /> // Radio button <?php echo radiobutton_tag('status[]', 'value1', true) ?> <?php echo radiobutton_tag('status[]', 'value2', false) ?> => <input type="radio" name="status[]" id="status_value1" value="value1" checked="checked" /> <input type="radio" name="status[]" id="status_value2" value="value2" /> // Dropdown list (select) <?php echo select_tag('payment', '<option selected="selected">Visa</option> <option>Eurocard</option> <option>Mastercard</option>') ?> => <select name="payment" id="payment"> <option selected="selected">Visa</option> <option>Eurocard</option> <option>Mastercard</option> </select> // List of options for a select tag <?php echo options_for_select(array('Visa', 'Eurocard', 'Mastercard'), 0) ?> => <option value="0" selected="selected">Visa</option> <option value="1">Eurocard</option> <option value="2">Mastercard</option> // Dropdown helper combined with a list of options <?php echo select_tag('payment', options_for_select(array( 'Visa', 'Eurocard', 'Mastercard' ), 0)) ?> => <select name="payment" id="payment"> <option value="0" selected="selected">Visa</option> <option value="1">Eurocard</option> <option value="2">Mastercard</option> </select> // To specify option names, use an associative array <?php echo select_tag('name', options_for_select(array( 'Steve' => 'Steve', 'Bob' => 'Bob', 'Albert' => 'Albert', 'Ian' => 'Ian', 'Buck' => 'Buck' ), 'Ian')) ?> => <select name="name" id="name"> <option value="Steve">Steve</option> <option value="Bob">Bob</option> <option value="Albert">Albert</option> <option value="Ian" selected="selected">Ian</option> <option value="Buck">Buck</option> </select> // Dropdown list with multiple selection (selected values can be an array) <?php echo select_tag('payment', options_for_select( array('Visa' => 'Visa', 'Eurocard' => 'Eurocard', 'Mastercard' => 'Mastercard'), array('Visa', 'Mastercard'), ), array('multiple' => true))) ?> => <select name="payment[]" id="payment" multiple="multiple"> <option value="Visa" selected="selected">Visa</option> <option value="Eurocard">Eurocard</option> <option value="Mastercard">Mastercard</option> </select> // Drop-down list with multiple selection (selected values can be an array) <?php echo select_tag('payment', options_for_select( array('Visa' => 'Visa', 'Eurocard' => 'Eurocard', 'Mastercard' => 'Mastercard'), array('Visa', 'Mastercard') ), 'multiple=multiple') ?> => <select name="payment[]" id="payment" multiple="multiple"> <option value="Visa" selected="selected">Visa</option> <option value="Eurocard">Eurocard</option> <option value="Mastercard" selected="selected">Mastercard</option> </select> // Upload file field <?php echo input_file_tag('name') ?> => <input type="file" name="name" id="name" value="" /> // Password field <?php echo input_password_tag('name', 'value') ?> => <input type="password" name="name" id="name" value="value" /> // Hidden field <?php echo input_hidden_tag('name', 'value') ?> => <input type="hidden" name="name" id="name" value="value" /> // Submit button (as text) <?php echo submit_tag('Save') ?> => <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Save" /> // Submit button (as image) <?php echo submit_image_tag('submit_img') ?> => <input type="image" name="submit" src="/legacy/images/submit_img.png" />
The
submit_image_tag() helper uses the same syntax and has the same advantages as the
image_tag().
note
For radio buttons, the
id attribute is not set by default to the value of the
name attribute, but to a combination of the name and the value. That's because you need to have several radio button tags with the same name to obtain the automated "deselecting the previous one when selecting another" feature, and the
id=name convention would imply having several HTML tags with the same
id attribute in your page, which is strictly forbidden.
Symfony offers specialized form helpers to do asynchronous requests in the background. The next chapter, which focuses on Ajax, provides more details.
Date Input Widgets
Forms are often used to retrieve dates. Dates in the wrong format are the main reason for form-submission failures. The
input_date_tag() helper can assist the user in entering a date with an interactive JavaScript calendar, if you set the
rich option to
true, as shown in Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1 - Rich date input tag
If the
rich option is omitted, the helper echoes three
<select> tags populated with a range of months, days, and years. You can display these drop-downs separately by calling their helpers (
select_day_tag(),
select_month_tag(), and
select_year_tag()). The default values of these elements are the current day, month, and year. Listing 10-3 shows the input date helpers.
Listing 10-3 - Input Date Helpers
<?php echo input_date_tag('dateofbirth', '2005-05-03', 'rich=true') ?> => a text input tag together with a calendar widget // The following helpers require the DateForm helper group <?php use_helper('DateForm') ?> <?php echo select_day_tag('day', 1, 'include_custom=Choose a day') ?> => <select name="day" id="day"> <option value="">Choose a day</option> <option value="1" selected="selected">01</option> <option value="2">02</option> ... <option value="31">31</option> </select> <?php echo select_month_tag('month', 1, 'include_custom=Choose a month use_short_month=true') ?> => <select name="month" id="month"> <option value="">Choose a month</option> <option value="1" selected="selected">Jan</option> <option value="2">Feb</option> ... <option value="12">Dec</option> </select> <?php echo select_year_tag('year', 2007, 'include_custom=Choose a year year_end=2010') ?> => <select name="year" id="year"> <option value="">Choose a year</option> <option value="2006">2006</option> <option value="2007" selected="selected">2007</option> ... </select>
The accepted date values for the
input_date_tag() helper are the ones recognized by the
strtotime() PHP function. Listing 10-4 shows which formats can be used, and Listing 10-5 shows the ones that must be avoided.
Listing 10-4 - Accepted Date Formats in Date Helpers
// Work fine <?php echo input_date_tag('test', '2006-04-01', 'rich=true') ?> <?php echo input_date_tag('test', 1143884373, 'rich=true') ?> <?php echo input_date_tag('test', 'now', 'rich=true') ?> <?php echo input_date_tag('test', '23 October 2005', 'rich=true') ?> <?php echo input_date_tag('test', 'next tuesday', 'rich=true') ?> <?php echo input_date_tag('test', '1 week 2 days 4 hours 2 seconds', 'rich=true') ?> // Return null <?php echo input_date_tag('test', null, 'rich=true') ?> <?php echo input_date_tag('test', '', 'rich=true') ?>
Listing 10-5 - Incorrect Date Formats in Date Helpers
// Date zero = 01/01/1970 <?php echo input_date_tag('test', 0, 'rich=true') ?> // Non-English date formats don't work <?php echo input_date_tag('test', '01/04/2006', 'rich=true') ?>
Rich Text Editing
Rich text editing is also possible in a
<textarea> tag, thanks to the integration of the TinyMCE and FCKEditor widgets. They provide a word-processor-like interface with buttons to format text as bold, italic, and other styles, as shown in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-2 - Rich text editing
Both widgets require manual installation. As the procedure is the same for the two widgets, only the TinyMCE rich text editing is described here. You need to download the editor from the project website () and unpack it in a temporary folder. Copy the
tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/ directory into your project
web/js/ directory, and define the path to the library in
settings.yml, as shown in Listing 10-6.
Listing 10-6 - Setting Up the TinyMCE Library Path
all: .settings: rich_text_js_dir: js/tiny_mce
Once this is done, toggle the use of rich text editing in text areas by adding the
rich=true option. You can also specify custom options for the JavaScript editor using the
tinymce_options option. Listing 10-7 shows examples.
Listing 10-7 - Rich Text Area
<?php echo textarea_tag('name', 'default content', 'rich=true size=10x20') ?> => a rich text edit zone powered by TinyMCE <?php echo textarea_tag('name', 'default content', 'rich=true size=10x20 tinymce_options=language:"fr",theme_advanced_buttons2:"separator"') ?> => a rich text edit zone powered by TinyMCE with custom parameters
Country and Language Selection
You may need to display a country selection field. But since country names are not the same in all languages, the options of a country drop-down list should vary according to the user culture (see Chapter 13 for more information about cultures). As shown in Listing 10-8, the
select_country_tag() helper does it all for you: It internationalizes country names and uses the standard ISO country codes for values.
Listing 10-8 - Select Country Tag Helper
<?php echo select_country_tag('country', 'AL') ?> => <select name="country" id="country"> <option value="AF">Afghanistan</option> <option value="AL" selected="selected">Albania</option> <option value="DZ">Algeria</option> <option value="AS">American Samoa</option> ...
Similar to
select_country_tag() helper, the
select_language_tag() helper displays a list of languages, as shown in Listing 10-9.
Listing 10-9 - Select Language Tag Helper
<?php echo select_language_tag('language', 'en') ?> => <select name="language" id="language"> ... <option value="elx">Elamite</option> <option value="en" selected="selected">English</option> <option value="enm">English, Middle (1100-1500)</option> <option value="ang">English, Old (ca.450-1100)</option> <option value="myv">Erzya</option> <option value="eo">Esperanto</option> ...
Form Helpers for Objects
When form elements are used to edit the properties of an object, standard link helpers can become tedious to write. For instance, to edit the
telephone attribute of a
Customer object, you would write this:
<?php echo input_tag('telephone', $customer->getTelephone()) ?> => <input type="text" name="telephone" id="telephone" value="0123456789" />
To avoid repeating the attribute name, symfony provides an alternative object form helper for each form helper. An object form helper deduces the name and the default value of a form element from an object and a method name. The previous
input_tag() is equivalent to this:
<?php echo object_input_tag($customer, 'getTelephone') ?> => <input type="text" name="telephone" id="telephone" value="0123456789" />
The economy might not look crucial for the
object_input_tag(). However, every standard form helper has a corresponding object form helper, and they all share the same syntax. It makes generation of forms quite straightforward. That's why the object form helpers are used extensively in the scaffolding and generated administrations (see Chapter 14). Listing 10-10 lists the object form helpers.
Listing 10-10 - Object Form Helpers Syntax
<?php echo object_input_tag($object, $method, $options) ?> <?php echo object_input_date_tag($object, $method, $options) ?> <?php echo object_input_hidden_tag($object, $method, $options) ?> <?php echo object_textarea_tag($object, $method, $options) ?> <?php echo object_checkbox_tag($object, $method, $options) ?> <?php echo object_select_tag($object, $method, $options) ?> <?php echo object_select_country_tag($object, $method, $options) ?> <?php echo object_select_language_tag($object, $method, $options) ?>
There is no
object_password_tag() helper, since it is a bad practice to give a default value to a password tag, based on something the user has previously entered.
caution
Unlike the regular form helpers, the object form helpers are available only if you declare explicitly the use of the
Object helper group in your template with
use_helper('Object').
The most interesting of all object form helpers are
objects_for_select() and
object_select_tag(), which concern drop-down lists.
Populating Drop-Down Lists with Objects
The
options_for_select() helper, described previously with the other standard helpers, transforms a PHP associative array into an options list, as shown in Listing 10-11.
Listing 10-11 - Creating a List of Options Based on an Array with
options_for_select()
<?php echo options_for_select(array( '1' => 'Steve', '2' => 'Bob', '3' => 'Albert', '4' => 'Ian', '5' => 'Buck' ), 4) ?> => <option value="1">Steve</option> <option value="2">Bob</option> <option value="3">Albert</option> <option value="4" selected="selected">Ian</option> <option value="5">Buck</option>
Suppose that you already have an array of objects of class
Author, resulting from a Propel query. If you want to build a list of options based on this array, you will need to loop on it to retrieve the
id and the
name of each object, as shown in Listing 10-12.
Listing 10-12 - Creating a List of Options Based on an Array of Objects with
options_for_select()
// In the action $options = array(); foreach ($authors as $author) { $options[$author->getId()] = $author->getName(); } $this->options = $options; // In the template <?php echo options_for_select($options, 4) ?>
This kind of processing happens so often that symfony has a helper to automate it:
objects_for_select(), which creates an option list based directly on an array of objects. The helper needs two additional parameters: the method names used to retrieve the
value and the text contents of the
<option> tags to be generated. So Listing 10-12 is equivalent to this simpler form:
<?php echo objects_for_select($authors, 'getId', 'getName', 4) ?>
That's smart and fast, but symfony goes even further, when you deal with foreign key columns.
Creating a Drop-Down List Based on a Foreign Key Column
The values a foreign key column can take are the primary key values of the foreign table records. If, for instance, the
article table has an
author_id column that is a foreign key to an
author table, the possible values for this column are the
id of all the records of the
author table. Basically, a drop-down list to edit the author of an article would look like Listing 10-13.
Listing 10-13 - Creating a List of Options Based on a Foreign Key with
objects_for_select()
<?php echo select_tag('author_id', objects_for_select( AuthorPeer::doSelect(new Criteria()), 'getId', '__toString', $article->getAuthorId() )) ?> => <select name="author_id" id="author_id"> <option value="1">Steve</option> <option value="2">Bob</option> <option value="3">Albert</option> <option value="4" selected="selected">Ian</option> <option value="5">Buck</option> </select>
The
object_select_tag() does all that by itself. It displays a drop-down list populated with the name of the possible records of the foreign table. The helper can guess the foreign table and foreign column from the schema, so its syntax is very concise. Listing 10-13 is equivalent to this:
<?php echo object_select_tag($article, 'getAuthorId') ?>
The
object_select_tag() helper guesses the related peer class name (
AuthorPeer in the example) based on the method name passed as a parameter. However, you can specify your own class by setting the
related_class option in the third argument. The text content of the
<option> tags is the record name, which is the result of the
__toString() method of the object class (if
$author->__toString() method is undefined, the primary key is used instead). In addition, the list of options is built from a doSelect() method with an empty criteria value; it returns all the records ordered by creation date. If you prefer to display only a subset of records with a specific ordering, create a method in the peer class returning this selection as an array of objects, and set it in the
peer_method option. Lastly, you can add a blank option or a custom option at the top of the drop-down list by setting the include_blank and include_custom options. Listing 10-14 demonstrates these different options for the
object_select_tag() helper.
Listing 10-14 - Options of the
object_select_tag() Helper
// Base syntax <?php echo object_select_tag($article, 'getAuthorId') ?> // Builds the list from AuthorPeer::doSelect(new Criteria()) // Change the peer class used to retrieve the possible values <?php echo object_select_tag($article, 'getAuthorId', 'related_class=Foobar') ?> // Builds the list from FoobarPeer::doSelect(new Criteria()) // Change the peer method used to retrieve the possible values <?php echo object_select_tag($article, 'getAuthorId','peer_method=getMostFamousAuthors') ?> // Builds the list from AuthorPeer::getMostFamousAuthors(new Criteria()) // Add an <option value=""> </option> at the top of the list <?php echo object_select_tag($article, 'getAuthorId', 'include_blank=true') ?> // Add an <option value="">Choose an author</option> at the top of the list <?php echo object_select_tag($article, 'getAuthorId', 'include_custom=Choose an author') ?>
Updating Objects
A form completely dedicated to editing object properties by using object helpers is easier to handle in an action. For instance, if you have an object of class
Author with
name,
age, and
address attributes, the form can be coded as shown in Listing 10-15.
Listing 10-15 - A Form with Only Object Helpers
<?php echo form_tag('author/update') ?> <?php echo object_input_hidden_tag($author, 'getId') ?> Name: <?php echo object_input_tag($author, 'getName') ?><br /> Age: <?php echo object_input_tag($author, 'getAge') ?><br /> Address: <br /> <?php echo object_textarea_tag($author, 'getAddress') ?> </form>
The
update action of the
author module, called when the form is submitted, can simply update the object with the
fromArray() modifier generated by Propel, as shown in Listing 10-16.
Listing 10-16 - Handling a Form Submission Based on Object Form Helpers
public function executeUpdate () { $author = AuthorPeer::retrieveByPk($this->getRequestParameter('id')); $this->forward404Unless($author); $author->fromArray($this->getRequest()->getParameterHolder()->getAll(),BasePeer::TYPE_FIELDNAME); $author->save(); return $this->redirect('/author/show?id='.$author->getId()); }
Form Validation
Chapter 6 explained how to use the
validateXXX() methods in the action class to validate the request parameters. However, if you use this technique to validate a form submission, you will end up rewriting the same portion of code over and over. Symfony provides an alternative form-validation technique, relying on only a YAML file, instead of PHP code in the action class.
To demonstrate the form-validation features, let's first consider the sample form shown in Listing 10-17. It is a classic contact form, with
name,
age, and
message fields.
Listing 10-17 - Sample Contact Form, in
modules/contact/templates/indexSuccess.php
<?php echo form_tag('contact/send') ?> Name: <?php echo input_tag('name') ?><br /> Email: <?php echo input_tag('email') ?><br /> Age: <?php echo input_tag('age') ?><br /> Message: <?php echo textarea_tag('message') ?><br /> <?php echo submit_tag() ?> </form>
The principle of form validation is that if a user enters invalid data and submits the form, the next page should show an error message. Let's define what valid data should be for the sample form, in plain English:
- The
namefield is required. It must be a text entry between 2 and 100 characters.
- The
- The
agefield is required. It must be an integer between 0 and 120.
- The
messagefield is required.
You could define more complex validation rules for the contact form, but these are just fine for a demonstration of the validation possibilities.
note
Form validation can occur on the server side and/or on the client side. The server-side validation is compulsory to avoid corrupting a database with wrong data. The client-side validation is optional, though it greatly enhances the user experience. The client-side validation is to be done with custom JavaScript.
Validators
You can see that the
name and
execute() method. This method expects the value of a field as parameter, and returns
true if the value is valid and
false otherwise.
Symfony ships with several validators (described in the "Standard Symfony Validators" section later in this chapter), but let's focus on the
sfStringValidator for now. This validator checks that an input is a string, and that its size is between two specified character amounts (defined when calling the
initialize() method). That's exactly what is required to validate the
name field. Listing 10-18 shows how to use this validator in a validation method.
Listing 10-18 - Validating Request Parameters with Reusable Validators, in
modules/contact/action/actions.class.php
public function validateSend() { $name = $this->getRequestParameter('name'); // The name field is required if (!$name) { $this->getRequest()->setError('name', 'The name field cannot be left blank'); return false; } // The name field must be a text entry between 2 and 100 characters $myValidator = new sfStringValidator(); $myValidator->initialize($this->getContext(), array( 'min' => 2, 'min_error' => 'This name is too short (2 characters minimum)', 'max' => 100, 'max_error' => 'This name is too long. (100 characters maximum)', )); if (!$myValidator->execute($name, $error)) { return false; } return true; }
If a user submits the form in Listing 10-17 with the value
a in the
name field, the
execute() method of the
sfStringValidator will return
false (because the string length is less than the minimum of two characters). The
validateSend() method will then fail, and the
handleErrorSend() method will be called instead of the
executeSend() method.
tip
The
setError() method of the
sfRequest class gives information to the template so that it can display an error message (as explained in the "Displaying the Error Messages in the Form" section later in this chapter). The validators set the errors internally, so you can define different errors for the different cases of nonvalidation. That's the purpose of the
min_error and
max_error initialization parameters of the
sfStringValidator.
All the rules defined in the example can be translated into validators:
name:
sfStringValidator(
min=2,
max=100)
sfStringValidator(
min=2,
max=100) and
sfEmailValidator
age:
sfNumberValidator(
min=0,
max=120)
The fact that a field is required is not handled by a validator.
Validation File
You could easily implement the validation of the contact form with validators in the
validateSend() method, but that would imply repeating a lot of code. Symfony offers an alternative way to define validation rules for a form, and it involves YAML. For instance, Listing 10-19 shows the translation of the name field validation rules, and its results are equivalent to those of Listing 10-18.
Listing 10-19 - Validation File, in
modules/contact/validate/send.yml
fields: name: required: msg: The name field cannot be left blank sfStringValidator: min: 2 min_error: This name is too short (2 characters minimum) max: 100 max_error: This name is too long. (100 characters maximum)
In a validation file, the
fields header lists the fields that need to be validated, if they are required, and the validators that should be tested on them when a value is present. The parameters of each validator are the same as those you would use to initialize the validator manually. A field can be validated by as many validators as necessary.
note
The validation process doesn't stop when a validator fails. Symfony tests all the validators and declares the validation failed if at least one of them fails. And even if some of the rules of the validation file fail, symfony will still look for a
validateXXX() method and execute it. So the two validation techniques are complementary. The advantage is that, in a form with multiple failures, all the error messages are shown.
Validation files are located in the module
validate/ directory, and named by the action they must validate. For example, Listing 10-19 must be stored in a file called
validate/send.yml.
Redisplaying the Form
By default, symfony looks for a
handleErrorSend() method in the action class whenever the validation process fails, or displays the
sendError.php template if the method doesn't exist.
The usual way to inform the user of a failed validation is to display the form again with an error message. To that purpose, you need to override the
handleErrorSend() method and end it with a redirection to the action that displays the form (in the example,
module/index), as shown in Listing 10-20.
Listing 10-20 - Displaying the Form Again, in
modules/contact/actions/actions.class.php
class ContactActions extends sfActions { public function executeIndex() { // Display the form } public function handleErrorSend() { $this->forward('contact', 'index'); } public function executeSend() { // Handle the form submission } }
If you choose to use the same action to display the form and handle the form submission, then the
handleErrorSend() method can simply return
sfView::SUCCESS to redisplay the form from
sendSuccess.php, as shown in Listing 10-21.
Listing 10-21 - A Single Action to Display and Handle the Form, in
modules/contact/actions/actions.class.php
class ContactActions extends sfActions { public function executeSend() { if ($this->getRequest()->getMethod() != sfRequest::POST) { // Prepare data for the template // Display the form return sfView::SUCCESS; } else { // Handle the form submission ... $this->redirect('mymodule/anotheraction'); } } public function handleErrorSend() { // Prepare data for the template // Display the form return sfView::SUCCESS; } }
The logic necessary to prepare the data can be refactored into a protected method of the action class, to avoid repeating it in the
executeSend() and
handleErrorSend() methods.
With this new configuration, when the user types an invalid name, the form is displayed again, but the entered data is lost and no error message explains the reason of the failure. To address the last issue, you must modify the template that displays the form, to insert error messages close to the faulty field.
Displaying the Error Messages in the Form
The error messages defined as validator parameters are added to the request when a field fails validation (just as you can add an error manually with the
setError() method, as in Listing 10-18). The
sfRequest object provides two useful methods to retrieve the error message:
hasError() and
getError(), which each expect a field name as parameter. In addition, you can display an alert at the top of the form to draw attention to the fact that one or many of the fields contain invalid data with the
hasErrors() method. Listings 10-22 and 10-23 demonstrate how to use these methods.
Listing 10-22 - Displaying Error Messages at the Top of the Form, in
templates/indexSuccess.php
<?php if ($sf_request->hasErrors()): ?> <p>The data you entered seems to be incorrect. Please correct the following errors and resubmit:</p> <ul> <?php foreach($sf_request->getErrors() as $name => $error): ?> <li><?php echo $name ?>: <?php echo $error ?></li> <?php endforeach; ?> </ul> <?php endif; ?>
Listing 10-23 - Displaying Error Messages Inside the Form, in
templates/indexSuccess.php
<?php echo form_tag('contact/send') ?> <?php if ($sf_request->hasError('name')): ?> <?php echo $sf_request->getError('name') ?> <br /> <?php endif; ?> Name: <?php echo input_tag('name') ?><br /> ... <?php echo submit_tag() ?> </form>
The conditional use of the
getError() method in Listing 10-23 is a bit long to write. That's why symfony offers a
form_error() helper to replace it, provided that you declare the use of its helper group,
Validation. Listing 10-24 replaces Listing 10-23 by using this helper.
Listing 10-24 - Displaying Error Messages Inside the Form, the Short Way
<?php use_helper('Validation') ?> <?php echo form_tag('contact/send') ?> <?php echo form_error('name') ?><br /> Name: <?php echo input_tag('name') ?><br /> ... <?php echo submit_tag() ?> </form>
The
form_error() helper adds a special character before and after each error message to make the messages more visible. By default, the character is an arrow pointing down (corresponding to the
‚Üì entity), but you can change it in the
settings.yml file:
all: .settings: validation_error_prefix: ' ‚Üì ' validation_error_suffix: ' ‚Üì'
In case of failed validation, the form now displays errors correctly, but the data entered by the user is lost. You need to repopulate the form to make it really user-friendly.
Repopulating the Form
As the error handling is done through the
forward() method (shown in Listing 10-20), the original request is still accessible, and the data entered by the user is in the request parameters. So you could repopulate the form by adding default values to each field, as shown in Listing 10-25.
Listing 10-25 - Setting Default Values to Repopulate the Form When Validation Fails, in
templates/indexSuccess.php
<?php use_helper('Validation') ?> <?php echo form_tag('contact/send') ?> <?php echo form_error('name') ?><br /> Name: <?php echo input_tag('name', $sf_params->get('name')) ?><br /> <?php echo form_error('email') ?><br /> Email: <?php echo input_tag('email', $sf_params->get('email')) ?><br /> <?php echo form_error('age') ?><br /> Age: <?php echo input_tag('age', $sf_params->get('age')) ?><br /> <?php echo form_error('message') ?><br /> Message: <?php echo textarea_tag('message', $sf_params->get('message')) ?><br /> <?php echo submit_tag() ?> </form>
But once again, this is quite tedious to write. Symfony provides an alternative way of triggering repopulation for all the fields of a form, directly in the YAML validation file, without changing the default values of the elements. Just enable the
fillin: feature for the form, with the syntax described in Listing 10-26.
Listing 10-26 - Activating
fillin to Repopulate the Form When Validation Fails, in
validate/send.yml
fillin: enabled: true # Enable the form repopulation param: name: test # Form name, not needed if there is only one form in the page skip_fields: [email] # Do not repopulate these fields exclude_types: [hidden, password] # Do not repopulate these field types check_types: [text, checkbox, radio, select, hidden] # Do repopulate these content_type: html # html is the tolerant default. Other option is xml and xhtml (same as xml but without xml prolog)
By default, the automatic repopulation works for text inputs, check boxes, radio buttons, text areas, and select components (simple and multiple), but it does not repopulate password or hidden tags. The
fillin feature doesn't work for file tags.
note
The
fillin feature works by parsing the response content in XML just before sending it to the user. By default
fillin will output HTML.
If you want to have
fillin to output XHTML you have to set
param: content_type: xml. If the response is not a strictly valid XHTML document
fillin will not work.
The third available
content_type is
xhtml which is the same as
xml but it removes the xml prolog from the response which causes quirks mode in IE6.
You might want to transform the values entered by the user before writing them back in a form input. Escaping, URL rewriting, transformation of special characters into entities, and all the other transformations that can be called through a function can be applied to the fields of your form if you define the transformation under the
converters: key, as shown in Listing 10-27.
Listing 10-27 - Converting Input Before
fillin, in
validate/send.yml
fillin: enabled: true param: name: test converters: # Converters to apply htmlentities: [first_name, comments] htmlspecialchars: [comments]
Standard Symfony Validators
Symfony contains some standard validators that can be used for your forms:
sfStringValidator
sfNumberValidator
sfEmailValidator
sfUrlValidator
sfRegexValidator
sfCompareValidator
sfPropelUniqueValidator
sfDoctrineUniqueValidator
sfFileValidator
sfCallbackValidator
sfDateValidator
Each has a default set of parameters and error messages, but you can easily
override them through the
initialize() validator method or in the YAML file.
The following sections describe the validators and show usage examples.
String Validator
sfStringValidator allows you to apply string-related constraints to a parameter.
sfStringValidator: values: [foo, bar] values_error: The only accepted values are foo and bar insensitive: false # If true, comparison with values is case insensitive min: 2 min_error: Please enter at least 2 characters max: 100 max_error: Please enter less than 100 characters
Number Validator
sfNumberValidator verifies if a parameter is a number and allows you to apply size constraints.
sfNumberValidator: nan_error: Please enter an integer min: 0 min_error: The value must be at least zero max: 100 max_error: The value must be less than or equal to 100
sfEmailValidator verifies if a parameter contains a value that qualifies as an e-mail address.
sfEmailValidator: strict: true email_error: This email address is invalid
RFC822 defines the format of e-mail addresses. However, it is more permissive than the generally accepted format. For instance,
[email protected] is a valid e-mail address according to the RFC, but you probably don't want to accept it. When the
strict parameter is set to
true (its default value), only e-mail addresses matching the pattern
false, RFC822 is used as a rule.
URL Validator
sfUrlValidator checks if a field is a correct URL.
sfUrlValidator: url_error: This URL is invalid
Regular Expression Validator
sfRegexValidator allows you to match a value against a Perl-compatible regular expression pattern.
sfRegexValidator: match: No match_error: Posts containing more than one URL are considered as spam pattern: /http.*http/si
The
match parameter determines if the request parameter must match the pattern to be valid (value
Yes) or match the pattern to be invalid (value
No).
Compare Validator
sfCompareValidator checks the equality of two different request parameters. It is very useful for password checks.
fields: password1: required: msg: Please enter a password password2: required: msg: Please retype the password sfCompareValidator: check: password1 compare_error: The two passwords do not match
The
check parameter contains the name of the field that the current field
must match to be valid.
Propel/Doctrine Unique Validators
sfPropelUniqueValidator validates that the value of a request parameter
doesn't already exist in your database. It is very useful for unique indexes.
fields: nickname: sfPropelUniqueValidator: class: User column: login unique_error: This login already exists. Please choose another one.
In this example, the validator will look in the database for a record of class
User where the
login column has the same value as the field to validate.
caution
sfPropelUniqueValidator is susceptible to race conditions. Although unlikely, in multiuser environments, the result may change the instant it returns. You should still be ready to handle a duplicate INSERT error.
NOTE
If you have enabled the Doctrine ORM for your project, you can also use the
sfDoctrineUniqueValidator in the same way as described above for Propel.
File Validator
sfFileValidator applies format (an array of mime-types) and size constraints to file upload fields.
fields: image: file: True required: msg: Please upload an image file sfFileValidator: mime_types: - 'image/jpeg' - 'image/png' - 'image/x-png' - 'image/pjpeg' mime_types_error: Only PNG and JPEG images are allowed max_size: 512000 max_size_error: Max size is 512Kb
Be aware that the
file attribute must be set to
True for the field, and the template must declare the form as multipart.
Callback Validator
sfCallbackValidator delegates the validation to a third-party callable method or function to do the validation. The callable method or function must return
true or
false.
fields: account_number: sfCallbackValidator: callback: is_numeric invalid_error: Please enter a number. credit_card_number: sfCallbackValidator: callback: [myTools, validateCreditCard] invalid_error: Please enter a valid credit card number.
The callback method or function receives the value to be validated as a first parameter. This is very useful when you want to reuse existing methods of functions, rather than create a full validator class.
Date Validator
sfDateValidator checks that a submitted date is valid and/or within a certain
simple range
sfDateValidator: date_error: You have entered an invalid date compare: "2007-05-01" operator: ">=" #defaults to "==" if not supplied compare_error: "Enter a date later than 1st May 2007"
tip
You can also write your own validators, as described in the "Creating a Custom Validator" section later in this chapter.
Named Validators
If you see that you need to repeat a validator class and its settings, you can package it under a named validator. In the example of the contact form, the email field needs the same sfStringValidator parameters as the
name field. So you can create a
myStringValidator named validator to avoid repeating the same settings twice. To do so, add a
myStringValidator label under the
validators: header, and set the
class and
param keys with the details of the named validator you want to package. You can then use the named validator just like a regular one in the
fields section, as shown in Listing 10-28.
Listing 10-28 - Reusing Named Validators in a Validation File, in
validate/send.yml
Restricting the Validation to a Method
By default, the validators set in a validation file are run when the action is called with the POST method. You can override this setting globally or field by field by specifying another value in the
methods key, to allow a different validation for different methods, as shown in Listing 10-29.
Listing 10-29 - Defining When to Test a Field, in
validate/send.yml
methods: [post] # This is the default setting fields: name: required: msg: The name field cannot be left blank myStringValidator: email: methods: [post, get] # Overrides the global methods settings required: msg: The email field cannot be left blank myStringValidator: sfEmailValidator: email_error: This email address is invalid
What Does a Validation File Look Like?
So far, you have seen only bits and pieces of a validation file. When you put everything together, the validation rules find a clear translation in YAML. Listing 10-30 shows the complete validation file for the sample contact form, corresponding to all the rules defined earlier in the chapter.
Listing 10-30 - Sample Complete Validation File
fillin: enabled: true age: sfNumberValidator: nan_error: Please enter an integer min: 0 min_error: "You're not even born. How do you want to send a message?" max: 120 max_error: "Hey, grandma, aren't you too old to surf on the Internet?" message: required: msg: The message field cannot be left blank
Complex Validation
The validation file satisfies most needs, but when the validation is very complex, it might not be sufficient. In this case, you can still return to the
validateXXX() method in the action, or find the solution to your problem in the following sections.
Creating a Custom Validator
Each validator is a class that extends the
sfValidator class. If the validator classes shipped with symfony are not suitable for your needs, you can easily create a new one, in any of the
lib/ directories where it can be autoloaded. The syntax is quite simple: The
execute() method of the validator is called when the validator is executed. You can also define default settings in the
initialize() method.
The
execute() method receives the value to validate as the first parameter and the error message to throw as the second parameter. Both are passed as references, so you can modify the error message from within the method.
The
initialize() method receives the context singleton and the array of parameters from the YAML file. It must first call the
initialize() method of its parent
sfValidator class, and then set the default values.
Every validator has a parameter holder accessible by
$this->getParameterHolder().
For instance, if you want to build an
sfSpamValidator to check if a string is not spam, add the code shown in Listing 10-31 to an
sfSpamValidator.class.php file. It checks if the
$value contains more than
max_url times the string
'http'.
Listing 10-31 - Creating a Custom Validator, in
lib/sfSpamValidator.class.php
class sfSpamValidator extends sfValidator { public function execute (&$value, &$error) { // For max_url=2, the regexp is /http.*http/is $re = '/'.implode('.*', array_fill(0, $this->getParameter('max_url') + 1, 'http')).'/is'; if (preg_match($re, $value)) { $error = $this->getParameter('spam_error'); return false; } return true; } public function initialize ($context, $parameters = null) { // Initialize parent parent::initialize($context); // Set default parameters value $this->setParameter('max_url', 2); $this->setParameter('spam_error', 'This is spam'); // Set parameters $this->getParameterHolder()->add($parameters); return true; } }
As soon as the validator is added to an autoloadable directory (and the cache cleared), you can use it in your validation files, as shown in Listing 10-32.
Listing 10-32 - Using a Custom Validator, in
validate/send.yml
fields: message: required: msg: The message field cannot be left blank sfSpamValidator: max_url: 3 spam_error: Leave this site immediately, you filthy spammer!
Using Array Syntax for Form Fields
PHP allows you to use an array syntax for the form fields. When writing your own forms, or when using the ones generated by the Propel administration (see Chapter 14), you may end up with HTML code that looks like Listing 10-33.
Listing 10-33 - Form with Array Syntax
<label for="story_title">Title:</label> <input type="text" name="story[title]" id="story_title" value="default value" size="45" />
Using the input name as is (with brackets) in a validation file will throw a parsed-induced error. The solution here is to replace square brackets
[] with curly brackets
{} in the
fields section, as shown in Listing 10-34, and symfony will take care of the conversion of the names sent to the validators afterwards.
Listing 10-34 - Validation File for a Form with Array Syntax
fields: story{title}: required: Yes
Executing a Validator on an Empty Field
You may need to execute a validator on a field that is not required, on an empty value. For instance, this happens with a form where the user can change their password (but may not want to), and in this case, a confirmation password must be entered. See the example in Listing 10-35.
Listing 10-35 - Sample Validation File for a Form with Two Password Fields
fields: password1: password2: sfCompareValidator: check: password1 compare_error: The two passwords do not match
The validation process executes as follows:
If
password1
== nulland
password2 == null:
- The
requiredtest passes.
- Validators are not run.
- The form is valid.
If
password2 == nullwhile
password1is not
null:
- The
requiredtest passes.
- Validators are not run.
- The form is valid.
You may want to execute your
password2 validator if
password1 is
not null. Fortunately, the symfony validators handle this case, thanks to the
group parameter. When a field is in a group, its validator will execute if it is not empty and if one of the fields of the same group is not empty.
So, if you change the configuration to that shown in Listing 10-36, the validation process behaves correctly.
Listing 10-36 - Sample Validation File for a Form with Two Password Fields and a Group
fields: password1: group: password_group password2: group: password_group sfCompareValidator: check: password1 compare_error: The two passwords do not match
The validation process now executes as follows:
If
password1 == nulland
password2 == null:
- The
requiredtest passes.
- Validators are not run.
- The form is valid.
If
password1 == nulland
password2 == 'foo':
- The
requiredtest passes.
password2is
not null, so its validator is executed, and it fails.
- An error message is thrown for
password2.
If
password1 == 'foo'and
password2 == null:
- The
requiredtest passes.
password1is
not null, so the validator for
password2, which is in the same group, is executed, and it fails.
- An error message is thrown for
password2.
If
password1 == 'foo'and
password2 == 'foo':
- The
requiredtest passes.
password2is
not null, so its validator is executed, and it passes.
- The form is valid.
Summary
Writing forms in symfony templates is facilitated by the standard form helpers and their smart options. When you design a form to edit the properties of an object, the object form helpers simplify the task a great deal. The validation files, validation helpers, and repopulation feature reduce the work necessary to build a robust and user-friendly server control on the value of a field. And even the most complex validation needs can be handled, either by writing a custom validator or by creating a
validateXXX() method in the action class.Mercury Free Baby.org Disclaimer:

This is an archived mail posted to the Subversion Dev
mailing list.If you are trying to boost your client base then it is extremely important to be using photographs to your advantage. And do you know that the key to boosting your client base and product marketing plan is not writing the perfect content? These days, it is all about images.
Yes, your audience wants to know all about your products. But you need to find a way to communicate it without forcing them to read long descriptions. Still not convinced why commercial product photography should rank high on your budget‚Äôs list?
Here are the proofs of how valuable commercial product photography can be.
CAPTURE YOUR CUSTOMERS MOOD
You cannot take your potential customers to a Halloween site and show them how scary and comfortable their props and masks are. You can convey this feeling through the pictures majorly. Hence, it makes sense to make them understand that your product is the ultimate solution for all the issues they may have. This gesture can be greatly conveyed through quality and worthy images. Perfectly clicked and useful product images draw attention with nanoseconds. This increases tremendously the chances of high sales.
PROMOTES SILENT COMMUNICATION
We all know images speak louder than words. This fact still stands strong and tall when it comes to businesses and endorsing the brands. People browsing various online platforms have limited time and patience to read all the texts and product descriptions. In this case, you only need to mention: available product sizes, colors, and features that are up for sale.
KEEP COMPETITORS AWAY
You might feel that your product is 100% unique, but it may not be a 100% fact. There are millions of products globally, that might have the same features as yours does. The trick here is to talk with your images. Show that all your products are way more attuned to detail and better than your competitors‚Äô, by using high-quality product images.
BUILDS BRAND
A photograph is a long-term solution to get your company recognized as a market leader. Displaying brand, quality product images consistently over months, can convey your brand as:
- Innovative
- Diverse
- Quality
- Professional
- Valued
It conveys your customers that your brand truly cares for their preferences and it is humble enough to cater to them all.
SETS RIGHT EXPECTATIONS
Almost 22% of products sold online are returned as the items look different than the pictures displayed. So convincing people to buy items offline is comparatively easier than doing so online.
So it is always advisable to display the pictures of the item as they are instead of adding any effects or filters. Set your customer expectations about what they are looking at right.
Another significant setter would be the number of days within which you can entertain product returns. People who make an impulsive purchase decision exit too! They are aware of and rely upon the fact that any products brought online can be returned if felt unsatisfied with it.
It‚Äôs good to run a considerate online business but not at the cost of your added expenses. Setting customer expectations right by implanting a limited return policy is healthy and profitable.
Bottom Line
There are several ways to boost your product sales by making optimum usage of the tool named ‚Äì PHOTOGRAPHY! Businesses flourishing online must leverage this tool to the fullest to influence the audiences to purchase the product.

Today, many organizations are coming to the realization that their current data and analytics environment does not meet their business needs, including managing and analyzing massive amounts of diverse data to gain a competitive advantage. Their on-premises data warehouse, traditional ETL tools, and desktop BI are not sufficient to govern and utilize newer data types, volume, and frequency, let alone the growing needs of non-technical users.
At TDWI, we see companies moving all parts of their analytics infrastructure‚Äîfrom traditional on-premises data warehouses to desktop analytics tools‚Äîto a cloud architecture. The pillars of a modern data and analytics stack include the cloud data platform, modern data pipeline tools, and a modern cloud analytics platform. The modern analytics platform often utilizes augmented technology such as natural language query to deliver real-time insights specifically for business users. All of these components are tightly integrated.
Join TDWI‚Äôs VP of Research, Fern Halper, as she hosts a lively panel discussion with team members from Fivetran, Snowflake, and ThoughtSpot on the topic of the truly modern data and analytics cloud stack.

Washing machines are huge time savers because you will not waste time monitoring the washing process. You can load your clothes, begin the cycle and do other things as the machine does the washing for you. The effort that is required to wash clothes is eliminated when you opt for washing machines. Instead of having to wash stains physically, you can pre-treat and then let the machine to everything for you.
Washing machines do not damage clothing because they have various cycles that will protect your attire during washing. After your fine washables have been cleaned using a washing machine, you can use a tumble dryer to dry them. The advantage of using good tumble dryers is that the machine will not overheat the load and the stability of your garments will not get broken down.
Depending on your budget and needs, you might want to be specific with the type of dryer that comes with the washing machine. There are mainly 2 kinds of tumble dryers ‚Äì namely vented dryers and spin dryers.Explore CAAMA

After I showed pictures of hundreds of VWs just rotting in the Pontiac Silverdome parking lot awaiting a verdict from CARB and the EPA on whether they‚Äôll live to drive another day, people naturally wondered if scrapping all of these cars was really an environmentally-friendly thing to do.
After all, it takes energy to recycle an old car, and more importantly, it takes energy to manufacture a replacement‚Äîplus you have to calculate the effects of scrapping all that metal. And even if they were way high on NOx emissions, these TDIs were known to score 50+ MPG.
How can crushing them be better for the environment?
To answer whether or not it would make more sense to just keep the VWs on the road versus recycle them would require a full life cycle study by the Environmental Protection Agency or the California Air Resources Board to determine the net CO2 imbalance (CO2 is associated with climate change) caused by prematurely decommissioning all the vehicles, and then weighing that against NOx (which is associated with smog and adverse health effects. More on that in a bit.)
Such life cycle studies have been done before, and you‚Äôll find quite a few of them covering the U.S. Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save (CARS) Act of 2009, also known as Cash For Clunkers. These studies, which deal primarily with CO2 emissions, dig into whether killing off all the guzzlers (which may still have had some life in them) and making owners buy newer, more efficient cars, was actually an environmental benefit or a detriment.
(It‚Äôs worth noting that most studies seem to conclude that Cash For Clunkers was actually beneficial thanks to the large gap in MPGs between the cars turned in and those purchased.)
The question is: In the Dieselgate settlement, did the EPA conduct such a life cycle study before deciding upon a solution that could send nearly half a million vehicles to the junkyard?
I reached out to the EPA and Volkswagen asking that very question, and both sources directed me to the California Air Resources Board. Eventually, I got a hold of somebody at CARB, and learned that the answer is no: nobody had conducted a Life Cycle Study on these vehicles.
Before I continue, I‚Äôll briefly discuss the difference between CO2 and NOx. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, while NOx leads to the formation of criteria pollutants like O3 and particulate matter. CO2 has detrimental effects on climate change, while NOx is better known to cause smog and health concerns like asthma.
The issue with VW‚Äôs TDI vehicles, CARB representative Stanley Young told me over email, is that they emitted extralegal amounts of NOx, which brings along associated local health concerns‚Äîhealth concerns that MIT has estimated could cause 1,200 people in Europe to die early.
Young emphasized that with the VW settlement, the goal was to get the cars off the road to prevent the health issues associated with NOx, and also to remedy the fact that consumers had been lied to, saying:
Because the cars are equipped with defeat devices they emit up to 40x more NOx than the standards to which they were certified. The impacts of NOx to public health are significant, and need to be dealt with appropriately. At the same time consumers were sold a car that did not perform as advertised, and this needed to be dealt with appropriately as well.
This latter point was reiterated by Elizabeth Cabraser, lead counsel of the Plaintiffs‚Äô Steering Committee, who told me in a teleconference:
As class counsel, we not only have to strike the balance in terms of environment versus economy, but the economic interests and environmental concerns of our class members, the owners. We‚Äôre consumerists, that‚Äôs how we look at it.
So clearly the main focus in drawing up the VW Dieselgate settlement was on preventing health issues and on getting owners compensated for VW‚Äôs lies‚Äînot necessarily climate change associated with CO2.
That makes a lot of sense. But still, there could be a half a million cars sent to the crusher‚Äîyou‚Äôd think an environmental agency would have run some numbers on the carbon impact as well.
The reason why the settlement didn‚Äôt determine the carbon imbalance associated with taking the cars off the road before the end of their useful life, CARB‚Äôs Stanley Young told me over the phone a few months ago, is that there‚Äôs no accepted methodology for such life cycles studies.
Young said there‚Äôs no way of knowing how far you‚Äôd take the study. Do you go through every piece of plastic? How do you determine the Greenhouse Gas intensity of screws? What about the carbon intensity of creating the motor? Do you include what happens to it at the end of life? These are all big question marks, Young told me.
After I pointed out that a number of academic institutions had already published life cycle studies the like aforementioned Cash For Clunkers reports, I questioned whether it would have been prudent to at least look into the CO2 ramifications of junking so many cars. Mr. Young told me there‚Äôs nothing that can be done now, saying something to the effect of:
Do you want me to go back and tell the federal agency and VW in California to redo the consent decree to [consider] the carbon life cycle in the car cars that are going be scrapped?
He then admitted that it would be productive and worthwhile to develop metrics for such studies so they can be used in the future, but that ‚Äúuntil there is an accepted metric and protocol for determining the carbon impact of creating a specific car for a specific model year... then it is in a sense not productive to engage in that discussion.‚Äù
For her part, Cabraser, the plaintiffs‚Äô attorney in the settlement case, said something similar about the complexity involved with such an undertaking:
I think various individuals and groups have studied parts of the problem...It‚Äôs a complex question...I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to answer that question, but I am not an environmental economist.
So clearly the lack of a standardized process played a part in not running a lifecycle study to figure out the effects of crushing the cars on climate change, as did a focus on local health effects of NOx. Expediency also played a role, as the court worked hard to get these vehicles off the road as quickly as possible to prevent further NOx pollution, and to ensure that consumers are promptly compensated.
A number of overseas markets are flooded with vehicles that pollute a lot worse than Volkswagen‚Äôs TDIs. Displacing a single old-school diesel vehicle in a developing country, for example, with a modern direct injected, turbo Volkswagen TDI would‚Äîyou would think‚Äîbe a major advantage from an environmental standpoint.
But, as Ms. Cabraser answered in our Q&A with the head Dieselgate lawyer, VW selling their cars overseas was not an option considered:
VW can only sell these cars overseas if they receive an EPA and CARB approved modification or repair. It was important to us, the EPA and CARB that VW not have overseas markets as an escape from being accountable under US emissions standards for the cars they originally sold here. It was also very important to many class members that the world environment as well as our own be protected from these emissions to the extent practical.
It seems that punishing VW, and making a statement that what they did is unacceptable by preventing international sale of the vehicles were the two primary reasons for this decision, even if there could theoretically be a net environmental benefit of sending the cars overseas.
So to everyone wondering if scrapping the cars is actually better for the environment than keeping the cars on the road, the answer is: nobody really ran the numbers, and it‚Äôs complicated. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the EPA, CARB and the Plaintiff‚Äôs Steering Committee didn‚Äôt at least consider this as a factor when drawing up the settlement terms.
In fact, in my conversation with Cabraser, she said her team ‚Äúdid what [they] could in the settlement to temper all of those [environmental] ramifications,‚Äù and in our Q&A she said they ‚Äúalways have the net environmental impact in mind and it is a delicate balance.‚Äù For example, the cars can‚Äôt just be scrapped, they have to be recycled in an environmentally responsible way in a process that will be overseen by the EPA and California Air Resources Board.
Cabraser then went on, discussing how both the 2.0-liter and 3.0-liter settlements give VW the option to bring the vehicles‚Äô NOx pollution down to levels that are higher than what the cars were originally certified to, but still much lower than current levels.
While this was undoubtedly done primarily to allow owners to keep their cars (again, Elizabeth and her team are ‚Äúconsumerists‚Äù), this modification option has a secondary benefit of preventing cars from being recycled before the end of their useful lives, avoiding the associated CO2 costs.
CARB‚Äôs Young said essentially the same thing:
...while we didn‚Äôt do a lifecycle assessment, the agreement does consider it in a way ‚Äì because we allow an emissions modification if the company can meet the requirements in the agreement...The modification helps ensure we get useful life out of the vehicles while addressing the illegal NOx emissions.
On top of the modification option (it‚Äôs worth noting that only 2015 model VWs have had their modification approved, while the remaining approximately 500,000 cars could still be headed to the junykard), there are also environmental mitigation actions built into the settlement.
Volkswagen has to pay $2.7 billion to ‚Äúfully mitigate the total, lifetime excess NOx emissions from the 2.0 Liter Subject Vehicles where the 2.0 Liter Subject Vehicles were, are or will be operated‚Äù in the form of a mitigation trust. The trust will disperse money to certain areas (dependent upon the concentration of VW TDIs) to fund certain NOx mitigation actions.
Those actions include retrofitting over-the-road trucks and buses with ‚Äúany new diesel or Alternate Fueled engine or All-Electric engine,‚Äù or just replacing those vehicles with ‚Äúany new diesel or Alternate Fueled or All-Electric vehicle.‚Äù
On top of that, VW has to spend $2 billion promoting zero emissions vehicle awareness and infrastructure. Between these two environmental commitments, Volkswagen may very well make up for the carbon pollution associated with scrapping all those cars.
The thing that makes recycling 500,000 VWs even worse for the environment than the costs of manufacturing a replacement is the the fact that these cars will likely be replaced by less fuel efficient cars.
Deepak Rajagopal, professor at the institute of the environment and sustainability at UCLA and author of multiple life-cycle studies, told me that manufacturing a new car only accounts for about 5 percent of all carbon emissions, while the rest comes from the fuel needed to drive the car (the end-of-life recycling part is actually quite efficient).
Since TDIs are known to score over 50 MPG, the real detriment to climate change, then, is consumers who will sell their fuel efficient car back to VW and replace it with one that burns more fuel, and thus emits more CO2.
This is a real issue‚Äîmy inbox is regularly flooded with emails from owners who honestly don‚Äôt know what new vehicle could possibly replace their trusty fuel-sipping TDI.
Of course, for all we know, all Dieselgate class members will buy Priuses. But I doubt it. As for scrapping cars, Rajagopal told me that part of the equation, in the grand scheme, is minuscule, and that the impact of NOx is likely much more important.
Yes, half a million scrapped cars is a shocking thing to picture. And yes, there will be pollution emitted when automakers build replacements‚Äîones that that will likely emit more CO2 from their tailpipes than the fuel-sipping TDIs. And while it‚Äôs tempting to criticize the fact that a life cycle study was not completed to really dig into a carbon imbalance associated with junking these cars, there are a number of reasons why the settlement still makes a lot of sense.
Not only does it require VW to spend $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion on NOx mitigation and Zero Electric Vehicle promotion, respectively‚Äîboth of which could also mitigate CO2 caused by scrapping the vehicles‚Äîbut there‚Äôs a modification option still on the table to keep the cars on the road.
Add to that the fact that we don‚Äôt know what vehicles the TDI owners will replace their cars with, and it becomes clear that even running a life cycle study to calculate the true CO2 imbalance would be damn near impossible.
Even if you could, how would you weigh NOx against CO2? If you kept the cars on the road to reduce CO2 pollution, but the trade-off was the health issues associated with NOx, would that be acceptable? That‚Äôs a debate that‚Äôs been around forever.
As lead counsel for the Plaintiffs‚Äô Steering Committee Elizabeth Cabraser put it in our 3.0-liter settlement conference call: ‚Äú...the best of all possible worlds has different answers depending on perspective.‚Äù

But before we get too excited about starting a new semester, there are some important things to consider. One of the most important is how heavy your bag will be by day‚Äôs end. A good rule of thumb is that if you‚Äôre carrying more than 10 pounds, then you‚Äôre doing something wrong! It doesn‚Äôt take a genius or an engineer to figure out that this kind of weight will put a lot of stress and strain on your body and not just your neck and shoulders but also your lower back, hips, knees, and feet as well. You don‚Äôt want any part of your body getting sore before the first day even gets here.
The fact is that most backpacks are designed without giving proper consideration to the anatomy of your body. In many cases, they simply throw a bunch of straps and cushions onto an ordinary backpack frame. This isn‚Äôt good for your back in the long run, especially if you‚Äôre walking around with 10 pounds or more on your back. And yet, many students are forced to walk around in this kind of pain for years without knowing how to stop it. To ensure that your back will stay healthy and strong, you need an Ergonomic School Bag in Singapore that is designed specifically for your body.
Make Sure You Choose a Bag that is High-Quality with Plenty of Support for Your Back
Choosing the perfect ergonomic School Bag in Singapore can be tricky and it‚Äôs important to think about what kind of materials are best for your back. For example, leather bags with a lot of padding are great because they will protect your spine while also being lightweight at the same time. Others may want a style that offers plenty of space and is lightweight to carry around all day. Whatever you choose, make sure it has plenty of support so that carrying that heavy bag doesn‚Äôt end up hurting your back or spine!
Why it‚Äôs better to Invest in an Ergonomic Backpack
A high-quality, ergonomic backpack will help reduce any pain that comes from carrying heavy books and supplies all day. When you invest in a stylish ergonomic backpack that is designed to offer the right amount of support for your back, you‚Äôll find that even the heaviest load will be easier to carry. Whether you need a large bag for all of your heavy textbooks or a light design for your laptop and pencil case, there‚Äôs a style that‚Äôs perfect for any student.
The Perfect Investment for Any Student!
High-quality ergonomic backpacks can provide the support that your spine needs when carrying heavy bags around. Not only do these backpacks offer plenty of space to store all of your school books, but they‚Äôre also lightweight and sleek. With many different styles‚Äìfrom leather to nylon‚Äìyou‚Äôll be able to pick the perfect bag for yourself no matter what your style is. And, of course, the best part is that you won‚Äôt have to worry about back pain from carrying a heavy bag!
Here are some additional tips for buying a high-quality ergonomic backpack in Singapore:
- The straps should be wide and padded, to ensure that you‚Äôll have plenty of support while carrying your bag. ‚Äì Choose from plenty of different styles to find the perfect look for yourself. ‚Äì Make sure that the backpack has a lot of compartments so that you can stay organized throughout the school day.
- Be sure that the backpack is made of durable material, so it can last throughout your school career. ‚Äì Make sure all straps are adjustable for an easy fit.
- Make sure the zippers are sturdy, so you don‚Äôt end up losing any of your supplies at school. ‚Äì The shoulder strap should be long enough to fit comfortably over both shoulders while still resting comfortably around your body.
The Bottom Line
Your back will thank you for investing in a high-quality ergonomic School Bag in Singapore this year. Carrying around heavy books and supplies on your shoulders can lead to major pain, but choosing the right bag ensures that you‚Äôre not adding any more stress to an already overworked body part. Ergonomic bags provide plenty of support while also being lightweight with lots of space for all your materials. You have options to‚Äìchoose from sleek leather or multi-colored nylon!

Before sharpening your creases, force them to place with your finger tips. When you are happy with the location of the folded flap, force it, by using a bone folder or your finger nail.
Try to avoid changing the direction of a fold line, especially with the wings. Reversing a fold line weaken the paper along it, and the wings will change the dihedral angle too easily.
Always refer to the paper reference points and not the printed template. The print may be misaligned on the paper, while reference points are absolute. By reference points we mean the edges and corners of the paper, and every new fold line that is based on them.
The symmetry of the wings has an utmost importance. This is the reason for having only one Wing Folding Line in the diagrams. Fold the marked wing first, and align the second to it, to have that perfect symmetry.

Research leading to improved treatment of stroke has largely excluded children. Progress in understanding pathophysiology and improved treatment of childhood stroke requires multicenter prospective cohort studies to define reliable and valid outcome predictors. Determinants of outcome in childhood stroke are unknown. Clinical stroke severity measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a robust outcome predictor in adults, but has not been studied in children. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the reliability, validity and predictive utility of a pediatric adaptation of the NIHSS, (PedNIHSS). There are three specific aims, to assess: 1) the relationship of PedNIHSS to acute infarct volume and location measured on brain MRI; 2) predictive utility of PedNIHSS score relative to 3- and 12-month neurologic and functional outcomes; 3) inter-rater reliability and predictive sensitivity and specificity of the PedNIHSS. In a consecutive prospective cohort study, 8 pediatric tertiary care hospitals in the International Pediatric Stroke Study network will enroll 120 subjects over 18 months, to include all children age 2-18 years with acute arterial ischemic stroke, excluding patients with acute head injury, cardiac arrest, brain tumor or meningitis. PedNIHSS will be recorded daily for 7 days, and correlated with infarct volume on T2-weighted MRI obtained on admission and at 5-7 days after symptom onset. Predictive utility of PedNIHSS will be assessed by multivariate regression models for 3- and 12-month outcomes which will include measures of neurologic impairment using the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure, disability using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, and quality of life using the PedsQL. Interrater reliability will be measured by comparing PedNIHSS scores given by a primary examiner with that of a second examiner observing the examination. The results of this study will provide new information about how initial clinical stroke severity is related to size and location of the stroke, its importance in predicting outcome in children, and the influence of age, gender, and stroke risk factor on the prediction of outcome. These observations, and the availability of a simple valid clinical stroke scale for children, will be important for planning and conducting future clinical trials and outcome studies for childhood stroke. ? ?

Cantabria is confined, thus following in the footsteps of its neighboring communities that have been doing the same throughout these days. In this way, as government sources have confirmed to elDiario.es, Health will decree the perimeter closure to try to contain the worrying advance of COVID-19 in recent weeks, in which there have been triggered daily infections and, as a consequence, also hospital occupancy, and does not rule out applying more restrictive measures in the field of mobility in the municipalities during the coming days.

An unforeseen love triangle‚Äô relationship with Richard deepens, so too does his friendship with Anna, a patient in his care who suffers from a rare neurological syndrome that leaves her paralysed.

A Cinergy Film Production 2018HBO is hacked, and Game of Thrones episodes may have leaked out
Written bThe Washington Post/ Courtesy of
Hackers have stolen what HBO on Monday called ‚Äúproprietary information‚Äù from the company‚Äôs computers. And though it has not disclosed what was taken, some news reports say the stolen goods may include new episodes of some series and also.‚Äù
Several news outlets, including Entertainment Weekly and Reuters, quoted an email from unidentified hackers claiming that they had taken 1.5 terabytes of information, including unspecified material from Game of Thrones.
One episode each of Ballers and Room 104 had been posted online but no episodes of Game of Thrones had yet appeared, according to Entertainment Weekly, which reported that the hackers may have taken a script or story treatment describing next week‚Äôs episode of the show. HBO has gone to extraordinary pains to protect the coming plot twists from Game of Thrones from leaking to the public.
The statement from HBO did not detail when the incident happened, and the company declined to comment on reports detailing the material stolen.
In its statement, the company said, .‚Äù
‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù is an exceptionally valuable property for HBO, and HBO has gone to unusual lengths to prevent episodes of the series from leaking online in advance of their air date.
In its seventh season, the series has become the highest-rated cable program across all platforms, a particularly notable figure for a series that airs on a premium cable network rather than a basic cable one. 12.7 million tuned in to HBO itself for the seventh-season premiere, and another 6 million watched on streaming platforms like HBO Go, which is available to the network‚Äôs subscribers. HBO covers a substantial part of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äô‚Äù hefty production costs by selling licenses to air the series overseas and monetizes the show with a huge range of official merchandise. And most importantly at a moment of transition for the cable model, ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù is so popular that even people who don‚Äôt have cable will subscribe to HBO‚Äôs stand-alone service, HBO Now, in order to see it.
Given those figures and revenue streams, HBO has a strong interest in making sure that viewers can‚Äôt get their hands on ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù without an HBO subscription. After the first four episodes of the show‚Äôs fifth season leaked, the network stopped sending advance screeners even to critics. For the show‚Äôs seventh season, the only chance at an early look at the first episode was a single screening in Los Angeles.

IFFR 2021
IFFR 2021BankGiro Loterij Audience Award
‚ÄúDon't shoot the piano player‚Äù were the famous words uttered by Dutchbat commander Thom Karremans before he toasted with Serbian general Ratko Mladiƒá in 1995. Shortly afterwards, Mladiƒá‚Äôs army committed genocide on the Muslim population of Srebrenica, killing over 8,000 people.
This moving, urgently needed drama by Jasmila ≈Ωbaniƒá meticulously dissects how this conflict went from bad to worse. ≈Ωbaniƒá‚Äôs previous films studied the lasting effects of the genocide on contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now, for the first time, the director focuses on the events themselves. The fictional Aida (Jasna ƒêuriƒçiƒá), an interpreter at the Dutch UN base in Srebrenica, feels torn. She has to translate Dutch orders for the locals, yet had lost faith in the UN soldiers‚Äô ability to de-escalate the conflict.
Within the online platform you can choose between subtitles in Dutch or English. Winner BankGiro Loterij Audience Award, IFFR 2021.The ultimate online slots experience

not been massively busy or anything (school holidays atm) but brain has been a bit of a sieve recently and finding it hard to keep up with basically anything that isn‚Äôt running so been half-planning blog posts then never getting round to finishing them so if this is a bit disjointed, that‚Äôs why! Thanks for still reading though if you are üôÇ
The main thing I wanted to write about in this blog post is frustration about ‚Äòrecovery‚Äô (or not being clinically ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô) and how that impacts over and over on what you want to do with your life but in order to write about that, it would be important to understand exactly what recovery ‚Äòis‚Äô and I realised I still don‚Äôt really know. On one level, it‚Äôs simple- the OED defines it as ‚ÄúA return to a normal state of health, mind, or strength‚Äù but that requires an implicit understanding of what ‚Äònormal‚Äô means and anyone with any experience at all of mental health issues in any context will know that that‚Äôs impossible to apply universally and doesn‚Äôt even exist as a yardstick to measure from.
Another definition would be the absence of symptoms or ‚Äòillness‚Äô but again that‚Äôs really difficult with mental health because everyone experiences symptoms of anxiety, depression, paranoia etc at some point and there‚Äôs no real way to decide what‚Äôs ‚Äònormal‚Äô and what‚Äôs ‚Äòillness‚Äô. I heard someone say recently that recovery isn‚Äôt the absence of symptoms but it‚Äôs when your symptoms don‚Äôt bother you any more, which I like as a concept and in everyday life that‚Äôs probably the most useful definition I‚Äôve come across but it still doesn‚Äôt help when you‚Äôre got a clinical diagnosis (or diagnoses) of specific mental health issues that you still show enough symptoms of to meet the criteria so can‚Äôt be classified as ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô even if you have managed to build up enough coping strategies or techniques that it doesn‚Äôt significantly impact your day-to-day life. I wrote a blog post about similar ideas a few months ago- see 21/05/07: probably the most significant day of my life. Reflections a decade on‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre interested. So complicated and frustrating!!
The reason I‚Äôm thinking about this so much at the moment (and this week in particular) is because I applied to foster a couple of months ago and found out yesterday that the application was unsuccessful because of my medical reference which wasn‚Äôt that surprising as I‚Äôve had issues with occupational health before when I‚Äôve applied for certain jobs and had the job offer withdrawn due to medical references, but it‚Äôs still really frustrating and disappointing. It‚Äôs partly the frustration of medical (mental health) issues continually getting in the way of things I‚Äôm really, genuinely passionate about and want to do with my life but also anger because I know I‚Äôm mentally more stable over the last few years than I have ever been and I really don‚Äôt know what more I can do to prove that to people. Anger at myself for not having managed to ‚Äòrecover‚Äô from a clinical perspective but also (horribly, because I hate feeling angry at other people) anger at the whole system and how restrictive it is. I know I could be a good foster carer and I genuinely would put the child‚Äôs needs above anything else. It‚Äôs what I try to do in every job I‚Äôve ever had- child/young person/service user‚Äôs needs are absolute priority and that‚Äôs the main ‚Äòrule‚Äô in my life and being totally honest, it‚Äôs the main reason I‚Äôm still trying to get rid of the horrible parts of my brain because it would be so much easier just to accept it and go along with everything the bitch in my head tells me but I try so hard not to and to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô as much as I can because of the impact that could have on kids I work with or who I‚Äôm close to. Which makes it doubly frustrating when as far as health professionals are concerned, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve not managed anything at all.
The other side to the situation is the fact that I really, really, REALLY want to have kids. I know it‚Äôs something most people want at some point in their lives and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work out for various reasons, but since I was really little I‚Äôve wanted lots of kids and I‚Äôd give up anything else to be able to have them. To me, it‚Äôs the point of being an adult and probably the only benefit to it. There‚Äôs already the complication of being asexual and never being in a relationship which is something I can‚Äôt see ever changing because I‚Äôve genuinely never experienced sexual or romantic attraction to anyone, and the idea of having sex with anyone makes me feel physically sick. Then there‚Äôs the other problem of having had an eating disorder for 17 years; I still have very irregular periods, I‚Äôm not sure how fertile I would be even if I was sexually active and I also know that with my current food intake, it could be potentially dangerous for an unborn baby so would have to make some drastic changes although I think that pregnancy would be a massive motivator for this because the baby would have to come first.
Adoption or fostering seemed the only option which is why it‚Äôs so upsetting that it‚Äôs not a possibility. The woman who assessed me was lovely and suggested voluntary organisations which support young people in care and I have applied to volunteer for, but it‚Äôs not the same as actually having the parent-style responsibility and relationship with the young person which is what I really, really want. It‚Äôs hard to describe because I don‚Äôt really know what the feeling is
it‚Äôs like an intense need to ‚Äògive‚Äô to and care for another person in a way that‚Äôs more than childcare or friendship- I want to be able to fully support someone and for their needs to be my absolute priority, which I know sounds weird and it‚Äôs not exactly what I‚Äôm trying to say but I have no idea how to phrase it.
I work with kids and have done for years which I absolutely love and I‚Äôve been lucky enough to be able to develop very close bonds with kids and young people, but it‚Äôs not the same as being the main caregiver for someone and having that sort of bond with them even though I know that parenting in any form is hard and isn‚Äôt always a positive experience. But even if it‚Äôs not, I still want to give it a try- I get really upset when people say things like ‚Äòit‚Äôs hard being a parent, you‚Äôre lucky you can give the kids back, you wouldn‚Äôt feel like that if you had your own‚Äô etc because actually I WANT the challenges of parenthood, I hate having to ‚Äògive kids back‚Äô and (I know this is horrible) I get really, really jealous of parents‚Äô relationships with their kids even when they‚Äôre arguing because I really want that sort of bond and to know that even if someone is angry at you at that particular moment, you‚Äôre still their parent and there‚Äôs still an unconditional bond there which won‚Äôt go away just because they‚Äôre upset. I‚Äôm not being naive or thinking that parenting is easy or anything like that; I just really, really want to be a parent. I‚Äôm 30 now and have wanted kids for years, and I‚Äôm starting to realise I probably won‚Äôt ever have them which hurts so much just to think about and I really, really don‚Äôt want it to be true.
I also know though that it would be selfish to go through with the fostering application knowing that it could be potentially damaging for a child or young person who‚Äôs already vulnerable to have a foster carer with (apparently) clinically significant mental health issues so I have to respect and accept the decision of fostering services even though I am really upset about it. I‚Äôm not angry with them at all- they need to prioritise the needs of young people and I completely understand that, but I am frustrated about the system and how I‚Äôm seen as not ‚Äúmentally stable‚Äù enough to be a foster carer. The main issues brought up in the medical report and in discussion with fostering services were emotion regulation issues relating to ASD (the GP said that he wasn‚Äôt confident I‚Äôd be able to have enough emotional empathy or understanding to fully support a child with emotional issues) and having a ‚Äúlong-standing eating disorder‚Äù which is a factor that has impacted on occupational health in the past and I have no idea what I‚Äôm meant to be about it. Yes, I have had an eating disorder for the last 17 years but I haven‚Äôt been an inpatient in ten years, I eat regularly even if it is only certain foods and I am a ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô weight.
I know I still have some issues around food and eating but it‚Äôs definitely not obvious and it‚Äôs mostly the bitch in my head shouting at me 24/7 which is the problem and not the actual behavioural/physical side which I‚Äôve learnt to manage pretty well over the last few years and I‚Äôm not exactly going to vocalise the bitch‚Äôs words to a young person I‚Äôm caring for. And to me, it‚Äôs not as potentially risky as someone who drinks alcohol regularly or smokes (for example) which is totally socially acceptable. It‚Äôs also frustrating because ED services won‚Äôt work with me anymore because it‚Äôs ‚Äòchronic‚Äô and my weight‚Äôs stable so I don‚Äôt meet the criteria for ED services but it‚Äôs still seen as a medical issue that stops me from being able to do things that I‚Äôm most passionate about like having/looking after children, working with young people in mental health services or being a teacher? I have no idea what the solution is and if anyone has any experience of this, please feel free to email me on rainbowsandrecovery@gmail.com!
Really sorry that this seems to have been a mostly ranting post and haven‚Äôt even got round to trying to define ‚Äòrecovery‚Äô properly yet. Will shut up now and save that for another post‚Ä¶ Thanks for reading üôÇOur Team

Lympne Zoo/Port Lympne Reserve/Port Lympne Wild Animal Park
Lympne Zoo is located new Hythe in Kent and is set in 600 acres of Kent countryside. It incorporates the historic mansion and landscaped gardens designed by architect Sir Herbert Baker for Sir Philip Sassoon during the first World War.
I had the pleasure and privilege to be invited along by a friend of mine, who was going to be a keeper for the day. (They do allow people to do so at a cost, and it's all properly supervised and safely carried out).
The park is large, with many enclosures. As part of the day (inclusive in the price) you may go on one of the excursions around the park. These are properly enclosed vehicles, pulled by large lorries, and which allow visitors amazing access to the animals. It is well worth a visit.Kentish Photography - Living Still Images15 Results Found

This Drunkard‚Äôs Path mini is all I have to show for this week.
I decided to make it because I came across TNT Thursday recently and I thought (this is TTT as well!) it was a great idea. I usually aim to try something new each time I quilt, which hasn‚Äôt been too hard for me so far because I‚Äôm quite a newbie at quilting and not particularly prolific. I like to work like like this because it‚Äôs a good learning curve and gives me an excuse for not being perfect ‚Äì who expects to make something perfect on their first attempt! Perhaps the longer I go on the harder it will be to find new things. Or perhaps, if I go on forever there will be always more to learn ‚Äì I hope so. The drunkards path mini was my first attempt at drunkard‚Äôs path blocks (and first curves except my Christmas table runner swap). It was also the first time I tried hand quilting solely for texture, rather than a sort of embroidery. I used a fairly random all-over running stitch and I found the coloured segments ended up a bit bulgy although they had started flat before the quilting‚Ä¶I still have a lot to discover before I can quilt with intent, rather than just stitching and seeing what happens.
What have you been thinking about this week? Have you tried something new?

Lava Shells are Clam Shells harvested from the Pacific Ocean. Islanders would use them for food and then throw them away. PerfectSense Professionals found a way to recycle them into the world's most powerful heated massage tool. These shells require no electricity or equipment to heat, they are filled with a self-heated technology and heat for up to 45-minutes.
Melting Experience
When using the Lava shell you will experience a deeper heat than you would with Hot Stones. Unlike Hot Stones the Lava Shells sustain heat for up to 45-minutes. Hot Stones stay hot to warm momentarily. When you incorporate Lava Shells to your massage you are creating a melting experience for your body. The heat opens up the muscular tissue and allows fresh blood flow through vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels). Incorporate Lava Shells into a 60 or 90 minute full body massage and melt your cares away! They are simply the best in my opinion! For more about the Lava Shell Product go to:
Benefits of Lava Shell Massage
An increase in extension of soft tissues
Removal of toxins from cells
Enhanced blood flow
Increased function of tissue cells

The benefits of breast milk are well known. Mothers of course want to give their babies the very best. But, the reality is that not every mother can breastfeed, either exclusively or at all.
Human milk, the only substance that evolved to both feed and protect us, however seems to contain a treasure trove of medicines just now being unlocked by scientists.
At the forefront of breast milk‚Äôs potential lies a diverse set of sugar molecules called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO).
Milk contains a treasure trove of bio-active molecules
In addition to nourishing a baby with milk fats, proteins and ordinary sugars such as lactose, breast milk harbors complex HMO sugars that a newborn largely cannot digest.
These Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) are diverse, biologically active components that beneficially modulate the infant microbiota as well as gut health, immune system, and support neurological development.
Over 150 types of these oligosaccharides, formed by various combinations of five basic sugars help cultivate an infant‚Äôs microbial garden and provide many indirect benefits.
‚ÄúPrebiotic effect: feeding the good guys‚Äù
Healthy, full-term, breast-fed infants tend to have a gut microbiota dominated by various species of the oligosaccharide-consumer Bifidobacterium.
These ‚Äògood‚Äô bacteria are consuming some of the Human Milk Oligosaccharides, giving the good guys a leg up over the less desirable ones.
Newborns with a healthy gut microbiome are apt to thrive and may more easily fend off potentially pathogenic microbes and viruses.
More than prebiotics ‚Ä¶
Advanced defense against bad microbes
Disease causing microbes can attach themselves onto cells of a newborn‚Äôs intestines by binding to sugar-rich receptors that cover these cells. Once attached, the pathogens can colonize and infect the tissues.
But Human Milk Oligosaccharides found in breast milk can act as decoys, snagging undesirables and tagging them for removal. Another defense involves oligosaccharides inducing cells to populate their surfaces with unwelcoming receptors by modifying which genes get switched on in the cell nucleus. This thwarts pathogen binding.
Breast milk vs. cow‚Äôs milk oligosaccharides
Oligosaccharides are at least 20 times more abundant in human breast milk than of cow‚Äôs milk, making it difficult to use cows as a source of these protective sugars.
But also many of the oligosaccharide structures found in human milk are essentially absent or exist in only trace amounts in bovine milk.
Fucose, a monosaccharide that in human milk adorns up to 70 percent of oligosaccharides, tending to lend them pathogen-blocking powers. The fucosyllactoses, most notably 2‚Ä≤-fucosyllactose are therefore a prime target for large scale production to make infant formula much more like breast milk.
The Inbiose difference ‚Ä¶
Inbiose is already making it possible to produce large quantities of HMOs enabling supplementation to infant formula, with the goal of supporting the gut microbiota composition and developmental outcomes more similar to that of the breastfed infant.

Daniel Fusco‚Äôs new book, Honestly, gets straight to the heart of the matter when he writes at the outset, ‚ÄúBut life‚Äôs messiness isn‚Äôt just the negative headlines‚Äîit‚Äôs everything that keeps us unbalanced. Life is extraordinarily unpredictable. Things happen that we can‚Äôt fathom‚Äîsome of which we choose, and some of which are chosen for us.‚Äù
With this premise as a backdrop, Honestly, looks at the book of Ephesians to the rhythm of John Coltrane‚Äôs legendary album, ‚ÄúA Love Supreme‚Äù.
Daniel Fusco‚Äôs musical background as a bass player and lover of all things Coltrane sets the content of the book in the four movements of Coltrane‚Äôs album: Acknowledgement, Resolution, Pursuance, and Psalm.
If you are a musician, you‚Äôll love the upbeat language and the structure of each section. Questions at the end of each section of the four parts are labeled ‚Äúriffing‚Äù and each of the parts‚Äô summaries is entitled ‚Äúcoda‚Äù.
Even if you have never been a musician or a lover of Coltrane, you will discover a no nonsense journey of walking through the messiness of life with Jesus minus easy religious platitudes as Fusco makes it clear that life will always be messy.
Acknowledgment looks at the need to face the reality of the mess both outside of us and within us. It looks at the straight hard truth that when the messiness of life collides with the God who reigns over the mess, we have questions. The author gives great scriptural examples such as what Mary and Martha experience when Jesus doesn‚Äôt show up when their brother, Lazarus, is sick.
‚ÄúLife is messy, and sometimes it feels like Jesus is the one doing the messing.‚Äù
Fusco doesn‚Äôt shy away from acknowledging that the Lord‚Äôs purposes and plans sometimes don‚Äôt run in the same direction as our desires. He also offers the remedy for such mess as grace and peace from Paul‚Äôs words in Ephesians 1:2. I especially loved how he broadened my understanding of the word peace.
Fusco shares that peace is a more complicated than thinking it is just the absence of conflict. He states, ‚ÄúThe best way to understand biblical peace is with the Hebrew word shalom, which means both ‚Äúpeace‚Äù and ‚Äúto join.‚Äù The implication is that when something is separated, or broken, it needs to be fixed.‚Äù So really shalom is putting things back together and isn‚Äôt that what we need when we are broken by the messiness of life?
Acknowledgment ends with some of these words by the author:
‚ÄúSo instead of using a magic wand to wave away all our external trouble, God‚Äôs after something deeper. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôre all deeply familiar with: a journey. Journeys have ups and downs, highs and lows. But we take them for a reason: to get somewhere we want to be.‚Äù
Entering Part ll, Resolution, Fusco brings us the good news of the resurrection and the truth that Jesus makes dead people (those lost to sin) alive. He also reminds us that some of the messiness of life is pure evil and that is when Jesus, the warrior, brings all authority in heaven and earth to confront it.
Nevertheless, in this life, the mess will never go away. Life means walking through the mess with Jesus at our side.
When we arrive at Part lll, Pursuance, Fusco brings us the reminder and hope that Jesus rules over the mess. Jesus also works in and through the mess outside of us as well as within us. As Fusco says,
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go around the mess because the mess is everywhere: relationships, jobs, hobbies, churches, governments, nature, school‚Äù
Even as Ephesians talks about our walk with the Lord, Fusco uses his musician‚Äôs background when he says, ‚ÄúAs we walk the bass line of our lives, we either create a context in which others around us can flourish, or we detract from their opportunity to do that.‚Äù
Part IV, Psalm, the author takes us to the foundation of it all: love. Near the end he quotes John Coltrane:
‚ÄúMay we never forget that in the sunshine of our lives, through the storm and after the rain‚Äîit is all with God‚Äîin all ways and forever.‚Äù
This book can appeal to many, but would uniquely speak to musicians!
The author, Daniel Fusco, is lead pastor of Crossroads Community Church in Vancouver, Washington.

Earthquake catalogs are probably the most informative data source about spatiotemporal seismicity evolution. The catalog quality in one of the most active seismogenic zones in the world, Japan, is excellent, although changes in quality arising, for example, from an evolving network are clearly present. Here, we seek the best estimate for the largest expected earthquake in a given future time interval from a combination of historic and instrumental earthquake catalogs. We extend the technique introduced by Z√∂ller et al. (2013) to estimate the maximum magnitude in a time window of length Tf for earthquake catalogs with varying level of completeness. In particular, we consider the case in which two types of catalogs are available: a historic catalog and an instrumental catalog. This leads to competing interests with respect to the estimation of the two parameters from the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law, the b‚Äêvalue and the event rate Œª above a given lower‚Äêmagnitude threshold (the a‚Äêvalue). The b‚Äêvalue is estimated most precisely from the frequently occurring small earthquakes; however, the tendency of small events to cluster in aftershocks, swarms, etc. violates the assumption of a Poisson process that is used for the estimation of Œª. We suggest addressing conflict by estimating b solely from instrumental seismicity and using large magnitude events from historic catalogs for the earthquake rate estimation. Applying the method to Japan, there is a probability of about 20% that the maximum expected magnitude during any future time interval of length Tf=30 years is m‚â•9.0. Studies of different subregions in Japan indicates high probabilities for M 8 earthquakes along the Tohoku arc and relatively low probabilities in the Tokai, Tonankai, and Nankai region. Finally, for scenarios related to long‚Äêtime horizons and high‚Äêconfidence levels, the maximum expected magnitude will be around 10..

Hugo Mariano Pavone scored twice through the first 23 minutes, but a late first half goal by Benny Feilhaber for the visitors made for an interesting second half, supposedly. Pavone completed his hat trick in the 55th minute to give Cruz Azul the edge once more, before the goals from Mauro Formica and Gimenez finished the job, sending Kansas City back home in humiliating fashion.

Racism exists everywhere. What are practical actions global business professionals can take against racism? How can we create safe spaces and move from sympathy to effective change for a racially just workplace?
The first mistake as a global business leader would be to assume that the trauma of George Floyd‚Äôs painful murder is restricted to the US. The second mistake would be to assume that it does not affect you or your business. And the third mistake would be to feel powerless, even though there is so much we can do in business to stand up against racism.
Meanwhile, across the globe, millions of Black people and their rights advocates are pained, heartbroken, angry and exhausted. The wounds of racial injustice towards Black people are not new, but centuries-old.
And yet, Black professionals globally are expected to just deal with this collective trauma, part of the systemic and institutional racism pervading our structures, and to show up to work with a positive and productive attitude as if nothing happened.
While a few companies are starting to express their solidarity, many are still silent, often out of fear of saying the wrong thing. But corporate silence and inaction are part of the problem. As leaders across all levels, there is a responsibility to affirm the psychological and physical safety of Black professionals at work, and to use one‚Äôs privilege to make a difference against all racism.
So how can we address these issues, especially as non-Black professionals in a global workforce? Remember though, you don‚Äôt need to be a leader to make a difference.
1. What not to say
- Don‚Äôt start with saying you can‚Äôt believe what‚Äôs happening or that it can‚Äôt be real. This is offensive as these incidents are not new, as public academic Rachel Cargle highlights on Instagram.
- Don‚Äôt ask Black people to educate you or advocate for justice initiatives, unless you hire them to do so. Black people are tired of carrying the burden of solving problems just because you‚Äôre not putting in the work yourself. So keep reading here, keep learning.
- Don‚Äôt tell Black people how to feel or that they are too aggressive / emotional / sensitive when they talk about the issue. This is called tone policing and should be avoided.
- Don‚Äôt say you don‚Äôt see colour, unless you are actually colour-blind of course. Acknowledge our differences as human beings, and along with that, the hardships Black people face because of those differences. The goal is not to stop seeing colour, but to stop making decisions based on colour. Otherwise, how can we fix a problem (racism), if we don‚Äôt see it in the first place? Great graphic here.
- Don‚Äôt say all lives matter. Of course they do and saying Black Lives Matter is not contradicting that. Black Lives Matter simply puts focus on who is currently hurting the most and who has not yet fully been included in ‚Äúall lives‚Äù. See this burning house analogy video and this NYT article.
- Don‚Äôt become too defensive. Addressing these issues is not a personal attack on you. When talking about white privilege, for instance, it‚Äôs not judging you or negating your hardships; it simply points out that your hardships are not based on the colour of your skin. As another example, refrain from focusing on the riots and civil unrest, if you don‚Äôt understand their reason. Instead, redirect your focus to the actual problem of systemic racism.

[SWIPE] For the month of June, we will get real, raw, honest and uncomfortable about our biases. Nothing is off limits. In order to rid the world of the ugliness of racism, many people need to come to terms with their complicity in white supremacy and oppression. #letstalkbias #blacklivesmatter
2. Listen & educate yourself as an individual
- This is not about you. Listen, show empathy, and if you need help, hire professionals. And remember: ‚ÄúAnti-racism work is not self-improvement work for white people. It doesn‚Äôt end when white people feel better, it ends when ‚Äòblack people‚Äô are liberated.‚Äù Rachel Cargle
- Acknowledge your privilege. It all starts with some uncomfortable introspection, no matter how well-meaning you are. Be honest to yourself. How are you profiting from white supremacy and white privilege? Are you aware of the struggles of Black people? How do you perceive Black people, at work, on the street, as friends, romantically? Not just POC; Black people specifically.
- Educate yourself on racism and what you can do to change it. Reading / watching / listening list below. You can also do this in a group setting to hold each other accountable.
- Want some guidance? You can follow Tayo Rockson‚Äôs #LetsTalkBias challenge in June for daily reflections and weekly lives: LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, his blog, and podcast, so follow along and let‚Äôs get to work!
- You will say and do the wrong thing. When you are called out on it, apologise, learn and move forward. ‚ÄúThe beauty of anti-racism is that you don‚Äôt have to pretend to be free of racism to be an anti-racist. Anti-racism is the commitment to fight racism wherever you find it, including in yourself. And that‚Äôs the only way forward.‚Äù Ijemona Oluo.

3. Create safe spaces at work
- Don‚Äôt ignore what‚Äôs happening. Take initiative and promote real conversations about racism. If you‚Äôre not in a leading position, consider using this template letter to contact your manager and ask for accountability.
- Check in and create safe spaces for your Black colleagues. As a leader, you don‚Äôt need to be the hero here. Be effective: Acknowledge what‚Äôs happening and get the ball rolling by starting the conversation.
- Lead the conversation for the whole team and don‚Äôt single out Black colleagues in front of everyone to ask how they are or what you should do. This only puts them on the spot. Instead, approach your whole team to address what‚Äôs been going on. Acknowledge how it can be hard to separate these things from work and share what you hope to achieve. Then open up an hour in your schedule for private meetings. Let your team know that you care and that your door is always open to talk and hear suggestions. Examples of what to say here.
- Consider a mental health break for your Black employees. They may have been crying, grieving and feeling anger and loss. You can ask how they are and if they have all they need, individually, but if they don‚Äôt want to talk, that‚Äôs okay too. Everyone is affected differently. Understand if they are quiet at work and offer them a break.
4. Speak up and amplify Black voices
- Speak up publicly to let your Black colleagues, clients, stakeholders and partners know you stand with them. Make your white network understand that silence is part of the problem. Have the conversations at the dinner table too. We‚Äôre keeping with our motto here: Using our privilege to make a difference.
- Speak out when you hear racist comments and jokes, even if it‚Äôs from your CEO or client. Yes, this requires courage, but that‚Äôs a good thing, isn‚Äôt it?
- Be vocal about lack of diversity, inclusion and representation. Speak up for Black colleagues passed over for promotions, for example. Your voice matters.
- Use your privilege and voice to amplify other voices and share spaces and opportunities. Amplify stories of Black people by liking, sharing, commenting, and provide larger platforms for people who are speaking out. Be inclusive online, at work, at events.
- Support the people you are learning from. Buy books from Black authors. Share their work.
- Donate to organizations fighting for the cause and strengthen initiatives across sectors.
In moments of injustice, Danielle adds, your voice needs to be heard, especially in your sphere of influence. You don‚Äôt have to wait until you‚Äôve amplified before you speak out.
5. Transform long-term: Business taking action against racism
- Create a corporate culture of understanding. Your non-Black employees should be aware too. How are you reminding them about bias? What can your company do against racism and to promote justice in the community? Find creative solutions together. It takes discomfort to truly address these issues, but the reward ‚Äî maximizing everyone‚Äôs potential at a safe workplace and increasing engagement with real meaning ‚Äî is worth it.
- Understand the microaggressions going on within your company. Have you ever considered this issue? How is it affecting your employee motivation and retention? How are you creating psychologically safe spaces?
- Practise Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in your organization and invest in training. Inclusion not only fosters innovation and motivation, but is a human rights issue.
- Diversify your talent. What are you doing to find, promote, reward and value diverse talent? This is a great long-term solution for business to take action against racism. Work harder to support initiatives and seek out a diverse workforce from junior recruitment to leadership succession.
7. Stay vocal about racial injustice
- Once the voices on social media get quiet again, don‚Äôt stop your efforts. Unlearning racism and biases and standing up for justice is a life-long commitment, and one worth the effort, both professionally and personally. You will not only find more justice, but more empathy, compassion and strength in your life and the lives around you.
Promoting racial justice is not restricted to the US and certainly not to Black people. Business can take action against racism too. Leaders globally on every level can stand up for equal rights and equal opportunities, starting from within themselves.
While it is a time for grief, it is also a time for change.
What will you do?

Trackbacks/PingbacksNowadays, the signing of certain legal documents governing people‚Äôs matrimony is common in the United States, and Missouri is not an exception. The Missouri prenuptial agreement form is a popular example.
Regardless of the state, prenuptial agreements relate to partners‚Äô ownership of properties and serve various purposes. With a free printable prenuptial agreement form, also referred to as a prenup, you can avoid a time-consuming procedure of splitting properties if your marriage comes to an end.

Your valid, lawyer-approved document is ready
You can also define how to dispose of assets if you or your partner dies or becomes disabled due to severe illness or an accident. Finally, these agreements can regulate your daily income and expenses if you include related provisions in the document.
Among the matters people usually cover in such agreements, one may find:
While prenuptial agreements outline every detail about your finances and tangible items, they never regulate children‚Äôs support and parenting. If the marriage ends, these issues are decided in court.
There has been a recent trend towards the creation of prenups. Before the nineties, some states considered such agreements void. Now, these legal papers are an acceptable way of protecting your properties, especially if you are significantly wealthier than your partner or you both own multiple assets and have incurred numerous debts.
When partners finish working on the template, both of them have to sign the form. Although it is rare, some states require a notary public agent to verify the form to make it effective. Another option is to call a witness to sign the document. If signatories are willing to correct the document, they can sign additional papers that prove their wish and describe the corrections.
With our form-building software, you can generate the Missouri prenuptial agreement form effortlessly. After getting the file, the only thing you should do is define the conditions that suit you as a family.
Remember that you should create your agreement in conformity with state law. Proceed to the next part to get an overview of the Missouri state laws on the topic.
Popular Local Prenuptial Agreement Forms
Laws describing prenuptial agreements in Missouri are brief since the state has not approved the uniform act regulating such documents, commonly enforceable in many other American states. So, there are only a couple of provisions linked to prenups. Some norms are taken from court precedents.
Section 451.220 of the Missouri Revised Statutes makes it mandatory for future spouses to sign prenuptial agreements, notarize them, and ask at least one witness to append their signature.
A prenuptial agreement in Missouri is enforceable if:
The agreement becomes valid once a couple officially gets married.
You may face the court‚Äôs refusal to consider your contract if it contradicts the law in any way. Another reason to void the contract is its unconscionability.
As we have stated before, your prenup may cover only the matters linked to your properties or liabilities. These matters include everything regarding:
Bear in mind that no provision related to your children can be added to such an agreement.

Van Halen is to Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll as Cadillac is to automobiles. It is one of the most popular bands ever to perform in the country, and is still going strong 40 years later. It is known as one of the best bands ever to come from a garage-band background. Founded by brothers Eddie and Alex Van Halen in their home in Pasadena, California in 1972, the band was one of the top rock acts in the country, and is as popular today as it was then.
Eddie Van Halen is considered one of the best lead guitarists in the history of music by many of his peers, while Alex was a superior drummer. Together, they formed the nucleus of the popular band that also included bass guitarist, Michael Anthony, and vocalist, David Lee Roth. The brothers were born in the Netherlands, and immigrated to the United States when they were children. The two were inseparable, and developed an interest in music in the mid-60s. They formed the band in 1972, using the name Genesis. They later changed the name to Mammoth when Eddie discovered Genesis was already in use. Eventually they renamed the band Van Halen.
According to popular legend, Van Halen was discovered by Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss, while they were performing at Gazzarri‚Äôs on the Strip, a popular spot for heavy metal rock bands in the 70s. They continued to play at gigs throughout Southern California when they released their self-titled debut album Van Halen in 1978. The album peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard list, and the band never looked back. Van Halen‚Äôs greatest commercial success was from 1978 through 1985, but their albums continue to sell. It has garnered a cult-like following from several, younger generations of American Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll fans.AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 23, 2021 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ ‚Äî Kipp Marshall, associate attorney, was admitted to the State Bar of Texas in 2008, and the State Bar of New Mexico in 2020.

Bluehost Testimonial
Bluehost is just one of the greatest host business in the world, getting both massive advertising support from the business itself and also affiliate online marketers that promote it.
It actually is an enormous company, that has been around for a very long time, has a huge credibility, and is definitely one of the leading options when it concerns webhosting (definitely within the leading 3, a minimum of in my book).
However what is it exactly, and should you obtain its services?
Learn More About Can You Ahve Multi Site On Bluehost Here ->
Today, I will certainly address all there is you need to understand, given that you are a blog writer or a business owner who is looking for a host, as well as doesn‚Äôt recognize where to get started, because it‚Äôs a terrific solution for that target market in general.
Allow‚Äôs envision, you want to organize your sites and make them noticeable. Okay?
You currently have your domain name (which is your website destination or LINK) now you intend to ‚Äúturn the lights on‚Äù. Can You Ahve Multi Site On Bluehost
You require some holding‚Ä¶
To achieve all of this, and to make your website noticeable, you require what is called a ‚Äúserver‚Äù. A server is a black box, or device, that saves all your internet site data (data such as pictures, texts, video clips, web links, plugins, and also other info).
Currently, this server, has to be on at all times and it needs to be attached to the web 100% of the time (I‚Äôll be stating something called ‚Äúdowntime‚Äù in the future).
In addition, it also requires (without getting too fancy and also right into details) a file transfer protocol typically known as FTP, so it can show internet internet browsers your internet site in its designated type.
All these things are either pricey, or require a high degree of technological ability (or both), to create and keep. And you can entirely go out there and also discover these things by yourself and also established them up ‚Ä¶ yet what regarding rather than you getting as well as maintaining one ‚Ä¶ why not just ‚Äúleasing holding‚Äù rather?
This is where Bluehost is available in. You rent their web servers (called Shared Hosting) as well as you introduce a web site making use of those web servers.
Given that Bluehost maintains all your data, the business likewise permits you to set up your content monitoring systems (CMS, for brief) such as WordPress for you. WordPress is an incredibly preferred CMS ‚Ä¶ so it simply makes good sense to have that choice readily available (nearly every hosting company currently has this choice also).
In other words, you no more require to set-up a server and afterwards integrate a software where you can build your content, independently. It is already rolled into one package.
Is it risk-free to have Bluehost care for your web sites?
Well ‚Ä¶ picture if your web server is in your home. hassles away, and takes care of whatever technological: Pay your server ‚Äúlease‚Äù, and also they will certainly take care of everything. As well as as soon as you acquire the solution, you can after that start focusing on adding content to your web site, or you can place your initiative right into your advertising and marketing projects.
What Services Do You Get From Bluehost?
Bluehost supplies a myriad of various services, but the key one is hosting obviously.
The organizing itself, is of various kinds incidentally. You can lease a common web server, have a devoted server, or likewise a digitalprivate web server.
For the objective of this Bluehost evaluation, we will concentrate on hosting services and other solutions, that a blogger or an on-line business owner would need, as opposed to go unfathomable right into the bunny hole and also talk about the other solutions, that are targeted at even more knowledgeable individuals.

Last week OnePlus finally outed the first beta build of Android 9 Pie for its smartphones from 2017, the 5 and 5T. And now the company is rolling out a new beta release for the duo, arriving as OxygenOS Open Beta 23 or 21, depending on which device you have.
This is going out to the people who have joined the OnePlus beta track. If you've already flashed the previous Open Beta, you will receive the new build as an over-the-air update. Alternatively, if you'd like to switch from stable Oreo to this release, follow the instructions on this page - but keep in mind that these builds may not be very stable and could contain bugs.
What's more, note that once you migrate to the beta path, you will no longer receive the regular Official Stable OTAs. Moving back to that path requires a full install and clean flash with a full wipe of your data.
The newest Android Pie beta for the OnePlus 5 and 5T comes with the December security patches, optimizations for Face Unlock, and improved color adaptation for the navigation bar. Additionally, issues with the custom accent color not getting applied every second try have been fixed, as have problems with scrolling in the app drawer.Investing in real estate is always a good idea even if the market fluctuates every now and then. You can make good money out of your properties; for example, offer office space for rent situated in a bustling city or perhaps a lovely looking home in the suburbs. The rent rates would vary depending on several factors, such as location and amenities, just to name a few. The average home price in Queensland is at $490,000, while commercial properties are also getting a good deal primarily with the high demand for spaces for rent or lease.

Setting the right rental price can be a challenge, especially when you do not know much about the matter in the first place. Well, here‚Äôs a quick guide on how you can accurately place a rental value on your property:
- Find out the current worth of your property in the market. Keep in mind that the amount can be different from the original amount that you paid for since the real estate market can change from time to time. You can get such information online, or you can hire a property appraiser to give you an accurate assessment.
- Research on rental rates in your area and then assign a relative value on your property. Look out for comparables in the same area and also assess the amenities or features of your rental property.
Factors Affecting the Value of Rental Property
1. Location
This is by far the most important factor that can influence the value of any property. As they say, location is the key, which means that you cannot set a higher rental rate in areas where there is little to no foot traffic.
2. Amenities or Features
If your rental property has many amenities included, then you have the advantage to set a higher rental rate provided that these amenities are not considered very common in most locations.
3. Overall Condition
A well-maintained property can fetch for a good price compared to a unit that has seen better days.
Putting a good price that benefits both you and your future tenants or buyers is what makes real estate. And knowing the full potential of your property not just allows you know what you can do with your property, but it also gives you a better idea of whether or not you should sell it or put it up for rent.

Why Aren‚Äôt As Bad As You Think
What I Can Teach You AboutAppetite busters
off with a glass of water and then see how you feel after 15 minutes.
- Protein rich breakfast. Protein keeps you feeling fuller for longer. and you could end up eating 267 fewer calories during the day. (That‚Äôs what happened on days when St. Louis University researchers gave overweight women a high protein breakfast)
- Out of sight out of mind. Keep the most tempting foods out of reach (or best of all, out of the house). I regularly have some baked goodies for the children‚Äôs lunchboxes. If the box sits on the counter (next to the kettle!), I‚Äôm constantly nibbling. If it‚Äôs in the pantry, I forget out it.
- Sleep on it. People who don‚Äôt get enough ZZZs experience hormonal fluctuations that can increase appetite. Also, when you‚Äôre tired, you‚Äôre more likely to reach for that sugar hit to keep you going.
- Trick it. Scientists scanned the brains of people eating different foods and found that the brain reacts to fat in the mouth in much the same way that it responds to a pleasant aroma. So if you feel a craving coming on, apply your favorite scent. It really works ‚Äì sometimes just taking a few deep breaths as you walk past the bakery (my weakness) is enough to satisfy you.
- Don‚Äôt over fill your plate. The more food that‚Äôs in front of you, the more you‚Äôll eat. So at a restaurant, try ordering starter sized portions or take left overs home for lunch the next day. At home ‚Äì serve up in the kitchen and then resist going back for seconds.
- Put it under the lights. You consume fewer calories at a well-lit table.
- Talk it down. Keep the conversation going at the dinner table ‚Äì it‚Äôs rude to talk with your mouth full so it‚Äôll slow you down (and it‚Äôs a great way for the family to catch up at the end of the day) We do ‚Äúwhat was your best thing and worst thing of the day and what are you looking forward to tomorrow‚Äù.
- Sit down to eat and eat consciously ‚Äì if you sit down with a plate every time you eat, you‚Äôll notice what you‚Äôre eating, enjoy it more and get more satisfaction. If snack while you‚Äôre standing around doing other things, you don‚Äôt notice what you‚Äôre eating. This = extra calories without the satisfaction.
- Satisfy it with soup. Start your meal with about a cup of vegetable soup (avoid the creamy variety) and you‚Äôll eat about 20% fewer calories overall.
- Limited choice. Have you ever noticed at a BBQ ‚Äì put out 4 salads, a potato dish and sausages and meat and everyone tries a bit of everything. Serve just 2 salads, one meat and potato/carb dish and everyone still eats a bit of everything, but less overall.
Oh, and one more thing ‚Äì this is always worth repeating. Go for unprocessed foods as much as possible and choose lots of different colours (i.e. lots of veggies)

I understand the challenge is the high volatility in Ethereum network congestion, and for some transactions the app estimation for gas allocation is not enough.
Not many people understand that, if they increase the gas allocation limit, it returns the unused portion. So there is no harm in setting the limit x2 or x3 the estimate.
I recommend team investigates and increase the gas allocation estimates of app with a fat safety factor and add a note along the lines: estimate gas usage = X, Required gas allocation to execute transaction = X + alpha, Unused gas will be returned back.
If want to be really fancy, the safety factory can be current estimate + 1.5 x standard deviation of last 1 hour.
Even though team has been returning the lost fee (excellent gesture), it leaves bad tastes for users when they see money being lost. Also, having to go through return process is a distraction for the team, which can be avoided.Leadership

What was advertised in a colonial American newspaper 250 years ago this week?
‚ÄúPowder horns.‚Äù
The ‚ÄúPowder horns‚Äù near the end of Joseph and William Russell‚Äôs full-page advertisement made me curious. I discovered that a powder horn was used for holding gun powder (which the Russells also sold).
Many powder horns from this period have intricate engravings on them. Some people took up horn carving as an occupation. One of the best-known horn carvers of this time period was Jacob Gay, who often carved his initials onto the powder horns he created. Historians are now able to spot the artwork he created by the ‚ÄúJ G‚Äù engraved on a powder horn.
Many powder horns have specific styles based on the period they were made and the battles that occurred at that time. Powder horns decorated just before and during the American Revolution often indicated New England‚Äôs anti-British feelings. Also, many of the engraved horns depicted battles fought during the Revolution. In addition to being used to reflect battles, powder horn engravings were also expressive of camp life during the Revolution.
In the midst of the Revolution, many powder horns were also used as forms of identification. Following the Battles of Lexington and Concord, many soldiers began engraving their names or initials on their powder horns. As a result, historians are now able to identify many of the soldiers who fought in battles of the Revolution.
For more information and examples, see William H. Guthman‚Äôs ‚ÄúPowder Horns Carved in the Provincial Manner, 1744-1777.‚Äù
**********
ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY: Carl Robert Keyes
Joseph and William Russell‚Äôs full-page advertisement, the first published in the Providence Gazette, first appeared three months earlier, on November 22, 1766. Since then, it ran multiple times, either because the Russells were keen on advertising or because Mary Goddard and Company needed any sort of content to fill the pages when faced with the combination of a dearth of new paid notices and post riders carrying news from other colonies chronically arriving too late for any of it to appear in the current issue. As a result, residents of Providence and readers of the newspaper printed there were exposed to the Russells‚Äô full-page advertisement on many occasions.
Due to the prominence and frequency it appeared in late 1766 and early 1767, this advertisement has also reappears fairly regularly as a point of reference when examining other paid notices in the Providence Gazette ‚Äì or trying to explain the absence of those notices. While the methodology for the project, when strictly observed, prohibits featuring this advertisement a second time, there‚Äôs room for making exceptions when doing so yields productive observations about advertising practices and consumer culture in eighteenth-century America.
Shannon is the first student in my Revolutionary America class to take on responsibilities for guest curating the Adverts 250 Project. In turn, this is the first time students in that class have encountered the Russells‚Äô advertisement, giving us an opportunity to discuss what was possible when it came to advertising in the revolutionary era compared to what was much more common. Revisiting this advertisement serves a second pedagogical purpose. For her work in preparing today‚Äôs entry, Shannon considered the variety of goods listed in this lengthy advertisement before choosing one to examine in greater detail. In the end, she took a closer look at an item not previously incorporated into the Adverts 250 Project, simultaneously expanding her own knowledge about an aspect of early American material culture and enhancing the project.
Finally, by choosing this advertisement Shannon contributes to an ongoing analysis of the advertising content of the Providence Gazette. This advertisement repeatedly occupied one-quarter of the space in any issue in which it appeared, quite a bit of space for the printers to yield. As mentioned above, Goddard and Company seemed to have difficulty attracting advertisers, especially when comparing their newspaper to counterparts published in Boston, Charleston, New York, and Philadelphia. That is a story that could not be told if the Russells‚Äô full-page advertisement were permanently excluded from further consideration simply because the Adverts 250 Project previously featured it.The latest voting numbers for the MLB All Star Game were released over the weekend and the race in the American League is certainly heating up. Third baseman Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers is reigning supreme with 4,337,223 votes and on pace to set record numbers for overall votes. Currently Josh Hamilton holds the record for the most All Star votes received at 11,073,744 in the 2012 season. The Baltimore Orioles are making a splash with 4 position players occupying the lead in votes. In the outfield, the battle for the final spot is a close one.
1st Baseman:
Chris Davis of the Baltimore Orioles has a secure spot with 3,960,299 votes, the second most overall votes. Davis is having an impressive season leading the league with 27 homeruns, has 69 RBI‚Äôs and is batting a .336 average. Prince Fielder of the Detroit Tigers follows Davis in votes with 2,579,031. Fielder has 12 homeruns, 55 RBI‚Äôs, and is batting .275.
2nd Baseman:
Robinson Cano of the New York Yankees is leading the voting with 3,032, 183 votes. Dustin Pedroia of the Boston Red Sox occupies the number 2 spot with 2,135,499. Cano and Pedroia have similar 2013 numbers, Cano with 44 RBI‚Äôs and a .278 average, Pedroia with 41 RBI‚Äôs and a .305 average, but the real difference comes in the power hitting. Cano has 16 homeruns on the season while Pedroia has 4. Traditionally power hitters draw the most interest from fans.
Shortstop:
While J. J. Hardy of the Baltimore Orioles still holds the lead in votes, Jhonny Peralta has moved ahead of Elvis Andrus in voting. The more deserving short stop is hard to decipher. Peralta has had a fantastic season thus far, batting .331 with 31 RBI‚Äôs and 6 HR‚Äôs, and only 4 errors on the year. Of Hardy and Andrus, he has the best fielding percentage. However, Hardy is a power-hitting short stop with 14 HR‚Äôs. He has 43 RBI‚Äôs and a .270 batting average. Hardy has been on a tear as of late and is the reigning Gold Glove winner. A case can be made for either. Currently, Hardy has 2,788,972 votes compared to Peralta‚Äôs 1,838,500.
3rd Baseman:
Miguel Cabrera has comfortably claimed a spot on the All Star team with Manny Machado second in voting with 2,097,804 votes. Cabrera is on pace for another career-defining season with 74 RBI‚Äôs, 20 HR‚Äôs and a .368 batting average. Machado is having a breakout year and may well be the best overall 3rd baseman in the league; however, he plays the same position as the best pure hitter in baseball. Machado has 64 RBI‚Äôs, 12 HR‚Äôs, and a .299 batting average in 2013.
Catcher:
Joe Mauer of the Minnesota Twins holds the starting spot at 2,788,972 votes. Matt Wieters of the Baltimore Orioles is second with 2,068, 032 votes. Mauer should get the spot as he is having a more consistent season at the plate. Wieters has had an under-performing year, hitting .233 with 37 RBI‚Äôs and 9 HR‚Äôs, but has thrown out 48% of attempted steals. Mauer is hitting .327 with 25 RBI‚Äôs and 8 HR‚Äôs, while throwing out 40% of attempted steals.
DH:
David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox claims the DH spot with 3,247,462 votes (batting .309, 16 HR‚Äôs and 55 RBI‚Äôs). Lance Berkman of the Texas Rangers is far behind with 1,519, 503 votes. Third in voting is Edwin Encarnacion (1,091,593 votes) of the Toronto Blue Jays who may be more deserving of the spot. While Berkman is hitting .260 with 33 RBI‚Äôs and 6 HR‚Äôs, Encarnacion is hitting .269 with 59 RBI‚Äôs and an impressive 20 HR‚Äôs on the year.
Outfield:
With Adam Jones of the Baltimore Orioles and Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels looking secure in the first and second outfield spot, 3,571, 693 and 3,548,195 respectively, there is a 3-way battle for the final spot. Nick Markakis of the Baltimore Orioles holds a slim lead at 1,915,860 votes. Close behind him is Jose Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays with 1,867,367, a lead of only 48,000 votes. This week‚Äôs voting update puts him ahead of Torii Hunter of the Detroit Tigers, who currently has 1,851,657 votes, only 16,000 behind Bautista. If Jones and Markakis both get a spot it will be the first time in Orioles franchise history that outfield teammates are selected and only the 17th time in MLB history.
Pitching:
Max Scherzer of the Detroit Tigers has a spotless record in the 2013 season at 11-0, an impressive stat even with the support of the Tigers‚Äô strong offensive line-up. He has also struck out 6 or more batters in each of his 15 starts, the fourth longest consecutive streak. Holding batters to a .192 average, 122 strikeouts, and an ERA of 3.05, Scherzer is a worthy candidate for starting pitcher. Between Scherzer, Justin Verlander, Anibal Sanchez, and Doug Fister, of the Detroit Tigers, AL Manager Jim Leyland has a plethora of options on his own roster. Other candidates for the starting position include Yu Darvish of the Texas Rangers and Clay Buchholz of the Boston Red Sox. Darvish boasts an incredible 143 strikeouts, holds opponents to a .208 batting average, and has an ERA of 2.95. Buchholz has 81 strikeouts, holds opponents to a .195 batting average, with an ERA of 1.71. However, Buchholz is currently on the 15-day DL making his availability uncertain. In relief, Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees should be an easy selection. Already with 26 saves in 2013, 43-year-old Rivera has 634 regular season saves as well as 4 All Star game saves. Rivera is set to retire after this season.
While securing a spot on the All Star roster is not necessarily an indication of stellar performance on the season (see Derek Jeter who managed to accumulate 819,175 votes) we are looking at a crop of the very best representing the American League.

APPELLANT And UGANDA......................................... RESPONDENT ( Appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal of Uganda at Kampala before the Justices Nshimye, Solome Balungi Bossa, Kenneth Kakuru JJA, on the 17th day of February 2015 in Criminal Appeal No.26 of 2011) JUDGMENT OF COURT This is a second appeal which arises from the judgment of the Court of Appeal which upheld the conviction of Baitwabusa Francis (the appellant) by the High Court on five counts of murder and a sentence of life imprisonment on each count. The sentences were to run concurrently. The facts of the case as found by the trial Judge (Chigamoy Owinyi-Dollo, J as he then was) and upheld by the Court of Appeal are that the deceased persons, namely, Kaireta Geoffrey, aged 25 years, Kabajwiga Brenda, aged 20 years, Kisembo Derrick aged 4 years, Disaya Kabajungu, aged 3 years and Amanyire Edward, aged 2 years lived at Kihande I Village, Masindi with Mathew Karubanga (PW2), his wife, Tugume Maureen and his mother, Rose Kabatoro (PW3). On the 8th day of July, 2008 they had all retired to bed when PW2 who was sleeping with his wife in a separate room from that of the deceased, heard a blast from the Television set. He noticed that the house had caught fire and all attempts to open the door were futile because it had been locked from outside. His mother who was sleeping in a separate house raised an alarm which attracted neighbours who removed iron bars from a window through which PW2 and his wife escaped. The deceased were not so lucky. They were all burnt beyond recognition as the post mortem reports on all the five dead bodies indicated. They all died of multiple organ damage due to extensive burns. The District Police Commander Masindi District, Alex Twebaze( PW5) on receiving the report about this incident visited the scene that very night. On reaching the scene he confirmed that five people had perished in the fire and the name of the appellant was being mentioned in connection with the burning of the house in which the deceased persons perished. He, together with the Local Council Chairman, Masindi and PW2 headed for the home of the appellant at Katama village where the wife of the appellant opened for them. The appellant was called out of his house and informed of the allegation that he had burnt PW2‚Äôs house in which the deceased were burnt. He was then arrested. He did not resist the arrest. His only response to the arrest was that it was okay. He was taken to Masindi Police Station from where he was later taken to the Chief Magistrate Court where he was charged with murder. He was later indicted in the High Court sitting at Masindi where the prosecution adduced evidence to link him with the offences. The appellant denied the alleged offences. He testified that on 8th July 2008 he had gone to bed at 10:00 p.m. and was sleeping when he was awakened by his wife who told him that someone wanted him. The District Police Commander called him out and placed him under arrest. He was taken to Masindi Police Station where he denied having burnt the house in which the deceased persons died. Norah Kyakuhaire (DW2) in support of her husband‚Äôs alibi testified that on 8th July, 2008 she returned home at 6:00 p.m. from school where she was a teacher. She found her husband and children at home and they remained together till his arrest in the night. The arrest of the appellant was prompted by information circulating at the scene that he was not on good terms with PW2 whom he suspected of having a love affair with his wife. The suspicion arose from the fact that PW2 had left a phone with the appellant‚Äôs wife for whom he was doing some casual work. According to PW2 and DW2, the phone was a pledge for a sum of Shs20,000/= which PW2 had borrowed from the appellant‚Äôs wife. PW2 had also taken a sum of Shs.850,000/= from DW2 on the pretext that he had a cure for her medical condition. These two incidents had soured the relationship between PW2 and the appellant who had allegedly warned PW2 that something was going to happen to him following which his house was burnt. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal found that the case depended on circumstantial evidence and we agree. Both Courts rightly stated the principles which Courts apply in deciding cases based on circumstantial evidence as was re-stated in the case of Akbar Hussein Godi Vs Uganda (Supreme Court) Criminal Appeal No 03 of 2013) as follows:- ‚ÄúThere are many decided cases which set out the relevant principles which Courts apply in deciding cases based on circumstantial evidence. In the case of Simon Musoke Vs R. (1958) E.A. 715 at page 718H, the Court of Appeal for East Africa held that in a case depending exclusively upon circumstantial evidence, the Court must, before deciding upon conviction, find that the inculpatory facts are incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of guilt ‚Äúsee also Teper Vs R.(1952) 2 ALL ER 447 . Also see Andrea Obonyo & Others Vs R. (1962) E.A. 542 where the principles governing the application by Courts of circumstantial evidence were considered‚Äù. The circumstantial evidence relied upon by the two Courts to convict the appellant consisted of the threat by appellant to do harm to PW2 and evidence that he was seen fleeing from the scene on his motorcycle. The appellant denied both incidents throughout his trial and in his appeal he raises two grounds as follows:- That the learned Justices of Appeal erred in law and fact when they failed to properly re-evaluate the circumstantial evidence on record to come up with their own conclusion. That the learned Justices of Appeal erred in law and fact in upholding an illegal sentence of the Appellant spending the rest of his life in prison (Life imprisonment) which was a manifestly excessive sentence. He prayed that The appeal be allowed. The harsh and excessive sentence of the appellant spending the rest of his life in Prison be set aside or substituted with a lessor (sic) prison term. The second ground is badly drafted. It raises the issue of illegality of sentence related to imprisonment of the appellant for the rest of his life and mixes it with the issue of a manifestly excessive sentence. The prayer seems to abandon the issue of illegality but it is raised again in the appellant‚Äôs final submissions. Our observation is that Counsel should take more care in the drafting of the memoranda of Appeal so that there is no mixup of issues on Appeal. Both grounds will be resolved as matters of Law. At the hearing of the appeal the appellant was represented by Mr. Emmanuel Muwonge, Counsel on State Brief while the Respondent was represented by Ms Caroline Nabasa, a Senior Principal State Attorney, Directorate of Public Prosecutions. Both Counsel filed written submissions which they adopted at the hearing of the appeal. On the first ground of Appeal, Counsel for the appellant submitted that both the trial Court and the Court of Appeal correctly observed that the case against the appellant was based entirely on circumstantial evidence because there was no eyewitness who saw the appellant commit the crime. He also acknowledged that both Courts correctly set out the principles that govern the Courts before any reliance can be placed on circumstantial evidence to convict a person. However, he faulted both Courts for having heavily relied on the testimony of PW9 which lacked credibility. According to Counsel, this witness only came to testify after the Court had detained his mother and maternal uncle and his evidence that he had been approached by PW2 with money to testify against the appellant makes his testimony unreliable and should not have been believed. He also could not have identified the appellant in the conditions prevailing on the night he is alleged to have met the appellant riding his motor cycle following the incident. In reply Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Court of Appeal properly re-evaluated the evidence as required of a first appellate Court and given the strong circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution, the appellant was placed at the scene of crime. She submitted that the circumstantial evidence rotated around the grudge between the appellant and PW2 and the evidence of PW9 who met the appellant fleeing from the scene. According to this witness, the appellant was carrying a yellow five liter jerrycan which fell off the motor cycle and he assisted him to retrieve it. He identified him in the process. This Court being a second appellate Court is not required to re-evaluate the whole evidence unless it is found that the first appellate Court did not sufficiently re-evaluate the evidence to draw its own conclusion. This is the position which was stated in the case of Kifamunte Henry Vs Uganda SCCA 10 of 1997 as follows:- ‚ÄúIt is the Court of Appeal as the first appellate Court which has duty to re-evaluate consideration of the appeal as a first appellant Court, the Court of Appeal misapplied or failed to apply the principles set out in such decisions as Pandya (Supra) Ruwala (Supra) Kairu (Supra)‚Äù In view of the defence of alibi raised by the appellant, it was incumbent on the trial Court and the Court of Appeal to determine whether or not the appellant was put at the scene of crime. The guidelines as to what amounts to putting the accused at the scene of crime were set by the Supreme Court of Uganda in the case of Bogere and Anor (Supreme Court Criminal Appeal No 1 of 1997) where it was held as follows: ‚ÄúWhat then amounts to putting an accused was at the scene of crime, and the defence not only denies it but also adduces that he was elsewhere at the material time it is incumbent on the Court to evaluate both versions judicially and give reasons why one and not the other version is accepted. It is misdirection to accept one version and then hold that because of that acceptance per se the other version is unsustainable ‚Äù As already indicated the case against the appellant is dependant on circumstantial evidence and the question is whether the Courts below subjected it to close scrutiny as is required. The requirement to subject circumstantial evidence to close scrutiny was emphasised in the case of Katende Semakula vs. Uganda (Supreme Court Criminal Appeal No. 11/ 1994) where it was stated as follows:- existing circumstances which would weaken or destroy the inference...‚Äù The first piece of circumstantial evidence relied on by both Courts to connect the appellant with the offence was a threat allegedly uttered by the appellant to PW2 on phone. The value to be attached to evidence of a prior threat was discussed in the case of Waihi and Anor Vs Uganda (1968) E.A.278 at p. 280 where the East African Court of Appeal stated:- ‚ÄúEvidence of a prior threat or of an announced intention to kill is always admissible evidence against a persons accused of murder, even amount to nothing. Regard must be had to the manner in which a threat is uttered, whether it is spoken bitterly or of impulsively in sudden anger or jokingly, and reason for the threat, if given , and the length of time between the threat and the killing are also material. Being admissible and being evidence tending to connect the accused person with the offence charged, a prior threat is, we think capable of corroborating a confession ....‚Äù (underlining provided) In this case, the appellant denies having made the threats and there was no verification of any telephone contact between the appellant and PW2. Secondly, from our reading of the case of Waihi Vs Uganda (Supra) evidence of prior threat cannot stand on its own. It can only be used for corroboration of other evidence which in this case is that the appellant was not only seen at the scene but was also seen fleeing from the scene on his motor cycle. According to the evidence of PW2 it was his mother, Rose Kabatoro (PW3) who informed people at the scene that she knew the person who had set the house on fire and had seen him jump on his motor cycle and ride away. But the trial judge, rightly so in our view disregarded this evidence when he observed as follows:- ‚ÄúIt is easily discernable that the PW3‚Äôs Court version alleging that she had identified the accused fleeing from the scene that night was ill contrived. She was evidently influenced to state so, by the ultimatum and threat she and PW2 claim the accused uttered for her family; and given that indeed the tragic fire incident took place within this time. In addition was her claim that she heard some people allege the morning after the fire that the accused had been seen with a jerrycan on a motor cycle fleeing from the scene of the fire. This was, in any case hearsay evidence and inadmissible. PW3‚Äôs claim that fateful night is therefore worthless. I must disregard it.‚Äù After disregarding the evidence of PW3, the only other piece of circumstantial evidence relied on to connect the appellant was that he was seen fleeing from the scene on his motor cycle. According to No 25383 D/CPL Okatayot Simon, an investigating officer who testified as a Court witness two people namely Mukubwa Peter a motor cycle rider who did not testify at the trial and Byakagaba Israel (PW9) a bicycle rider claimed to have met a person riding a TVS motor cycle on which he was carrying a five litre jerrycan. Mukubwa did not identify the person while Byakagaba who testified as PW9 claimed to have identified the appellant whom he assisted to retrieve the five litre jerry can which had fallen from the motorcycle. But in his own testimony this is what he stated ‚Äúthe complainant approached me and asked me to go and give evidence on how I had met the accused. He asked me if I knew the person who had burnt his house I told him I did not know the person, and then he asked me go and give statement at police. I accepted but asked him for 5 million shillings. He refused up to now‚Äù. Earlier he had stated that he never mentioned to anyone that he had met Baitwabusa. He also denied having made any statement at the police. Later he admitted recording a statement at the police and although there was a suggestion that the appellant had approached him to influence him not to testify against him he denied ever meeting the complainant or the appellant after he had made his statement at the police. He denied having discussed the case with his uncle George Magambo (PW8) and his mother Evasi Kaheru (PW7). He denied having told his mother that he had seen the accused on the night of the fire. In our view, the two pieces of circumstantial evidence did not point irresistibly to the guilt of the appellant. The evidence of the District police commander who arrested the appellant from his home did not help in linking the appellant with the offence. According to the witness he heard the name of appellant being mentioned at the scene and he went to his home where he found him sleeping. No search was conducted at the home of the appellant especially if anybody mentioned that he had been seen fleeing on his motorcycle whose registration number was not given but was described as blue in colour. There was mention of a yellow small jerycan which was never recovered. Moreover PW9 who testified that he had met the appellant, on the night the crime was allegedly committed told court that he never told any body so including the complainant whom he told that he did not know the person who had set fire to his property. It was only after he was promised Shs.5 million that he agreed to go and make a statement at the police. The complainant reneged on his promise to pay him Shs.5 million which may explain why he was reluctant to testify in Court till his relatives were imprisoned. There was also evidence that he was approached by the appellant to withdraw his statement at the police which may explain the disappearance of his statement from the police file. We do not see how the trial Court and Court of Appeal would find P.W.9 such a credible witness as to disprove the alibi raised by the appellant. On the contrary his credibility would be in question whether he was approached by the appellant to exonerate him of the crime or by the complainant to fabricate a story that he had met the appellant fleeing from the scene. On that basis we find that although both courts were alive to the principles 305 regarding circumstantial evidence, none of them subjected it to the scrutiny required before basing a conviction on it. We are of the view that the evidence on record left the appellant as a mere suspect. Suspicion, however strong it may be does not lead to conviction. See R v. Israel Epuku S/0 Achietu [1934] IEACA 166. In the result the appellant‚Äôs appeal is allowed. His conviction on all counts of murder is quashed and is to be released from custody unless he is being held on other lawful charges.

Untuk dan bagi pihak.In the 1970‚Äôs I attended a church in Perth where the pastor‚Äôs gift was evangelism. I remember that on most Sundays there would be new people becoming followers of Jesus. I was one of them and many of my friends today were also. The pastor told lots of good stories and also said some quotable statements. One of them was, ‚ÄúGod has no grandchildren!‚Äù The context of his statement was often aimed at children of believers, kids that had been brought up in the church. He would often read John 1:12 which states, ‚ÄúYet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God‚Ä¶‚Äù Then he would stress the fact that it was not enough to just follow on in your parent‚Äôs faith, in fact it was of great importance for each one to believe and acknowledge Jesus as their own Lord and Saviour. Many did.
In the first 3 verses of Psalm 44, we read of the Psalmist reviewing the past history of God‚Äôs interventions in his past generation‚Äôs lives. He has been taught well by his grandparents and parents, and this was according to the words of God in Exodus 10:2 which says ‚ÄúTell your children and your grandchildren‚Äù. And so, he talks to God and says:.
But then his conversation to the Lord changes in verses 4-8 and the psalmist becomes personal. He acknowledges how all this has become very real to him as well and using the personal pronoun (in bold font) he states:
4 You are my King and my God,
who decreesvictories.
He acknowledges that it is not enough just to know the stories told him by past generations but they now have become his stories ‚Äì his experience!
I was not brought up in a Christian home, coming to faith in Jesus at 19 years old, but I have now known many who had the privilege of believing parents (including my wife and our own children) and who now have also committed their lives to following Jesus. Our task is not yet over though, as we now move into another generation, whom we trust will also remember all that they have been taught and decide to follow Jesus as their parents and grandparents have done. Prayer being the gift God has given us to exercise during this time.
But, as we consider the words of this poem we also see another important lesson in the psalmist‚Äôs words. They are concerning who deserves all the praise for what has, is and will happen. In the words of Wilcock, ‚ÄúGod was doing something else at the time of the exodus and the conquest. He was making it crystal clear to Israel that all the achievements of those momentous days were his and not hers. The founding fathers knew, and their descendants now singing Psalm 44 also knew, that it was a divine arm and not a human one which had wrought these great things.‚Äù (# 5)
Read the verses 1-8 (underlined above) again and you will see just how much this truth is emphasized. And that‚Äôs why the psalmist finishes with the words:
In God we make our boast all day long,
and we will praise your name forever. (Verse 8)
Father, we do acknowledge that you have done great things in the lives of generations past and in our own lives. We ask that you do this same work of grace in the generations to come as they commit their lives to following you. Amen.Germany's Self-Driving Car Bill: World's 1st Legal Framework For Autonomous Vehicles
Germany could soon witness autonomous vehicles rolling on its streets as the lawmakers in the nation have approved new rules for self-driving cars in the lower house of the parliament.

Reported first by DW, this measure would pass to the upper chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat in order to take effect. If approved, it would give birth to the world‚Äôs first legal framework for integrating autonomous vehicles in regular traffic, according to the German government.
The bill was passed by lawmakers in a late-night session on Thursday allowing specifically fully autonomous systems under ‚ÄòLevel 4‚Äô classification which is defined as when a computer is in complete control of the vehicle and no human driver is necessary to control or monitor it.
The rule, according to the Transport Ministry, has been drafted in a way to offer more flexibility, including that the new regulations won‚Äôt require a human to be on standby at all times -- something that is pretty common today.
Along with this, the bill has highlighted that it would allow driverless shuttle busses as well as self-driving public transport buses to be put into use by 2022. They would also permit autonomous goods transport vehicles on set routes.

Autonomous vehicles for the general public are also permitted under this law, however, we still have time for the cars to become good enough. Sure. Tesla has pioneered this field, but it still isn't the most robust. But we can surely expect this to be a huge step in making car journeys a whole lot safer and reduce the rate of fatal traffic accidents.

Transportation Minister Andreas Scheuer was all positive about the bill and even urged the upper house to put the law into force as soon as possible, stating, ‚ÄúGermany will be the first country worldwide to take autonomous vehicles from the research laboratories to the streets. We are now a major step closer to that goal.‚Äù

Your domain name is something that deserves hours, if not days, of reflection, and it is not an exaggeration to say that, in some circumstances, making the wrong decision can ruin a business. Bottom line: choosing a domain name is something that every website owner needs to make sure it works properly, ideally before doing anything else, and especially if the website will have a commercial purpose.
We are no strangers to domain names here at WpOnlineHub. In fact, we‚Äôve been talking a lot about domains in the past few months, which shows just how pressing a problem this is for potential website owners.
So far, we‚Äôve talked about what a domain name is and what the difference is between a domain name and web hosting, and a website. And we‚Äôve also listed the top nine website domain name registrars of 2020, meaning where to go to register and buy a domain name.
However, we have not yet delved into the things to consider when choosing your ideal domain name; in other words, how to really choose! Let‚Äôs change that today. Here are over 20 essential tips for choosing and registering a domain name (in no particular order).
1. Choose a domain name that would directly associate with your network name.
This is the first and obvious solution. You should always try to find a domain name that is synchronized with your brand and your network name. Sometimes choosing the domain name associated with your network name can be challenging, especially if your network name is generic and has already been taken by other people. Choose the correct variation.
2. The unique domain will change the game
In case you want to create a new unique name for your blog, be prepared that this type of solution requires more hard work and investment on your part. It is not recommended to put your own personal name on the domain.
4. Be unique and memorable
There are a myriad of registered domain names, and you probably don‚Äôt want to look like a copycat. Using domain names similar to Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat or any other popular social network on the market is not the best idea. Be unique.
3. Keep it short and easy to type
Your domain name should not be long and consists of 30 symbols or words. Think about the times when you need to put your website name in the ad. Ads won‚Äôt work just because people won‚Äôt want to bother remembering the mile-long website address. The shorter the better.
05. Include keywords when appropriate
By practicing SEO (Search Engine Optimization), you can improve your chances of showing up on Google when people search for businesses like yours. A great SEO tip would be to include a relevant keyword in your domain name. This can help both site visitors and search engine robots associate their website with their primary field of expertise, thus helping you rank better for that topic.
While beneficial, it is also important to use keywords sparingly and only when they naturally fit your domain name. Otherwise, don‚Äôt force it, as an overly optimized domain name may appear as spam. In other words, this domain name SEO strategy is valuable but not a must.
When including a keyword works in a stylish and memorable way, be sure to do it.
6. Check your domain name carefully
Make sure the chosen domain name does not exist here on the Internet. Also check copyrighted names and trademarks. It is better to do a full checkup at first and then deal with and have legal issues later.
7. Avoid special symbols
The domain name must be easy to pronounce and spell. Underscores and hyphens can confuse people. For example, if you want to name your network as ‚ÄúDIY Cosplay Costumes‚Äù, then diycosplay.com would be much better than diy-cosplay.com or diy_cosplay.com. These symbols are easy to forget and mislead each other, so it will be best if you avoid them at all costs.
8. Avoid ‚Äúthe,‚Äù ‚Äúa,‚Äù ‚Äúmy,‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù in your domain name
Of course, this is not a strict rule, but the site ‚Äúgolfplayers.com‚Äù is obviously better than ‚Äúthegolfplayers.com‚Äù. However, if you have no other options and the domain name with an article or pronoun seems to be the best option, you should remember to promote your network with the full form of the name.
9. Choose simple name extension
The most popular domain name extensions are the legendary .com (dot-com), .net, and .org, and we strongly recommend that you adhere to these extensions. You can of course find all kinds of new emerging extensions like .ninja, .pizza or .photography but they may not be trustworthy. Also, they are less memorable and many users will be tempted to make their clever domain name simpler. For example, instead of myworldof.ninja, they would probably write myworldofninja.com. If you don‚Äôt want your target audience to be redirected to another similar place on the web, use the standard extensions mentioned above.
10. Avoid legal trouble
Before buying your domain name, make sure you are not in competition. Research databases of trademarks and copyrights, as well as competing brands. Going with a domain name that has been adopted by other brands, even indirectly (that is, in uses other than a domain name), could lead to customer confusion and possibly legal problems as well. Therefore, it is worth spending time to make an informed and well-researched decision.

-  ‚ÄúMy School Uniform‚Äù
"My School Uniform," written by Anonymous from South Carolina, is an empowering piece of writing in Teen Ink's Fall 2019 issue. It speaks out about the author's thoughts on strict school regulations that impact clothes developing young girls can wear to school. In this article, the author feels passionately against the uniform dress codes and lists many reasons why. To begin her stance, she informs the readers about her school, "a private, all girls school‚Äù where ‚Äúuniforms are by far the most important thing.‚Äù She goes on to describe the specific requirements on uniforms on each day of the school week. At the end, the author then states, ‚ÄúI am tired of fighting,‚Äù against the teachers caring about what they wear other than their education. She depicts her strong opposition very well against these uniform restrictions and encourages readers to support her stance.
The reason why this piece of writing is powerful is because it is able to connect with readers, females more than males. I, a 13-year old 8th-grader, am also irritated about my school‚Äôs dress code. Although it is not as strict as the all girls school in the article, many girls aren‚Äôt even allowed to show their shoulders without getting lectured. ‚ÄúShoulders are distracting to the male staff and student body,‚Äù many say; however, what young women wear should not be the reason males are not focusing on their work. In the article, the author closes the last paragraph with a short, but influential sentence, ‚ÄúI need them to get with the times.‚Äù The author also mentions great points when she says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the little girls going to my school to be shamed the same way that my peers and I are.‚Äù The way the author phrases her sentences draw on the reader‚Äôs emotions. Ultimately, ‚ÄúMy School Uniform,‚Äù is a great piece that young women should read.

The digital marketing landscape is always evolving and from 2016 to 2017, a massive shift occurred. The Consumer Advertising Report by the team at MediaRadar, found that while print and programmatic ad spends were down, there was a 74% increase in the number of native ad buyers. The study focused on all of 2016 through the first quarter of 2017.
What Decreased?
Print ad pages continued to experience a decrease, losing 8% ad spend year over year. Print spending is estimated to have decreased by 6% during the same period.
MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman noted that there has been a ‚Äúconsiderable‚Äù drop in ad pages from 2016 to the present day. ‚ÄúThat being said, there are still a considerable amount of pages being bought. Niche and enthusiast titles are on the rise, with some regional titles flourishing.‚Äù
During the first quarter of 2017, there was a drop of 5,000 advertisers who purchased ads programmatically compared to the first quarter of 2016, a 12% decreased year over year.
Krizelman notes that many brands are worried that they lose control of where their ads are placed when they purchase programmatically.
‚ÄúAfter years of growth, the decline in programmatic buyers is likely attributed to concerns around brand safety, especially given recent problems for companies like YouTube,‚Äù said Krizelman. ‚ÄúThis form of advertising is continuing to evolve as brands seek more control over where their ads are running. We expect to see a programmatic rise as more brands move to programmatic direct models.‚Äù
A Massive Increase In Native Ad Spending
Native ad buyers increased by 74% in the past year to over 5,000, according to MediaRadar and demand has more than tripled since 2015.
The study found that native ad increases were biggest among professional services, financial and real estate, technology, and wholesale products.
Here are the top 10 categories for Native Ads:
The MediaRadar study also found that high CPM ad placements on mobile and native platforms were being experienced, despite an overall dip in digital ad spends.

I don‚Äôt know if y‚Äôall remember me saying that ‚Äútacos are the way to my heart‚Äù‚Ä¶but it turns out my heart isn‚Äôt a one way street and it can also be won over with dumplings. However, tacos will always be my first true love.
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need!
Dough (you can buy frozen dough or you can make it like I did!)
- 2 cups flour (and a little extra depending on how sticky your dough gets)
- ¬æ cup hot water
- 1/2 tsp salt
Filling
- 1 cup ground pork
- 1 large coarsely diced carrot
- 1 diced shallot
- 3 green onions
- 1/3 cup diced purple cabbage
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- 1 tbs soy sauce
- 1 tbs rice wine vinegar
- 1 beaten egg
Now, let‚Äôs prep the dough! Measure 2 cups of flour and pour it into a large mixing bowl with the ¬Ω tsp of salt. Next, slowly add 3/4 cup boiling water to the mixture and using a small silicone spatula mix until clumpy. Cover the dough and let it sit for 3 minutes then knead the dough with your hands for 5 minutes. Let the dough sit again for 5 minutes then knead it for an additional 8-10 minutes adding more flour as needed. Roll your dough into a ball and cover it while you prepare the filling to prevent it from drying out.
It‚Äôs time to prep the filling! (this part is way easier than making the dough üòâ ) In a medium skillet toss in the shallots, carrots, garlic, and ground pork. Cook the mixture about halfway then add in the soy sauce, cabbage, rice vinegar, and green onions. Remove the mixture from the stove when it‚Äôs about ¬æ cooked and mix in ¬Ω beaten egg and the green onions. (It will cook the rest of the way while you steam it and this prevents your dumplings from being ‚Äúdry.‚Äù
Now, back to the dough! I bought a ‚Äúdumpling maker‚Äù on Amazon to cut and pinch my dumplings shut, but you can also do it by hand. Use a rolling pin to roll your dough out thin and even then use your dumpling maker to cut circles out of your dough. If you are doing this by hand roll your dough out into a ‚Äúlog‚Äù and cut 2 inch pieces off and flatten them out to form your circles.
Finally, it‚Äôs time to fill these babies up! Fill each dumpling with 1 tsp of filling and use the rest of your egg to dampen the edges of each dumpling so that they stick together better. Fold each dumpling over to form a half moon and pinch closed. If you are doing this by hand make pleats on one side for the dumpling to hold it together. If you are using the dumpling maker tool just fold the maker in half and squeeze it shut to pinch the side together.
Time to steam! I bought a steamer basket to steam my dumplings off of Amazon, but you can steam them any old way you like. I steamed mine for 6 minutes in the basket then tossed them in a hot skillet with a splash of olive oil to pan fry them until they were slightly crispy. Now dip those babies in some soy sauce or chili sauce and ENJOY!

This review focuses on a number of amazing examples of viral strategies, which exploit the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for effective viral replication. delicate variations prospective of PI3K, appeared to accumulate in microdomains whereas WSN/NS1-induced PIP3 was broadly distributed throughout the plasma membrane, which may clarify that different NS1 variants define intracellular sites of PI3K activation [62,63]. To entirely decode how influenza A disease effects the PI3K signaling pathway, the authors suggest cautiously selecting the viral strain, host-cell type, Dinaciclib supplier time post-infection and the PI3K isotype to be used in further experiments [62]. HSV-1, having a genome of 150 kb encoding more than 70 proteins approximately, can afford its serine/threonine kinase. non-etheless, early during HSV-1 an infection, apoptosis continues to be blocked within an Akt-dependent way until the trojan has accumulated more than enough Us3 proteins kinase to imitate Akt activity. Nevertheless, in the lack of Us3, the trojan seems to have advanced a Dinaciclib supplier backup system to wthhold the activity of Akt thus making sure anti-apoptotic Dinaciclib supplier signaling [64]. Another herpes simplex virus thought to change the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway may be the individual cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Both HCMV main immediate-early protein (MIEPs) and a constitutive energetic type of Akt can inhibit temperature-induced apoptosis in ts13 cells. Since this capability from the MIEPs to inhibit apoptosis is normally dropped when PI3K/Akt signaling is normally inhibited by ‚Äútype‚Äù:‚Äùentrez-nucleotide‚Äù,‚Äùattrs‚Äù:‚Äùtext message‚Äù:‚ÄùLY294002‚Ä≥,‚Äùterm_id‚Äù:‚Äù1257998346‚Ä≥,‚Äùterm_text message‚Äù:‚ÄùLY294002‚Ä≥LY294002 and since MIEPs can activate Akt, it had been figured the MIEPs induced anti-apoptotic activity is normally Akt-mediated [65]. Another member of the herpes simplex virus family members, Epstein-Barr trojan (EBV), induces the PI3K/Akt pathway through the viral latent membrane proteins 1 (LMP1), resulting in host-cell survival, which most probably contributes to EBV persistence in B cells necessitating sustained apoptotic inhibition [66]. Both viral EBV transcriptional activators, BZLF1 and BRLF1, can reactivate the lytic form of viral replication with BRLF1 acting inside a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner as inhibition of PI3K abolishes BRLF1-induced transcriptional activation [67]. Recently, however, for two additional herpes viruses, murine gamma herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) and human being herpesvirus-8/Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV8/KSHV), Peng and coworkers shown that Akt promotes viral persistence by suppressing transcriptional reactivation of these viruses rather than reactivating lytic replication. In this case reactivation or the transition from latency to lytic replication is definitely controlled from the viral transcription activator (RTA), an immediately-early (IE) gene, whose activity is definitely negatively controlled from the PI3K/Akt pathway [68]. They observed enhanced MHV-68 creation in permissive fibroblast after either ‚Äútype‚Äù:‚Äùentrez-nucleotide‚Äù,‚Äùattrs‚Äù:‚Äùtext message‚Äù:‚ÄùLY294002‚Ä≥,‚Äùterm_id‚Äù:‚Äù1257998346‚Ä≥,‚Äùterm_text message‚Äù:‚ÄùLY294002‚Ä≥LY294002 Dinaciclib supplier treatment within a dose-dependent way or RNAi-mediated Akt1 silencing. For the many various other capabilities from the trojan to modulate web host cell pathways for much longer periods the audience is normally described the complete review by Cooray [69]. Two associates from the poxvirus family members, VACVwhich currently uses the pathway to aid its endocytotic uptake [23]and cowpox trojan (CPXV), hijack the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to avoid apoptosis Cdc14A2 also. Inhibition of Akt activity either with the pharmaceutical PI3K inhibitor ‚Äútype‚Äù:‚Äùentrez-nucleotide‚Äù,‚Äùattrs‚Äù:‚Äùtext message‚Äù:‚ÄùLY294002‚Ä≥,‚Äùterm_id‚Äù:‚Äù1257998346‚Ä≥,‚Äùterm_text message‚Äù:‚ÄùLY294002‚Ä≥LY294002 or by expressing a dominant-negative type of Akt decreases viral titers by up to 90%, matching to cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 as significant indicators of apoptotic cells [70]. In rotavirus contaminated cells an elevated Akt phosphorylation depends upon a direct discussion between your viral nonstructural proteins NSP1 and PI3K. This discussion leads towards the Akt-dependent inactivation of pro-apoptotic protein on the main one hand as well as the activation of NFk-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic genes for the additional [71,72]. A link of the two success pathways continues to be known for a long period [73] and Bagchi and coworkers recommend these to become partially overlapping and even cooperative in case there is rotavirus disease [71]. Dengue disease and japanese encephalitis disease, both people of the single-stranded RNA flavivirus family, also make use of a PI3K-dependent blocking of apoptosis as early as 15 min after infection, indicating that the mere viral attachment leads to an activation of.US 7 Year Note Bond Yield was 1.05 percent on Wednesday July 21, July of 2021.

In fact, it feels more like you are walking into a garden center. But this is no ordinary place. Continue down a level and you will find the Anaba Tea Room.
Teapots of all kinds are on display and Asian furnishings lend an Eastern theme. The tables are modest and the floors are of concrete. A large tropical vine has been planted in the center of the room, and sun streams in through a skylight.
The Garden Room was a local pioneer in the ‚Äúgreen roof‚Äù concept. The top level contains a greenhouse and an outdoor balcony with a garden. The most interesting tables are up there as well (but tables should be requested from the host or hostess in the lower level).
Anaba Tea Room, which offers a wide range of varieties that can be sampled at a tea bar, has been in business for several years now. The day menu includes salads, tea sandwiches and desserts. Several items follow an Asian theme, such as a Vietnamese shrimp salad and a spicy Asian peanut butter sandwich. Traditionalists will find cucumber and watercress sandwiches.
Recently Anaba started serving dinners (Wednesday through Saturday from 5-9 p.m.). The evening menu includes 10 entreesall Asian-inspired with the exception of wild mushroom pasta. A very nice feature is that nearly all items are available in half-portions.
Much of the menu is devoted to the tea selection and thorough descriptions of the teas. But there also is a list of about 20 wines and some unusual Asian beers, including Chinese Yanjing and Sri Lankan Lion Stout.
Most entrees consist of meat or seafood, though two are vegan. You will find Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese influences. Meaty, braised pork ribs tempura ($9-$18), made in a light batter, are served over white rice topped with pear black bean sauce with slivered carrots and snow peas on the side. The sauce is quite rich. Prosciutto-wrapped Thai curry shrimp ($8-$16) is peeled shrimp with the tail on with a thin wrapper of prosciuttojust enough to add a little saltiness. It comes with ginger matcha rice (matcha is a powdered green tea) and a medley of sweet red peppers, bok choy and peapods. The curry is mild; indeed, even the veggies seem spicier. The beef short ribs ($9-$18), from a thick piece of tender meat, are served over wasabi mashed potatoes accompanied with carrots, onions and peapods. Even the half-order would qualify as an entr√©e at many restaurants.
The full servings include a house salad or house soup. The house soup is miso with mushroom dumplings; the dumplings are made of minced mushrooms with dough. Thin slivers of carrot and snow peas add color. It‚Äôs a nice soup.
Lunches offer a soup and sandwich special ($8) that changes daily. One was a blue cheese BLT with lean slices of smoked bacon; another was beef with black pepper sauce. The thin slices of beef were served in the manner of a Vietnamese banh mi with marinated cucumbers in a small baguette. The pepper is from black peppercorns, which is very Vietnamese. This beef is also served as a dinner entr√©e. Two soupsone with meat, one veganare offered as well.
Typically, Shorewood is not a community where restaurants dare to be different. But the Anaba Tea Room definitely breaks that mold. Sit back and enjoy the calming comfort of a place that offers fine Asian food and exotic teas in a very unique setting.

- Scientists filmed microscopic tardigrades to see how the tiny creatures walk
- They found the animals have a gait similar to insects 500,000 times their size
- This ‚Äòregular gait‚Äô changes to a ‚Äògallop‚Äô on softer surfaces, the researchers said

They are known as one of the most indestructible life forms on Earth.
But tardigrades are also one of the smallest animals with legs and among the only creatures with soft bodies that can walk.
Now scientists have captured them on a microscopic camera to see exactly how they do it.
Researchers found that tardigrades, also known as ‚Äòwater bears‚Äô or ‚Äòmoss piglets‚Äô, have a ‚Äòregular gait‚Äô similar to much larger insects that changes to a ‚Äògallop‚Äô on softer surfaces.
This is surprising because the plump and ponderous creatures earned the nickname ‚Äòwater bears‚Äô when scientists first observed their lumbering gaits in the 18th century.Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has spoken out against it that social media platforms should correct misleading information. ‚ÄúFacebook shouldn‚Äôt be the truth judge over everything people say online,‚Äù Zuckerberg said on Wednesday night on Fox News.
He disagreed with Twitter boss Jack Dorsey after a tweet from US President Donald Trump was provided by Twitter with information about the context.
Get the facts
Trump had warned in Tuesday of one of his numerous tweets about possible manipulations in postal elections and described them as ‚Äúessentially fraudulent‚Äù. Twitter then provided this and another tweet from the President with a note (‚ÄúGet the facts about postal elections‚Äù) and a link to further information. Trump sees this as an impermissible interference in the election campaign and threatens the social media platforms with countermeasures.
Facebook has always held the position that a platform should not subject its users to an internal quality check. ‚ÄúPrivate companies, and platforms in particular, shouldn‚Äôt play that role,‚Äù Zuckerberg said. ‚ÄúI think we have a different policy from Twitter in this case.‚Äù The CEO had once again defended the measures. ‚ÄúWe will continue to report incorrect or controversial information about elections worldwide,‚Äù said Dorsey. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make us an ‚Äòarbiter of the truth‚Äô.‚Äù
Liability privilege at risk
Zuckerberg‚Äôs understanding of the role of social media platforms is based on US legislation. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter enjoy a liability privilege: They are not responsible for the information published by their users from the outset, but only have to take action when they become aware of violations. This privilege is an essential livelihood of the platform economy. With the large number of daily postings on these platforms, it is unlikely that effective pre-checking will be easy for money printing machines such as Facebook.
Trump has reacted sharply to Twitter‚Äôs intervention and announced countermeasures. The president accuses the platform operators of not being politically neutral and biased against conservative opinions. ‚ÄúBig Tech is doing everything possible to exercise CENSORSHIP prior to the 2020 election,‚Äù Trump tweeted on Thursday. The US President now wants to regulate the social media by decree and announced an ‚ÄúExecutive Order‚Äù, which he wants to sign on Thursday.
Because the US President is on constitutionally relevant terrain and therefore thin ice, his scope for a decree is not too great. According to US media who have seen a draft Executive Order, the paper has so far been rather vague. The White House argues that social media is a public space in which the fundamental right to freedom of expression is protected by constitutional law and providers cannot use it to their liking.
However, Trump also sets a needle-stitch: he wants to instruct the national telecommunications authority NTIA to initiate a review of the legal liability privilege with the regulatory authority FCC. Zuckerberg ‚Äì who knows that the platform privilege that is essential for his company is increasingly being questioned ‚Äì stops on Fox News: ‚ÄúA government that censors a platform because it is concerned about censorship ‚Äì that doesn‚Äôt seem the right reaction to me now.‚Äù

Hop in a taxi and in only 25 minutes from Miami International Airport you will arrive at some of the country‚Äôs most beautiful beaches. If you‚Äôre searching for local vibes, a dog-friendly beach, or a natural oasis, you will find a beach that‚Äôs right for you. Here are some of my favorite beaches in Miami.
3rd Street Beach
Whether you come for sunrise yoga, or to mix and mingle with Miami locals, the 3rd Street Beach is far from the hustle and bustle of the mega resorts that you‚Äôll find in mid-beach. Expansive stretches of white sand, an iconic orange lifeguard tower, and a chilled out mood makes this my go-to beach to sun the day away. If the surf is big enough, you‚Äôll also be able to watch local surfers drop in at a nearby break.
Viewfinder Tip: 3rd Street Beach Yoga offers sunrise and sunset donation-based classes every day of the week!
Hobie/Windsurfer Beach
Two things draw beachgoers to Hobie beach: the wind and the dog-friendly attitude. If you love windsurfing, you can rent your gear right on the beach and cruise around the shallow waters. This beach off Rickenbacker Causeway is also the perfect place to bring your pooch. Dog owners can rest assured that their canine companions will be safe playing in the water, which doesn‚Äôt have strong currents.
73rd Street Beach
Once a month, this beach in the North Beach section of Miami hosts a full moon drum circle that draws drummers and barefoot dancers from all over Miami to revel under the light of the moon. The beach at 73rd Street is also home to the North Shore Park Bandshell, which hosts Miami Food Truck and Music Fest every fourth Wednesday of the month. You will enjoy free live music and a food truck lineup of some of Miami‚Äôs best mobile eats.
South Pointe Park
Head to the southern-most tip of South Beach and you‚Äôll end up in beautiful South Pointe Park. Its oceanfront location and sweeping views make it a favorite destination to relax on one of the many grassy areas, stroll along the pier, or sit on the rocks and watch the cruise ships leave port. Families will love South Pointe Park for its kid-friendly water park, paved biking and rollerblading lanes, and shady picnic spots!
Surfside
Many of Miami‚Äôs beaches are operated by hotels offering beach chairs, umbrellas, and concessions. But if you head north of Miami Beach, you‚Äôll reach the neighborhood of Surfside, where there is a mile-long stretch of pristine beach with nothing but sand.

Bathroom remodelling doesn't just have to enhance its appeal: it can also be a great opportunity to save water, energy, and money.
There are many options to choose from when you want to give your bathroom a makeover. These options range from the colours of your bathroom walls to the type of cabinetry. However, there is more to a bathroom than its appeal, and sometimes it is easy to forget the amount of energy wasted in your bathroom. So, when considering bathroom remodelling ideas, why not look at options that will look good and work efficiently.
Like most energy efficiency measures, the cost of upgrading your bathroom with more energy efficient features will eventually pay for itself.
Check out these great tips for planning your energy efficient bathroom:
Water-Saving Shower Heads
The flow rate of old shower heads is about 2.5 gallons (9.4L) per minute. However, modern, energy efficient shower fixtures can significantly lower the amount of water wasted in the bathroom. Water saving bathroom shower heads maintain pressure without compromising water flow. In fact, you will hardly notice a difference in water flow after you swap them out.
Energy Efficient Taps
Just like water efficient shower heads, energy efficient tap aerators can help you cut your bathroom water usage by half. Installing tap aerators is one of the most affordable ways of reducing your bathroom's water usage. As with energy efficient shower heads, modern aerators are designed to keep the pressure high without compromising water flow. However, you should also check for leaks from your bathroom fixtures and make necessary repairs. This can cause wasting of significant amounts of water each day.
Low Flow toilets
Many modern bathrooms come with dual flush toilets featuring settings. If your bathroom doesn't already have a dual flush toilet, consider installing a flush converter that allows you to adjust settings depending on the amount of water you need for each flush. Another affordable option is to install a tank bag designed to displace water used in a tank to eliminate water wastage when flushing the toilet.
Bathroom lighting
Is your bathroom too bright?. You can measure the brightness using a light meter, which can also tell you how your bathroom lighting compares to room lighting standards. Also consider swapping out your bathroom bulbs for LEDs, which will significantly cut your bathroom energy usage.
Windows
Windows are a great place to start when remodelling your bathroom: Consider replacing your current windows with energy efficient ones that carry the energy star label. These types of windows are insulated to prevent your bathroom from becoming too hot or too cold. Bathroom energy efficient windows come in a wide range of colours, shapes and sizes, giving homeowners a huge amount choice when renovating.
Check for signs of draft and caulk around your windows to determine if air is getting in. Consider covering your windows with plastic if the panes are drafty. Adding or upgrading window insulation will make your bathroom warmer (and more planet-friendly!).
Floors, Walls, Ceiling, and Counters
Your choice of floor, wall and counter materials will affect how much you spend on your bathroom remodelling and how often you'll need to do a major fix-up. The materials that you use won't only only determine your bathroom's overall appearance, but also its energy efficiency and carbon footprint. Wood is a great energy saving bathroom ceiling material and will give your bathroom a natural look. However, it requires regular maintenance and protection from water and moisture. Tile is also a great option for your bathroom floor and a safe way to go.
Go Fanless
Consider leaving your bathroom exhaust fan turned off, especially during winter. Bathroom fans pull heat and humidity from outside, so keep it turned off if you want your bathroom to be more energy efficient during winter.

People questioned their dramatic ways and vaguely alluded to fragility, but being the defending champions with an unimpeachable squad, Manchester City saw their criticism abate. It was just the opening week of the season. There wasn‚Äôt a real scenario where a close call against Southampton was anything but a mild aberration. It‚Äôs all part of the Manchester City narrative.
When Manchester United won 3-2 at St. Mary‚Äôs on Sunday, the tone was completely different. That‚Äôs because the narrative around United‚Äôs evolved. No longer are they a unstoppable behemoth orchestrated by a venerable wizard whose spells inexplicably conjure results. Now they‚Äôre an inherently flawed team, one that won‚Äôt accomplish anything as long as they have a weak central midfield. Sure they spend money on attackers like Robin van Persie, Shinji Kagawa and Ashley Young. And yeah, at the back they‚Äôve sprung for Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, and David de Gea. But the Glazers are skimming so much money off the top, Alex Ferguson is left with a midfield so depleted that only American capitalist interventionism can be blamed.
Like most narratives, it‚Äôs a mix of truth and exaggeration. Manchester United has lost some if its swagger after crashing out of last year‚Äôs Champions League group stage, but no team accumulated more points in last year‚Äôs Premier League. Their owners are rumored to be pulling the purse strings, but the club has made five big signings in the last three windows. Their midfield seems weak to us, but it‚Äôs also not something that‚Äôs kept them from success.
Here are the players who‚Äôve started in central midfield for Manchester United over the last five seasons along with their Premier League and Champions League results:
Five years ago, Manchester United were champions of England and Europe with a midfield built around Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick. In the interim, Darren Fletcher has played a more prominent role, Ryan Giggs has been moved inside, while Anderson and Tom Cleverley have been given a chance to earn first choice roles.
Manchester United‚Äôs midfield is not clearly weaker than it was when the Red Devils where winning everything. You could make an argument it‚Äôs stronger (more options and talent) or weaker (possible fading of Scholes and Carrick), but both explanations would be within reason.
Relative to their competition, the recent Red Devils have always been soft in the middle. Manchester United‚Äôs recent success has never been built on their central midfield, and although the club soccer world has become a more midfield-looking place, 89 points in last year‚Äôs Premier League hints there‚Äôs more than one way to get results. While the improved quality of the English league makes Ferguson‚Äôs reticence to buy midfielder odd, the results suggest we may want to explore other hypothesis.
Is it possible Manchester United‚Äôs midfielders are merely underrated? Or, are we overstating the impact of central midfielders? Perhaps Darren Fletcher is much better than we think, and Ferguson is waiting for his return? Or maybe, as Ferguson has said before, the market for central midfielders is inflated, and he has wisely elected to allocated United‚Äôs resources elsewhere?
It is confounding, though. Amid all the money Manchester United has spent on players, why won‚Äôt they just buy a central midfielder? They got Shinji Kagawa and were so close to getting Wesley Sneijder, but as Kagawa has shown United fans, there‚Äôs a huge difference between somebody who plays at the highest level of midfield and somebody who can dominate where Carrick and Scholes patrol.
But just because United doesn‚Äôt have that player doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt compete for this the title. It doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll repeat last year‚Äôs Champions League performance. And it doesn‚Äôt mean their 3-2 at St. Marys is more indicting than Manchester City‚Äôs result two weeks before.
Elsewhere in England
- Brendan Rodgers is still manager at Liverpool. John Henry knows attack‚Äôs an issue. Liverpool remains the friend of writers who don‚Äôt want to talk about the games. The Reds aren‚Äôt actually that bad.
- Swansea City finally dropped their first points of the season, steamrolled by the inertia-fed boulder that is Sunderland‚Äôs Steven Fletcher signing. The former Wolves man scored twice on his debut (a 2-2 result at the Liberty Stadium), almost enough to calm concerns Martin O‚ÄôNeill drastically overspent.
- Spurs are still winless under Andre Villas-Boas, again faltering late in a 1-1 draw with previously point-less Norwich. Tom Huddlestone marked his first appearance under AVB with a red card.
- Everton will not take over the world, but West Brom might. The Toffees lost for the first time this year (2-0 at The Hawthorns), while Steve Clarke‚Äôs team has earned seven points through three games. A couple more weeks like that, and people might start talking about them.
- It took Andy Carroll less than a minute to have an impact at West Ham, heading a ball on that eventually became Kevin Nolan‚Äôs opening goal. The Hammers beat Fulham 3-0. Carroll celebrated his debut by pulling out of England‚Äôs upcoming World Cup qualifiers.
- Manchester City won 3-1 in a game QPR would have preferred play at the bottom of a pool.
- Aston Villa earned a point at Newcastle. The should have been the lead. The 1-1 was Villa‚Äôs first result of the season.Herman, basic elements of the expert to whom to lm, whom to.

Dear Friends
We.
Sensual, earthy, redondo (roundedness) ‚Äì we explored what all this was to our body, how to work our physique to the style we searched for.
Technique ‚Äì working our footwork to the rhythmic comp√°s and remates.
Listening ‚Äì hearing the live song and guitar, familiarising ourselves to the melody and responding to it, calling upon what we learnt technically.
Feelingly ‚Äì because dance is about expression and amenco, greatly about your own response.
Artistry ‚Äì because that is the higher merit, going beyond steps and technique to cultivate your deeper essence.
Journeying with you ‚Äì Along with learning the dance, students experience Manuel‚Äôs teaching style ‚Äì a personal approach, where he ‚Äòsees‚Äô each student and with his great experience as well as instinct, he understands where the student is at.
Hands-on and on-the-spot, he corrects the student, explaining how to become better. All this, while keeping the rest of the class of the class going, either with his palmas keeping beat or vocalising his encouragement. It‚Äôs such amazing multi-tasking skills of the group and of the individual all at the same time!
The short, intensive and yet impactful five-day workshop gave us a charge of inspiration, further insight into learning and a sense of accomplishment of the steps of our individual growth.
AT THIS YEAR‚ÄôS 2018 WORKSHOP:
Log in these dates into your calendar: Wed 20 ‚Äì Sun 24 June!
Tangos (Style & Technique): We‚Äôll be working on a different Tangos this year. Similar to last year, 3 weekdays (Part A) and over the weekend (Part B). Come for both, or either. The Tangos is always such a great and useful palo ( flamenco style) ‚Äì for all the above reasons I mentioned above! So let‚Äôs have a go at it!
Technique: 2 days of technique, working on a 12-beat rhythm. Yes, technique is much needed, constantly!
Bamberas (Choreography) ‚Äì An intensive session of 2 daily hours. We aim to complete the choreography. So do join us fully if that is also your aim.
Espacio Propio/ My (Flamenco) Space ‚Äì Ok, so this is the new one this year. All participants are welcomed to join this n-de-curso (end-of-course) showcase. And those bold, brave ones, can work on adaptations.

(My informal translation)The potential trade-off between environmental protection and employment stability has been a concern in the literature. However, in the case of China, the employment issue has not been adequately addressed despite government‚Äôs big push on investing in renewable energy since 2007. This essay addresses the employment issue through estimating the relative employment impacts of renewable energy investments versus spending within the traditional fossil fuel sectors based on input-output modeling with China-specific data of sector and sub-sector weighting techniques. I find that spending within three segments of the renewable energy sectors‚Äîsolar, wind and bioenergy, will produce in combination about twice as many jobs per dollar of expenditure than an equal amount of spending on fossil fuels. I also find that, more than 70% of jobs from renewable energy sectors are created in the informal economy. This raises questions about the quality of the jobs created through renewable energy investments.TN 5 (06-10)

The Vermont‚Äôs Act to Protect Religious Freedom and Recognize Equality in Civil Marriages,
2009 Vt Laws 2009-2010 which went into effect on September 1, 2009 permits same-sex
couples to marry in Vermont beginning September 1, 2009. Vermont permits parties to
a same-sex marriage to change their names based upon the marriage in the same manner
as any other person changing their name by marriage.
Civil Unions established before September 1, 2009 will continue to be recognized in
Vermont. The new legislation has removed the ability to register a new Civil Union
as of September 1, 2009. Prior Civil Unions must be dissolved before marrying someone
not party to the Civil Union. Domestic relationships or partnerships will not be affected.
This memorandum is in response to your request for an opinion concerning the use of
a Vermont same-sex marriage certificate as proof of a name change following the recent
enactment of Vermont‚Äôs Act to Protect Religious Freedom and Recognize Equality in
Civil Marriages, 2009 Vt. Laws 2009-2010 Legislative Session (2009), which became
effective on September 1, 2009. Specifically, you requested an opinion as to whether
Vermont state law allows an individual to change his or her legal name after entering
into a same-sex marriage in Vermont. Vermont same-sex
marriage.
Briefly, SSA may accept the documentation associated with a same-sex marriage or divorce
as proof of a name change. Your other questions are answered below.
Analysis
1. Whether the State permits parties to the same-sex marriage to change their names,
first name, and/or surname, based on the marriage.
At common law, a person could lawfully change his or her name without resort to any
legal proceedings where such a change is not made for a fraudulent, criminal or wrongful
purpose, merely by use of the new name. 57 AM. JUR. 2d Name ¬ß 16 (2010). Thus, under the common law, any document showing use of the new name
could conceivably serve as an indication that a name change has occurred. However,
it does not appear that Vermont has adopted the permissive common-law rule. Indeed,
Vermont has enacted statutes that undermine the common-law approach. See generally Julia S. K~, The Right to Control One‚Äôs Name, 57 UCLA L. Rev. 313, 318-19 & passim (Oct. 2009) (arguing that common-law freedom
to change names at will has been largely eroded by documentation requirements, statutory
enactments, and discretion afforded judges to deny name changes). Most notably, the
Vermont legislature has promulgated a specific procedure to govern name-change petitions.
VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, ¬ß 811 (2010) (‚ÄúA person of age and sound mind may change his
or her name by making, signing, sealing and acknowledging before the judge of the
probate court of the district in which the person resides . . . .‚Äù). According to
the Vermont judiciary‚Äôs website, ‚Äú[l]egal name changes are only necessary if you are
interested in changing your name by an Official Court order. For non-legally binding
day-to-day usage or return to a maiden name, an official Court order is often unnecessary.‚Äù
See Name Change of Adult Information,. Thus, at least some formal action is typically required to effectuate a name change
for legal purposes, presumably including purposes under the Social Security Act.
Vermont has defined marriage to embrace the union of same-sex as well as heterogeneous
couples, see VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, ¬ß 8 (2010), and Vermont marriage licenses permit an individual
to designate himself or herself as a bride, groom, or spouse, id. tit. 18, ¬ß 5131(a). The marriage license contains a blank for both individual‚Äôs names.
Id. ¬ß 5131(a)(2). After the marriage is solemnized, the resulting document is referred
to as a marriage certificate. Id. ¬ß 5131(b). Vermont does not appear to have enacted any specific statute providing
that a marriage certificate, in and of itself, effectuates a legal name change. However,
Vermont‚Äôs administrative regulations invariably recognize marriage certificates as
sufficient proof of identification or a legal name change. See 12-3-206, VT. CODE R. ¬ß 2601.3(2) (2010) (general assistance); 20-1-3 VT. CODE R.
¬ß I(a) (obtaining renewal of home address confidentiality status);).
Accordingly, we conclude that Vermont permits parties in same-sex marriages to change
their names based on the underlying marriage certificate. Our conclusion stems from
the fact that such a certificate constitutes adequate proof of a legal name change
in Vermont under the administrative code. We note that our opinion is less firm with
respect to an individual‚Äôs first name. There is, of course, a long tradition of surname
name changes at the time of marriage. It would appear less customary for an individual
to change his or her first name at the time of a marriage. And, as stated above, Vermont
does seem to require certain formalities with respect to name changes. VT. STAT. ANN.
tit. 15, ¬ß 811 (2010). Meanwhile, in some situations, a name change may be denied.
Id. ¬ß 558 (establishing that, upon divorce and absent good cause to the contrary, a court
‚Äúmay allow [a woman] to resume her maiden name or the name of a former husband‚Äù (emphasis
added)). Nevertheless, given the sufficiency of marriage certificates as proof of
identification and change of name, we think that, as a practical matter, our concern
is largely theoretical.
2. Whether there are any restrictions on such name changes.
Vermont does not appear to place any additional restrictions upon individuals seeking
to change their names based on same-sex marriages beyond those involved in any name-change
process. It is unclear whether an individual has complete discretion to change his
or her name to anything he or she chooses. The Vermont statutes and case law do not
place any specific restrictions upon name changes via the marriage certificate. See VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 18, ¬ß 5131(a)(2) (2010). Nevertheless, it is also clear that Vermont
typically requires court involvement in the name-change process, even in situations
involving adults. Id. tit. 15, ¬ß¬ß 558, 811.
Vermont‚Äôs law is equivocal regarding the level of scrutiny, if any, a court should
apply to an individual‚Äôs decision to change his or her name. On one hand, the general
name-change statute appears to relegate the court to a purely ministerial role in
processing the name change and ensuring that the individual seeking the name change
is of age and of sound mind. Id. ¬ß 811. Conversely, upon divorce, a court ‚Äúmay allow [a woman] to resume her maiden name or the name of a former husband.‚Äù Id. ¬ß 558 (emphasis added). Section 558‚Äôs test implies that the woman may not take a
name other than that of her former husband or her maiden name. Id. Moreover, the court may not allow the name change at all upon a showing of ‚Äúgood cause
to the contrary.‚Äù Id. Even where good cause is not shown, the word ‚Äúmay‚Äù connotes that discretion is vested
in the court to deny the name change.
We suspect that, if squarely presented with the issue, Vermont would decide that judges
do have some discretion to deny a name change in limited circumstances. Vermont‚Äôs
statute prescribing the standard for the name change of a minor child, VT. STAT. ANN.
tit. 15, ¬ß 812, mirrors ¬ß 811, the statute governing adult name changes. Despite explicitly
recognizing the silence of ¬ß 812, the Supreme Court of Vermont nevertheless created
a multifactor test to guide a court‚Äôs inquiry regarding the propriety of authorizing
a proposed name change of a child. In re W~, 648 A.2d 648, 649-52 (Vt. 1994). While many of the concerns that animated the court‚Äôs
decision do not apply in an adult name-change context-- i.e., the arguably disruptive effect of the name change upon children of divorced parents--we
think the decision at least implies that courts are not required to rubber stamp all
name changes. Thus, a court might properly reject a name change made for fraudulent
purposes, see 57 AM. JUR. 2d Name ¬ß 16 (2010), or a name change involving a scandalous or otherwise
objectionable name, see generally K~, supra, at 314-15 (listing examples of courts refusing to sanction purportedly inappropriate
names).
As a practical matter, this limitation will have little effect, however. By the time
SSA receives a marriage certificate, the relevant judicial officer presumably will
already have made his or her decision regarding the propriety of the name change.
3. Whether there are any additional actions that the individual must take to change
his or her name to conform to State Law after entering into the same-sex marriage.
No. As explained above, the marriage certificate itself suffices as proof of identity
or a name change.
4. The date the State will begin issuing marriage licenses and certificates to same-sex
couples.
Vermont‚Äôs statutes authorizing same-sex marriage became effective on September 1,
2009. See, e.g., Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, ¬ß 8 (2010). Thus, the State began issuing marriages licenses
and certificates to same-sex couples on that date.
5. Any change to the status of prior civil unions or domestic partnerships entered
into in the same State.
The Act to Protect Religious Freedom and Recognize Equality in Civil Marriages, 2009
Vt. Laws 2009-2010 Legislative Session (2009), repealed those statutory sections devoted
to the issuance of civil union licenses and certification. However, the Act did not
repeal the civil-union statutes themselves nor did it convert present civil unions
into marriages. Furthermore, an individual in a present civil union is free to enter
a marriage with the other party to the civil union, but not an individual who has
entered into a civil union with a different person. VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, ¬ß 4 (2010).
Therefore, we conclude that prior civil unions remain in effect and confer the same
benefits as they did previously.
Vermont recognizes for certain purposes but does not explicitly define ‚Äúdomestic relationships.‚Äù
See VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 13, ¬ß¬ß 5301(2), 5351(7)(C) (2010); id. tit. 15A, ¬ß 1-112; 12-4-202 VT. CODE R. ¬ß2.2(ss) (2010). In the same-sex context,
the term was employed by the Vermont legislature in a statute seeking to impose child-support
obligations in the event of the dissolution of a same-sex relationship. See Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 882 (Vt. 1999) (discussing adoption and child support in context of
domestic relationships). Such relationships were not altered by the recent legislation
permitting same-sex marriages, but the requirements for such relationships are not
entirely clear. It seems likely that a ‚Äúdomestic relationship‚Äù is, typically speaking,
little more than a functional term used to describe an otherwise unrecognized sexual
relationship featuring cohabitation. See generally id. at 883-84 (detailing paucity of benefits conferred to same-sex partners prior to
enactment of civil-union statutes).
6. Whether a previously-entered civil union and domestic partnership must be dissolved
before entering a same-sex marriage.
As indicated immediately above, an individual in a civil union may enter into a marriage
with his or her civil-union partner. VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, ¬ß 4 (2010). An individual
would, however, need to dissolve the prior civil union before marrying someone not
party to the civil union. Id. Domestic relationships or partnerships would not be affected.
7. Whether a same-sex civil union is automatically dissolved when a same-sex marriage
occurs.
The Act to Protect Religious Freedom and Recognize Equality in Civil Marriages, 2009
Vt. Laws 2009-2010 Legislative Session (2009), is silent regarding the impact of a
subsequent marriage upon a civil union between the same parties. However, the Legislative
Council of the State of Vermont has clarified that ‚Äú[c]ouples with existing civil
unions will be permitted to marry one another‚Äù and that ‚Äú[t]he civil marriage does
not dissolve the civil union.‚Äù See State of Vermont Legislative Council, Frequently Asked Questions About S. 115, An Act Relating to Civil Marriage, As Passed
by the House and Senate, available at s115faq.pdf.
8. Procedures for the dissolution of a Vermont same-sex marriage and the relevant
documentation that would allow Social Security to change a name to a prior name in
the event of the dissolution.
With respect to the dissolution of a Vermont same-sex marriage, Vermont‚Äôs statutes
concerning dissolution of a heterogeneous marriage apply equally to a Vermont same-sex
marriage. iVT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, ¬ß 8 (2010). In Vermont, a marriage is dissolved
by a decree of divorce or annulment. Id. ¬ß¬ß 511-637. As stated above, ¬ß 558 authorizes a court to restore a woman‚Äôs maiden
name upon divorce. Notwithstanding the gender-specific language, we strongly suspect
that a Vermont court would employ ¬ß 558 in cases involving same-sex couples. In any
event, Vermont administrative law permits as proof of a name change a copy of whatever
court order effectuated the name change. See 20-1-3 VT. CODE. R. ¬ß I(1)(a) (2010);). Thus, we conclude
that, where the probate court has approved a name change as part of a divorce proceeding,
we may accept the order as proof of the name change.
CONCLUSION
Based on the above analysis, we conclude Vermont permits legal name changes on the
basis of same-sex marriages. A Vermont same-sex marriage certificate may be used in
the same manner as any other Vermont marriage certificate as proof of a name change
in Vermont. Given the Vermont legislature‚Äôs election simply to redefine marriage to
include same-sex marriages, SSA can comfortably employ the same procedures that it
uses with respect to name changes following heterogeneous marriages.Royally bold in a deep confidence, it doesn‚Äôt pose. Nothing pungent about it nor any need for attention.

Apple introduced its recent flagship iPhone examples, the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, at its iPhone event on Tuesday. Among other things, the inventions boast a new LiDAR Scanner designed to allow for more immersive augmented world( AR) know-hows. Snapchat today approves it will be among the first to introduce the new technology to use in its iOS app for a lidar-powered Lens.
As Apple explained during the event, the LiDAR( Light Detection And Ranging) Scanner calibrates how long it makes for light-footed to reach an object and wonder back.

The technology can also be used by app developers to build a precise depth map of the background, and facilitate speed up AR so it feels more instantaneous, while allowing for new app experiences that use AR.
In practice, what this means for app makes is the ability to use lidar to enable things like objective and room searching ‚Äî recall, better AR shopping apps, residence pattern implements or AR tournaments, for example.
It likewise are allowing photo and video influences and a more exact placement of AR objectives, as the iPhone is actually able to ‚Äù construe‚Äù a depth map of the room.

That can lead to new AR ordeals like what Snapchat is prepared to introduce. Already known for some best-in-class AR photo filters, the company says it will soon launch a lidar-powered lens specific for the iPhone 12 Pro models.
Apple made a brief peek at Snapchat‚Äôs lidar-powered feature during the lidar portion of the iPhone happening today.
Here, ‚Äúyoure seeing‚Äù an AR Lens in the Snapchat app where buds and grasses cover the table and storey, and fledglings fly toward the user‚Äôs face. The forages toward the back of the chamber gazed as if they were further away than those closer to the user, and botany was even climbing up and around the kitchen cabinet ‚Äî an indication that it appreciated where those objectives were in the physical space.
The fowls in the Snapchat Lens disappear as they move behind the person, out of view, and even land precisely in the person‚Äôs hand.
We understand this is the exact Lens Snapchat has in the works, but the company is bracing further details for the time being. However, it demonstrates what a lidar-enabled Snapchat know would feel like.

IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN TANZANIA
By Daniel Mpanduzi
The Voice School Trust
Some of the sectors mostly affected:
- Agriculture and Animal husbandry
- Water and vegetation
- Health
- Tourism
- The agriculture and animal farming sectors are directly affected by climate change in Tanzania. Unreliable rains, regular drought and in some areas/cases unprecedented flood leading to soil infertility. This is causing serious poor crop production leading to food insecurity, alarming threats of hunger and increased levels of poverty as many people in the country rely on agriculture and subsistence farming for food and their livelihood. With this, The Voice School is farming project directly affected. For instance, we had very poor harvest this year due to prolonged drought. This coming farming season is not promising either; quite unusual not getting early rain up to this moment. Basic food prices are on the raise thus our overheard or school running cost are on the rise too. In some neighbouring households, they cannot afford three meals a day. The food insecurity has far reaching effects to our students‚Äô attendance in schools. Some children are forced to join their parents in low paying daily jobs for food sake.
This is our maize farm in Monduli, which ended up with nothing this year. All the crops failed.

Our forty acres‚Äô beans farm produced only 50 bags this time round; Is like every single acre produced an average of 1 bag; huge loss!

2. Rich pastures and sources of water are drying up due to increased levels of Temperature. This leads to scarce or completely luck of drinking water for human beings, animals and even for domestic uses in many areas in the country. This is pausing a huge Health threat to so many people especially in rural Tanzania. Water and pasture disappearance is increasingly affecting the Livestock industry in the country particularly in areas like Arusha, Mara and Simiyu, regions which largely practice animal farming.
Picture by Millardayo.
This is making so many animal keepers move from one region to another (e.g. some move from Simiyu in the North to Mbeya down South of the country) in search of water and pasture, a practice which is causing them lots of conflicts with crop producers. So much time is also used walking long distances in search of water and pasture. This practice affects women and children who spend most of their time searching for water and grazing areas instead of going to school.
This is a water dam in Singa Village, Mkalama, Singida ‚Äì it should be full of water.

3. Climate change is also encouraging invasion of a number of new forms of pests in our farms‚Äô ‚Äì another food insecurity threat! We have recently witnessed clouds and waves of locust and other crop eating pests which have never been witnessed before.
4. Kilimanjaro is known to be the roof of Africa found in Tanzania. It is the highest Mountain in Africa found in the list of wonders of the world. It is not only a unique tourists‚Äô attraction in Tanzania but also a unique world heritage. It was initially very famous for its full snow cover in this warm country, but with the on going climate change, the snow cap on this roof of Africa is slowly, but surely melting and disappearing. This has direct impact to Tanzania and The Voice School‚Äôs economy. The country receives 1,000,000 tourists per year who come to see the only point with snow through out the year in Tanzania while We, at The Voice School receive fees from parents who are employed in the tourism industry including those who host Mt Kilimanjaro climbers. If something is not done now, it is very sad that our next generation are likely not to see this only but fast disappearing snow cap in Tanzania.
A very shocking incidence happened in Rombo (at the very foot of Mt Kilimanjaro) on 27th Sept 2021. A number of citizens got fire wounds; got burnt as they were walking in their area. The land/soil was burning hot from deep inside to the surface. They had mixed feelings and thoughts within a frame of commotion and worries. Some thought of volcanic activities that Kilimanjaro was about to erupt. Some thought of presence of natural gas. When the government of Tanzania geological authorities came, they dismissed any signs of volcanic activities. They said due to climatic changes, the increase of temperature is causing the composite inside the land to burn.

He is an amazing singer who has crossed over to numerous genres to unbelievable success that has resulted in Grammys and some of the other biggest awards in the industry. A performance by Juan is a must-watch and that is one of the reasons fans buy Juan Luis Guerra tickets to watch this amazing artist perform like only he can. Juan Luis Guerra Cities Juan Luis Guerra Dallas TXJuan Luis Guerra Fairfax CAJuan Luis Guerra Miami FLJuan Luis Guerra Newark DEJuan Luis Guerra Orlando FLJuan Luis Guerra Rosemont IL Juan Luis Guerra was born on 7th June, 1957 at the Dominican Republic. A tall guy, he takes that facet from his father who was a professional basketball player. He grew up pretty close to the National Music Gallery but he wasn‚Äôt always into taking up music as a profession. His first attempts at choosing a profession took him to study literature and philosophy at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo but soon realized that wasn‚Äôt what he wanted. Juan was always a music lover and grew up listening to the likes of the Beatles and some of the music done by U.S. hippies. Juan Luis Guerra‚Äôs passion for music took him to learning how to play a guitar which was his favorite instrument. To take his music learning to another level Juan went to the Berklee College of Music on a scholarship for a diploma in jazz composition. That time at Berklee opened his eyes to the power of music and Juan went on to study the various forms and degrees of jazz even more closely. After completing his diploma in 1982, he went back to his native Dominican Republic to start and test whatever he had learned during his time in the U.S. Juan decided to take up the local African music and experiment with it by mixing it with folk songs and jazz. He formed a band 440 and started working on his music skills. The name 440 which was later changed to Juan Luis Guerra y 440 is inspired by the musical note A440 whose frequency is configured to 440 Hz. The name was suggested by Juan‚Äôs brother who was a regular at their practice sessions and suggested it when he saw that the music played by the group was absolutely perfectly tuned and harmonious. Juan Luis Guerra stepped into the world of professional music with the release of his first album titled Soplando in 1984. The album was based on everything he had learned at Berklee and was an experiment so it wasn‚Äôt meant to be a commercial success. The album however highlighted the prowess of Juan as a musician and that enabled him to keep on working and release two more albums Mientras M√°s Lo Pienso...T√∫ and Mudanza y AcarreoI. Juan Luis Guerra and 440 signed their first recording contract with Karen Records in 1990 and started to change their music to gain some more commercial success. The trick worked to perfection when they released Ojal√° Que Llueva Caf√© in 1989. This was the breakthrough album Juan needed to really kick start his career as a commercially successful musician. The self titled song from the album was a melodious and slow song that had fast paced music. The song and the album topped charts in a lot of Latin American nations and enabled Juan to go on a tour with his band. The tour was immensely successful with fans buying Juan Luis Guerra tickets everywhere they went. The success garnered from the release of Ojal√° Que Llueva Caf√© enabled Juan to release their next album Bachata Rosa in 1990. The album was an even bigger hit and sold a staggering five million copies to earn Juan Luis Guerra his first Grammy. He followed it up with another tour that was an even bigger success than the previous one. The success and awards continued to come his way with his next albums Areito, Forgarte and Para Ti etc. which cemented his reputation as one of the leading Latin American singers of all time. Juan Luis Guerra is a musician that has never been afraid to experiment. He has done whatever he has wanted and stood by what he believes is right. He has changed his music to keep up with the latest trends but the originality still remains intact in every song of his. Juan Luis Guerra tickets are simply not to be missed out on by everyone who wants to witness the very best of Latin music with just a little bit of difference.

Available Dollars In Latest Round Of Awards
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood today announced that 54 high-speed rail projects in 23 states will share in $2.4 billion to continue developing America‚Äôs first nationwide program of high-speed intercity passenger rail service.
The Department‚Äôs Federal Railroad Administration received 132 applications from 32 states totaling $8.8 billion, more than three times the $2.4 billion available. During the first round of awards in the fall of 2009, applicants submitted more than $55 billion in project proposals for the initial $8 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
‚ÄúDemand for high-speed rail dollars is intense and it demonstrates just how important this historic initiative is,‚Äù said Secretary LaHood. ‚ÄúStates understand that high-speed rail represents a unique opportunity to create jobs, revitalize our manufacturing base, spur economic development and provide people with an environmentally friendly transportation option.‚Äù
More than 30 rail manufacturers and suppliers, both domestic and foreign, have agreed to establish or expand their bases of operations in the United States if they are hired to build America‚Äôs next generation high-speed lines, a commitment the Obama Administration secured to help ensure new jobs are created here at home.
Some;
Iowa received $230 million to create a new intercity passenger rail service between Iowa City and Chicago through the Quad Cities. When completed, the service will form an integral part of the existing efforts to develop the Chicago Hub intercity rail system in the Midwest; and
Michigan received $161 million for a high-speed rail corridor connecting Detroit and Chicago, the two largest cities in the Midwest. The long-term vision for this corridor includes doubling the number of daily round trips between Detroit and Chicago.
The money is being awarded for a range of activities, such as construction of track and stations, purchase of new passenger equipment, and planning studies to develop new high-speed rail service.
‚ÄúIn the 20th century, our vision led to the interstate highway system,‚Äù said FRA Administrator Joe Szabo. ‚ÄúIn the 21st century, our vision will give us a world-class network of high-speed passenger rail corridors.‚Äù
In addition to the $8 billion down payment from the Recovery Act, additional funding for high-speed rail has come from several sources. These include $95 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation‚Äôs FY 2009 appropriations and remaining money from a related FY 2008 appropriations program, and from the Department‚Äôs FY 2010 appropriations, which included at least $2.125 billion for high-speed rail service development programs, $245 million for individual projects and $50 million for planning and multi-state proposal activities.

Full Text IntroductionHospital emergency departments (EDs) play a vital role in the health-care system, providing care for patients with acute illness and injury, and access to the health-care system in Nigeria. Over the past 15 years in the developed world,[1],[2],[3],[4] EDs have become progressively more congested due to the combined effects of increasing demand for care,[5],[6],[7],[8] increased complexity of care, and access block.[1],[2],[3],[9] In Nigeria, the congestion is due to nonfunctional primary and secondary health-care levels. ED congestion has implications for patient outcomes[1] as well as for the efficiency and effectiveness of ED operations as evidenced by staff and patient satisfaction.[1]High rates of ED use create a strain on the health-care system by leading to overcrowding,[10],[11] but they can also be seen as a marker of systemic problems, including poor access to nonemergency health care and the failure to prevent injuries and illnesses.[12]The University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) is a 650-bed tertiary health-care facility located within Ilorin, the capital of Kwara State, North-Central region of Nigeria. It serves a wide variety of patients and receives referrals from neighboring states and towns. It is easily accessible from any part of the city and provides emergency and inpatient medical services round the clock for patients. Worldwide, access to and the manner of use of the accident and emergency unit (ED) is a point of great concern. Issues regarding duration of stay, crowding of the ED, and promptness of care are paramount to both the patients and health-care providers. These are issues that are regularly undergoing changes in order to provide better service to patients. The quality of care and the resources available at the ED may go a long way to influence the outcome of patients who presented there and also the pressure for inpatient beds. In Nigeria, most patients pay out of pocket and have no health insurance, and thus, cost for this group may be an important factor in their use of the ED and may adversely affect their outcome. Data on the workload of medical ED in Nigeria are sparse. The aim of this review was to determine the sociodemographic profile of patients presenting at the medical accident and emergency and the outcomes of their care. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study of patients presenting at the medical A/E at the UITH over a period of 12-month period (January‚ÄìDecember 2007). Ethical approval was obtained from the Hospital Ethical Review Committee to carry out the study. All consecutive consenting patients who were admitted into the ED aged 14 years and above were included in this study. Patients brought in dead, and surgical cases were excluded from the study. Information obtained from the patients' case records within 48 h of arrival included sociodemographic data, clinical presentation, duration of stay in emergency, and outcome in the EDs. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 16 (The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) is a software package used in statistical analysis of data. It was developed by SPSS Inc. and acquired by IBM in 2009. In 2014, the software was officially renamed IBM SPSS Statistics) computer software and results were presented in tables and figures. ResultsA total of 820 patients presented to UITH Medical ED during the study period. About 10 patients were brought in dead, 11 were purely surgical cases, while 27 had incomplete data for analysis. A total of 796 medical cases were analyzed. About 54.1% (431) were male and 45.9% (365) were female giving a male: female ratio of 1.2:1 [Figure 1]. Six hundred and fifty patients (81.7%) were from Ilorin township and its immediate environs while 18.4% were from the neighboring states [Table 1]. Age range was 14‚Äì75 years with a mean age of 43.71 ¬± 4.92 years. Patients in the age group of 21‚Äì30 years were the modal age group (188, 23.6%) as seen in [Table 1]. Most of the patients who presented were self-employed in 48.2% (384) than unemployed 32.4% (258) and civil servant 19.4% (154) as seen in [Figure 2].{Figure 1}{Table 1}{Figure 2}About 58% (462) of our patients presented to the ED without a referral either from a primary or secondary health-care provider. Among those with referrals, private health-care facility accounted for the bulk of referrals in 16.7% (133) as seen in [Figure 3]. Eighty-four different diagnosis were captured in our study, the highest was stroke in 75 (9.4%), others were AIDS 66 (8.3%), diabetes mellitus and its complications in 59 (7.4%), systemic hypertension and complications in 52 (6.5%) then malaria in 49 (6.2%), sickle cell anemia in 37 (4.6%) and chronic heart failure in 21 (2.6%), others like dyspepsia, sepsis, acute renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, epilepsy, acute psychosis and chronic liver diseases constituted about 55% (438).{Figure 3}On the duration of stay in the ED, about 29% (231) stayed beyond 24 h on the ED before being moved to the ward, 26% (207) stayed more than 48 h, while 32.2% were either transferred or discharged within 24 h. For those who remained in the ED after 48 h, various reasons were provided by most of the patients why they are not transferred to the wards, about 39% of them were due to nonavailability of bed space, 54% were are due to financial constrai nt, and 7% have no specific reasons rather than they wanted to stay and be discharged from the ED.Overall, about 60.6% of the patients (483) were transferred to the ward for further management, 26.6% (212 patients) were discharged home from ED, most of whom were due to malaria, and 102 (12.8%) died. Mortality was recorded in 12.8% of the patients. The highest mortality was recorded among patients with the diagnosis of strokes in 17 (16.7%.) followed by sepsis syndrome in 11 (10.8%), AIDS and decompensated chronic liver disease in 11 (10.8%), 10 (9.8%), and 8 (8%), respectively, while other diagnosis constituted 45 (43.9%) of the mortality. DiscussionED is an integral part of the safety net services anywhere in the world.[13] Although EDs were originally designed for treating urgent and emergent conditions, they are increasingly being used by certain segments of the population as a provider of last resort for nonurgent care.[14],[15],[16],[17],[18] Emergency units are designed to accept walk-in patients and referrals.[18] We had 796 medical emergencies in our ED over a period of 12 months. The male: female ratio 1.2:1, which was similar to the findings in a similar center in the south-south region of Nigeria.[19],[20] The most frequent age group was 21‚Äì30 years and this may reflect the ease of access of this group to timely health care, and it also encompasses the economically active group. Mean age was 43.71 ¬± 4.92 years. These figures are similar to the findings of other authors.[1],[2],[3] Most of our patients were resident in Ilorin; however, our study did not differentiate whether they were immigrants or indigenous as there were no data to reference this information as compared to a study on emergency utilization in Barcelona by Buron et al. Government employees accounted for 19.4%, self-employed persons for 48.2%, and dependents (housewives, aged, students, and retirees) for 32.4%. Most patients were walk in about 58.8% similar to study elsewhere in Nigeria.[20],[21] This was at variance with the developed world where phone calls were used for utilization of emergency services.[22],[23] The referral pattern showed that 133 were referred from outside the hospital and 100 were in-house referral from the general outpatient department, which is the pattern reported in most work done in Nigeria. The most common diagnosis was stroke in 75 (9.4%) patients followed by immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS complication in 66 (8.3%), diabetes mellitus and its complications in 59 (7.4%), and then systemic hypertension (and its complications) and malaria fever. The World Health Organization had projected that diabetes mellitus and stroke would be the leading causes of morbidity in many developing countries by 2025.[24] The mean duration of stay at the A/E was 23.5 ¬± 7.21 h. The goal in ED is to stabilize a patient within 48 h of presentation. The most common reason for a prolonged stay was inadequate bed space on the specific wards, followed by financial constraints as some patients could not pay the admission fees as we live in a low-income setting where majority of the patients live on a daily income of <2USD and health-care service is out-of-pocket expenses. In Nigeria, out-of-pocket health care is the most common also called fee-for-service in our environment. As compared to the developed world where insurance takes care of the health of individuals either working with government or not, this may support the utilization rates. This further supports why most patients have delay in transit to the specific wards. Although for most patients, no reason was given for staying more than 24 h in the ED. The mortality was 12.8%, and this was quite higher than reports from other reports.[19],[22] About 482 (60.6%) were transferred to the ward, and 212 (26.6%) were discharged home. Stroke patients accounted for 16.7% of the mortality and also the highest number of those transferred to the ward with prolonged hospital stay. Other causes of mortality were acute diabetic emergencies, AIDS complications, and decompensated chronic liver disease, accounting for 12.7%, 7.8%, and 7.8%, respectively. This was similar to the findings of other investigators.[19] AIDS complication was the second leading cause for ward admission. Malaria fever accounted for the majority of the patients attended to and discharged within a short period in the ED, probably because they may have been adequately managed at a primary health-care facility rather than a tertiary one. Furthermore, 95.8% of those with diagnosis of malaria stayed <24 h. The most common problems encountered by the physician were insufficient diagnostic support usually in terms of radiologic imaging and the inability of the patients to do the required investigations for further medical care. This was similar to previous results. In 1% of the patients, there was difficulty communicating as there was nonavailability interpreter to explain to them the details of some requested investigation and treatment in the best language understood by them. ConclusionOur study showed that most of the patients were in the younger age group, males, and self-employed. Most patients were walk-in patients. The most common reason for presentation at the medical ED for admission was stroke which was also the leading cause of death. Inadequate bed space and financial constraints were responsible for prolonged stay in the EDs.Financial support and sponsorshipNil.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.

Jones takes the reader on a journey of pilgrimage, crusades and conquests, growth of markets, education and changes in religion from 410 AD to 1527AD.
This is the epic history of Viking invasions, the rise and fall of the Roman empire, with stories of lost treasure, adventures at sea and revolts, it‚Äôs sometimes easy to forget you‚Äôre reading nonfiction. Almost every aspect of history is mentioned, from conquests to education including the creation of Bologna University and it being the best place in the west to study law, the creation of Oxford and how the Plantagenets helped it begin to thrive.
The story of famed scholar Aquinas is not only interesting but Jones also adds humour especially in one line about perfume which I won‚Äôt spoil. I particularly enjoyed reading about Leonardo da Vinci and his life in Europe as well as Martin Luther, a man I am definitely wishing to learn even more about after reading this. It has certainly given me an interest in reading more about his life. The notes and bibliography have certainly given me much more future reading for my own interests. I love reading how things that happened so long ago are similar to recent events or how things had a lasting impact, even to this day.
This is certainly a big book but it‚Äôs incredible especially as Jones has a way of writing that is so entertaining. Although this book covers an extensive time frame there was not a single chapter that wasn‚Äôt interesting. Jones separates the book into four sections Imperium (c.410 AD ‚Äì 750 AD); Dominion (c.750 AD ‚Äì 1215 AD); Rebirth (c.1215 AD ‚Äì 1347 AD) and Revolution (c.1348 AD ‚Äì 1527 AD) making it very easy to focus on a specific era if that is your preference, unlike myself who devoured the whole thing and still wanted more. This is honestly the perfect book for anyone who wants to learn a bit of everything or focus on a specific era and whilst it may have taken me a while to read I was genuinely sad when I came to the end.

Traders at Birkenhead Market have weighed in on fresh new renderings depicting how the new market might appear.
This year, the future of the historic market has been a hotly debated matter.
After a response from traders, Wirral Council scrapped its original intention to shift traders from the existing site to a temporary market in St Werburghs Square until a permanent facility was ready.
The Met Office has issued a ‚Äòdanger to life‚Äô warning for Storm Arwen, which is expected to strike Liverpool.
However, stall owners appear to be far more enthusiastic about the proposed idea, which would see Birkenhead Market relocate to the former House of Fraser building on Grange Road.
The Washington Newsday paid a visit to the market today to inquire about the Wirral Council‚Äôs vision for the projected permanent new market.
Kevin Goodman, who owns a clothing booth at the current location, thought the image was ‚Äúquite modern,‚Äù which he didn‚Äôt think was a bad thing.
Mr Goodman was concerned that the new market might be difficult to find, but he believed the fresh new image was very open and apparent, which would be beneficial for attracting passing commerce.
Wirral Council‚Äôs proposal for the market also includes eliminating the town‚Äôs remaining two flyovers and making it easier to walk to the market from Birkenhead Central train station.
While admitting that the new market‚Äôs image was enticing, Billy Hill Curtains‚Äô Mike Eccles raised another important worry for several traders.
Mr Eccles said his main objection to the proposal was a lack of space, and he needed to know if the new stalls would be adequate for a company like his.
Sidhu Fashion owner Jas Sidhu predicted that more people would notice his stand in the new market, but he stressed that he would wait and see what happened next.
Mr Sidhu‚Äôs remarks mirror the anxiety felt by many traders following the pandemic‚Äôs struggles and the abandoned proposal to transfer the market to St Werburghs Square.
However, stall proprietors appear to be lot more optimistic about the future than they were this summer, when the temporary was in place. ‚ÄúThe summary has come to an end.‚ÄùWhile Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore have qualified for the playoffs, Kolkata look like a strong contender to grab the fourth spot. KKR have 12 points from 13 games. Significantly, they have an excellent net run rate of +0.294. So even if they lose their last match and are stuck on 12 points, this factor could work in their favor.
All is not lost for RR and MI though. Both have two games left and if they can win those two, they will remain in contention for the last playoff spot. Rajasthan will go into Tuesday‚Äôs clash with some degree of confidence. They stunned CSK with a breathtaking batting performance to ace what seemed like a difficult chase. As for MI, things have gone horribly wrong for them. The defending champions have lost four of their last five games.
RR would not want to make too many changes in the line-up. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Evin Lewis delivered the goods at the top and Shivam Dube made an impact in his first game of the UAE leg. Rahul Tewatia also stood out with the ball. This is exactly what skipper Sanju Samson needed from the other players.
RR‚Äôs predicted XI: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Evin Lewis, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Glenn Phillips, Mahipal Lomror, Shivam Dube, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Kartik Tyagi, Chetan Sakariya, Mustafizur Rahman
MI‚Äôs batting crumbled miserably against DC in the last game. While Suryakumar Yadav‚Äôs form is a worry, skipper Rohit Sharma and Quinton de Kock also haven‚Äôt delivered at the top. The inclusion of Nathan Coulter-Nile has strengthened the bowling but MI have failed to find the winning formula.
MI‚Äôs predicted XI: Rohit Sharma (c), Quinton de Kock (w), Suryakumar Yadav, Saurabh Tiwary, Krunal Pandya, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jayant Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult
Top fantasy picks for RR vs MI clash: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rahul Tewatia, Mustafizur Rahman, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Saurabh Tiwary, Trent Boult

A mildly crude and mostly elegant telling of the Yukon
Yukon is a well-kept secret in the middle of fucking nowhere, Canada. As one of its 3 territories, it has a small population leaving wide expanses of untouched nature. And when I say small population, I mean less than 0.08 people per square kilometre. Since there are so few people, the majority of the environment has been undeveloped making it the perfect place for those looking to connect with nature.
Yukon is known as the land of the midnight sun as in summer the sun doesn't set till about 1 or 2 am and rises about 2 to 3 hours later. However, in winter, the sun sets around 3:30 pm and rises at around 10 am. For those living here, this means going to work in the dark and coming home in the dark. You might think that sounds pretty fucking depressing, which it is. Yet it gave rise to our biggest festival; Rendezvous. Rendezvous is a festival that signifies the end of cabin fever which is why it takes place smack dab in the middle of February. A month so cold, your nipples could cut diamond. But if you're brave enough to visit in the winter you'd get to experience all the festivities such as the chainsaw chuck, the log throw, the flour pack, the one dog pull, the axe throw, and many, many more. If you want to see the living, breathing Canadian stereotype, look no further.
Rendezvous also hosts the Yukon Quest, the toughest dog sled race in the world. There is also an international snow sculpture carving competition because yep. If you're feeling a bit chilly, you can also pop down to the Tahkini hot springs to partake in the hair freezing competition. Not to mention, everyone's favourite part of Rendezvous, the sourdough pancake breakfast. If you've never had sourdough pancakes, you have not lived. They are the fluffiest, most glorious god damn pancakes in the world that make people drool like a bulldog on a mildly warm day. Definitely worth the trip. However, I understand that most people are not cut out to risk the -40‚ÑÉ temperature but fear not, there's plenty to do in summer as well.
Snow Sculpture Competition
Hair Freezing Contest
Yukon Quest
Summer is our busiest tourist season. People come from all over the world, but especially USA and Germany to experience our wide open spaces, beautiful landscapes and breathable air, which was ranked the cleanest air in the world by the World Health Organization (no big deal). We have plenty of hiking trails and gorgeous turquoise lakes which host excellent fishing.
Anyone looking to see some wildlife can head to the Yukon Wildlife Preserve and see Yukon‚Äôs native animals in their natural environment. With 700 acres of land, you can learn about all the species they have as well as their conservation efforts.
For those who might want to get up close and personal with some long extinct animals, you can head over to the Beringia Centre where you'll find various ice age specimens including the mighty mammoth and the sabre-tooth tiger. These are the animals that inhabited the massive fucking land bridge that connected Alaska to Russia during the ice age. Aren‚Äôt we lucky that was gone before the cold war.
If you‚Äôre looking for more recent history, you can visit the McBride Museum which details Yukon's past with a heavy focus on the Klondike gold rush with out which, the Yukon would not be what it is today. Literally, most of our cities didn‚Äôt exist before the gold rush. Speaking of the gold rush, you can also head up to Dawson City which is pretty much still in its gold rush state. While you‚Äôre there, you can stop into Diamond Tooth Gerties; the only casino in the Yukon. But before you leave, make sure you try the famous Sour Toe Cocktail. It involves placing a mummified human toe into a spirit of your choosing and drinking until the toe touches your lips. Be careful not to swallow the toe, it‚Äôs a $2500 fine if you do and you‚Äôre also responsible for procuring a new toe. After completing your drink, you will officially be inducted into the sourtoe cocktail club, what an honour.
While there is plenty to do in either season, I say either because we only have two, the Yukon is also a place to relax. In a short 15 minute walk, you can find yourself completely secluded with not a person around. Left only with the sound of the wind and the birds. Yukon is larger than life and will leave you with a breathtaking experience. Whether you‚Äôre climbing Mount Logan, the tallest mountain in Canada, rafting the Tatshenshini or even just sitting by a campfire roasting hotdogs, you‚Äôll find something for everyone here and you may just want to stay.A couple of years ago, BuzzFeed asked a former White House official to explain the logic behind some bizarre Trump action. The official responded with one of the master quotes of the Trump era.
President Trump, the official said, is not playing ‚Äúthe sort of three-dimensional chess people ascribe to decisions like this. More often than not he‚Äôs just eating the pieces.‚Äù
...
Trump‚Äôs psychology is defined by his terror of rejection. The most stinging insult in his vast vocabulary of disdain is loser. And yet every poll, every powerful Biden TV ad, forces Trump to contemplate that he is headed toward a historic humiliation. He‚Äôll stand with Jimmy Carter and Herbert Hoover, the incumbents rejected because they failed to manage economic crises.
Trump failed to prevent the crisis. Out of envy and spite, he dismantled the pandemic-warning apparatus his predecessors had bequeathed him.
Trump failed to manage the crisis. At every turn, he gave priority to the short-term management of the stock market instead.
Trump failed to message the crisis. He not only lacks empathy; he despises empathy.
Angry, scared, and aggrieved by the lack of praise for his efforts, Trump turns for safety to television, where his two-dimensional friends explain how everything is everybody else‚Äôs fault. They tell him that he is right and all his critics are wrong. They promise that miracle drugs will‚Äîpoof!‚Äîmake all his troubles vanish without effort. Sean and Tucker and Laura and Jeanine and the Fox & Friends romper room tell him stories that hold the terror at bay.
But those stories have drawn Trump into a twisting ghetto of craziness that is impenetrable to outsiders.
...
The more Trump talks about his crackpot theories, the more he reveals why he plunged the country into such a catastrophe. He never cared about anybody else. He ignored unwelcome realities, because only fantasy flattered his ego as it required to be flattered....
But the most important thing to notice about the Trump-Fox blizzard of mania is how remote it is from anything that real-world voters care about. In 2015, Trump apprehended that most Republicans were talking about things that Republican voters did not then care about: deficits, taxes, productivity, and trade. In 2015, Trump apprehended that nobody was talking about things that Republican voters did care about: immigration, drugs, the declining status of less educated white men..

'Obama was mean to me.. bullied me.. wah wah..
and nobody was strong enough to help me out.. wah'
But that's always been Trump.. and its always what his family is about..
.. at his very basis.. Trump is a 'suck'.. the old schoolyard insult..
& his family are sucks.. everything about him sucks
Trump is a suck to be sure, Sal. It's part of his pathology. It manifests in his utter absence of empathy for anyone else. I think in school we called that a "whiny bitch."
Never has it seemed more apt to observe that the emperor has no clothes, Mound. Yet his courtiers still follow him slavishly with made-to-measure accouterments, desperately trying to hide his increasingly obvious and repulsive nudity.
For me, what differentiates Trump and the pandemic is that I don't loathe Covid-19. I despise Donald Trump.

(WSYR-TV) ‚Äî Upstate Medical University is looking for people to participate in a clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine.
The study is part of a national multi-center study to evaluate the safety and performance of a vaccine for the coronavirus.
Some individuals will receive a placebo while others will receive the vaccine. It will be completely random and most of the study team won‚Äôt know who has received the placebo and who received the vaccine either.
‚ÄúIndividuals who volunteer for this study will help advance our understanding of whether this vaccine has the potential to protect people and work toward ending the pandemic,‚Äù said the Chief of Upstate‚Äôs Infectious Disease Division Dr. Stephen Thomas.
NewsChannel 9 spoke with Thomas on Wednesday about the trial:
To be eligible for the study, you must be in good health, between the ages of 18 to 85, and be able to make a two-year commitment to the study. If you have tested positive for COVID-19 you are not eligible to participate.
Participants are required to provide blood samples for up to two years and be subject to up to 10 visits during that time period. Upstate says the two-year time frame is important for the study to assess the long-term safety and immune response of the vaccine.
During the first two study visits, participants will receive an injection and nasal swab tests for COVID-19. Other visits will include blood samples.
For seven days after the initial visits, participants are required to complete an e-diary daily for specific reactions.
Participants will be compensated for being part of the study.
If interested, you can call 315-464-9869 or email trials@Upstate.edu for more information.The vocal band 4accord takes the audience on a musical journey to the southern states of the USA, home of the Southern Gospel and touches the scene of some well-known country and pop songs.

A myriad of young adults, juveniles, and hatchlings watch you enter. The youngest of them retreat into an icy tunnel to hide.
"Welcome to Starweaver's Sanctuary, stranger."
The dragoness stands tall and dignified, but there is warmth and compassion in her pale blue eyes as they study the newcomer intently, trying to discern the meaning of their arrival.
"Be you foe, then flee now before my wrath undoes you. But be you friend, you are welcome to stay a while. My charges study the stars here, hone their skills in survival and teamwork, then seek to find their destinies. Perhaps today someone's destiny has sought them?"
In good humor, she laughs, her voice the deep and musical tones of the sea.
"Come, then, walk these dens and see if one of my many children will find their purpose by joining you. I only allow those fully grown to leave, howver; the hatchlings stay with me until I am certain they can survive on their own."

Almost every modern movie monster will encounter this situation. Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers will start a terrifying evil image, lurking in the shadows, often pursuing a brave heroine. Then, in the third or fourth part, the audience is already familiar with the ghouls in question, and perhaps to some extent, began to support them and everything they promised: unlikely resurrection, elaborate killings, killer generals Go back to another sequel in a year or two.
It‚Äôs not that these monsters have become less scary, although it did happen. More importantly, being the face of their series makes them de facto heroes. After all, the protagonists of horror movies are rarely seen repeatedly in movies; Screaming is an exception to the proof rule, where three beloved characters have survived multiple movies, partly because the identity of the masked killer is a surprise, not the same old murderer. In most other horror series, it is the monster that keeps the whole thing going.
However, some horror movies have developed an inverse metaphor: the monster appears in the form of a young woman, usually a teenager with complex emotions. Although the most famous (and sequel) contemporary movie monsters are often indifferent killers, unknowable and often masked, and their humanity is concealed or non-existent, monster girls are more obviously psychologically motivated. It is not obvious in the sense of the tragic background story, but in the sense of externalizing the different combinations of growth‚Äôs by-products of anger, confusion, and turmoil. (So ‚Äùgirls‚Äù, not ‚Äúwomen‚Äù; although not every monster girl is literally a teenager, most of them are either young or socially awkward, so much so that they will encounter this situation .)
Sometimes monster girls repeat familiar monster forms, such as Ginger. The girl‚Äôs adolescent changes include becoming a werewolf gingerbread; Vampire Let the right people in or A girl goes home alone at night; Or title character possible, He is more than just a misguided Dr. Frankenstein.Sometimes they create their own hybrids, such as Liming, a heroine who supports abstinence teeth Suffering from vaginal dental disease, or sharing devil who eats boys Jennifer‚Äôs body. Sometimes, they don‚Äôt have obvious supernatural phenomena‚Äîthe role in them Neon Demon And recently titanium Probably qualified. What these sometimes very different movies share is the feeling that the characters‚Äô experiences as young women in the world form their own horror performances.
The metaphor of the monster girl can sometimes be played like the upside-down of a horror movie The last girl: Rather than facing external threats, the girl claims that she has been threatened with destructiveness, and then interacts with another girl who is instinctive or not succumbing to her inner demons (such as the one in Needy). Jennifer‚Äôs body, Or Brigitte gingerbread). But Monster Girl is not a direct product of a bloody movie-nor is it a bad seed children‚Äôs horror movie, it is also very similar.It has its own touchstone: the Brian de Palma thriller of the late 70s Carrie with angerFor example, both feature young women who are spiritually motivated. Carrie Establishing a struggle between the sympathetic monster girl and the constant ‚Äúgood‚Äù girl can be said to be a brilliant hedge against the outcast status of the title character. Although most of the film is based on the perspective of the introverted and socially awkward Kelly White (Sisi Spicer), some scenes assume Sue Snell (Amy Owen). In the POV, she is a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù girl who tried to help Carrie but failed. anger There are more points of view, coupled with spy-like conspiracy, which makes it a more distracting experience, rather than immediately entering the emotions of its young heroine (this time, Owen played a woman who cannot be ignored). Nevertheless, it still has a similar bloody intensity.
Carrie Associating her bloody climax with the rituals of Girls‚Äô Generation, both physical (because Carrie was afraid and confused about her late period) and social (through Carrie confronting her classmates‚Äô cruelty, which was triggered in the early days of the movie) Her power, and finally realize her final revenge). The metaphor of the monster girl is almost always associated with these physical and/or psychological changes in one way or another: gingerbread, Ginger‚Äôs werewolf bite was caused by delay, and teeth‚Äòs Dawn combines her body weaponization (first accident, then clear purpose) with her sexual awakening.This may not be accidental Snap, teeth, possible, Let the right people in, with Jennifer‚Äôs body All of this appeared in the 2000s. Following the pop culture domination of young female pop singers, they received public attention because of their appearance and sexual orientation. They were also sought after by tabloids and scorned by men. They gave them a superficiality. Sexual fantasies. (Many horror fans will laugh at these singers as pop pie; in 2004 Chaki‚Äôs SeedsFor example, the murder of an off-screen version of Britney Spears is a joke. ) Neon DemonA little further away from those days, it‚Äôs about young things, in fact, to keep young, fresh, and aspirational.
:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960686/teeth_2007_bathtub.jpg)
Although these movies are not entirely fantasies of revenge for girl power, many of them have found a more organic way to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the complex ethics of horror movie killings. Not all monster girl victims deserve their tricky ending, and the opposing girl sometimes protests there.However, it is a satisfying feeling to see bastards, imps, bullies and rapists being punished for insults, because they are teeth, Or at orgasm Let the right people inAdmittedly, this is no less than a half-naked couple followed by a masked person, and sometimes repetition can be numb. teethFor example, although cunning, it relies on very limited skills. But the monster girl has a way to defend and alleviate the bloodthirsty of modern horror movies at the same time: it is interesting to see some victims get compensated while watching the monster girl lose herself in the violence (Jennifer‚Äôs body),Lonely(possible), or both (Carrie) Still disturbing. And because the competition between male heroes and powerful women can be so cunning, these movies usually create a space where multiple female characters control the narrative. Even when they finally fight each other, it tends to sting more than a girl superhero fighting a designated maid.
Perhaps this is why there are relatively few ‚Äúboy‚Äù monsters in the monster girl mode. Horror films have always included sympathetic monsters portrayed or coded as males (cosmic monsters sometimes inspire as much mercy as fear), but they tend to have a more biological appearance.Murloc Shape of water Romance with human women (and more); by designing him to be more like a creature from a black lagoon than a sea king-like sea-king hunk, this movie replaces a negligence (human appearance concealing a terrible ability) with Another type (the terrible appearance conceals human sensitivity). R, the zombie played by Nicholas Holt warm bodies, Closer to the gender-reversal version of the monster girl metaphor, his zombie nature must be greatly softened-it is revealed that he is evolving back to a more humane form-in order for the movie to reach its mark, which is more romantic-com is more than horror, anyway .
Even when they delve into black comedy or avoid traditional panic, Monster Girl‚Äôs movies are more terrifying, even though they don‚Äôt rely much on the creepy atmosphere. Familiar scenes, such as old dark huts, rustling in the woods, or creaking corridors of suburban houses, may appear, but these stories do not need to isolate their characters from society (and in many cases, separate Social dynamics don‚Äôt work). The special hell of the characters is also often related to their bodies, and they are better at tracking them everywhere than the Buji people.
titanium Make this part of the story: its anti-hero spent most of the movie in her own life, where she committed multiple episodes between performances as a semi-famous exotic dancer (of some kind) Horrible, murderous murder. She left scars in childhood accidents. This kind of unruly behavior is common among children and can easily be called terrible by parents. Throughout the movie, her body is constantly changing, sometimes it is her own design, sometimes it is a physical horror plot device that has never been fully explained; it is at the same time the object of desire, fear and transcendence. titanium Many of its cousins understand that the metaphor of the monster girl can be liberated or familiar, looking for horror and beauty in the girl‚Äôs world, both are not lacking.Keys for a Successful Design of Retail Packaging

Moreover, give consumers the reason why they should choose the brand over different products. At the same time, the statement of Why-To-Buy permits you to clear as well as simply communicate what product does, what consumer may get from using the product, and their uniqueness from the most competitive offerings immediately. Generally, statement of Why-To-Buy is written in big bold letter on Custom product packaging which is even legible from far afield, and it is also situated close to the top of the package.

What is LockDown Browser?
Respondus LockDown Browser is an application that can be used to for quizzes in Canvas. It allows the teacher to require that students open and use LockDown Browser on an iPad, MacBook, or Chromebook. When students use LockDown Browser, they cannot open other applications, take screenshots, copy/paste, or get to other parts of Canvas until they have submitted the quiz they are taking.
For iPad users, this is a more secure method for testing than using Apple Classroom because students cannot turn their device off or access other parts of Canvas until they have completed the quiz.
Why use it?
This allows you a little peace of mind when administering a quiz through Canvas. Students will not be able to cheat easily, take screenshots, or view notes.
How do I use it?
Written Directions
1. For any quiz you already have in your Canvas course, you can use LockDown Browser. Simply click on the LockDown Browser navigation button in your course, find the quiz you would like to have students take, and click on Modify Settings.
2. Select the button to ‚ÄúRequire Respondus LockDown Browser for this exam‚Äù and then you can choose if you‚Äôd like students to only be able to view feedback and results in Respondus as well. You can also set an access code for this exam which you can verbally tell students in class so they are only taking it when you are present.
3. Click on Advanced Settings. They include a checkbox setting for using LockDown Browser on iPads. You can also change the settings to give students a calculator to use, access links outside of Canvas, and more. It is recommended to use an access code for quizzes as well so that students do not take the quiz before they are supposed. If your students use iPads, you must check the setting to "allow students to take this exam with an iPad."

The superstar and the athletics and fashion giant are preparing to release Ivy Park Rodeo, the fourth Ivy Park offering, Adidas announced on Friday (Aug. 6).
‚ÄúInspired by the inimitable style and undeniable influence of Black cowboys and cowgirls, the ‚ÄòIVY Park Rodeo‚Äô collection celebrates the formidable impact of Black men and women on American Western culture,‚Äù an Adidas news release states. ‚ÄúThe collection celebrates the oft-hidden history of Black pioneers within cowboy and cowgirl culture and their continued influence and impact on the American Rodeo.‚Äù
The Rodeo collection includes 58 apparel styles and five footwear styles for adults, along with 13 accessories, according to the announcement. Features include ‚Äúunique denim monograms and bold purple glow cow prints.‚Äù Clothing options include a ‚Äúdenim body suit,‚Äù a ‚Äúwide-leg snap pant,‚Äù a denim tracksuit and a hoodie and sweatpants made from French terry.
For customers who will wear their new acquisitions out on the range, the collection includes denim chaps, a denim bucket hat and shoes made to look as if they were fashioned from denim.
The announcement comes amid two complementary trends: African-American history drawing new interest from corporate America and the entertainment establishment and attendance at athletics events and gyms showing continued recovery from initial COVID-19-related shutdowns.

While chaps might be the ultimate outerwear, Adidas is also expanding its participation in the underwear market, the company announced in June. The company reached an agreement that will have Israeli private-label clothing manufacturer and distributor Delta Alil Industries Ltd. selling Adidas-branded underwear.

The ‚Äô70s disco funk reawakening has arrived, and Victoria Mon√©t is leading the charge in an emerald green jacket so sparkly it reflects the music of the past. On March 18, Mon√©t played a live session of the title track off her 2020 album Jaguar. Mon√©t accompanied her performance of the funk-inspired song with some equally groovy dance moves that have us experiencing a major blast to the past. Since the video went live, fans of Mon√©t‚Äôs funk-infused R&B style have rallied for her to do a collaboration with H.E.R. or Silk Sonic, Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak‚Äôs new band that performed at the Grammys on Sunday.
The live session comes less than a month after Mon√©t gave birth to her baby girl Hazel Mon√©t Gaines, whom she had with boyfriend John Gaines, on Feb. 21.

Like many people unfamiliar with the Bluegrass State, I previously had a lot of assumptions about it. However, the state is much more than meets the eye, and it is home to some incredible destinations. This list breaks down the best, including wonderful cities, neat towns, beautiful parks, unique stops, and more:
Cities & Towns
40. Louisville
As Kentucky‚Äôs largest city, Louisville is a hub for nearly everything that makes this state special. You‚Äôll find countless venues to see live bluegrass shows, race tracks with the country‚Äôs most impressive horses, and some amazing Southern cooking. Not only that, but Louisville is bursting with culture and has a thriving art community.
Here are a few must-visit spots in this vibrant city:
39. Frankfort Avenue
As far as places to go in Louisville, this is one of the best to check out as soon as you get into town. Frankfort Avenue, aka ‚ÄúThe Avenue,‚Äù is a long corridor that connects the city‚Äôs most hip and happening neighborhoods. Along it, you‚Äôll see local businesses galore, from boutiques to galleries to mom ‚Äòn‚Äô pop restaurants.
38. Fairmount Falls Park
On the outskirts of Louisville is Fairmount Falls, one of the city‚Äôs hidden natural gems. Visiting feels like discovering a Louisville secret that not many other tourists get to experience. The waterfall is tucked away in the forest, about a mile‚Äôs hike from the trail entrance.
To get to this gorgeous waterfall, you can make a reservation to access the park at Jefferson Memorial Forest Welcome Center. Since only three cars are allowed in the park per day, a reservation nearly guarantees you‚Äôll have the falls almost all to yourself.
37. Churchill Downs
Churchill Downs is as famous as it gets when it comes to Louisville institutions. The two longest continuously running sporting events in the US are held at Churchill Downs: the Kentucky Derby and the all-female Kentucky Oaks races. Even if you aren‚Äôt in town during one of those, check the events calendar to see what else is going on at the race track during you visit.
36. Muhammad Ali Center
The famous boxer-turned-philanthropist Muhammad Ali is a Louisville native and certainly engenders a generous amount of hometown pride. Opened in 2005, the Muhammad Ali Center is a nonprofit museum that serves to demonstrate Ali‚Äôs six core principles: confidence, conviction, dedication, giving, respect, and spirituality. It‚Äôs one of the most inspirational museums in Kentucky. Find more information here.
35. Louisville Mega Cavern
Adventure seekers will not want to miss out on a visit to the Louisville Mega Cavern, the world‚Äôs only underground aerial ropes course. This former 1930s mine site has 17 miles of corridors that you can explore via Historic Tram Tour or walking tour, on which you can learn about the history and geology of the caverns. This is one of the top places to see in all of Kentucky, let alone Louisville!
34. Cherokee Park
Did you know that Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed NYC‚Äôs Central Park, also designed Cherokee Park in Louisville? It‚Äôs true! His eye for design is evident in the Park, which features quaint woodlands, open meadows, rolling hills, and trickling streams. That‚Äôs right, you can enjoy all of that natural beauty without having to leave Louisville‚Äôs city limits.
33. Lexington
Lexington is Kentucky‚Äôs second largest city and is spilling over with history, Southern charm, and unique places to visit. As the country‚Äôs horse capital, you‚Äôll find loads of opportunities to learn about the city‚Äôs horse racing and breeding legacy. Not only that but Lexington is in the heart of bluegrass country and packs a big punch with its rich bourbon culture.
Here are some of the best places to visit in or near Lexington:
32. Keeneland Race Track
Keeneland is an internationally renowned racecourse committed to preserving the tradition of thoroughbred horse racing. The track is open to the public, so you don‚Äôt have to attend an actual race to take in its beautifully landscaped gardens and pristine grandstand. The place captures the essence of horse racing culture and prestige. This tour includes a stop at Keeneland with an expert guide.
31. Ashland: Henry Clay Estate
As far as historic places in Kentucky, this is easily one of the most famous. Henry Clay was one of Kentucky‚Äôs most well-known statesmen, and Ashland was his home during the height of his career. The Henry Clay Memorial Foundation has an interesting way of telling the stories of people who lived, worked, and were enslaved at the Ashland estate. This guided tour is a great way to get the most out of your visit.
30. Kentucky Horse Park
If you can‚Äôt get enough of horse-related attractions, Kentucky Horse Park is the ultimate destination. Not only does the park have a fully operational horse farm, but it also houses the Smithsonian International Museum of the Horse. You could easily spend a day visiting this equine treasure in Lexington.
29. Raven Run Nature Sanctuary
This pristinely preserved nature sanctuary in Lexington is the ultimate nature lover‚Äôs paradise. Across 734 acres, there are over 10 miles of trails to enjoy. Spend a warm summer afternoon hiking, biking, or picnicking here. Visiting in fall? The autumn colors in Raven Run Nature Sanctuary are gorgeous!
28. Jacobson Park
On 216 acres of land, Jacobson Park includes a large reservoir perfect for kayaking, paddleboarding, or just hanging out on the grass near the shore. The park also has volleyball courts, a disc golf course, and more. Of all the green spaces in Lexington, this one is one of the best for a quiet afternoon in nature.
27. Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill
Just 45 minutes outside of Lexington is Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill. Travelers from all over the world visit Shaker Village each year to get a glimpse into the past of a society that was able to thrive off the land.The Shakers were a religious community that was active in Pleasant Hill from 1805 to 1910.
This 3,000-acre landmark is one of the most well-preserved sites of Shaker history. The nonprofit organization Shaker Village has worked hard to maintain the 34 original historic structures, a nature preserve, and conserved farmland on the site. You can even stay in Shaker Village‚Äôs inn!
26. Bardstown
As the home of nine famous bourbon distilleries, Bardstown is one of Kentucky‚Äôs most notable bourbon destinations. Not only that, but the town also has the Bardstown Civil War Museum, the fourth-largest such museum in the country. It is also home to Kentucky‚Äôs ‚Äúofficial outdoor drama‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Stephen Foster Story‚Äù) and even has an entire exhibit dedicated to women‚Äôs roles in the war.
Bardstown has a picturesque town square and is overall a beautiful little town to visit. You can book an entire weekend getaway there, complete with plenty of bourbon-filled experiences, here.
25. Frankfort
Known to have one of the most beautiful capitol buildings in the country, this small capital city deserves a spot on your Kentucky bucket list. Located along the Kentucky River between Louisville and Lexington, Frankfort is perfectly tucked into the green hills and is surrounded by nature. Here you‚Äôll find outdoor adventure, historical relics, and, of course, plenty of bourbon.
24. Bowling Green
As one of Kentucky‚Äôs many bustling college towns, Bowling Green has a unique mix of new and old, historic and innovative. You‚Äôll find venerable neighborhoods complete with colonial architecture and manicured lawns, as well as some of Kentucky‚Äôs best museums. One of them is the National Corvette Museum, which takes visitors on a journey through the iconic history of America‚Äôs sports car.
Bowling Green is also the perfect launching point for Mammoth Cave National Park (more on that later!), so consider staying here a night or two during your Kentucky adventure to make the most of this attraction-filled area.
23. Newport
If you are an American history enthusiast, you won‚Äôt want to miss out on a visit to Newport. This quaint riverside community was once set to become what is now Las Vegas. In fact, the town was once home to many casinos and was frequented by none other than Frank Sinatra, who performed there. Even Las Vegas‚Äôs nickname, ‚ÄúSin City,‚Äù was first applied to Newport before it was given to Las Vegas.
Since Newport is so close to Cincinnati, Ohio, you can take a sunset cruise to see the Cincinnati skyline from Newport.
22. London
This one is for all the cyclists out there! London is one of Kentucky‚Äôs designated ‚Äútrail towns,‚Äù because of its access to road cycling, mountain biking, and hiking trails. It‚Äôs next to Daniel Boone National Forest, so nature lovers find London the perfect place to stay while they explore nearby parks, trails, and forests.
21. Paducah
Known as ‚ÄúThe Quilt City,‚Äù Paducah is America‚Äôs quilt-making capital. In fact, UNESCO dubbed Paducah a City of Crafts and Folk Art in 2013. You can learn about this legacy at the National Quilt Museum.
As soon as you arrive in Paducah, you‚Äôll realize that this small town is anything but ordinary. The visitor‚Äôs center is housed in a restored 1860s mansion, which truly sets the stage for a historic adventure. Enjoy the town‚Äôs peace and quiet with a walk along the river and a stroll through town to see the historic buildings.
20. Owensboro
Owensboro is a small city packed full of all the things that make Kentucky great. It has some of the state‚Äôs best barbecue joints, bluegrass music venues, and art museums.
Check out the Owensboro Museum of Fine Art, where you‚Äôll find a sculpture park and folk art dating back to the 15th century.
Owensboro is famous for its mutton barbeque, so if you‚Äôre a meat eater you shouldn‚Äôt leave town without trying it at either Old Hickory Bar-B-Que or Ole South Bar-B-Q.
19. International Bluegrass Music Museum
No trip to Owensboro is complete without a stop at the International Bluegrass Music Museum. We are listing this place all on its own because it‚Äôs easily one of the top attractions in the state. Even if you‚Äôre new to bluegrass music, this museum is sure to keep you entertained all day long with its interactive exhibits and nuggets of history throughout. You‚Äôll see a variety of neat vintage instruments, learn about the genre‚Äôs most influential musicians, and see the evolution of the genre over the years.
Get your tickets here.
18. Stanton
This is the ultimate destination for adventure seekers in Kentucky. Stanton is the perfect launching point for hiking and biking trails, with direct access to the Red River Gorge Byway. The Red River Gorge has over a hundred stone arches and several waterfalls, along with the picturesque Nada Tunnel. It also has a unique landscape that is waiting to be explored.
National Parks, State Parks, and More
17. Mammoth Cave National Park
Mammoth Cave National Park is one of the most beloved places in Kentucky. This amazing natural wonder is home to the longest recorded cave system in the world, at over 400 miles explored and mapped. Cave tours are an excellent way to get familiar with some of the park‚Äôs most notable caves.
Not only is the park adored for its natural beauty, but it also holds many stories from the people who used to reside there, from the original settlements of Native Americans to colonial settlers to the African Americans who were the most important guides and explorers of the caves in the 19th and 20th centuries.
16. Daniel Boone National Forest
You may recognize the name Daniel Boone if you‚Äôre into outdoorsman history. This massive forest spans more than two million acres and offers over 600 miles of trails to explore. Sandstone cliffs are perfect for rock climbing, and the abundance of rivers and lakes creates the perfect environment for those who enjoy getting out on the water. Although many of the trails were originally intended only for hiking, mountain biking is possible in many locations. Backpackers and other campers will enjoy the many forest campgrounds.
15. Cumberland Gap National Historical Park
The mountainous scenery at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park is just one of the many reasons to pay a visit. Beyond the stunning views from hidden overlooks, you‚Äôll find epic sandstone formations, abundant underground caverns, and plenty of plant and animal life everywhere.
There‚Äôs a wealth of history to uncover here. This amazing national historical park is home to the Hensley Settlement, which gives visitors a time-warping look at a 20th century mountain community settlement. The Wilderness Road Trail will take you on an equally exciting journey in the footsteps of Native Americans, early settlers, and Civil War soldiers.
14. Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area
As one of the largest areas of undeveloped forest in the United States, the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area is about as rugged as it gets. Stretching over 170,000 acres of forests and wetlands, there‚Äôs plenty of nature to admire here. There are 300 miles of natural shoreline, offering opportunities to camp, picnic, hike, and bike.
In addition to 500 miles of trails throughout the park to enjoy, you can visit the Woodlands Nature Station, Elk & Bison Prairie, Homeplace 1850s Working Farm, or Golden Pond Planetarium and Observatory for authentic educational experiences.
Land Between the Lakes is also the ideal place for a road trip, with incredible scenic drives and walks.
13. Cumberland Falls State Park
If you want to see something nearly as majestic as Niagara Falls without leaving the South, make sure to add Cumberland Falls State Park to your Kentucky itinerary. It gets its nickname, ‚Äúthe Niagara of the South,‚Äù due to the 68-foot tall and 125-foot wide waterfall. One of the coolest things about this waterfall, besides its immense size, is that it‚Äôs one of the few places in the world where you can see a moonbow, aka a lunar rainbow. If the sky is clear on the night of a full moon, you might be able to see one in all of its magnificent glory.
In addition to the obvious visit to the falls, Cumberland Falls State Park is overflowing with adventurous things to do (see what I did there?). Go birding in the park, rafting on the Cumberland River, camping at one of the 50 campsites, or hiking on 17 miles of trails. You can even try your hand at gem mining.
12. Breaks Interstate Park
Located right on the Kentucky-Virginia state border is the severely underrated Breaks Interstate Park. Spanning 3,500 acres of greenwood lands full of mountainous scenery, this is one of only two interstate parks in the country. This gorgeous natural area has the largest canyon east of the Mississippi River, which spans five miles and is 1,650 feet deep, earning its nickname ‚Äúthe Grand Canyon of the South.‚Äù
Breaks Interstate Park is a haven for rock climbers, campers, and hikers alike. No matter how you choose to enjoy the park, you‚Äôre certainly in for a treat.
11. Big South Fork National River
Big South Fork National River is often referred to as a giant outdoor playground, and for good reason. This 125,000-acre recreation area features rugged gorges and pristine forests, along with numerous streams and, of course, the thunderous Big South Fork of the Cumberland River.
Outdoor activities at the Big South Fork National River include hiking through forests and gorges, horseback riding, rock climbing sandstone cliffs, and paddling and swimming in crystal-clear waters. This recreation area is also an ideal place to camp and backpack.
10. The Pinnacles of Berea
In 2019, Outside Magazine named the Pinnacles of Berea hike the #1 hike in Kentucky. If that isn‚Äôt enough to spark your curiosity, visitors who enjoy peace and quiet love this hike because of its sparse crowds and incredible views of the Daniel Boone National Forest.
This stellar hike is easy to get to from Berea, Kentucky, and is even a great spot to stay while you visit Red River Gorge and other big nearby attractions. Having such an awesome hike like the Pinnacles Hike is just the cherry on top.
9. My Old Kentucky Home State Park
This is a state park unlike any other. You probably associate state parks with hiking trails and the great outdoors, but some of this park‚Äôs best feature are actually indoors. It‚Äôs home to the estate of US Sen. John Rowan, which holds two hundred years of stories, from duels to horse racing to family fortunes and everything in between. You can tour the mansion and hear guides sing a special song on every tour.
Horse Farms
8. Sun Valley Horse Farm
This classic horse farm‚Äôs slogan is ‚ÄúAt the Crossroad of Bourbon & Horses.‚Äù It makes a neat connection between horses and bourbon through its ties to bourbon pioneer Elijah Pepper. The best way to experience Sun Valley is on a guided tour, which leads guests through the farm to witness the inner workings of an award-winning thoroughbred horse farm nursery.
7. Hermitage Farm
Hermitage Farm is more than just a horse farm and nursery. Beyond running a renowned thoroughbred operation, the farm also prides itself on its sustainable and organic agriculture. You can even get a taste of Heritage Farm‚Äôs farm-fresh produce at its Barn8 Farm Restaurant.
In the mood for some bourbon? You can do a bourbon tasting featuring products from any of the distilleries on the Kentucky Bourbon trail.
This farm offers a truly well-rounded view of Kentucky‚Äôs rich agricultural culture and history. Choose from a number of tours and tastings at Hermitage Farm to get the most out of your visit.
6. Claiborne Farm
This one is for the history buffs out there. Claiborne Farm is one of the most iconic thoroughbred horse farms in Kentucky, best known for being the final resting place of one of the most famous horses in history, Secretariat.
Claiborne Farm offers historic tours of the on-site facilities, taking guests on a journey through the farm‚Äôs origin story up until present day with a look at how the working farm takes care of the stunning beauties that live there.
Unique Stops
5. The Pete Treehouse
This completely off-grid treehouse was part of Animal Planet‚Äôs Treehouse Masters and is now one of the coolest Airbnbs you‚Äôll find in Kentucky. Pete Nelson is the mastermind behind the construction of the treehouse, which is tucked away in nature about 1.5 hours from Lexington. The place is full of thoughtful touches, including a fire pit and balcony.
After watching Kristin‚Äôs treehouse adventure, you‚Äôre probably getting excited about staying in a treehouse, so don‚Äôt miss out on this one when you visit Kentucky!
4. Harland Sanders Caf√© and Museum
Nowadays, you can find a KFC in just about any country in the world. Have you wondered about how it all started, though? At the Harland Sanders Caf√© and Museum in Corbin, you‚Äôll be able to see the birthplace of Kentucky Fried Chicken at Colonel Sanders‚Äô original restaurant.
Not only can you actually dine at the Harland Sanders Caf√© and Museum, but you can then tour the building and see all kinds of artifacts and memorabilia from the famous restaurateur‚Äôs legacy.
3. Vent Haven Museum
In the small town of Fort Mitchell is the world‚Äôs only museum dedicated to ventriloquism: the Vent Haven Museum. This is by far one of the strangest places I‚Äôve ever seen while researching a destination, and now it has been bumped up pretty high on my bucket list.
The museum has over 700 dolls, featuring some that have been on TV and in movies, all from the personal collection of William Shakespeare Berger. If you‚Äôre a fan of weird museums and happen to be driving through Fort Mitchell, you‚Äôll definitely want to make a pit stop here.
2. Historic Diamond Caverns
Located right next to Mammoth Cave National Park, this unique attraction is a must-visit while you‚Äôre in the area. Its cathedral-like caverns feature cascades of naturally colorful calcite and other mind-blowing formations. Guided tours are available and are the perfect way to see the gorgeous caverns and learn about their interesting history.
1. Kentucky Kingdom
I‚Äôm a big fan of roller coasters, so I can‚Äôt skip out on adding Kentucky Kingdom to this list. This theme park may be small compared to megaparks like Six Flags and Disney World, but it‚Äôs a charming homegrown spot that locals adore. There are five roller coasters, a 5-D cinema, and plenty of other fun attractions to enjoy.
***
As you can see, Kentucky is full of quirky surprises and abundant natural beauty. There are plenty of amazing places just waiting to be discovered by travelers who are new to the state and also by locals looking to learn more about what there is to do near them!
Are you a Kentucky native? Which places did we miss this time? Let us know where your secret spots are!

They have a wide range and are found throughout Cameroon, the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, and possibly even Mali.
Because it is the only species in the Xenopus genus that has a diploid (cells with two homologous copies of each chromosome; normally one from the mother and one from the father) genome which has been sequenced, it along with it‚Äôs cousin the African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis), is widely bred and used in biological and genetic research. Xenopus tropicalis have a much shorter life cycle than Xenopus laevis, grow to only 1.95‚Ä≥ long, and attain adulthood at only 4 months, vs. 12 months for Xenopus tropicalis.
Xenopus tropicalis is a medium sized species that has a flattened body, bulging eyes that are situated high on their head, short plump limbs, and fully webbed feet with horny like claws. They have a short tentacle below each eye and a row of tubercles that run along a lateral line on their flank that begins at the eye. They have a fine granular skin, a pale to dark brown body with small black and gray spots on the back, and a creamy white to yellowish underbelly with some darker mottling.
Western Clawed Frogs should be housed in an aquarium of at least 10 gallons with a medium size gravel substrate, some hardy aquatic plants along with some driftwood
and rock work structure for them to hide among, and some floating plants
to diffuse the lighting in the tank.
They require adequate filtration, but avoid any strong currents in the tank. These frogs need a tightly fitting cover to prevent them from crawling out of their tanks. They are best kept in a single species tank with 4 or 5 others of their own kind, but they can be kept in a community environment as long as the fish are not smaller than themselves.
In the wild, Western Clawed Frogs are found underneath flat stones, tree roots, and holes in the riverbanks of shallow streams during the dry season, and when the rainy season begins, they migrate across the wet rain forest floor at night to find small pools where they can spawn. Their spawning behavior is like that of the African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis) but they produce a larger number of eggs per spawn and have a shorter (5 month) generation time. The usually lay their eggs on plants, but they are often found floating on the water surface.
The tadpoles are generally an orange color with transparent to blackish colored tails. They have wide mouths that are used to filter zooplankton from the water, and they transform into adults when they reach about 2 inches in length.
In their natural habitat, adult Western Clawed Frogs feed on insect larvae, small fish, tadpoles, and earthworms. In an aquarium environment, they should be feed meaty foods like live, frozen, or freeze dried bloodworms
, waxworms, earthworms
, tubifex, feeder fish, guppies, brine shrimp, or sinking carnivore pellets. They will also eat fish smaller than themselves. Feed them either every couple of days, or smaller portions daily.
Western Clawed Frogs are available online or from specialty tropical fish keeping shops at reasonable prices when they are about 1 1/2‚Ä≥ in size.

2 for 1 offer on Coaching with me, Sandra Pollock.
Coaching is not only for those times when you feel like you‚Äôve lost your way but also for those time when you just need a reflective view on where you‚Äôre going with your life or business.
When I was introduced to Sandra, I was on the cusp of starting my business but I lacked confidence personally and in business. I was nurtured, taught and pushed. It takes a special person to do what she does and she is an asset to our community.
Sandra knows her stuff (particularly around business development, how to get the best out each person, and how to motivate you to get your best out of yourself. She is generous with her time, knowledge and contacts and provides a platform for women in business to thrive. Sandra has had a long career in supporting thousands of women across England, Scotland, and Wales and is, in my opinion, an unsung heroine of women‚Äôs development. Precious Jason, Founder Etieno Skin Care
This would be a great gift to raise confidence, self-belief, career transition and helping to get that promotion.
This offer will close soon. Make sure you don‚Äôt miss it.

Unsere Social-Media-Kan√§leI love using background paper, but I don‚Äôt do it too often because it‚Äôs a hassle to drag it out. BUT ‚Äì you may have noticed I‚Äôve been using it a lot more recently. Trevor hooked me up! And I‚Äôm here to show you ‚Äì ‚Äì how to hang background paper in your garage ‚Äì it‚Äôs awesome!!
First off, I‚Äôve probably mentioned this a million times, but one of the best places to take pictures is in your garage ‚Äì really! Open up the garage door and tons of natural light pours in, yet it‚Äôs not in the direct sun (well, for me in the morning it‚Äôs not ‚Äì ‚Äì the picture above was taken in the late afternoon and you can see the sun starting to creep in). It‚Äôs perfect.
I bought my background paper a couple of years ago ‚Äì I bought 3 rolls. I have pink, teal, and gray. Then I bought white recently.
So anyways, I had the rolls but I didn‚Äôt use them too often because I stored them in the basement. When I did use them, I clipped the end of the roll to a chair or trashcan (setting the roll on the ground) so the paper didn‚Äôt go very high ‚Äì ‚Äì good for sitting kiddos, but that was about it.
Well, a few weeks ago, I asked Trevor if he‚Äôd hold the background paper up high while one the kids took my picture ‚Äì cause I didn‚Äôt know how to hang it from anything high. He looked around, and said ‚Äújust a minute‚Äù ‚Äì grabbed a couple of those C clap things and attached them to the top of garage door (it was open) ‚Äì -then he grabbed an old bar thing we had and shoved it through the roll of paper and the ‚Äúc‚Äù part of the two C clamps ‚Äì and it held!!
And I took these pictures (by the way, it‚Äôs wedding season ‚Äì be sure you have belts for your little men!)
Here‚Äôs how it looks from the back (standing in the garage looking out) ‚Äì ‚Äì
Well, I LOVED IT!! I mentioned that I had more rolls in the basement, so maybe he could hang one up on the other side of the garage. He got even fancier this time ‚Äì ‚Äì 2 rolls at once. He built this piece of wood with holes in it, hung the rolls on length of PVC pipe, and caped the end (he was hoping the cap handles would roll the paper up, but they don‚Äôt). It‚Äôs still being held on by C Clamps ‚Äì 2 on each side. This is when the garage door is up and I‚Äôm looking up at it:
Here‚Äôs what it looks like from the driveway ‚Äì ‚Äì see the rolls up in their spot??
And here‚Äôs what it looks like when the garage door is down ‚Äì it just sits against the door:
It‚Äôs been up for several weeks and not fallen off (which was my fear). I need him to build another one of these fancy versions for the other side, so it can hold 2 instead of 1.
And where was this thing years ago?!?! It‚Äôs SO HANDY!! Anytime I need a picture, I just open the garage door and pull down on whichever paper I want to use. Then roll it up when I‚Äôm done. LOVE IT!!
It lets me get pictures that look kind of professional ‚Äì ‚Äì here‚Äôs a sample from some I took for Father‚Äôs Day:
So get some rolls of background paper and hook it up to your garage door ‚Äì it works!! Go try it!!
Neat! Where do you get the rolls of paper from???
What a cool idea! And side note-love the hand prints on the back of your van!
This is a great idea!!! I‚Äôd also like to know where you get the rolls of paper?
GREAT idea! now all I need is a garage =)
Love this! Pinning this on my Honey-Do board!
Wonderful idea! I too, would love to know where you can purchase the rolls of paper. Maybe my re-do will begin to change after I try this. I am not sure if it went through, but my re-do moment was to take more picures of my children when they were teenagers. At that age they are too cool for pictures, but I wish I had listened to my heart instead of their urges to stop. Now before they head back to college in a month, I can maybe snap a few great posable shots! üôÇ
Great IDea. I‚Äôm so pinning this so I can do it later. Thanks for sharing.
Such a good idea! What kind of paper is it?? It seems like it would get really beaten up if it was just craft paper‚Ä¶ ?
Looks like it is the question of the day, but I didn‚Äôt see the answer in the comments! Where did you get the paper from? üôÇ
sorry I‚Äôm slow to reply ‚Äì ‚Äì I bought it here:
good price but shipping can get ya, so be sure to order more than one‚Ä¶

Once or twice can be a coincidence, but if you are seeing it regularly then there is definitely some interest there.
But there‚Äôs more than one way to tell if she‚Äôs into you:
- If she is frequently looking for ways to talk to you, topics to talk about, or wants to ask you questions, there‚Äôs a good chance that she‚Äôs being more than just friendly. Go ahead and answer her questions and chat her up as much as you want. Show her you are interested too.
- If she looks for reasons to sit next to or across from you. Whether you are grabbing lunch or just sitting at a park with friends if you happen to notice that there‚Äôs a pattern try approaching her about meeting up, just the two of you.
- One of the biggest signs is if she‚Äôs constantly touching you in light, friendly ways. It can be a hand on your knee or hugs that go on for just a moment longer than with other friends. If you happen to notice her going out of her way to touch you, she‚Äôs giving you a clear sign of interest.
- She tells you about her queer experiences and is especially interested in yours. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign that she‚Äôs into you, but it can be a good indicator if you are getting along well.

It is also possible that other lesbians or women who are bi may not show their interest openly. There can be a range of how open they are about this, from subtle glances to direct contact. This is why it is important to recognize some of the cues that they can be giving you.
However, it is possible that she may be doing certain things unintentionally, and is not actually interested in you. Pay attention to these kinds of signs and go the extra distance to ask around and see if she might be interested.
But what if you are using the best lesbian dating sites out there? Or maybe you have installed a lesbian dating app? You may still find yourself in situations where you just don‚Äôt know. Read on to learn about how you can tell if she is into you when you are online!
How do you find a lesbian relationship on online dating sites?
Being online can make a big difference when it comes to looking for subtle cues. In many ways, however, it is a lot more direct: someone who is into you will find ways to use the online service features to drop hints. This can be sending you emojis, liking your profile, or commenting.
Dating apps and services tend to be more direct anyway. If she‚Äôs really into you she will eventually send you some sort of message trying to get to know you. This can be just making an effort to start a conversation, if she‚Äôs not being blunt!
A big give away is if she takes the time to go through your profile and learn a bit about you. When she is using that as a way to get to know you better, you can be certain that she is into you! Take the time to reciprocate by learning about her and reaching out to her yourself!

What to do if she‚Äôs actually not into you?
Mistakes can happen and it‚Äôs a tricky business when it comes to dating. This is especially the case if it turns out she‚Äôs not a lesbian or bi. Assuming she‚Äôs a reasonable person, the most practical thing to do is also the best approach: be upfront about it and explain that you were getting mixed signals.
She could just be an outgoing, touchy-feely kind of person. It happens, and misreading these kind of interactions is common enough. The important thing to remember is that you‚Äôre both adults and there‚Äôs no reason to let a misunderstanding get in the way of a friendship.
No matter how she reacts, be open and direct with your feelings. If she‚Äôs been giving the wrong signals don‚Äôt be embarrassed and don‚Äôt feel let down. However, if she is into you, then getting onto the same page can help both of you overcome a lot of uncertainty quickly.HSHS Holy Family Hospital is accepting applications for their Patient and Family Engagement Council (PFEC).

Agribusiness Services Unit under the department of agriculture with funding from Food Agricultural Sector Development Project (FASDEP) Friday commenced a five-day farmers training on leadership skills, business management plans, organisational structures and other related business agricultural skill acquisitions.
Held at Jenio Rural Farmer Training Centre, the training was aimed at strengthening the capacity of the farmers in improving their earning capacity through adoption of better business strategy plans.
It brought about fifty farmer representatives from various group organizations across the country and individual business entity.
In his statement, Cherno Mballow, registrar of cooperative and head of Agribusiness Services Unit under the department of agriculture, explained that his unit is closely collaborating with Food Agricultural Sector Development Project (FASDEP) to train farmers in certain disciplines.
He noted that the training was focusing on leadership, organizational structures and business management, especially on agricultural strategy.
Mr Mballow said there had been so much emphasis on production over the years, but they would focus on agriculture commercialization as a business, moving from subsistence agriculture to commercialisation.
Therefore, he added, the new paradigm shift was to ensure agriculture go along with the value chain from production to the table.
That means farmers have to be trained not only on production but also on processing, marketing, business management, leadership and group management, which are key issues to which Agribusiness expected to expose the farmers during the five-day training so that by the time FASDEP, the main funding activities of the farmers training, rolled out the implementation program or activities, farmers would be in a position to have reasonable skills to be able to a carry out effectively and efficiently their business plans, he stated.
He said the training was also targeting small ruminant breeding farmers to equip them with the requisite skills to effectively manage their group market produce and to better help the farmers to carry out their business monitoring to determine whether they are making profit in their business.
Agribusiness involved all the value chain players, such as marketers, processors, transporters, producers, vendors and other businesses related to agriculture.
He spoke at length about the mandate and the activities of Agribusiness, saying their mandate is to regulate all the cooperatives relating to agricultural development, auditing for the society and other issues like marketing and facilitating training for farmers on various activities, as well as providing services capacity building and business linkages within organisations.
In his official opening statement, the Governor of Lower River Region, Salifu Puye, said building the capacity of the farmers in improving their production and productivity was key and in line with the President‚Äôs vision.
He commended the Gambian leader for taking the lead in empowering the farmers to go back to the land and ‚Äògrow what you eat and eat what you grow‚Äô.
He challenged the farmers to take the training seriously as these are government projects to improve the livelihood of the farmers.
Hawawu Barry, Agribusiness marketing officer, highlighted some of the expectations of the training in the thematic areas the participants would be exposed to during the five-day, as well as some recommendations for their business strategy plans that would be of impact and improve their daily business and livelihood.Oppo Official shared First Look of ENCO Q1 : Noise Cancelling Headphone

Truitt‚Äôs Brother
By LIBBY CUDMORE ‚Ä¢ Special to
COOPERSTOWN ‚Äì In his testimony this morning, Terrence Truitt, the older brother of defendant Gabriel Truitt, said he went to 5 Walling Ave. ‚Äì home of Heather Engler ‚Äì to help his brother look for the keys he‚Äôd lost that night following a fight at the Sip & Sail Tavern.
District Attorney John Meuhl wasn‚Äôt buying it.
‚ÄúThe Sip & Sail is the opposite direction of Walling Avenue,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou went to Heather‚Äôs Engler place because you knew what your brother was going to do.‚Äù
According to Meuhl, Gabriel left the Tru Cuts Barber Shop at 4:04 a.m. and was seen on the Center Street Deli‚Äôs cameras at 4:09 a.m., headed towards Walling Avenue.
By the time Terrence arrived, he testified, the building was already on fire. ‚ÄúI saw people on the fire escape, a woman and some children, and I ran in, but I couldn‚Äôt get to the top of the stairs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI went to Main Street, flagged someone down and asked if they had a cell phone. They didn‚Äôt, so I asked them to drive me to the Speedway.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call them from your phone?‚Äù Muehl asked. ‚ÄúWe have you on video from the barber shop, putting your phone in your pocket. (That‚Äôs) Because you didn‚Äôt want to be tied to the scene. You went into the house because you were looking for your brother.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy would I care who called 911?‚Äù he replied.
Terrence deferred on several questions, telling Muehl that he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt remember‚Äù telling the police that Gabriel was going to 5 Walling Ave. or that when he asked Gabriel if he set the fire, he avoided the question.
Public Defender Michael Trossett, representing Gabriel, asked Terrence if he saw Gabriel at the fire.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Terrence replied.
‚ÄúAm I speaking a different language than Mr. Trosset?‚Äù Muehl asked on redirect. ‚ÄúWhy are you answering his questions and not mine?‚Äù
Jurors were then shown a tape of Gabriel Truitt‚Äôs interview with Oneonta Police on Dec. 31, 2018, where he claimed it was his brother who left Tru Cuts barber shop, while he stayed inside and waited for a cab. He told police Terrence came back in a cab a short while later, contrasting what Terrence said and what the surveillance footage from the barber shop showed."Please hear me clearly: At this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard earned ground we have gained," said Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
After weeks of tumbling case numbers, new infections are on the rise again - about two per cent more this past week compared to the previous week, Dr Walensky said on Monday.
LIVE UPDATES: Tropical cyclone batters north Queensland
"Similarly, the most recent seven-day average of deaths has also increased more than 2 per cent... to nearly 2000 deaths per day."
Dr Walensky also called out states that were easing up on COVID-19 safety mandates.
"I am really worried about reports that more states are rolling back the exact public health measures we have recommended to protect people from COVID-19," she said.
"Please stay strong in your conviction. Continue wearing your well-fitting mask and taking the other public health prevention actions that we know work," Dr Walensky added.
"It is so critical that we remain vigilant and consistently take all of the mitigation steps we know work to stop the spread of COVID-19 while we work our way toward mass vaccination."
A third vaccine will help with mass vaccination
The good news this week: Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine will start being administered.
"There's a kind of new urgency to it," said Dr Eric Rubin, a professor at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.
"Because there are new viral variants coming out right now, with some chance that some of them could eventually become somewhat resistant to the protection provided by vaccines, it's really important to get it out there fast."
"Those J&J doses will be delivered as early as this Tuesday morning."
As a one-dose vaccine, "people do not have to return for a second dose to be protected," Dr Walensky said.
"In addition, this vaccine does not need to be kept in a freezer and can be stored at refrigerated temperatures. So it is easy to transport and store and allows for expanded availability in most community settings and mobile sites as supply scales up."
The other two vaccines being distributed - one from Pfizer-BioNTech and one from Moderna - both have efficacy rates of about 95 per cent, with even greater protection against severe forms of disease.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown a 72 per cent efficacy rate against mild to severe/critical disease among US trial participants.
READ MORE: Brazilian strain of virus found in UK
It's more effective against severe forms of disease, with about 85 per cent protection.
Don't be too picky about which vaccine you get
Health experts say Americans should not be deterred by J&J's slightly lower numbers.
Its vaccine was tested later than the other two vaccines, when infections were already surging and new variant strains were spreading more widely.
The J&J vaccine was also tested in South Africa when the troubling B.1.351 strain was dominant there, but it still gave strong protection against severe illness.
Health experts such as Dr Anthony Fauci have said they would be happy to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine if it were the only one available because all three vaccines getting distributed in the US are highly effective against severe COVID-19.
And if that's the only vaccine available in your area, you should go ahead and get it once you're able to, CNN medical analyst Dr Leana Wen said Monday.
"Think about the other vaccines that we get. If we go in to get the flu vaccine, I don't think anyone is asking the brand of the flu vaccine (or) what company manufactures it."
Besides, "in the immediate future, people are not going to be getting a choice when supply is a limiting factor," she said.
"Right now, the key is to get immunity of some kind. Get whatever vaccine is first available to you. You can always get another vaccine or booster shot later on when supply is not the issue."
New variants keep spreading
March will be a very important chapter in this pandemic.
The CDC has predicted the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the UK will become the dominant strain in the US this month.
More than 2,460 infections involving variant strains have been reported, according the CDC data. The vast majority of those cases -- at least 2,400 - are of the highly contagious B.1.1.7 strain.
Those counts are probably much lower than the actual number of people infected by variants.
The numbers represent only those variant cases found through genomic sequencing, the CDC has said.
The US has lagged behind dozens of other countries in the proportion of cases tested for variants, but the CDC said it's working to scale up those efforts.
Can vaccines fend off the new variants?
Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech are all trying to make sure their vaccines get ahead of the variants.
Johnson & Johnson is working on a booster to help its COVID-19 vaccine deal with new strains of coronavirus variants, CEO Alex Gorsky said on Monday.
"While we're encouraged and we're confident in the current vaccine that we have, you've always got to be preparing for the future and frankly for the unknown," Mr Gorsky said.
Last week, Moderna said it has designed a booster shot to help stave off the B.1.351 strain, which has worried scientists because it has a mutation that might affect the efficacy of vaccines.
That shot would serve as a booster for people who have already been vaccinated and as a primary vaccine for people who haven't had coronavirus and have not yet been vaccinated.
READ MORE: When you will receive the COVID-19 vaccine
Moderna is also testing a third, lower dose of its current vaccine in trial participants to see if that would protect against troubling variants.
Pfizer and BioNTech said last week that they've started testing how well a third dose of their authorised vaccine stacks up against new variants.
Many more need vaccine before herd immunity
While news of third COVID-19 vaccine is worth celebrating, the US is still a long way off from herd immunity. That's when enough people are protected against a virus that it cannot spread through the population.
About 15 per cent of the US population has received at least one shot of their two-dose Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to CDC data on Sunday.
About 7.5 per cent of Americans have been fully vaccinated with both doses.
Vaccines will be tested," Dr Douoguih told a CDC advisory committee on Sunday.
"The study in adolescents, we hope, will open next week. We are also anticipating a study in pregnant women in the second and third trimesters toward the end of March, early April," Dr Douoguih said.
Johnson & Johnson also plans to begin study in immunocompromised people in the third quarter of this year, Dr Douoguih said.
The FDA's emergency use authorisation for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is currently for use in adults 18 and older.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for people 16 and older, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been authorised for people 18 and older.
Both Moderna and Pfizer have started enrolling children in COVID-19 vaccine trials.Rossendale based, CircleLoop, the cloud-based phone system, has announced its launch into the Irish market where it will power application-based telephony for Irish SMEs.

A rate rise by the Bank of England has prompted peer-to-peer lending platform Zopa to increase its investor target rates, according to a statement by the firm.
Zopa will increase its rates to 4.5 per cent for its Core and 5.2 per cent for its Plus accounts. Returns have increased from 4 per cent for Core and 4.6 per cent for Plus respectively.
The higher target returns reflect pricing improvements in the loans market, Zopa says, as well as the Bank of England‚Äôs recent base rate rise in August to 0.75 per cent. This was the UK‚Äôs second rate rise in a year, following last Autumn‚Äôs rise from 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent.
However, while that was a level prompted by the Brexit vote‚Äôs huge uncertainty, the more recent rise reflected the first rise above 0.5 per cent since the Financial Crisis‚Äô nadir in March 2009.
Zopa cut its rates in order to remain competitive in a crowded market of prime consumer lenders in 2016 following an interest rate cut to 0.25 per cent from the UK central bank, several times dropping its interest rates and henee the returns it targets for investors.
Many had expected higher interest rates to be a bullish signal for P2P lenders who have a better track record of passing these rises onto investors.
The Bank of England‚Äôs governor Mark Carney has said there will be further "gradual" and "limited" rate rises in the coming year or so.
Andrew Lawson, Chief Product Officer, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to offer investors a return of up to 5.2 per cent for accepting the risk of peer-to-peer lending".
‚ÄúAs demand for Cash ISAs drops to an 18 year low, the IFISA stands as an excellent middle ground for people who are looking for an alternative to the Cash ISA but don‚Äôt want to take on the risks or volatility associated with investing in the stock market," he added.

POTM cards are rewarded in FIFA 22 for players who perform excellently in their respective domestic leagues over a particular month. These cards have boosted stats and are only obtainable by completing their respective SBCs only.
Mohamed Salah had an outstanding October, where he had a phenomenal nine-goal involvement in four games. He became the first opposition footballer in the Premier League era to score a hat-trick at Old Trafford.
Complete list of tasks and rewards for Mohamed Salah‚Äôs POTM SBC in FIFA 22

If completed from scratch, Salah‚Äôs POTM SBC will cost FIFA 22 players about 950,000 coins. Of course, the final amount of the actual cost will depend on using the existing fodder.
Mohamed Salah POTM card review
Salah‚Äôs POTM card in FIFA 22 is a 92 rated RW card. Like his TOTW variants, the card has phenomenal stats. With 93 Pace, 91 Shooting, and 93 Dribbling, he is a dream card for any FIFA 22 Ultimate Team player.
Mohamed Salah already has two excellent TOTW cards in FIFA 22, but not everyone had the great opportunity to obtain them. A million coins are not cheap, but for those who didn‚Äôt get either of the two TOTW variants, Salah‚Äôs POTM SBC is an excellent opportunity.
Like Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs POTM card, the critical question is not about the value or usefulness of the card. Salah‚Äôs POTM card is the equivalent of a Lamborghini in FIFA 22 Ultimate Team.

Don‚Äôt Like Needles? No Problem
We offer 5 different ways to stimulate the acupuncture points without needles‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs right! We adopted these methods to treat kids, because what kid likes needles? Also those taking blood thinning medications, those who bruise easily, and for all of the needle-phobics. We‚Äôve found these to be just as effective when compared to the needle.

- Tei-Shin: This is a spring loaded tool that is applied in bursts of 5 to the desired point
- Available for purchase for home acupuncture stimulation.
- Acu-buzzer: Apply vibration to each point for about 15 seconds each.
- Class 3b Laser: Laser stimulation allows us to treat each point for only 5 seconds each point. We can also customize the light frequency to stimulate each point to maximize healing time.
- We also offer acu-lasers that you can purchase and take home with you and treat your points from home. This light pen is set to a specific frequency for optimal stimulation for each point. We‚Äôll send you the points you need with pictures that help you find the points easily, and you can continue your treatment at home each and everyday. We‚Äôre noticing the best response when patients do their points each day.
- Ear Seeds: These small clear band-aid like beads stimulate points for weeks at a time. This allows you to leave the office and continue your day to day activities with constant stimulation of the point. These were great for a number of issues, especially allergies.
Acugraph
Our Acugraph Software allows us to take a snapshot of how each meridian or pathway in the body is functioning. The theory of meridian acupuncture is that each pathway affects the organ its associated with and any joint or tissue it passes through. For example the Lung meridian starts at the upper chest and runs down the arm to the thumb. An imbalance in the lung meridian can cause pain along the outer arm, elbow, wrist and thumb. The software also provides a list of chinese herbs and acupuncture points that will best fit your needs at the moment. This software allows us to customize your treatments every visit.There‚Äôs so much to do at Aerosports!

Some weeks back, a dear relation of mine sent me a package for my birthday: assorted candies, teas, sweeteners, etc., that I took to be the end result of her latest kitchen cabinet cleaning. Why she put it into a box to send to me instead of into the ‚Äúcircular file‚Äù, I could never quite figure out. I was more than a little concerned that apparently this dear relation of mine looks at a pile of refuse and immediately thinks of me. I would hope that it would be stunning works of art or paragons of physical perfection that would remind her of me. But I digress. I should have been grateful really: usually it‚Äôs the contents of her desk that end up in the postmarked box. Honestly, how many Post-Its, paper clips and ball point pens does one man need?
Included in the package amongst the assorted odds and ends this time was one of her husband‚Äôs highly prized cigars. It was a fine cigar, plump and lengthy, with just the right amount of crackle: not too wet, not too dry. The man obviously has a fine person managing his humidor. I suspect it to be my own dear relation.
I called my dear relation to thank her immediately upon opening the package and she recommended I smoke the cigar at a Super Bowl party. I thought this to be an inspired idea and I decided then and there to do just that. More precisely on the way home from the party. You know how these non-smokers are about smoking indoors, especially a cigar.
I stepped outside to the curb and lit my cigar with a wooden matchstick, as I understand that is one of the cleanest ways to light up. A lighter would pollute the flavor of the tobacco with the tang of lighter fluid, and wood smoke would serve only to enhance it. Or so I‚Äôm told. So this is what I did. And in my unpracticed hands, it took at least five minutes and a cascade of matches that, before I gave up, yielded only a lopsided result. So with a glowing orange semi-circle leading the way, I blinked my way through the smoke-induced tears and headed west for the subway.
So there I was at 11:30pm casually strolling through Harlem, NYC smoking a quality cigar and thinking I look like a real bad ass. Except when the smoke goes a little too far down my throat. At which point I double over, grab my knees and attempt to keep my lungs from making a break for the outside world. And, curiously, it‚Äôs at that very same moment that the world decides to tilt violently on its axis while the stars do their best imitation of the Northern Lights. And all the while trying to remain cool. Man, those cigars are good.
The occasional bronchial spasm aside, I thought my ‚Äúpuff pacing‚Äù wasn‚Äôt bad, though I was concerned I might be hitting it a little hard. Being the natural-born miser that I am, I had to try to smoke as much of the cigar as possible by the time I reached the subway entrance where I‚Äôd have to discard it before heading underground. I was concerned that a draw every three steps or so might be a little much, especially for one unused to tobacco as I was, but I had limited geography to accomplish my goal and it was getting smaller with every step. I got about half of it smoked before the green, half-domed lights loomed in the distance telling me I was close to my destination. That was when I started to feel it.
I usually have a pretty decent sense of equilibrium. I wouldn‚Äôt want to walk the high steel or start a tight rope act but there‚Äôs been no vertigo or bouts of dizziness that I can remember that weren‚Äôt induced by playground shenanigans or raging influenza. Even on the rare occasions when I‚Äôve managed to over-indulge on fermented spirits, I‚Äôve never felt dizzy. Tunnel vision, yes. Nauseous, yes. Vertigo, no. This time, I was dizzy.
I stood on the corner of the cobblestone island by the subway stairs taking a last couple of puffs and having them go straight to my head. It seemed a shame to discard so much of a good cigar still unsmoked. I tried to tamp out the glowing cherry on the metal rail of the stairway. No dice. It was a hard, orange, glowing ember. It wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. So I took out my pocket knife and started to cut off the glowing end.
I gave a generous length of about an inch from the lit end of the cigar and cut it against the railing. Between my swimming head and a knife not designed for such a purpose, I made a ragged job of it. I crushed out the lit end on the cobblestones under foot then examined what remained of the stogie. It looked okay, not really singed on the cut end. But what concerned me is that it was still warm. I wrapped it back in the plastic wrap I had taken it out of and twisted both ends. Then I stood there with my head swimming, staring at the wrapped remains and pondering the possibilities. In the end, the image of me tucking away a quietly smoldering half cigar wrapped in slowly melting cling wrap only to have it burst into flames at a most inopportune moment, like while slowly nodding off to sleep in the seat of a swaying subway car, won out. I regretfully tossed it into the trash and held tight to the handrail as I wobbled down the stairs to catch my train.
I made sure to stand well back from the platform edge as I texted my dear relation the results of her suggestion and offered one of my own: that maybe her dear husband could give me a lesson or two in cigar smoking upon the occasion of my next visit. I had a feeling I might need one. After all, real men smoke cigars. Don‚Äôt they?

The Existence of God ‚Ä¢ Theism = the belief in a personal diety, creator of everything that exists and who is distinct from that creation ‚Ä¢ A priori = prior to experience, an argument starting from a definition of God, not experience. The argument is that by understanding the definition, God is proved to exist. ‚Ä¢ A posteriori = from experience, an argument based on sensory experience and experiential evidence
‚Ä¢ There are five classical theistic proofs for the existence of God ‚Ä¢ Four of theistic proofs attempt to demonstrate the existence of God from some observation or experience of the universe- a posterior argument ‚Ä¢ These are as follows:
The Cosmological Argument ‚Ä¢ An argument which attempts to infer the existence of God from the existence of the cosmos or the phenomenon within it. ‚Ä¢ It is an argument based on cause and effect. ‚Ä¢ Thomas Aquinas 1273 ‚Ä¢ Frederick Copleston 1907 -94 ‚Ä¢ Objections. David Hume 1711 -76 Bertrand Russell 1872 -1970
The Teleological Argument ‚Ä¢ An argument which infers a designer from the occurrence of order and regularity in the world. This evidence points to a designer ‚Ä¢ Aquinas‚Äô Five Ways 1273 ‚Ä¢ William Paley 1743 -1805 ‚Ä¢ The Anthropic Principle- F. R. Tennant 1930 ‚Ä¢ Challenges. Hume 1779 John Stuart Mill 1806 -73 Darwin 1809 -82
The Moral Argument ‚Ä¢ An argument infers God as the explanation for moral consciousness, or the guarantor for the highest good ‚Ä¢ God must exist to ensure that all can achieve that which they are morally required to pursue. It is illogical to be required to seek an impossible end. God‚Äôs existence is morally necessary.
‚Ä¢ Aquinas‚Äô Fourth Way ‚Ä¢ Kant‚Äôs Moral Argument 1785, 1788, 1797 ‚Ä¢ Other versions. Cardinal Newman 1870 Robert Adams 1987 ‚Ä¢ Challenges. Sigmund Freud 1856 -1939 Richard Swinburne 1979 Ayer and Nietzsche
The Religious Experience Argument ‚Ä¢ An argument which sees God as the best explanation for experiences that people claim are beyond the normal ‚Ä¢ Rudolph Otto 1936 ‚Ä¢ William James 1902 ‚Ä¢ Swinburne 1979 ‚Ä¢ Challenges. Freud 1927 Karl Marx 1844
The Ontological Argument ‚Ä¢ This fifth argument is in contrast to the others. It is a priori. This argument is not verified by experience. It concludes that God‚Äôs definition entails his existence, i. e. for God to be God, he must exist. ‚Ä¢ Ontological literally means ‚Äòconcerned with being‚Äô
St. Anselm 1033 -1109 ‚Ä¢ Proslogion chapters 2 -3 ‚Ä¢ Anselm‚Äôs argument is a reductio ad absurdum argument, an argument that makes a proof by showing that the opposite cannot possibly be true. ‚Ä¢ A priori argument starting from a definition of God, not experience ‚Ä¢ The argument is that by understanding the definition God is proved to exist
First Form ‚Ä¢ Anselm says: ‚ÄúGod is that than which nothing greater can be conceived. ‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Something that exists in reality is greater than something that exists only in the mind ‚Ä¢ In other words, if it is the greatest, then it must be something more than merely existing in people‚Äôs thoughts. We can think of something greater than a mere idea.
‚Ä¢ If God is the greatest, he must really exist separately from people‚Äôs thoughts. He must exist actually, in reality.
As a formal deductive argument, it goes like this: √ò God is the greatest possible being (nothing greater can be conceived) √ò If God exists in the mind alone (only as an idea) then a greater being could be imagined to exist both in the mind and in reality √ò This being would then be greater than God √ò Thus, God cannot exist only as an idea in the mind. Therefore God exists both in the mind (as an idea) and in reality.
In summary ‚Ä¢ It is self-contradictory to be able to conceive of something that which nothing greater can be thought and yet to deny that something exists.
Second Form ‚Ä¢ So far Anselm has suggested a proof for God‚Äôs existence. However, for God to be God there must be more to him than that he simply ‚Äòexists‚Äô (after all, that would make God fundamentally similar to ourselves). ‚Ä¢ In the next stage of Anselm‚Äôs argument therefore, he attempts to demonstrate that God‚Äôs existence is necessary
What does he mean by ‚Äònecessary‚Äô? ‚Ä¢ It is impossible to conceive of God as not existing. ‚Ä¢ He has necessary existence. ‚Ä¢ He could not be. ‚Ä¢ This state is greater than a being who comes and goes out of existence.
As a deductive argument it is: ‚Ä¢ God is the greatest possible being (nothing greater can be conceived) ‚Ä¢ It is greater to be a necessary being (cannot be) than a contingent being (can cease to exist) ‚Ä¢ If God exists only as a contingent being he can therefore be imagined not to exist. Then a greater being could be imagined that cannot be conceived not to exist
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ This being would then be greater than God is therefore a necessary being Therefore God must exist in reality In summary: God must be a necessary being, i. e. he cannot exist Necessary here means logical necessity It would be a logical contradiction to claim that God does not exist since any being who has the property of necessary existence could not fail to exist
‚Ä¢ The OA claims to reveal that inherent in the concept of God is necessary existence ‚Ä¢ When you come to analyse and examine the ‚Äòconcept‚Äô it becomes clear that existence is part of the concept ‚Ä¢ Such propositions are called ‚Äòanalytic‚Äô ‚Ä¢ This is a statement where the predicate is contained in the subject ‚Ä¢ The predicate is that which is said about the subject
‚Ä¢ E. g. of an analytic sentence is ‚Äòall bachelors are single‚Äô ‚Ä¢ All bachelors = subject ‚Ä¢ Being single = predicate ‚Ä¢ An analytic statement does not contain any new information but clarifies the term ‚Ä¢ Analytic statements can be true or false ‚Ä¢ The proposition ‚Äòall bachelors are married‚Äô is analytic but false ‚Ä¢ It is analytic because the married state is part of the concept of bachelor
‚Ä¢ The way to decide if it is true or false is by considering the meaning of the words ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄòThe cat sat on the mat‚Äô is not an analytic statement since there is nothing in the analysis of the concept of ‚Äòcat‚Äô that contains the idea of ‚Äòsitting on the mat‚Äô ‚Ä¢ This is synthetic, i. e. the truth value of the statement, whether it is true or false, is determined by empirical evidence.
Descartes 1596 -1650 ‚Ä¢ Regarded as the founder of modern philosophy ‚Ä¢ In Meditations he put forward his arguments for a unified and certain body of human knowledge ‚Ä¢ He broke free from the dogma of Aristotle and supported instead the new age of science
‚Ä¢ He favoured independent enquiry from first principles and asserted only that which could be known to be certain ‚Ä¢ A crucial part of his argument involved the existence of God as a guarantor for the certainty that the external world exists ‚Ä¢ The argument he uses is a form of the ontological argument:
√ò God, a supremely perfect being, has all perfections √ò Existence is a perfection √ò Therefore God, a supreme perfect being, exists ‚Ä¢ In Meditation 5 Descartes argued: v. There are some qualities that an object necessarily has or it can‚Äôt be that object
v. E. g. a triangle must have three angles adding up to 180¬∞ v. The notion of a hill demands the idea of a valley v. Existence cannot be separated from the concept of God v. Existence, singularity and perfection, are God‚Äôs characteristics. In fact, God‚Äôs essence is existence. If something is supremely perfect and if existence is a perfection, God by definition exists.
Modern Versions ‚Ä¢ Norman Malcolm 1960 and Charles Hartshorne 1962 centre their arguments on the idea of necessary existence ‚Ä¢ If God does not exist then God cannot come into existence as that would require another force which would mean that God was limited and could not be God at all ‚Ä¢ If God does exist God cannot have come into existence nor cease
‚Ä¢ God‚Äôs existence is either impossible or necessary ‚Ä¢ It can only be impossible if the idea of God is logically absurd ‚Ä¢ Assuming that it is not, then God necessarily exists
Alvin Plantinga 1974 ‚Ä¢ Develops the idea of infinite possible worlds ‚Ä¢ In a possible world a maximally great being could exist (omnipotent, omniscient, morally perfect) ‚Ä¢ For there to be a maximally great being he would have to exist in all possible worlds so a maximally great being exists (this argument only proves possibility, not actuality)
Criticisms of the OA ‚Ä¢ Gaunilo‚Äôs challenge on behalf of the fool 11 th century (and Anselm‚Äôs reply) ‚Ä¢ Gaunilo, a monk, argued if someone were to describe to you a ‚Äòmost perfect island‚Äô, lost somewhere and untouched by man, and then state that it must exist because of it‚Äôs perfection, you would be a fool to believe him.
‚Ä¢ He is trying to criticise the process by which Anselm moves from his definition of God to his suggestion of God‚Äôs existence ‚Ä¢ Gaunilo‚Äôs criticism is not valid in this context. Anselm never compares things of a like kind above. ‚Ä¢ He speaks of God ‚Äòthat than which nothing greater can be conceived‚Äô ‚Ä¢ Gaunilo, on the other hand, occupies himself with a comparison between islands
‚Ä¢ Anselm replied that God is a special case ‚Ä¢ There may be a thing greater than a perfect island, but not God ‚Ä¢ Only God has all the perfections and so the argument can only apply to God
Immanuel Kant 1724 -1804 ‚Ä¢ Kant opposed Descartes‚Äô version of the argument ‚Ä¢ He objects to Descartes‚Äô claim that denying God‚Äôs existence is the same as denying a triangle has three sides, which is contradictory
‚Ä¢ He states that if one dismisses the idea of the three sides (predicate) and that of the triangle itself (subject), one is left with no contradiction ‚Ä¢ He is saying you can define a thing in any way that you want but whether or not anything matches that definition in reality is another question all together ‚Ä¢ Kant feels he has dealt with Descartes‚Äô notion of existence as a predicate
‚Ä¢ Kant argues that we can only know the world through our experience of it ‚Ä¢ We cannot know any aspects of existence beyond our experience ‚Ä¢ Experience is not a predicate (an attribute or quality) of perfection that a thing can lack ‚Ä¢ Existence is the thing and all its attributes ‚Ä¢ Therefore Kant raises this second objection to deal with Anselm
‚Ä¢ Kant states that existence is not predicate, e. g. x exists says nothing about x (e. g. is x female, is x tall, etc. ) ‚Ä¢ Kant says a predicate must give us information about x ‚Ä¢ The statement ‚Äòx is‚Äô does not
Bertrand Russell ‚Ä¢ 20 th century philosopher ‚Ä¢ Claims that Anselm uses the word exist incorrectly ‚Ä¢ Existence cannot be a predicate, if it were we could construct this argument: Men exist. Santa Claus is a man. Therefore Santa Claus exists.

{1} Defendant appeals the district court‚Äôs refusal to grant her presentence confinement credit for the full period of time that she spent under house arrest pursuant to an electronic monitoring program. We reverse Defendant‚Äôs sentence and remand with instructions to grant her presentence credit for the full period of time that she spent under house arrest.
BACKGROUND
{2} Defendant was charged with committing forgery on February 28, 2001. On May 9, 2001, she was charged in a homieide/burglary ease with being an accessory to second degree murder, burglary, tampering with evidence, and harboring a felon. The cases were subsequently consolidated.
{3} On July 11, 2001, Defendant and the State agreed to a ‚ÄúStipulated Order on Appearance Bond and Conditions of Release‚Äù (Stipulated Order) which was approved and adopted as an order of the district court. It directed that Defendant be released on a $20,000 appearance bond with the following conditions: (1) that she be placed on ‚Äústrict house arrest‚Äù; (2) that she ‚Äúwear an ankle bracelet provided and monitored twenty-four (24) hours a day‚Äù; (3) that she submit to random urinalysis by the adult probation office; (4) that she check in daily with the adult probation office; and (5) that she be allowed to travel while accompanied by her parents only to meet with her attorney, for medical emergencies, to church, and to mental health counseling. [Id.]
{4} Defendant and the State also negotiated a guilty plea agreement which they filed on July 11, 2001. The plea agreement required Defendant to cooperate fully with law enforcement in the investigation and subsequent prosecution of all individuals involved in the homicide/burglary. The guilty plea agreement was subsequently approved by the district court on September 13, 2001. Disposition of Defendant‚Äôs case was then deferred pending disposition of the homicide/burglary case, and Defendant‚Äôs house arrest continued under the conditions of release set forth in the Stipulated Order.
{5} Defendant remained under house arrest pursuant to. the electronic monitoring program as specified in the Stipulated Order from July 12, 2001, until she appeared for final sentencing on May 23, 2003, after the homicide/burglary case was concluded. Defendant complied with all the conditions of the Stipulated Order and requested presentence confinement credit for the entire time she was under house arrest. The State objected and a subsequent hearing was held, in which the parties addressed the credit issue. The district court ultimately granted Defendant credit for 340 days, which was only one-*468half of the time that she spent under house arrest. Defendant appeals.
DISCUSSION
A. Entitlement to Presentence Confinement Credit
{6} Defendant is entitled to presentence confinement credit if her house arrest pursuant to the electronic monitoring program constituted ‚Äúofficial confinement.‚Äù NMSA 1978, ¬ß 31-20-12 (1977) (‚ÄúA person held in official confinement on suspicion or charges of the commission of a felony shall, upon conviction of that or a lesser included offense, be given credit for the period spent in presentence of confinement against any sentence finally imposed for that offense.‚Äù). A two-part test applies, requiring that:
(1) a court has entered an order releasing the defendant from a facility but has imposed limitations on the defendant‚Äôs freedom of movement, OR the defendant is in the actual or constructive custody or state or local law enforcement or correctional officers; and (2) the defendant is punishable for a crime of escape if there is an unauthorized departure from the place of confinement or other non-compliance with the court‚Äôs order.
State v. Fellhauer, 1997-NMCA-064, ¬∂ 17, 123 N.M. 476, 943 P.2d 123.
{7} The State concedes that the Stipulated Order setting the conditions of Defendant‚Äôs release meets the first part of the Fellhauer test. We agree. The conditions that she be on ‚Äústrict house arrest,‚Äù that she check in daily with the adult probation office, and that she be allowed to travel only to meet with her attorney, for medical emergencies, to church, and to mental health counseling, and then only while accompanied by her parents clearly constitute limitations on her freedom of movement to satisfy the first part of Fellhauer. State v. Guillen, 2001-NMCA-079, ¬∂ 11, 130 N.M. 803, 32 P.3d 812 (holding that any defendant charged with a felony who is released ‚Äúunder conditions of house arrest that require the defendant to remain at home except to attend specified events such as treatment, work, or school‚Äù places sufficient limitations on that defendant‚Äôs freedom of movement to satisfy first part of Fellhauer test).
{8} The issue presented here is whether Defendant was subject to punishment for a crime of escape under the second part of the Fellhauer test. Guillen holds that release of a defendant under conditions of house arrest pursuant to a community custody release program that holds the defendant liable to a charge of escape under NMSA 1978, ¬ß 30-22-8.1 (1999) satisfies the second prong of Fellhauer. Guillen, 2001-NMCA-079, ¬∂¬∂ 7, 11, 130 N.M. 803, 32 P.3d 812. The dispute in the district court centered on whether Defendant was subject to liability for escape under Section 30-22-8.1. The offense is statutorily defined in Subsection (A) as follows: attempting to escape from the community custody release program.
Section 30-22-8.1(A).
{9} The district court focused on whether Defendant‚Äôs house arrest was pursuant to a ‚Äújudicially approved community custody release program.‚Äù The district court stated it was unaware of a ‚Äújudicially approved community custody release program‚Äù in the Ninth Judicial District, and in its letter decision to counsel, the district court stated that the county had not authorized the establishment of a community-release program, citing NMSA 1978, ¬ß 33-3-24 (1981) (‚ÄúThe sheriff of any county or the jail administrator of any jail with the approval of the board of county commissioners and the governing body of the municipality, as applicable, may establish a prisoner-release program[.]‚Äù). The district court apparently concluded that since Defendant‚Äôs house arrest was not pursuant to a formally adopted, county-wide, pre-existing uniform system of release, her release was not pursuant to a ‚Äújudicially approved community custody release program,‚Äù and Defendant was therefore not subject to liability *469under Section 30-22-8.1. Accordingly, Defendant‚Äôs request for full presentence confinement credit was denied.
{10} We are therefore called upon to interpret Section 30-22-8.1(A) to determine if the district court was correct. Statutory interpretation is an issue of law, which we review de novo. State v. Rowell, 121 N.M. 111, 114, 908 P.2d 1379, 1382 (1995). ‚ÄúOur primary goal in interpreting a statute is to give effect to the Legislature‚Äôs intent. We look first to the words chosen by the Legislature and the plain meaning of the Legislature‚Äôs language.‚Äù State v. Martinez, 1998-NMSC-023, ¬∂ 8, 126 N.M. 39, 966 P.2d 747. When the language in a statute is clear and unambiguous, we give effect to that language and refrain from further statutory interpretation. State v. Jonathan M., 109 N.M. 789, 790, 791 P.2d 64, 65 (1990).
{11} Section 30-22-8.1(A) addresses the escape from a ‚Äújudicially approved community custody release program.‚Äù Defendant‚Äôs release to house arrest was a form of ‚Äúcommunity custody release‚Äù that was ‚Äújudicially approved.‚Äù The issue before us is whether that release was pursuant to a ‚Äúprogram.‚Äù Webster‚Äôs Third New International Dictionary 1812 (unabridged) (2002) defines a ‚Äúprogram‚Äù in pertinent part as a ‚Äúplan of procedure,‚Äù a ‚Äúschedule or system under which action may be taken toward a desired goal,‚Äù or ‚Äúa proposed project or scheme.‚Äù Concepts considered to be synonymous with a ‚Äúprogram‚Äù include an ‚Äúarrangement,‚Äù an ‚Äúoutline,‚Äù a ‚Äúplan,‚Äù and a ‚Äúschedule.‚Äù Burton‚Äôs Legal Thesaurus 430 (3d ed.1998). Applying the plain meaning rule, while the term ‚Äúprogram‚Äù suggests that any release will be subject to defined procedures and conditions, it does not require a formally adopted, county-wide, pre-existing, and uniform system of release. Defendant‚Äôs release here was subject to defined procedures and conditions. To the extent that authorization is at issue, Section 30-22-8.1(A) only requires the release to be ‚Äújudicially approved,‚Äù and as we have already noted, Defendant‚Äôs release was ‚Äújudicially approved.‚Äù Nothing about the terminology in the statute suggests that broader approbation of a formalized, universally applicable methodology is contemplated or required. Therefore, as this case illustrates, the release of a criminal defendant may be ‚Äújudicially approved‚Äù subject to defined procedures and conditions on a case-by-case basis. Finally, we note that while Section 30-22-8.1(A) makes no reference to Section 33-3-24, escape from an ‚Äúelectronic monitoring program‚Äù is specifically included. Accordingly, we find nothing in the plain language of the statute to support the meaning ascribed by the district court. ‚Äú[W]e do not read language into a statute, especially where the statute makes sense as written.‚Äù State v. Marshall, 2004-NMCA-104, ¬∂ 8, 136 N.M. 240, 96 P.3d 801.
{12} Finally, we consider policy. It seems reasonably clear that Section 30-22-8.1 was designed to create incentives for complying with the conditions of restrictive house arrest, just as the more general escape statutes were designed to create incentives for inmates to remain in jail or the penitentiary. The societal interest in obtaining criminal defendants‚Äô compliance with custodial restrictions applies to formalized systems and ad hoc procedures equally. Furthermore, the authorization of court-approved, ad hoc procedures would permit a degree of flexibility that would, appear to be desirable in this context. As such, the approach taken by the district court below does not appear to advance the purposes or policies underlying Section 30-22-8.1(A).
{13} In summary, we conclude that Defendant was subject to prosecution for escape under Section 30-22-8.1 throughout the period of time that she remained on house arrest pursuant to the electronic monitoring and reporting program specified in the Stipulated Order. As a consequence, both prongs of the Fellhauer test are satisfied, and Defendant is statutorily entitled to receive full presentence confinement credit.
B. The Mandate on Remand
{14} The parties dispute the scope of the district court‚Äôs authority on remand. The State contends that the appropriate procedure is an order of ‚Äúremand for an entirely new sentencing hearing, at which the length of Defendant‚Äôs sentence would be decided de novo, restricted only by the terms of her plea *470agreement.‚Äù Defendant contends that the inquiry should be limited to recalculation of her presentence confinement credit and application of that credit to her existing sentence. We agree with Defendant.
{15} The district court sentenced Defendant to a total prison term of twelve years and six months but suspended four years and six months, resulting in an eight-year prison sentence, to be followed by supervised probation, then parole. There is no dispute that Defendant‚Äôs underlying eight-year sentence is valid and within statutory limitations. However, the State contends that the miscalculation of Defendant‚Äôs presentenee confinement credit rendered her entire sentence illegal, such that the sentence as a whole may be reconsidered on remand. Therefore, the State contends, Defendant‚Äôs underlying eight-year sentence is subject to being increased to twelve years. This argument overlooks the nature of presentence confinement credit.
{16} Statutory presentence confinement credit gives a convicted defendant credit for the period spent in presentence confinement against the sentence finally imposed for that offense. Section 31-20-12. Furthermore, the granting of presentence confinement credit is mandatory. Id. (providing that credit shall be given for time spent in presentence confinement); State v. Ramzy, 98 N.M. 436, 437, 649 P.2d 504, 505 (Ct.App.1982) (observing that Section 31-20-12 is mandatory), modified on other grounds as recognized by State v. Romero, 2002-NMCA-106, ¬∂¬∂ 7-13, 132 N.M. 745, 55 P.3d 441. The judgment and sentence is therefore subject to correction for inclusion of the mandatory period of presentence confinement credit. See State v. Abril, 2003-NMCA-111, ¬∂ 20, 134 N.M. 326, 76 P.3d 644 (‚ÄúWhere a sentence lacks a statutorily! ]mandated provision, the trial court retains jurisdiction to correct the sentence by adding the omitted term.‚Äù (Emphasis added.)); see, e.g., State v. Aragon, 109 N.M. 632, 638, 788 P.2d 932, 938 (Ct.App.1990) (holding that the judgment and sentence could properly be amended to add a statutorily mandated restitution requirement); State v. Acuna, 103 N.M. 279, 280, 705 P.2d 685, 686 (Ct.App. 1985) (holding that a sentence could properly be amended to include a mandatory parole period). Correcting the judgment and sentence to accurately state the amount of presentence confinement credit Defendant is entitled to receive has no effect on the valid, underlying eight-year sentence. We are aware of no New Mexico case law suggesting that a sentence, which fails to include a mandatory provision, as in this case, is subject to wholesale revision in the manner sought by the State. See Abril, 2003-NMCA-111, ¬∂ 20, 134 N.M. 326, 76 P.3d 644; cf. State v. Charlton, 115 N.M. 35, 38, 846 P.2d 341, 344 (Ct.App.1992) (‚ÄúWhen a trial court imposes one valid and one invalid sentence, this court will sever the sentences if possible in order to give effect to the valid sentence.‚Äù). We therefore reject the State‚Äôs argument that the sentence, as a whole, is illegal and subject to reconsideration.
{17} Furthermore, the constitutional protection against double jeopardy prohibits increasing Defendant‚Äôs sentence. N.M. Const. art. II, ¬ß 15. ‚ÄúIt is a well-established principle of New Mexico law that a trial court generally cannot increase a valid sentence once a defendant begins serving that sentence.‚Äù State v. Porras, 1999-NMCA-016, ¬∂ 7, 126 N.M. 628, 973 P.2d 880. Since Defendant has started to serve her sentence, it can now be increased only if the underlying eight-year sentence itself is invalid. Id. Again, the underlying sentence itself is not invalid. While the failure to include the total amount of statutory presentence confinement credit that Defendant is entitled to receive requires correction, this does not render the underlying eight-year sentence itself invalid. See State v. McDonald, 113 N.M. 305, 307, 825 P.2d 238, 240 (Ct.App.1991) (stating that a district court‚Äôs allegedly improper denial of presentence confinement credit did not present a situation in which the sentence imposed was illegal). Given that the underlying eight-year sentence, which Defendant has begun to serve, is not illegal, it cannot now be increased. See Porras, 1999-NMCA-016, ¬∂ 7, 126 N.M. 628, 973 P.2d 880.
{18} The State contends that because Defendant has challenged her sentence, she could not have developed a ‚Äúreasonable ex*471pectation of finality‚Äù in her sentence, and resentencing is permissible. See State v. Villalobos, 1998-NMSC-036, ¬∂ 5, 126 N.M. 255, 968 P.2d 766 (noting the holding of United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980) that ‚Äúno reasonable expectation of finality exists in a sentence [for double jeopardy purposes] when Congress has enacted a statute allowing for the possibility the prosecutor could still successfully appeal the sentence‚Äù). However, Defendant has never sought to overturn her underlying eight-year sentence. Her challenge has always been limited to the presentence confinement credit issue. We have already concluded that this limited challenge does not undermine the validity of the underlying sentence.
{19} Finally, the State argues that resentencing should be permitted so that the original intent of the sentencing court can be effectuated. In this regard, the district court stated that it ‚Äúnever contemplated, nor approved, the notion that the time [Defendant] spent under house arrest would count as time of incarceration.‚Äù To the extent that the State relies on the sentencing package doctrine as explained in cases such as United States v. Hicks, 146 F.3d 1198, 1202-03 (10th Cir.1998), we point out that, by its terms, the doctrine applies to multiple count cases in which one or more counts are reversed. Here, no count was reversed, and the possibility of this Court‚Äôs requiring full credit was apparent to the district court at the time it made its ruling. Indeed, if the district court truly intended to require Defendant to serve a particular amount of time, it could have granted the requested presentence confinement credit and lessened the number of years that would be suspended.
CONCLUSION
{20} We reverse Defendant‚Äôs sentence and remand with instructions to grant Defendant the total presentence confinement credit to which she is entitled.
{21} IT IS SO ORDERED.

Oldsmar, a tranquil city of 15,000 people in the Tampa Bay area in Florida, unexpectedly became the victim of a cyber-attack in early February this year. Hackers gained remote access to the city‚Äôs water treatment plant and increased the amount of sodium hydroxide to 100 times its normal level.
This caustic substance is used in extremely low concentrations to control drinking water acidity and remove metals but is also the main ingredient in drain cleaner. ‚ÄúThis is dangerous stuff‚Ä¶you‚Äôre basically talking about lye‚Äù said Oldsmar‚Äôs Sheriff, Bob Gualtieri at a news conference shortly after the incident. He added that the sodium hydroxide, had it actually entered the city‚Äôs water supply, could have made residents extremely sick indeed.
However, the attack was caught and mitigated long before this could happen, when the modified lye level was quickly noted by a supervisor. Oldsmar city officials underlined that other security measures would have prevented the contaminated water from actually arriving in residents‚Äô homes, while the inexperienced hacker didn‚Äôt hide his presence and changed settings so dramatically that the modifications were easy to spot.
Critical Infrastructure Facilities Under Attack
Although this particular incident was resolved harmlessly, this is a scenario that cybersecurity experts have been warning about for some time. Most water and sewage plants, dams and gas and oil pipelines have moved to digital systems that allow employees to remotely track and adjust pressure, temperature and chemical inputs. The problem is that remote access creates a vulnerability that hackers can exploit, gaining control in order to potentially wreak havoc, and not all cyber-attacks are as innocuous as that of Oldsmar.
What was once the subject of science fiction has become a very real and constant threat as we move towards global digitalization, and critical infrastructure is becoming a more frequent target for hackers. Advanced Russian hackers have been regularly investigating American critical infrastructure systems since 2012, managing in 2017 to infiltrate one US power plant deeply enough to manipulate its controls before being caught.
In 2013 Iranian hackers were detected inside the Bowman Avenue Dam, a small structure that holds back a stream 30 miles north of New York. Had they been in control of the locks on the much larger Arthur R. Bowman dam in Oregon, as investigators originally feared, the attack could have resulted in disaster.
Human-Machine Interfaces
Yet we rarely hear about incidents of cyberattacks on infrastructure systems, despite the fact that power grids, water systems, sewage and manufacturing plants are usually monitored and controlled through ‚Äúhuman-machine interfaces‚Äù or HMI ‚Äî web pages designed for remote interaction, and notoriously easy to hack. If such incidents don‚Äôt make the news, it‚Äôs probably not because they don‚Äôt happen, but because there is no obligation for the victims to report them.
In the specific case of water treatment facilities, the US Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 does require water systems serving more than 3,300 people to carry out risk assessments and maintain emergency response plans but does not require them to actually report any cybersecurity breaches. Cybersecurity experts consider the smaller municipal systems to be the greatest cause for concern. With few resources they resort to remote access, creating the very point of vulnerability that can be exploited, but their small budgets mean they can‚Äôt afford much by way of cybersecurity protection, making them easy targets.
Transportation Systems are Affected
Transportation systems are also easy prey for cybercriminals, whose aim in recent US cybersecurity breaches has usually been financial gain through ransomware attacks ‚Äî Colorado, San Francisco, Sacramento and Atlanta have all been victims in the last five years. Conversely the 2008 cyber hijack of a tram system in Poland injured dozens of people and clearly demonstrates the potentially serious danger in the future of our transportation systems.
A cyberattack in this sector could affect everything from traffic lights to high speed trains to airport radar systems, not to mention the self-driving cars of the future, with devastating consequences.
Although new cyber threats are being developed as fast as the technologies they intend to attack, and everything that is connected to a network should now be considered at potential risk, the cybersecurity market is also growing rapidly, with many innovative solutions available to help companies and organizations secure their digital infrastructure. With so much at risk as cyberattacks increase in volume and strength, it is essential to implement strong and effective defense strategies.

Yeast is a high source of chromium and has actually been revealed to support sugar metabolic process plan).21 Another scientist released an action criticising the study for insufficient doses. 24 Gunton applied to the FDA for qualified health care, but the only allowed claim worried lowering insulin resistance based on a research study utilizing 500 mg of elemental chromium and 4,000 mg of hormone per useful in individuals with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and prediabetes. brand-new study, scientists at the University of Miami analyzed data on the effects of chromium supplementation on blood sugar for three decades and concluded that chromium supplements in healthy individuals or diabetics are not effective in decreasing fasting blood sugar. The FDA provided an unfavorable research study of chromium for diabetes with 800 mg of chromium picolinate and 100 mg of elemental chromium (about 12% diet).21 Another scientist released an action a valuable weapon for weight-loss because it transports fatty acids from the blood to mitochondria where they can be utilized for energy production. Some people with diabetes of all kinds might take advantage of an L-cannitin supplement because it can help to lower blood sugar levels.

What is Veganic Farming?
Veganic farming is a plant-based farming method that uses plants to grow plants. Organic farming removes the dangers of most contamination issues, veganic farming eliminates the crops exposure to animal fertilizers as well.
Most farm animals are exposed to pesticides and other chemical and routinely given antibiotics and other drugs either directly or via their feed. These residue of these chemical can show up in their manure. This manure is used in non-organic and organic farms however since Locals is veganic we only used plants to grow plants thus we keep away additional pathogens and contaminants away from our crops. We also take it a step further an don't use any pesticides even organic approved pesticide on our farm.
In essence, veganic is a logical step beyond organic for those who seek safe food grown in a sustainable manner.
Hyper Quality Control In Every Step
Our food produce can no longer be confined to rural America. Our agriculture system is due for sustainable innovation. We need to grow food in a way that will be not only productive, safe, and sustainable for our lifetime, but also for future generations. #265!

John: Okay, the first plugin I‚Äôve got here today is called Registered Users Only, and this is a plugin that allows you to lock down your website real quick and easy. It‚Äôs a plugin I‚Äôm starting to use more and more when I‚Äôm doing development versus using a landing page or the in development pages plugins that were used. This one locks it down to specifically prevent anyone from getting into the site unless they are logged in or through IP addresses if you do a little customization in the code.
It‚Äôs a plugin I inherited through a client and it can also help you build an intranet, and this is more information on what‚Äôs going to be developing from this plugin further down the line. But other than that, if you use this plugin with Gravity Forms, you can also force people to only register for your website, and with some more tweaks, you can limit it even further.
But as it stands right now as Registered Users Only, it‚Äôs a great plugin and I gave it a 4-Dragon rating.
Marcus: Outstanding! Well, what I‚Äôm going to talk about next is called Advanced Image Grabber, and this is a really cool plugin. What it does is you can point it to an external webpage URL somewhere and it will take all of the images that‚Äôs on that page and allow you to select them and import them. So it will just download them straight from that website and import them right into the media library. What do you think of that, John?
John: That‚Äôs very nice. It also sounds very dangerous.
Marcus: It does. It sounds like somebody could pirate you with just one click.
John: Yeah.
Marcus: But this is pretty cool in terms of if you‚Äôve got, you know, an old client site and you need to pull a bunch of images over, stuff like that.
John: Yeah, I can see the benefits for it.
Marcus: Yeah, yeah ‚Äì so I rated this one a 4 out of 5.
John: Yeah, very nice. Yeah, it‚Äôs got some great benefits but the use and copyright violations is just astounding for that one, too.
Okay, the next plugin I‚Äôve got here
. This is one of the first in many plugins coming for WP Plugins A to Z. This is going to be one of our first plugins created. It‚Äôs called Staff Directory WPAZ. If you want to get a copy of it, you‚Äôll have to go to the Contact page and send me an email. But I‚Äôll tell you a little bit about this plugin. This is a fork of another plugin called Staff Directory. There‚Äôs a link in the show notes to the original.
What we‚Äôve done with this plugin is it came to me through a client of mine who had a staff directory and they were using this plugin but it wasn‚Äôt adequate to the needs and there was nothing else out there. So we decided to take this plugin which had the good basics and start forking it out.
What it allows you to do is create a staff list which you can edit in the backend and display in the frontend via a short code. This is for if you‚Äôre running an intranet and you wanted to display your staff list. We added functionality to it such as Ajax Sorting for the frontend, as well as in the backend, the ability to export the CSV file, the ability to reimport the CSV file, and double-check to make sure if the entries were there, and not over-write them. It also did some cleanup of the interface.
We‚Äôve added a whole bunch of new features to it and there‚Äôs more coming. This is a plugin that will continue to be developed over time and it‚Äôs going to be our first plugin that gets announced out to the world soon ‚Äì and may even submit it to the WordPress Repository eventually, so check it out. Of course, since it‚Äôs a WordPress Plugin from A to Z, it‚Äôs going to get a 5, right?
Marcus:
John: No, just kidding. At the moment, it‚Äôs still rated at a 4, but it‚Äôs not a perfect plugin yet, but it‚Äôs getting close. So check it out; it‚Äôs called Staff Directory WPAZ.
Marcus: Excellent. I look forward to that and many more.
John: Yeah, well there‚Äôs another one in the pipeline right now, too.
Marcus: Yeah, maybe we can fork off all the 3‚Äôs and 4‚Äôs that we found and make them 5‚Äôs.
John: Well, what‚Äôs happening is when I run into a plugin that‚Äôs needed, I‚Äôm starting to fork it off since I‚Äôve manage to find myself a really good quality developer locally who does work for me.
Marcus: Yeah, I do the same with my outsource team. I have them fork plugins that I like that gets me about 70% of the way that I need to get ‚Äî
John: Yeah.
Marcus: ‚Äî and then have them do the rest as far as the last 30.
John: Time to bring them back here and we can offer them as an exclusive to our subscribers on the website.
Marcus: Hmm, that‚Äôs a great idea. Well, the next one I‚Äôd like to talk about is called Disable Autocomplete, and John, with so many autocomplete scripts out there and I‚Äôm talking about stuff within Chrome, Firefox ‚Äì you know, those password savers.
John: Autocomplete forms.
Marcus: Last Pass is another good one. There are a lot of different ways that sensitive data could get saved within your browser, and sometimes you just don‚Äôt want that. To do your users a favor, you can use this plugin to disable autocomplete and it prevents items from being saved in your passwords or Last Pass, which can be pretty valuable if you‚Äôve got stuff that‚Äôs relatively sensitive that you do not want somebody to just save the password, and I rated this one a perfect 5 out of 5.
John: Very nice. Very nice. That could come in real handy.
Marcus: Yes.
John: Okay, and the final one I‚Äôve got here is called WP Security Audit Log. This is a great plugin that helps you track everything on your website from user sign-ins to whatever changes they‚Äôve made, including your own changes, whatever plugins you install, activate, deactivate, remove. It tracks failed logins and more.
It‚Äôs a great tool for helping you know what‚Äôs going on and if something goes wrong on your site. It‚Äôs got a log here you can go and check it out and see what happened just before it went wrong. It tracks pretty much everything. You can also expand its abilities by adding some pro add-ons such as email notifications, you have user monitor, and even more to it.
All in all, a pretty great plugin. Again, another one that I picked up from a client and check it out: WP Security Audit Log; I gave it a 4-Dragon rating.
Marcus: And that‚Äôs pretty valuable stuff.
John: It‚Äôs very ‚Äî
Marcus: You want to see what‚Äôs going on.
John: ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôve got a site with multiple users.
Marcus: Yeah, absolutely. All right, I‚Äôm going to wrap it up with something that‚Äôs a little off the beaten path. It‚Äôs called WP API Yoast SEO and what this does is it returns Yoast post or page metadata in a normal post or page request and it stores the metadata in a field of returned data. Yay. Okay, so what?
But I want to bring this plugin to light not because I think a ton of people will be using it, but I want to talk about this to illustrate and highlight a point that these kinds of plugin interactions via API are coming a lot faster than you might think. So what this does is it actually takes metadata from within Yoast and you can manipulate it and do different things with ‚Äî actually, even incorporate it within your post itself, so that‚Äôs pretty powerful. I only bring this up because Yoast is something that almost all of us use ‚Äî
John: Yes.
Marcus: ‚Äî in some respect. And this plugin is fun to just get a sense of what kind of interactions you can do with the API, and that‚Äôs why I wanted to talk about it. It‚Äôs called WP API Yoast SEO, and I rated it a 4 out of 5.
John: Very nice. Yes, we‚Äôve got lots and lots of changes coming down the pipe for WordPress over the next year or two.
Marcus: Mm-hmm.
John: Okay, well that covers up. In this show, I covered up the Registered Users Only, which I gave a 4 to; the Staff Directory WPAZ, which I gave a 4 to; and the WP Security Audit Log, which I gave a 4 to.
Marcus: And I talked about Advanced Image Graver, 4 out of 5; Disable Autocomplete got a perfect 5 out of 5; and WP API Yoast SEO gets a 4 out of five.
John: Very nice.

Unlike others in my class, I don‚Äôt sing or play, so I‚Äôve taken what is supposedly the easiest option by choosing to rewrite existing songs instead. The first step in all of that is choosing the tracks I want to work on, and as I write this, that‚Äôs still very much a work in progress. I do have one song set in stone, which I rediscovered my love for a few weeks ago thanks to Spotify‚Äôs random choices ‚Äì Coldplay‚Äôs ‚ÄòIn My Place‚Äô (song titles go in single inverted commas, apparently). However, the only issue with being able to choose songs you enjoy is that you risk butchering musical masterpieces with your own mediocre words, and that was definitely at the front of my mind as I started to think about mine.
We‚Äôve been doing various writing exercises in seminars over the last few weeks that we hope will get our creative juices flowing. Many of them have involved writing about different unrelated emotions or scenarios in prose or loose verse, so that we can pluck certain words and phrases for later use. In my case at least, some exercises have been more fruitful than others, but a few words, lines and images have helped me to get started. Last night, I went to the library to begin my new version of ‚ÄòIn My Place‚Äô, and because the song has a relatively simple syllabic structure and rhyme scheme, I had written a draft I was satisfied with in around half an hour ‚Äì giving me 39 lines of lyrics. A blank sheet of paper is daunting for any writer, so I initially focused only on getting started and committing to an opening line. What I came up with was ‚Äúouter space, outer space‚Äù, which mirrors the repetition of the title in Coldplay‚Äôs original, since I felt a degree of pressure at first to be faithful to it. It had the effect of evoking something better, though, so I soon replaced it with something else. From there, the rest of the piece seemed to flow nicely, and my portfolio was officially underway.
Because I‚Äôm rewriting something existing, it is imperative that the new song exactly matches the syllabic count of the original. In some cases, there may be an opportunity for an extra syllable in a line where one has been stretched by the singer ‚Äì but I have to try and remember not to get greedy. I have a feeling that whatever the next four songs are, their new words won‚Äôt come quite as easily as the first set did, and I‚Äôll have a lot more to consider before I can make them work. Each submission has to be accompanied by a 30-second recording explaining what you were trying to achieve with it, so there are both technical and emotional aspects to think about. Even so, I‚Äôm finding the study of lyrics less highbrow and much more accessible than I did traditional poetry last year. I can only conclude that that must be because of the nature of popular music as something which is designed to be cherry-picked and enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age, experience or background.

On Wednesday, the CEO delivered a 26-minute speech at the Palais des congr√®s in Montreal, during which he only spoke French for about 20 seconds. After the speech, Rousseau was asked in French by a journalist for Quebec TV news channel LCN how he‚Äôs managed to live in Montreal for so long despite speaking little French.
He was unable to answer it and asked for the question to be posed in English. When pressed, he said despite living in Quebec for 14 years, he‚Äôs too busy running a company to learn French.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been able to live in Montreal without speaking French, and I think that‚Äôs a testament to the city of Montreal,‚Äù Rousseau said.

Research has shown that L-theanine can enhance sleep quality not just by serving as a sedative but also by lowering anxiety and promoting relaxation. Scientists found in one research study that doses of 250 mg and 400 mg L-theanine respectively improved the sleep of human beings and animals (16 ). The scientists also discovered that the drug reduced stress and anxiety and enhanced symptoms. L-theanine and caffeine mixes can influence human cognition, as shown by alpha-band oscillatory activity and attention job. L-theanine can be used together with caffeine to enhance cognitive capabilities. The impact of 3 main state of mind. Evaluation of the effects of caffeine and theanine on maintaining alertness and continual attention during tasks. aid with low anxiety and as a sleep aid. Given that it is a substance that naturally occurs in green tea and black tea, it is also offered as a supplement. L-theanine in green tea produces a mouthwatering taste referred to as umami taste. Tea is the most typical food source for L-theanine, but it can also be discovered in some kinds of fungis. In foods such as green tea, L-anine is believed to be a source of umami, a spicy, breakable taste. A study found that individuals who experienced high blood pressure during a specific psychological job found that L-theanine assisted minimize the rise in high blood pressure. In another study, it helped enhance sleep and mood in felines, but did not have the very same impact on disrupted eating and drinking behavior. esearch also suggests that L-theanine in black and green tea can add to a sense of relaxation by decreasing the resting heart rate of an individual. In 2016 Scholey and his coworkers reported that subjects who took in a nutrient beverage that consisted of 200 milligrams of L-theanine (approximately the quantity found in 8 cups of tea) had lower cortisol levels and reported feeling more unwinded throughout stress-inducing jobs than those who consumed a placebo4. A little research study revealed discovered in tea. These research studies have shown that the mix has no impact on mood, and they have also found that it has little or no impact. Kinetics L-theanine uptake and metabolism in healthy participants was comparable to the consumption of green tea L-theanine pills. The theanine content showed a connection with associated gene expression levels in the culture and tissues of tea plants in order to figure out the integrated effect of metabolic genes. The connection between metabolism of theanins and associated gene expression profiles and the content of theanins was examined in this study. Theanine functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain and can reduce high blood pressure in hypertensive rats. Lots of research studies on theanine have been carried out in combination with caffeine, which is found in tea. These studies have actually revealed that the combination has no effect on state of mind, and they have identify the integrated impact of metabolic genes. The correlation between metabolic process of theanins and associated gene expression profiles and the material of theanins was investigated in this study. consumption of green tea L-theanine pills. For people with type 2 diabetes, a metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance and increased stomach fat, the suggested day-to-day consumption is 1,000 mg GTF (glucose tolerance aspect) in chromium type, which is utilized by the body. Chromium picolinate supplements decreases weight gain and increases insulin sensitivity in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Research studies show that chromium preparations can be valuable in people with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and prediabetes. Share on Pinterest Chromium increases insulin sensitivity, which assists the body process blood glucose. While some scientific trials have actually shown no benefit, other scientific trials report that the supplements lower blood sugar levels and insulin levels that people with diabetes requirement. Individuals with type 2 diabetes taking chromium picolinate had better HbA1c levels, utilized to control long-term blood sugar levels, in a properly designed study than those who ate a placebo. A research study carried out by the Human Nutrition Research Center of the US Department of Agriculture found that people who were treated with type 2 diabetes and got either placebo or a chromium preparation over a four-month duration continued to take regular medications and did not alter their eating practices; the group who received extra chromium decreased insulin and cholesterol levels than the placebo group. Another of these studies discovered that when people with type 2 diabetes for a month got chloride supplements two times a day, their insulin and cholesterol levels dropped. Previous research studies have shown that insulin resistance is the main factor for clinical action to chromium25,37-39. In people with type 2 diabetes who utilized sulfonylurea, Martin39 showed that chromium picolinate improved insulin level of sensitivity and glucose control and reduced body weight and visceral fat compared to placebo. While previous research stopped working to validate that additional chromium helps people with limited glucose tolerance due to type 2 diabetes, recent studies have actually revealed that it can help deal with diabetes by lowering blood fat levels, improving weight loss and improving body structure. Chromium supplements did not increase weight, blood glucose, body fat portion or fat levels in a study of 80 obese and overweight grownups and females with increased waist circumference. Current research study suggests that research studies reporting a small reduction in body weight after supplementation with chromium have considerable limitations. A study discovered that women who consumed nutrient and energy-based products and whose energy consumption was just managed by chromium picolinate supplements had no impact on weight, body mass or iron levels. In a brand-new study, researchers at the University of Miami examined data on the impacts of chromium supplementation on blood glucose for three years and concluded that chromium supplements in healthy people or diabetics are ineffective in lowering fasting blood sugar. The study, entitled "Improving metaanalytic techniques to show the result of a chromium supplement on fasting glucose - toxicity," was released in the journal Biological Trace Elements Research. The research study was developed to examine the results of chromium picolinate supplements in mix with a nutritional education intervention for weight-loss in ladies and men and to evaluate whether the effects are because of anthropometry or body fat circulation. Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a helpful role in regulating insulin, the hormonal agent that manages blood sugar and assists to carry glucose to cells where it can be utilized to create energy in the body. Chromium contributes in the insulin signaling paths that enable our body to control the amount of sugar we take in, which assists balance blood sugar level levels and gives us steady energy. For instance, yeast is a high source of chromium and has actually been shown to support sugar metabolic process and glucose form in the blood which is helpful in preventing glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and diabetes development. There is clinical proof that combined chromium supplementation can have a favorable lowered cravings for carbohydrates and fat foods and a minor loss of body weight. Because weight problems is more equally distributed and is associated with insulin resistance, we presume that chromium might support weight loss. Due to the substantial effects accomplished by greater doses of chromium picolinate, Gunton et al. The FDA released an unfavorable research study of chromium for diabetes with 800 mg of chromium picolinate and 100 mg of essential chromium (about 12% diet plan).21 Another researcher published a response criticising the research study for inadequate dosages. 24 Gunton applied to the FDA for qualified health care, but the only allowed claim concerned reducing insulin resistance based on a study using 500 mg of essential. Chromium picolinate has actually become a popular dietary supplement for bodybuilders and professional athletes who use it to keep muscle mass throughout workout and promote fat loss. Chromium GTF-200, a nicotinic acid has been revealed to help metabolize fat, improve glucose and insulin metabolism, preserve healthy cholesterol and blood sugar levels, transform proteins into muscles and transform sugars into energy. Scientists have studied dietary supplements such as chromium picolinate to support weight-loss and modifications in body structure, especially low iron levels in females who consume nutrient and energy-based items. Studies show that chromium preparations can be helpful decreased insulin and cholesterol levels than the placebo group. In a brand-new research study, scientists at the University of Miami evaluated data on the effects of chromium supplementation on blood sugar for three years and concluded that chromium supplements in healthy people or diabetics are not efficient in lowering fasting blood sugar. The FDA issued an unfavorable study of chromium for diabetes with 800 mg of chromium picolinate and 100 mg of essential chromium (about 12% diet).21 Another researcher published an action criticising the research study for inadequate doses.ineBecause it carries fatty acids from the blood to mitochondria where they can be used for energy production, l-carnitine is an important weapon for weight loss. Some individuals with diabetes of all kinds may benefit from an L-cannitin supplement because it can help to lower blood sugar level levels. L-carnitine not just assists the body burn fuel as efficiently as possible to increase energy, but also enhances athletic efficiency and endurance by inhibiting the buildup of lactic acid, which is among the primary causes of exhaustion throughout exercise. Research studies have shown that patients who utilize L-carcitine for weight loss experience a decrease in body fat, an increase in muscle mass, enhancements in strength and stamina and a decrease in fatigue. It is believed to assist minimize and enhance muscles fat in the body, helping people to feel less tired and enhance weight loss. If you do not combine it with a healthy diet and exercise routine, it is crucial to keep in mind that L-carnitine will not help you burn fat and lose weight. If you are vegan or on a restricted diet, the injection directly into your body supplies you with the healthy carnitine your body needs to charge energy and burn fat. At MD Ageless Solutions, we found the most efficient method to address weight reduction issue with the aid of L-carbonitin preparations that are known to assist weight reduction and deal other health benefits. If you don't eat meat or dairy products or have a limited efficient fat burning and weight loss. They can be used for those who are deficient in L-carnitine, wish to reduce weight and construct factors why many weight reduction supplements include it due to its native function in the body. Carnitine, as a type of amino acid, benefits from the energy material by transporting fatty acids to mitochondria where they can be burned and used as fuel. For this reason, many individuals take carnitine as a weight loss supplement to promote weight loss. For numerous people, L-carnitine is a way to speed up weight-loss and weight loss. Benefits of carnitine include improving brain function, avoiding muscle damage, regulating blood sugar level and increasing endurance. Keep in mind that while carnitine can improve fat loss and weight-loss in some people, it must be used with a healthy diet and active way of life to get the most outcomes. Weight reduction Since L-carnitine helps to burn fat for energy, many individuals assume that more of it will assist them reduce weight. It has been suggested nevertheless that its capability to transport more fat acids into the cells to burn energy makes it a reliable efficiency booster and it is advantageous for fat loss and weight reduction. Because it is utilized by professional athletes all over the world for fat loss, it can enhance the method your body uses fat as fuel, resulting in much better workout performance3. It is a popular supplement for both weight reduction and fat burning and need to be taken as a terrific addition to your workout program. The mix of adenosine and L-carnitine can assist you increase your weight reduction plan by turning your body into a weight loss maker. In addition to the benefits of this supplement in fat burning and weight loss, it likewise supports the function of the body's body immune system and is an efficient antioxidant. Since L-Carnitine supplements are safe and take place naturally it can also assist you melt fat and increase energy for a lot of workouts. With a much better content of L-carnitine in the body, it will be easier to burn fat and increase the energy material. Considering that L-carcinol helps to transfer more fat acids into the cells to burn energy, one would believe that this would likewise help to burn fat and drop, found that L-carcinine supplementation did not increase fat loss and endurance training achieved this objective. Extra L-carnitine can help to compensate for shortages in the amino acids methionine and lysine in individuals on a plant-based diet who do not have adequate quantities of these amino acids in animal products. As lots of people do not have an appropriate diet plan that produces amino acid derivatives in big amounts, build-up by increasing fat loss and energy usage throughout physical activity. L-carnitine At MD Ageless Solutions, we found the most efficient method to address weight loss problem with the help of L-carbonitin preparations that are known to assist weight loss and offer other health benefits. Weight loss Since L-carnitine assists to burn fat for energy, numerous individuals presume that more of it will help them lose weight.

The number of medics in England has fallen further behind comparable European countries over the summer, ahead of what is predicted to be one of the worst winters in the 73-year history of the health service, Dr Chaand Nagpaul said.
‚ÄúWinter is an incredibly difficult time for the health service,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith flu season on the horizon and even fewer staff this time round, it‚Äôs a total unknown as to how well our services will cope ‚Äì if they even cope at all.‚Äù
England has a much lower doctor to population ratio than comparable EU countries, with just 2.8 doctors per 1,000 people, in comparison with an EU average of 3.7, according to the BMA. Its research in July said that meeting this average would mean scaling up by 31% ‚Äì or an additional 49,162 full-time equivalent (FTE) doctors.
Now new data, revealed at the BMA‚Äòs annual representative meeting in London, suggests the crisis has worsened.
With more GPs and hospital doctors quitting over the summer, the shortage has risen to 50,191, according to the BMA. This reflects a loss of 919 doctors in primary care and 110 in secondary care over the last two months.
Yet more doctors are actively considering quitting in the coming months due to burnout and excessive workloads. ‚ÄúAlarm bells‚Äù should be ringing, Dr Nagpaul said.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frightening to see that the gap between the number of doctors in England and comparable EU nations is widening at such pace,‚Äù said Dr Nagpaul. ‚ÄúFor those still working in the NHS, who knows how long we‚Äôve got them for.
‚ÄúRather than actively retaining staff, government has stood by as doctors work themselves to the point of exhaustion, with many now considering leaving the NHS, further depleting us of expert, talented colleagues.‚Äù
The workforce crisis means staff are working longer hours to keep up with patient demand. Some feel they have no choice but to hand in their notice to get the respite they need. This piles pressure on those that remain, Dr Nagpaul said.
Last week, Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told the Guardian that GPs in England are ‚Äúfinding it increasingly hard to guarantee safe care‚Äù for millions of patients, because the shortage of medics means they are unable to cope with soaring demand.
Dr Nagpaul also expressed concerns about how far the additional funding for the NHS and social care, announced last week, will stretch, as the health service continues to deal with the pandemic and a backlog of cases.
The government plans to raise ¬£12bn extra a year for the NHS and adult social care, partly through a rise in national insurance next spring. The NHS will get most of the share for the first three years, with ¬£5.3bn allocated to social care, ¬£500m of which will be spent on workforce training and recruitment.
Ministers said social care will get more money after this window, when the ¬£86,000 cap on costs ‚Äì which comes into force in October 2023 ‚Äì starts to require funding.
But Dr Nagpaul said that, despite the funding announcements, ‚Äúthe BMA estimates that core health spending is still ¬£10bn short‚Äù.
The BMA is also calling for extra funding for more medical school, foundation programme and specialty training places, alongside investment in the staff and infrastructure needed to deliver this.

Montgomery Township home offers the ultimate in style, quality and elegance
When Luke Meisenbacher of Global Technologies founded his building company they had one objective ‚Äî to create and build truly remarkable one-of-a-kind homes that would satisfy the most discerning home buyer.

Mr. Meisenbacher, when asked to describe the company's philosophy, replied, "We want our buyers to be able to walk around the home and see consistently fine detail. We will work with purchasers to make sure the home is precisely what they want."
To achieve this, the team continuously researches new materials and studies architectural details of the past in order to incorporate them tastefully and efficiently into their projects.
The Jefferson at Grandview, which is currently under construction in a scenic corner of Montgomery Township, offers the ultimate in style, quality and elegance. Designed for a comfortable lifestyle with a functional, imaginative floor plan for everyday living as well as for entertaining, this lovely house combines traditional features with modern conveniences.

One thing that was not implemented in the initial releases was support for syncing data. While data syncing was a work in progress for a long time on Windows and Mac OS as well, Linux users had to wait a bit longer still.
Now, with Microsoft Edge 91 comes synchronization functionality on Linux. The feature is available in development versions and labeled experimental, which means that users need to enable it right now to make use of it.
The functionality enables Linux users to sync data such as passwords, favorites or extensions. It does require a Microsoft account, but that is to be expected as Microsoft‚Äôs sync functionality requires a Microsoft account on all supported platforms.
To enable syncing on Linux, Linux users need to do the following:
- Make sure that Edge is at version 91.0.831.x or higher.
- Load edge://flags in the browser‚Äôs address bar.
- Set the status of the flag to Enabled.
- Restart the Microsoft Edge web browser.
Login functionality becomes available after the restart. Select the profile image on the browser‚Äôs main toolbar and there sign in to sign-in with a Microsoft account.
The feature syncs data using the account, which means that synced data will become available on other platforms.
Microsoft notes that the synchronization may take a few seconds to complete.
Linux users may experience issues when the feature gets enabled. Microsoft published a few scenarios on its Tech Community website. These are:
- My browser is not behaving correctly since I logged in and enabled Sync.
- My browser crashes when I launch it since I logged in and enabled Sync.
- Disabling things as described above did not work for me.
- Deleting my Profile folder did not work for me.
Edge can be started with the parameter ‚Äìdisable-features=msOneAuthEnableMSALSignInOnLinux to turn off the feature; useful if it is not starting anymore after enabling it.
A quick test of the sync functionality on several Linux systems was successful. Syncing could be enabled and was working as expected on these devices.

Franchises are the big money makers these days and one of the franchises that never quite make the jump to the $1bil club is The Terminator series. Three high priced sequels were made after T2: Judgement Day but none of them were box office hits. Yet somehow the studio executives are willing to write big checks to make more films in the series. The latest in supposed to be a true sequel to T2 since James Cameron is officially part of the production, he came up with the story and produced this sequel.
Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and her son John (Edward Furlong) has stopped Judgement Day and Skynet never happened. Unfortunately, the war between machines and humans are inevitable and a new threat has emerged. A lone warrior from the future name Grace (Mackenzie Davis) has been sent back to our time to protect our new savior named Dani (Natalia Reyes) from the new evil time travel Terminator (Gabriel Luna). With the help of Sarah and T-800/Carl (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Grace must figure a way to keep Dani alive and kill the more advanced Terminator. That‚Äôs basically the story, there‚Äôs nothing new here, if you‚Äôve seen the previous Terminator films then you know how it goes. Lots of big chases and shootouts and machine hand to hand combats.
According to Cameron, we‚Äôre supposed to ignore the last three films, and this is a true sequel to Judgement Day. I didn‚Äôt care for the last three films and was curious as to what kind of story he came up with. Well as it turned out, there‚Äôs not much here that we haven‚Äôt seen before. It‚Äôs same storyline, there‚Äôs no creativity or any sort of effort in trying to create anything that resembles originality. I‚Äôm not a fan of McG‚Äôs Terminator Salvation but at least that film tried to come up with something new and move story forward to new territory. Here Cameron and his writers just rehashed the same tired storyline from the previous films and updated with new characters. It‚Äôs quite surprising how lazy script was to me.
Director Tim Miller didn‚Äôt help much with his lackluster directing skills. He basically tried to mimic Cameron‚Äôs style and he failed on every level. The action scenes were huge but lack any excitement and I‚Äôll say it again, it lacked creativity. Miller‚Äôs background is in art direction and design and the film looked great. But he‚Äôs not a good film director, he‚Äôs one of those Hollywood directors that can shoot beautiful shots but can‚Äôt put scenes together to make a compelling story.
The only thing that saved this from being a complete disaster are the actors. It‚Äôs great seeing Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor and Arnold can play The Terminator role in his sleep. Just like the last film, he‚Äôs basically the comic sidekick. Mackenzie Davis is becoming one of my favorite actresses in Hollywood. She‚Äôs great here as the new action hero and she even able to deliver some corny lines with believability. I‚Äôve never seen Natalia Reyes in anything before but she held her own against the more veteran actors. As for Gabriel Luna, well he didn‚Äôt have much to do except to look like an evil Terminator, basically he‚Äôs similar to Robert Patrick‚Äôs T-1000 in T2.
I‚Äôve said in my review of the last film Terminator Genisys that this franchise needs to be terminated and I stand by that statement. There‚Äôs nothing new or exciting in this latest sequel and I would be happy to never see another Terminator film in the future.
So have you seen Terminator: Dark Fate? Well, what did you think?

Show how the poet‚Äôs marriage is mirrored in the work, e.g. via men and women‚Äôs relationships all through the poem being shown as empty, soulless, and sad. In different phrases, when getting down to write an excellent English essay about any textual content, don‚Äôt be afraid to pile on the proof ‚Äì though be wise, a handful of quotations or examples must be greater than enough to make your level convincing.

This essay gives an accurate, however relatively one-dimensional, dialogue of Hamlet‚Äôs relationships with Gertrude and Claudius, and how they have an effect on his present of insanity. However the discussion doesn‚Äôt go deeper than some properly summarized plot points and it by no means digs into Ophelia‚Äôs madness, which is a serious a part of the theme all through the play.
Systems In literature essay examples ‚Äì Straightforward Advice
19. Do not merely skim to level out literary devices. (I used to say ‚Äî Don‚Äôt Where‚Äôs Waldo the system‚Äù however this can be a copy write challenge.) Zoom deep into the textual content to establish the device, clarify intimately how the system is functioning and then zoom out to explain the way it works to support the passage as a whole and how it connects to the common human condition. This means the difference between writing a school level paper and writing a high school degree paper. Thanks for the tip from Jodi G. from Saugus High. Thanks for the tip from Erin M. at Mercy County Senior Excessive.
The mid-vary sample additionally cites particular details: the words Elizabeth modifications (fay‚Äù for succeed‚Äù) for her father. These details are purported to assist the point that class difference causes battle between the two. Nonetheless, the writer leaves it to the reader to make the connection between class, expectations, and phrase choices. The example of the phrases Elizabeth eliminates from her vocabulary doesn‚Äôt beowulf symbols illustrate the writer‚Äôs point of class conflict. In reality, the category difference as the reason for their difficulties is never explicitly said. As an alternative, the author makes general, unsupported statements about Hardy‚Äôs focus on the language difference without saying why Hardy does that.
three. Provide a number of items of evidence where potential. Many essays have some extent to make and make it, tacking on a single piece of proof from the textual content (or from beyond the textual content, e.g. a vital, historical, or biographical supply) within the hope that this can be sufficient to make the point convincing. ‚ÄòState, quote, explain‚Äô is the Holy Trinity of the Paragraph for many. What‚Äôs improper with it? For one thing, this approach is too formulaic and fundamental for many arguments. Is one citation sufficient to help some extent? It‚Äôs usually a matter of degree, and although one piece of proof is healthier than none, two or three items will probably be even more persuasive. In spite of everything, in a court docket of legislation a single eyewitness account will not be sufficient to convict the accused of the crime, and even a confession from the accused would carry more weight if it comes supported by other, objective proof (e.g. DNA, fingerprints, and so forth).

72 solves / 462 points Legend has it there is a secret somewhere in this library. Unfortunately, all of our Babel Fishes have gotten lost and the books are full of junk. Note: You do not need a copy of Minecraft to play this challenge. The flag is in standard flag format. Author: WholeWheatBagels
This challenge was based on the Babel library. The objective was to find a flag inside one of an insane number of books based on a Minecraft world. Obviously, it is impossible to read them all in time and get the flag. So, we had to find a way to parse .mca files that contain minecraft's chunks information to extract all the book's content and grep the flag.
For this challenge, I tried a lot of tools, but I didn't find one that makes the job. Thereby, I choised to use the "ansil-parser" python library to make it. The problem ? This lib has no documentation and I had to understand how does it works by my own. So, I had to roll up my sleeves and use python's introspection function to learn how does it works!
# Import .mca file region = anvil.Region.from_file(absolutePath) # Select a specific chunk (regions are 32x32 chunks size) chunk = anvil.Chunk.from_region(region, x, y) # List chunk informations: chunk.data OUTPUT: {TAG_String('Status'): full, TAG_Int('zPos'): 4, TAG_Long('LastUpdate'): 198515, TAG_Int_Array('Biomes'): [1024 int(s)], TAG_Long('InhabitedTime'): 94595, TAG_Int('xPos'): -14, TAG_Compound('Heightmaps'): {4 Entries}, TAG_List('TileEntities'): [3 TAG_Compound(s)], TAG_Byte('isLightOn'): 1, TAG_List('TileTicks'): [0 _TAG_End(s)], TAG_List('Sections'): [9 TAG_Compound(s)], TAG_List('PostProcessing'): [16 TAG_List(s)], TAG_Compound('Structures'): {2 Entries}, TAG_List('LiquidTicks'): [0 _TAG_End(s)]} # Get chunk TileEntities (TileEntities are like simplified Entities that are bound to a Block.) chunk.data.get('TileEntities') # Select the Book object if insine the block chunk.data.get('TileEntities')[0].get('Book') # Get book information chunk.data.get('TileEntities')[0].get('Book').get('tag') OUTPUT: {TAG_String('filtered_title'): test book, TAG_List('pages'): [10 TAG_String(s)], TAG_String('title'): test book, TAG_String('author'): WholeWheatBagels, TAG_Byte('resolved'): 1} # Get all pages in a list chunk.data.get('TileEntities')[0].get('Book').get('tag').get('pages')
After taking a little hour, I finally succeeded to understand how to dump all book's content of one .mca file! Let's loop on all of them:
from json import loads import anvil import os library = os.listdir(".") for elt in library: if ".mca" in elt: absolutePath = os.path.join(os.path.abspath("."), elt) region = anvil.Region.from_file(absolutePath) for chunk_x in range(32): for chunk_y in range(32): try: chunk = anvil.Chunk.from_region(region, chunk_x, chunk_y) chunk.data.get('TileEntities')[0].get('Book') except: continue TitleEntities = chunk.data.get('TileEntities') for book_n in range(len(TitleEntities)): try: book = chunk.data.get('TileEntities')[book_n].get('Book').get('tag') except: continue title = book.get('title') filtered_title = book.get('filtered_title') author = book.get('author') pages = book.get('pages') for page_n in range(len(pages)): page = loads(str(pages[page_n]))['text'] print(page)
Using a simple grep command on the output and tada the flag appears! üéâ

This home buying experience has been a complete nightmare. From the sales office all the way through closing. Nothing but broken promises. We have been in our new home for 6 weeks and we have so many problems that they do not want to fix. They act like they are the victims as to why they build crappy homes.
Overall the experience was great. Chad has been very helpful

The framing on our house had to be redone after we noticed problems with it. Every step of the way we had problems.
Even though I am glad and grateful that our was built in less than 6 months, I feel that Meritage and their vendors rushed the closing of our home and for such a small house there was waaayyy too many mistakes and little details wrong in the house and throughout the property. Some we decided to let slide like dings on appliances and my wife even touched up paint that the painters missed. But there were items marked on our 1st walk through such as the kitchen cabinets needed adjustments, that were not corrected when we moved in and it took several weeks to be corrected and it was not even corrected by the cabinet company, but by the construction manager, after we were stood up multiple times by the cabinet company. Also since we closed 7 weeks ago we have had several issues that have been found that need to be resolved and we have been in contact with the gentleman assigned to our walk through by Meritage Mr. Pedro who appears to be making every effort to be in contact with the trades that are supposed to be coming and we have been stood up at least 4 to 5 times. Pedro had been great in keeping contact with us but recently he was moved twice to different communities and unfortunately the contact has not been the same. Now I have to say that some trades have made it to complete some of the issues, not when they were scheduled to but on a later date, but I am grateful they did come. But it is completely unprofessional for a large company like Meritage Homes and or it's vendors to not keep their word on their scheduled repairs. I have been informed by Pedro and his manager that do to covid many trades are behind so my wife and I have been understanding to that situation and we have been extremely patient but there is only so many times that your builder schedules repairs and the trades pull a no call and no show on appointments before you loose patience. This may land on deaf ears but I truly hope that Meritage will back up there motos on their website that they build at a higher standard so that their customers can live with peace of mind. Lastly I want to say that this is my 3rd new construction home and none of the previous 2 homes that I had bought from William had anywhere near as many defects as this home and they always showed up on the scheduled date and times to correct the few items.DC Srinagar chairs meeting
Srinagar: District Disaster Management Authority, Srinagar has put in place arrangements as per ICMR guidelines pursuant to foreign travellers testing positive for COVID on arrival at Srinagar which includes institutional quarantine and other logistics arrangements. Guidelines have been notified for COVID containment in view of new cases.
Chairman District Health Society and DDMA chaired a meeting to finalise arrangements to be put in place as per India‚Äôs Ministry of Health and Family Welfare guidelines issued on 1st January 2021. Addl Commissioner, Kashmir Dr Srikant Suse, Addl Deputy Commissioners Dr Syed Hanief Balkhi, Syed Khursheed Ahmed and Harvinder Singh, Divisional Nodal officer Dr Talat, HoD SPM Dr Saleem Khan, CMO Dr Jahangir Bakhshi, Epidemiologist Dr Tasadunq Shafi and other officers attended the meeting.
District Administration in coordination with the Department of Health has earmarked institutional quarantine and healthcare arrangements for contacts of COVID travellers as per guidelines issued by the Ministry. Meanwhile, UK travellers testing positive for COVID are admitted for hospital isolation. It was informed that contrary to some reports appearing in media two cases of foreign travellers tested positive are yet to be confirmed for UK strain as the samples have to be sent to and tested at Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) Lab for genome study. A total of 21 passengers travelling from the UK have been tested so far and two cases testing positive for COVID have travelled from Italy and the UK respectively. Meanwhile, robust public health Surveillance and contact tracing have been initiated for the same. The Covid Positive patients have been shifted in Hospital Isolation and their contacts are identified and are being quarantined for observation and to be tested accordingly.
DC Srinagar emphasised that in view of research and studies about COVID variant strains still at early or emerging state precautions shall be taken for all foreign travellers to avoid any risk to the local population. Logistic and infrastructure support is accordingly extended to the health department.
As per the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, if the report of sequencing is inconsistent with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus genome circulating in the country, the ongoing treatment protocol including home isolation/treatment at facility as per case severity is to be followed. In conformed cases of genomic sequencing indicative of new SARS-Cov-2 variants the patients will continue in a separate isolation unit and shall be tested on 14th day. Hospitals have been notified by the Government already.
DDMA has put in place required arrangements in view of fresh guidelines of ministry in view of returnees from the UK and European countries. Meanwhile, a public appeal has been issued for ensuing COVID containment SOPs including wearing masks mandatory at public places, maintaining physical distance and personal hygiene. It is pertinent to mention here that as per provisions of DM act the district administration has authorised officers including Magistrates, Police officers, Medical officer, SMC officers and others under the Act for imposing and recovering fine.

ASOS go for gold with ParalympicsGB
With the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games a week away, we can reveal the ParalympicsGB opening and closing ceremony wear by our partners ASOS.
The focus this year is on what it means to be *extra* and how each athlete goes the extra mile in everything they do.
Amy Conroy in her ceremony wear
Third time‚Äôs a charm
This is our third time working together on a Paralympic Games, ASOS having also kitted out the team for both the Rio 2016 and PyeongChang 2018 Games. For each Games, design teams have created three outfits for the team: one each for the opening and closing ceremonies, and one formal outfit for official events in the UK.
Inclusivity at the heart
Working with ParalympicsGB over the past six years has been so important to teaching ASOS design teams about creating fashion that‚Äôs accessible to all ‚Äì a fundamental part of their purpose is to give people the confidence to be whoever they want to be. Most importantly, the outfits must reflect the diversity of ParalympicsGB team. Making sure that the garments are suitable for all ages, sizes and body types is key, and each piece has been designed with adaptability front of mind.
Thinking responsibly
All the cotton used in the Tokyo 2020 collection has been sourced through the Better Cotton Initiative; the ceremony jackets are made from recycled polyester certified by the Global Recycling Standard (GRS); and the suits are created using Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) wool and a recycled polyester lining.
Going for gold-standard
Finally (as this is the Paralympic Games after all), the outfits must be worthy of a champion team. Design teams carefully construct every single piece in our collections to make sure they reflect the very latest trends and represent the values of ParalympicsGB ‚Äì talent, pride and determination.

Greg ‚Äì other places are doing pancake breakfasts, why don‚Äôt we invite the MP‚Äôs to come and meet us ‚Äì the activists ‚Äì have coffee and donuts.

Gloria ‚Äì we have political action money, right? Yes.
12. Old Business
There had been a request for a list of trained members on PSST (sorry, missed what this was). Gus sent Marianne an e-mail, she was concerned about privacy, components toes being stepped on, etc.

And it brings this haiku in mind:
Written letters, yes
not coloured leaves raked up
burned after reading

she seems a bit uncomfortable at times and maybe that's just her personality? (which is totally understandable - & who could blame her, right?) i hope she realizes that God has blessed each of us in so many ways. she is super bright and insanely talented with the voice of an angel - she's also very beautiful as well and no one expects her to ever have to be "perfect" - as that is bs - it's a "mirage" a "fallacy" - that only exists in phony ass hollyweird. hope she knows that and knows that people appreciate her art for the incredible beauty that it possesses. she doesn't need to be uncomfortable. NOBODY is perfect. we are all just regular people. we all put our pants on the same way. we are all flawed creatures made in the image of God. it's all good sister. keep on doing you regardless of what people think. there's an old saying that goes: "i used to care what people think of me... until i realized how little they do" - how true.Hace 10 d√≠as

Bought this for my nephew's 1st birthday and he loved it. The splash pad was just big enough the 4 kids (ages 1, 2, 5 and 7) who were there could play without being on top of each other but small enough the center filled up rather quickly creating a shallow pool. The ring around the outside had small holes where the water would shoot up at different heights based on how far we opened the hose spigot. It was easy to empty out when they were done. Overall a great purchase for the price even though the connector on the pad to connect to the hose was weak and the hose disconnected a few times when one of the kiddos would kick it. I could see where this could become an issue in the future.

Banzai 54in-Diameter Sprinkle and Splash Play Mat Review (14663)
We bought this play mat for our 14 month old because it gets so hot here in the summer. We've used it a couple times so far and really like it. I expected the middle area where you can stand or sit to be slippery because it's wet, but that's not the case and i'm so glad! it is definitely smaller in person than their packaging suggests, but the size works just fine for us. Other customers have written about their mats getting holes after a few uses - we put a tarp down under ours so nothing can penetrate the plastic from underneath. . The only thing i wish was different is the outside ring. Once it completely fills with water it's a couple inches high and there's nowhere for the water in the center to exit the play mat. It would be nice if the ring had small channels of some sort to allow water to exit. Once the water is sitting in the middle it starts to cover the holes and the water stops squirting out. If you have a yard with just a tiny bit of an incline use it to your advantage so the water will "drain" on its own and you don't have to splash a bunch out to enjoy the sprinkles. -

Banzai 54in-Diameter Sprinkle and Splash Play Mat (Switch to Mobile/Desktop Version)
I actually got this for my dogs. Best thing i ever bought for them. I have 1 large dog and 2 small dogs and they all have a blast with this. They get in the middle and splash through, lay down, and even roll around. They also really enjoy the water that shoots up around the edges. They use that to drink water. After the yellow part is full i turn the water pressure down almost all the way which keeps the water flowing slowly. The dogs will run around the yard playing then go up for a quick cool down.

Bonus Entry
You've been asking us to send out some kind of newsletter or email updates forever, and we are finally getting started this year!
Not only will you get 10 bonus entries for signing up, you'll also be the first to find out what our deals are for Black Friday AND you'll get early access to register your reservation for Pre-Black Friday Shopping.
Wait Wait Wait, hold up... Pre-Black Friday Shopping?
What's that?
Well, 2 years ago we had over 100 people in line before we even opened the doors on Black Friday! To mitigate the chaos (and to preserve social distancing!) last year we had reservations for a limited number of people to come and shop before the store officially opened.
I think that anyone who was at Game Grid both years will agree that it was a massive improvement for all of our customers and for our staff too!
Not only did you have space to breathe and browse, when you were ready to leave you didn't have to wait in another line just to checkout!!
Of course, we also have our diehard fans who love to campout over night - and we want them to be able to continue their insane tradition as well :-)
So here's how Pre-Black Friday Shopping is going to work -
8:00am
Doors are unlocked for the first 30 people lined up out the door!
Whether you camped out overnight or you showed up at 7:55 and there was a spot left, at 8am we're letting 30 people in for 45 minutes.
And it wouldn't be Black Friday without a Door Buster!
The first 10 people in line will get a 70% off discount sticker to apply to anything (except collectible cards/singles)!
Next 10 will get a 60% off sticker!
And the last 10 will get a 50% off sticker!!
9:00am
20 Online Reservations get to shop for 20 minutes!
9:30am

11:00am
Doors Open for Everyone!
The 10 minutes between each reservation are for us to finish checkout and sanitize the area before the next batch come in.
Don't worry, this is our BIGGEST BLACK FRIDAY EVER!
There will definitely be amazing deals everywhere, even if you aren't in the early-bird groups. :-)
So, if the idea of Pre-Black Friday Shopping appeals to you, definitely make sure that you sign up for our Email List - we'll be announcing reservations via email before anywhere else!
And you'll be the first to know all of our Black Friday Deals too :-)
(hint - it'll be even better than last year and you don't want to miss out!)
Can't wait to see you all in person next week, and good luck in the Black Friday Giveaway!!!

Native American proverb
If ever there was a period in which stories were important, this is it! We all need that feeling of being lost in another reality from time to time and no more so than now when the world feels anything but normal.
As Walt Disney said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what storytellers do. We restore order with imagination. We instil hope again and again.‚Äù
Storytelling Week aims to celebrate the tradition of this ancient oral art form with its roots in every part of the world and is usually celebrated by people of all ages in places such as schools, clubs, theatres, museums and even care homes.
The Society for Storytelling provide a central hub for all kinds of events and provide suggestions and resources for all ages and settings.
Why is storytelling important?
As a teacher, I was very aware of the need to allow children time to tell stories ‚Äì real life or otherwise ‚Äì and always tried to keep in mind that some find it much easier than others, but that even if they need persuading, everyone has something valuable to communicate. Because time is at such a premium in the busy curriculum (and I fear because aural skills do not easily translate into tangible evidence) we feel under pressure to get children writing and recording their thoughts rather than allowing enough time for them to talk. Even as parents, how often do we give our children the time or opportunities to do this?
Communication
And yet the ability to communicate and to tell a story is an incredibly important life skill, and not just for celebrities on Graham Norton! Being able to talk fluently and with good vocabulary is crucial and can make such a difference to children‚Äôs life chances. Much of our usual daily oral communication is in single words, short phrases, or sentences, so many of us find speaking it a more prolonged way quite challenging. Telling stories is a great way to practise, improving communication skills and confidence.
Here are just a few ideas for ways in which you and your children might enjoy telling stories together:
Tell stories
- Rather than reading a story, take turns to tell them. Let children hold a book they are familiar with and encourage them to use the pictures rather than the words as prompts. Children often do this as part of learning to read, but not as often once they can read the words. The fact that they are relating the story to the book will encourage them to use language that is different from everyday speech and they will add their own interpretations to the story.
Make a story chain
- This can be done anywhere ‚Äì a car journey for example, or out on a walk. One person begins a story with a sentence, the next person adds another sentence and so it goes on. Children often love it when they and people they know are included in the plot and it is very personalised! What about these for beginnings‚Ä¶.
- ‚ÄúIt was in the winter of 2014 when I first found out I could fly‚Ä¶‚Äù
- ‚ÄúTo his complete surprise, Dylan woke up on a sandy beach with the sun beating down ‚Äì this was not where he went to sleep‚Ä¶‚Äù
- ‚ÄúOnce, deep, deep under the sea, lived a girl called‚Ä¶‚Äù
- You might even try a one-word-each story chain. How far can you get?
. Le Guin
Storytelling chair
- Allocate a chair to be your ‚Äòstorytelling chair‚Äô and decorate it to look a bit special, perhaps by covering it with some sort of material and adding cushions! Anyone who sits in it becomes the storyteller with powers to entrance their listeners!
- Use very well-known stories and tell them together. Many children (and adults) feel more confident telling stories when they know them inside out and know exactly what comes next. Fairy tales are great for this because there is often lots of repetition, providing a hook for children. These Telling Tales Activity Cards use 10 traditional tales to encouraging storytelling.
Pie Corbett
- The author, Pie Corbett has been very influential in encouraging group storytelling. (Search the internet for his well-known re-telling of ‚ÄòLittle Red Hen‚Äô. It is brilliant!) Tell your chosen story together and using the same words. Adding actions can also help the memory a great deal, as Pie Corbett demonstrates.
- Use props. Choose a few key items from your chosen story to act as memory prompts and to add interest and focus for listeners.
- Make a map of the story, again to act as a prompt. The story map might have pictures with arrows.
Use puppets
Imagine that it is a different character telling the story. Children often feel more confident telling a story using a puppet. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a real puppet. It could be a cuddly toy or perhaps a sock with a couple of eyes glued on. Set up a makeshift puppet theatre, using a cardboard box or whatever you can think of. Children love performing stories in this way.
Choose 3 random items from around the room. The storyteller must tell a short story (you might even set a time limit of 2 minutes) incorporating the 3 objects! Can they mention them all in a way that makes sense? This is a real tester of quick thinking and creativity.
‚ÄúPeople think that stories are shaped by people. In fact it‚Äôs the other way around ‚Ä¶‚Äù
Terry Pratchett, novelist
Everyone has at least one good story to tell and the ability to tell a great story is a wonderful skill to have. We all know people who can make us laugh or cry by relating their tales of joy, woe or even something seemingly mundane, so if at all possible, let‚Äôs tell our children about storytelling week and take part however we can.Canadian Consulate General in Denver United States of America is a strong bond of communication between Canada Government and United States of America.

‚ÄúThe book was a very good read, well written and it definitely made me want to finish it sooner rather than later. I can‚Äôt wait for the next one.‚Äù
‚ÄúAn enjoyable Bondesque thriller‚Äù
I very much enjoyed reading this book (a first for me by this particular author). The plot is worthy of a James Bond film with plenty of exotic locations (take note, Eon Productions ‚Äì a brilliant storyline for the next 007 movie). The characters are engaging and the author sets the scene brilliantly ‚Äì I was there with them! I loved the short chapters and also the writing style which was so effortless to read. I found it an excellent bit of escapism after a long day at work. A sequel surely is in the offing.
‚ÄúA Gripping Read‚Äù
‚ÄúI am always apprehensive about purchasing a non-fiction book from an Author I know nothing about. To say I was pleasantly surprised by Pearl of Wisdom is an understatement. I was spellbound after a few pages. The story was totally gripping from start (the chase) through to the Finale (an ending which left me shell shocked and on the edge of my seat). A Read with plenty of thrills and amusement. Rob Wassell is a name I will be looking out for in the future‚Äù
‚ÄúA brilliant read that kept me interested from beginning to end‚Äù
‚ÄúA brilliant read that kept me interested from beginning to end. It is skillfully crafted so that, in several places, the build-up of tension and suspense made it impossible to put the book down. The characters are so well described that you feel you know them and therefore care what happens to them. In short ‚Äì a real ‚Äòpage-turner‚Äô.‚Äù
‚ÄúAn exciting thriller, full of action and tension.‚Äù
‚ÄúAn exciting thriller, full of action and tension. Each character is skilfully woven into the story, and not only gives an insight into their professional lives, but also their personal ones. An entertaining read through to the last page.‚Äù
‚ÄúGreat read!‚Äù
‚ÄúReally enjoyed this storyline, packed full of action and flows well. Also has a good mixture of humour and tension, look forward to the next one Rob.‚Äù
‚ÄúFive Stars‚Äù
A very good ‚Äòedge of your seat‚Äô read ‚Äì just my type of book.
‚ÄúExcellent read ‚Äì intriguing plot with fast-paced action‚Äù
‚ÄúExcellent read, intriguing plot, fast-paced action with entertaining and amusing central characters ‚Äì gripping from start to finish ‚Äì I would highly recommend this book.‚Äù
‚ÄúA great read, I couldn‚Äôt put it down.‚Äù

Some quotes shortened to remove any plot spoilers or key details.An earlier report published in 2015, had already pointed out that the regulations in place were not delivering the desired results.
‚ÄúGlaring gaps‚Äù in India‚Äôs tobacco control legislation make it ‚Äúineffective for regulating tobacco consumption and exposure to second-hand smoke,‚Äù argues the report. These concerns are not new, an earlier report published in 2015, had similarly pointed out that the regulations in place were not delivering the desired results.
‚ÄúCompared with many countries around the world, India has been proactive in introducing tobacco control legislation since 2003‚Ä¶. However, the legislation currently in place is not delivering the desired results ‚Äî in terms of dissuading tobacco use and encouraging quitting,‚Äù said Geoffrey Fong, a professor of psychology at Canada‚Äôs University of Waterloo, who had co-authored the 2015 report.
India‚Äôs Tobacco Act is outdated
Calling for amendments to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA), the new report points out that this act was developed too long ago and needs updating. ‚ÄúThough the Act intended to be a comprehensive law on tobacco control, it was adopted more than 15 years ago. Also, the law was developed before [the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control] came into force [in 2005 and was ratified by India]. Now, with the passage of time, lacunas in the Act have become apparent and proved to be a key challenge in terms of effective implementation [sic],‚Äù said report author Professor Ashok R. Patil, chair of consumer law and practice at NLSIU, as quoted by the Financial Express.
Experts worry that set at 18 years, the current tobacco age limit leads to early initiation, and that the availability of single cigarettes and other loose tobacco products for sale, makes smoking more accessible, affordable and prevents smokers from being ‚Äúregularly exposed to the warning labels the law requires on tobacco packaging.‚Äù Moreover, the report adds, the regulations around advertising and sponsorship in relation to tobacco products are so vague that they prevent authorities from setting clear advertising restrictions.
Recommended amendments
To this effect, the report makes 11 recommendations. These include raising the tobacco age limit from 18 to 21, eliminating designated smoking areas and tobacco product displays in shops, increasing penalties for any COTPA violations, and ban ‚Äúthe sale of single stick cigarettes, loose tobacco products, and smaller packs.‚Äù These amendments would also level up Indian laws with the WHO guidelines, which on the otherhand many public health experts find counterproductive, as they fail to differentiate between combustible tobacco products and safer alternatives.
Voicing his support for the report, former Chief Justice of India, Honorable Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, said that these recommendations need to be implemented right away. .‚Äù
Most Indian vapers are ex-smokers
Meanwhile, a recent cross-sectional survey of 3000 vapers across eight Indian cities, found that the vast majority were former smokers, who managed to quit or reduce smoking thanks to the use e-cigarettes. The study titled, ‚ÄúPatterns of Tobacco and E-Cigarette Use Status in India: A Cross-Sectional Survey of 3000 Vapers in Eight Indian Cities,‚Äù was conducted with the aim of obtaining data on the characteristics and tobacco behaviour profile of vapers in India.
An interview-based survey was performed in the 8 largest metropolitan cities in India, recruiting a total of 3000 subjects. The eligible criteria for being able to participate were being a current e-cigarette user, aged 18 years or more. Interviewers were asked to continue recruitment until a total sample of 375 was reached in each target city.
‚ÄúA total of 3000 vapers (81.4% males and 18.6% females, median age 29 years) participated to the study. The majority (80%) were first exposed to nicotine via tobacco smoking, smokeless tobacco (SLT) use, or both. Most of the subjects (79%) believed that e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking. The vast majority of smokers (71.3%) reported smoking cessation (30.0%) or reduction in consumption (41.3%) with the help of e-cigarettes. Similar changes were observed in SLT users. Participants reported minimal side effects and some health benefits after e-cigarette use initiation,‚Äù reported the researchers.

No business man wants a secretary whom he cannot trust to see his business callers in his absences. A knowledge of good English and a courteous way of speaking are the things he wants in his representative.
There are other little details of office manners which every business girl should know. In the first place, when you come to work in the morning. say good morning, individually or collectively, to your fellow workers. There is no need to be effusive about it, but it is a simple courtesy which is well worth while. If you are late, don't come hurrying in with "Gracious! Isn't this awful?" but say simply and frankly, to the head of the office, "Good morning, Mr. Mr. Blank. I'm sorry to be late, and I will make up the time this evening ." For it is office manners, and the best sort of office manners, to give your employers honestly all the time which they are paying you for. You owe them the ten minutes which you lost in the morning. You owe them the ten minutes you stayed out over your lunchtime. They will appreciate your honesty it you make it a point to see that their interests are protected.
OPINIONS TO BE GUARDED.
Don't be familiar either with your superiors or inferiors on the office staff. Familiarity leads to gossip and office gossip is always bad for those taking part to it.
You are not paid to make friendships or to chat with the rest of the office. Guard your opinions as to office conditions. The girl who sits at the desk next to yours, and who thinks the office manager a mean, partial thing, always giving the easiest work to someone else, may, if you agree with her, and let her know it, be unscrupulous enough to repeat your words to the office manager himself, or to someone else who can injure your prospects.
You can be pleasant and polite to every one, but keep your own counsel‚Äîor you will be sure to wish you had.
Don't get into the habit of criticising your superiors, even to yourself. Maybe the head of the firm is cranky and inconsiderate of you, but you must remember that you are only a small piece of a big mechanism, and that it is this mechanism which he is working with all his strength to keep mowing,
He is struggling with problems of the gravest weight and importance, and when you misspell words and get figures wrong you are putting most trying little obstacles in the way of his success, and when he flies out at you and calls you inattentive and incompetent, he is only telling you the truth. Try to concentrate and make your work the big thing during work time.
All girls should remember, too, that the office is not the place for manicuring, hair-dressing, or general 'prinking'. All that sort of thing should be done at home. How many business girls, during a lull in work, may he seen giving attention to their nails or readjusting their side-combs, and the like. Some girls even have little mirrors into which they may be seen looking anxiously whenever they get a chance.

is an intellectual concept movie. The movie is based on the concept that a single community person holds all memories of its past and serves as an advisor to the government on the best decisions to make for the future based on remembered past events. The new receiver of memory, however, makes the decision that memory should once again be released to all members of the community. This story and script are based on Lois Lowry‚Äôs book of the same name. The film plays on the idea that it is wrong to have emotion and reminds one of the film Equilibrium. The film is highly crafted. Brenton Thwaites does a terrific job of interpreting the role of Jonas.

Diabetic Feet
WHAT IS IT?
Diabetes is a disorder that affects many people in our society. Diabetes
mellitus is a condition in which the body is unable to transport sugar
from the blood to the cells. People who suffer from this disease cannot
produce or use insulin, which is necessary to keep the sugar under
control. Many sufferers of this disease will complain of constantly
being thirsty, hungry, and frequently having to urinate. Diabetic
patients often have problems with their circulation, which can result
in foot pain, and problems. If this disease is not identified and goes
untreated, it can lead to severe health issues and occasionally death.
This disease process can affect your kidneys, eyes, sense of feeling in
your feet and the circulation to the foot.
CAUSES
Diabetes mellitus can be caused by a number of factors. If there is a family history of diabetes, one's chances of developing this disorder significantly increases. Over weight people are also at risk, since the body is in a constant battle with the elevated sugar.
As one gets older, a certain type of diabetes, ¬¨type II (non-insulin dependent) becomes prevalent. On the other hand, type I diabetes (insulin dependent), is more prevalent in the young. African Americans and Hispanics are also more susceptible to this disease. If any of the above facts apply to you, an evaluation visit to your family doctor is suggested.
TREATMENT
The effective treatment of diabetes mellitus begins with patient cooperation and compliance. The patient needs to understand that this disease can be severe and that a strict diet as well as faithful use of all medication is necessary to keep this disease under control. Some patients may need to inject insulin while others might need to take various oral medications. Careful monitoring of one's blood sugar on a daily basis is essential since it will give both the patient and doctor an idea of how well the sugar is controlled. Periodic trips to your foot doctor are also needed. Many diabetics have problems with their feet and if regular monitoring is not followed, subsequent complications can readily occur. Active ongoing patient participation is an essential aspect in the clinical management of this disease.
DIABETIC PEDIATRIC CARE
It is essential to thoroughly evaluate and periodically manage the diabetic patient. We know that diabetics can specifically have impaired circulation, reduced sensation, and a greater tendency to develop infections, ulcerations and other skin problems. Early detection, periodic monitoring, and judicious care are essential in the prevention and management of diabetic complications. The lower legs and feet are primary locations for these problems to occur. Professional care and supervision can be highly effective in minimizing the complication tendencies of patients with diabetes.
Periodic care for these patients can range from a simple examination of one's feet to more involved treatments of such problems as diabetic arthropathy (diabetic arthritis), peripheral neuropathy (loss of feeling), vascular complications, and ulcerations. The podiatrist will examine the feet to make sure that there is adequate blood supply and sensation (feeling) to the feet. A decrease or loss in one or both can lead to infection and potentially more serious problems. In many cases, the podiatrist will involve by referral, other medical specialists to participate in the total team approach to managing the existing diabetic problems.
Many diabetics are seen by their foot specialists on a periodic basis for general foot care. It is important to keep the nails properly trimmed so that they do not become ingrown and cause infection. This is important as many diabetics can not fight infections as well as people without the disease. Also, the skin of diabetic patients is thinner and more susceptible to injury than that of non-diabetic persons. It is important to reduce the calluses to relieve pressure over the bony prominence of the feet. If there is too much callus build-up, the skin may break down and lead to an ulceration. An ulceration can become infected and possibly lead to more serious consequences requiring more involved care.

What do those Popups mean? Well Act 2 still ends on March 17th‚Ä¶which is how long you have to unlock all of the Act 2 prizes, but on March 13th you‚Äôll unlock the next gaming house. (like how Cletus‚Äô Dice Den unlocked before Act 1 was over)
And that my friends completes the main Act 2 questline of the Casino Event!
What are your thoughts on this event? Excited about the prizes? Enjoying the questline? Sound off in the comments below, you know we love hearing from you!
I have Cregg Demon and have started on the Act 3 prizes, but the cowgirl sign and everything past that has not unlocked. What do I need to do to unlock them?
Hi everybody!
If I don‚Äôt finish the quetline until the end of act2, does it just stop and when act3 starts won‚Äôt I be able to finish it? Like‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt I get Homer‚Äôs House of Cards?
You‚Äôll still be able to get the House of Cards. Your prizes will change to Act 3 prizes, but you won‚Äôt see the Act 3 questline until you finish the Act 2 questline
I too can‚Äôt figure out how I missed getting Homer‚Äôs House of Cards.. I‚Äôm pretty sure I got through all 10 parts of the vice questline (how can I tell? Is there a hidden list, or by looking at characters task lists (locked or unlocked?). I checked my inventory in case I put it there by mistake. I‚Äôm afraid if I don‚Äôt get it today, I might not be able to once act 3 starts tomorrow. Tia.
You can still unlock it even after act 3 starts. Do you have a golden token (icon) in your task book?
No. The coin was the icon for that questline, wasn‚Äôt it?
It‚Äôs the icon for all of the main questlines for Casino. But yes..
What level are you on? Game play level
I‚Äôm on level 59.
I would contact EA‚Ä¶
No golden coin‚Ä¶ Which means I completed the quest, right?
Yea
It‚Äôs past the 13th and somehow I didn‚Äôt unlock homers house of cards.. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been doing everything and I don‚Äôt have it and other people do, can I not still get it?
You need to be at the certain part of the questline. Read the top of the post where it says How Do I get Homer‚Äôs House of Cards
You have to have certain characters for the next part of the quest to begin, like princess Kashmir and tuxedo Krusty. I had that problem and wouldn‚Äôt have known if I didn‚Äôt come here. My husband got the house of cards and I never did because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbuy‚Äù tuxedo Krusty yet
I‚Äôve gotten the last act 2 prize so should I stop using my tokens and save them for act 3?
up to you, but it‚Äôs not a bad idea
That is what I am doing
Bonuts by the dozens
As of this morning, I have received 100 donuts since I got the Miss Springfield and Sleep-eazy package with rebate.
Awesome.
Should I be worried about gold coins going away in act three or can I let them accumulate like act two? The event with Maggie completely changed in Act 3 if I remember correctly.
This one doesn‚Äôt change.
Do I need to let Apu bleed out (finish the last task) to get Homer‚Äôs House of Cards? I was planning to keep Apu gambling until I earn the last prize of Act 2.
most likely. That‚Äôs how it was for the Dice Den..
Thanks!
Thank you so much for the site. Been monitoring for couple years now. Very helpful. And jersey girls too. Any word on if the chips will roll over to act three. Is it worth saving them or should we spend them all now?
Fellow New Jersian
Tokens, yes save.
I‚Äôve gotten to the point where princess comes in but I don‚Äôt have her I don‚Äôt think where do I find her
Princess Kashmire? She‚Äôs premium..in the premium menu but you may not see her if you‚Äôre not high enough in levels..
Greetings, I had to reinstall my game due to the lack of space on my device. Now. Since the update, I haven‚Äôt be able to get into the game via my new mobile. It just won‚Äôt install. (It will always show the Bart screen.)
I can still get in with another device, so the connection isn‚Äôt really a problem.
I would be glad if you were able to help me.

Seniors have to take extra care of themselves, and for this, they should keep a check on their health. The primary care physician handles routine health care and performs regular checkups. He is someone who knows your complete medical history and understands what is good for your health. These physicians help manage chronic conditions and treat illnesses by monitoring your overall physical, and mental health.
Choosing the right primary care physicians is very important, so you don‚Äôt have to switch your doctor more often. There are many things you have to keep in mind while selecting the right primary care physician for your parents or any other senior family member.
know Your Needs
Although primary care physicians don‚Äôt deal with one type of health condition, still, you must know what your physician is good at. For example, some physicians are good at dealing with pediatrics health, some have more experience with athletics and sportspersons, and some better understand senior health issues. Before choosing your physician, you have to make sure that the physician has sufficient experience in treating senior health conditions.
Consider A Geriatrician
Geriatricians are the primary care doctors who are specialized in diagnosing and treating senior‚Äôs health conditions. While looking for a primary care physician for seniors, you should consider a geriatrician because he can better understand and treat old people‚Äôs health conditions. A geriatrician makes sure that the treatment they are offering to the patient is age-appropriate. They are also more expert in old people‚Äôs health and have all the required resources and equipment to treat senior medical conditions.
Ask for Recommendations
When it comes to choosing a doctor, word of mouth plays a major role because people feel more comfortable visiting a doctor recommended by a family member or a friend. You can ask your co-workers, friends, or relatives to refer a good and trusted primary care physician. Especially, if you are new to a community, you should ask the locals to suggest the best senior care clinics. The doctor should not just expert in providing senior care services but he should be trustworthy, kind, and someone you can feel comfortable with. Asking people for referrals can help you to get a more unbiased and authentic recommendation for primary care physicians.
Think About Logistics
When it comes to finding the right primary care physician for seniors, there are many other things you should be considering, more than the physician‚Äôs expertise and services. You should know that if your parent or any other senior family member has chronic illnesses or diabetes, they need to visit the doctor more often. It would be more convenient if the doctors‚Äô clinic is near your home or office, so you can easily take them to the clinic. Other than that, the medical expenses, advanced equipment, office timings, are some important things to keep in mind before choosing your primary care physician.
Here are a few major points. You must check before choosing the senior primary care doctor.
- The location of the clinic should be near your house or on the way to the office.
- Office timings must be convenient, so you can plan the appointments without disturbing your schedule.
- Look if the primary care physician has advanced equipment for providing diagnostic services and treatments.
- Not all doctors charge the same, you have to consider your budget and affordability of the doctors.
- Before getting your patient to the doctor, you can have a face-to-face meeting with a physician, so you can analyze the atmosphere, staff and get an idea about the doctor‚Äôs attitude, professionalism, and concern for the patients.
Look Online
You can also research online to find the right physician for you. Now, almost all physicians have their own websites and social media pages. The best thing about online research is that you can see their patient reviews and get an idea about the overall patient satisfaction. Visiting the physician‚Äôs websites, you can get detailed information about everything that a primary care physician offers, including their medical services, diagnostic services, treatments, etc.
Conclusion
Summing up the discussion, it can be said that choosing the right primary care physician can be a bit challenging, these tips would help you to find the best geriatrician for seniors. Even if seniors are not experiencing any health issues, they still need proactive medical care to maintain their health and on-time diagnosis and treatment of illness.
Remember, primary care centers are designed for regular checkups and general medication. In case of an emergency, such as stabbing chest pain, or serious injuries, you should take the patient to the nearest emergency room to get immediate emergency care.

The fest was done and the taste of this Biriyani got imprinted in the hearts and minds of the people of Trivandrum. This successful event inspired in setting up a takeaway counter in the city for their Biriyani and they fondly titled it as ‚ÄúAjwa‚Äù which refers to anexpensive dates made in Saudi Arabia.Mujeeb,Noushad and their friends MammoottyKeyi C.N and Abdul Razak A.C were the main men behind this initiative.

Adding variety to their menu is the fish biriyani which is available only from 12 pm in the afternoon. Chicken fry priced at 150 per plate is also a speciality at this spot. Mutton and chicken biriyani specials are also available here, these cost a bit more as they offer more in terms of quantity. Lemon tea available here will give you the soothing effect and will quench your thirst as well, this is priced at 10 rupees. The smell and aroma of ghee and good quantity chicken pieces available in the biriyani too give this dish a heavenly feel. Sweet and sour pickle and salad served as side dish make this a deadly combo not to be missed while at Trivandrum! 2019 marks the 6th year of Ajwa in Trivandrum and ask any Trivandrumite and they will openly honestly and lovingly say that Ajwa is the best authentic Thalaserry dum biriyani in the city!

Starting next week, ten old buses from the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) fleet that have been repurposed into mobile schools will start going to different zones in the city to conduct bridge classes for out-of-school children.
The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has already assigned one bright yellow bus per zone. The two extra buses will be deputed to zones that have a higher number of children not in school, said senior BBMP officials.
The civic body took up this initiative following specific directions of the High Court of Karnataka to identify out-of-school children, and conduct bridge courses to bring them back to the mainstream. According to a senior civic official, the BBMP has also re-assigned teachers from its day-care centres for this purpose.
As per the current plan, each bus will have four teachers, who will be assisted by a helper (ayah). All the teaching materials and teaching aids have been provided. ‚ÄúThe zonal joint commissioners are in the process of identifying locations where the mobile schools can be parked. The location should also be chosen keeping in mind accessibility for the identified children, who are mostly residents of slums and settlements of migrant workers,‚Äù the official said.
The mobile schools will function under the supervision of zonal joint commissioners, and will cater to children in Class I and above. ‚ÄúMany of the children may have never stepped into a school. It is for such children that we have chosen teachers from day-care centres, who will be able to help them in an age-appropriate manner,‚Äù the official said and added that drivers for all the 10 buses had also been appointed.
The first bus has already been sent to Rajarajeshwarinagar zone. ‚ÄúThe other buses will be sent to the respective zones on Tuesday. Their locations will also be finalised next week,‚Äù the official claimed.
Survey of children begging or hawking
Meanwhile, as per the directions of the High Court, the civic body is also conducting a survey of children found begging or hawking in the city. It has tied up with several non-governmental organisations for the survey, which, according to officials, is likely to be completed by the end of November.
The Centre for e-governance had developed a software to capture data from the city-wide survey. ‚ÄúWe hoped to complete the survey sooner. While more than 75% has been completed in most zones, there were some hiccups in Yelahanka zone. The same has now been sorted out. We will complete the survey by the month-end,‚Äù an official stated. get this job ?

Post subject: Will I get this job ?
Hi All,
The chart is erected by my friend.
He has been unemployed for a year, and last week he got a call from job agency who invite him for an interview of a company.
He would like to know if he will get this job.
Here is the chart :
Asc : Sun
Job : Venus (10H)
This two planets both are in 5H and in conjunction.
And co-sig Moon trines Venus.
I believe it is a good sign for him, can I say 'Yes' to the question ?
Moreover, rulership of his money is Mercury (2H), and rulership of money from Job is also Mercury (11H), Mercury is in 5H too !
Sun, Venus and Mercury stick together in this chart.
Are there any bad sign can be seen from this chart ?
Hope someone can share their thought, thanks !!

Mostly it looks good, but that retrograde peregrine Mars on the ASC bothers me a lot.
I don't know. Lots of positive testimony, but a badly behaved malefic smack on an angle.
I like how the Moon trines the MC, especially as the MC is Taurus and the Moon is exalted there.
I don't like that the Sun is peregrine, or that Venus is only saved from peregrinity by out-of-sect triplicity ruler. I also don't like the Moon being Void of Course.
But the positives do look pretty strong. Let's see if somebody else can offer an opinion here.

Hello Minami
I'm agreeing with what Olivia's posted already.
You asked if there are any bad signs that can be seen in the chart so I'll focus on that side of things.
The significators (Sun, Moon, and Venus) don't behold the Ascendant. As Olivia's pointed out they do have a nice relationship with the 10th though which is good testimony.
Moon's decreasing in light.
It's good that the job significator is moving towards the querent's significator, i.e. the job is moving towards the querent rather than the other way around.
That sticking point of Mars is all the more so because it rules the 4th house. Mars beholds the 10th by square, an aspect of 'imperfect enmity'. I would say there is definitely something counting against the querent's application, but the aspects (conjunction with Ascendant, square with MC) are separating not applying so it could be worse.
Perhaps if the querent can identify what Mars might be in this particular instance and take steps to minimise its impact, he stands a better chance. The Sun and Mars have mutual receptions so there does seem to be scope for amelioration, although to what extent with Mars being so close....
That just leaves the receptions between Sun-Moon and Moon-Venus, some of which are good but others aren't. It's a mixed bag. Sun-Venus have no mutual receptions to aid them.
There's no helping from Jupiter either.
I don't know if it counts for much but all the significators including the Moon are moving towards aspects with the north node.
Best of luck to your querent.
Regards
H.

The Sun is ill disposed to signify the querent, so is the Moon because they neither behold the ascending sign nor have another planet in an angle(preferably) rendering their light to the ASC degree.This in itself is not a positive testimony for the querent, it signifies his inability to "steer his ship" properly in this matter.
Debilitated Mars on the cusp of the ASC is another negative testimony, angular malefics in a bad state are always a sign of trouble.
The lady of the MC, Venus(which has just separated from retrograde Mercury, a possible sign of the instability of this job,its controversial nature) is applying to conjunction with the Sun, ruler of the ASC - this is a strong testimony for getting the job, since she also receives the Sun in her triplicity and term(Egyptian set), this being a perfect reception involving the combination of two lesser dignities.
I think the Moon here is not void of course, since she still isn't separated from the Sun, and when she finally is, she already joins Saturn in Libra which will receive her into his exaltation, triplicity and term. The number of degrees she has to travel in order to reach Saturn in the following sign indicates possible slowness and tardiness in the matter; however, I'm not so certain that this will necessarily happen, since we have the close conjunction of the main significators which will perfect in a bit more than 7 degrees, on the north node, which is another positive testimony.
The angles of the figure are fixed, the conjunction will occur in a sign of Capricorn, ruled by ponderous Saturn in a succeeding house, so I judge he will get this job in about seven weeks. More optimistic version would be 7 days(conjunction occurs in a cardinal sign, how do we square such apparent contradicting teachings on the nature of signs, I wonder?), so let's wait and see, timing isn't easy in horary.
While I believe he will get the job, I also think he won't keep it for long nor will be satisfied with it, mainly because the POF is cadent and the ruler Mars is retrograde and peregrine.
Greetings,
Goran

We have all heard of people who do not want others to know their true names. In order to accomplish this subterfuge, some go about anonymously, or without a ‚Äúname‚Äù in order to keep their true ‚Äúname‚Äù a secret. Yet others, such as authors, will adopt pseudonyms, or false ‚Äúnames,‚Äù to keep their true ‚Äúnames‚Äù from being known.
Students realize the importance of knowing both synonyms and antonyms for the SAT and GRE. Synonyms have meanings that are the same or similar in ‚Äúname,‚Äù such as ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúscorching,‚Äù or ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù and ‚Äúsmart.‚Äù Antonyms, on the other hand, have opposite ‚Äúnames,‚Äù such as ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúcold,‚Äù or ‚Äúup‚Äù and ‚Äúdown.‚Äù
The primary identifier of a family is its ‚Äúname.‚Äù The patronymic of a family is the ‚Äúname‚Äù derived from the father, which generally becomes the surname of any of the family‚Äôs children. When a baby girl is ‚Äúnamed‚Äù after her mother, she has received a metronymic.
Now on to two more words that derive from the English root onym meaning ‚Äúname.‚Äù A homonym describes a word whose ‚Äúname‚Äù sounds like another‚Äôs but is different in meaning. For instance, the words ‚Äúdear‚Äù as in ‚Äúprecious‚Äù and ‚Äúdeer‚Äù as in ‚Äúa four-legged woodland creature with antlers‚Äù are homonyms because their ‚Äúnames‚Äù sound the same but they have different meanings. An eponym is an imaginary or real person‚Äôs ‚Äúname‚Äù put upon a place. An example of an eponym is Europe, whose ‚Äúname‚Äù came from the mythological bull Europa.
Now no longer will the root word onym run around anonymously, having no ‚Äúname,‚Äù since at least you will not be fooled!
- anonymous: without a ‚Äòname‚Äô
- pseudonym: false ‚Äòname‚Äô
- synonym: word that shares its ‚Äòname‚Äô together with another
- antonym: word whose ‚Äòname‚Äô is opposite another
- patronymic: the father‚Äôs ‚Äòname‚Äô
- metronymic: the mother‚Äôs ‚Äòname‚Äô
- homonym: word that has the same-sounding ‚Äòname‚Äô as another
- eponym: a ‚Äúname‚Äù put upon a placeJust over 20 years ago was the first time a computer beat a human world champion, beat 2006 world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Now the ability of computers to take on humanity has taken a step further by mastering the far more complex board game Go, with Google‚Äôs AlphaGo program beating world number one Ke Jie twice in a best-of-three series.
This signifcant milestone shows just how far computers have come in the past 20 years. DeepBlue‚Äôs victory at chess showed machines could rapidly process huge amounts of information, paving the way for the big data revolution.
Go is considered one of the world‚Äôs most complex board games. applying this strategy to Go would require a million-fold increase in processing speed over DeepBlue so a computer could analyse 100 trillion positions per second.
Learning new moves around 300m moves made by professional Go players. It then used what are called deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to develop its own ability to identify favourable moves. power other Google services such as Street View and optimisation tasks in the firm‚Äôs data centres.
Lesson for us all
The other thing that has changed since DeepBlue‚Äôs victory is the respect that humans have for their computer opponents. When playing chess computers, it was common for the human players to adopt so-called anti-computer tactics. This involves making conservative moves to prevent the computer from evaluating positions effectively.
In his first match against AlphaGo, however, Ke Jie, adopted tactics that had previously been used by his opponent to beat it at its own game. Although this attempt failed, it demonstrates a change in approach for leading human players taking on computers. Instead of trying to stifle the machine, they have begun trying to learn from how it played in the past.
In fact, the machine has already influenced the professional game of Go, with grandmasters adopting AlphaGo‚Äôs strategy during their tournament matches. This machine has taught humanity something new about a game it has been playing for over 2,500 years, liberating us from the experience of millennia.
What then might the future hold for the AI behind AlphaGo? The success of DeepBlue triggered rapid developments that have directly impacted the techniques applied in big data processing. The benefit of the technology used to implement AlphaGo is that it can already be applied to other problems that require pattern identification.
For example, the same techniques have been applied to the detection of cancer and to create robots that can learn to do things like open doors, among many other applications. The underlying framework used in AlphaGo, Google‚Äôs TensorFlow, has been made freely available for developers and researchers to build new machine-learning programs using standard computer hardware.
More excitingly, combining it with the many computers available through the internet cloud creates the promise of delivering machine-learning supercomputing..Catrin Finch & Seckou Keita

From twin to California King, memory foam mattresses are available from most reputable dealers in a variety of sizes designed to provide the closest-to-perfect fit possible.
In addition, many retailers of high quality products offers the ‚Äúsplit‚Äù option where it is literally split in half so that each user can enjoy their preferred firmness level. The split option is also an advantage for users who may have trouble navigating a large king size memory foam mattress through tight spaces such as stairwells.
source:walmart.com
There are no less than seven varying sizes available for memory foam mattresses. Here is a tutorial on each:
- Twin: designed for use by a single child or adult. Twin dimensions are 39‚Äù x 75,‚Äù but a Twin XL is also an option at 39‚Äù x 80.‚Äù
- Full: a roomy sleep surface for a single user or a slightly cramped option for a couple. Full dimensions are 54‚Äù x 75‚Äù and a Full XL adds five inches to the length for taller users.
- Queen: designed for two users, the Queen mattress‚Äô dimensions are 60‚Äù x 80‚Äù and again can be extended by five inches in length with an XL upgrade.
- King: a very spacious surface that can easily accommodate most couples. King size dimensions are 76‚Äù x 80‚Äù and California King is an alternative at 72‚Äù x 84‚Äù for a slightly narrower and longer profile.
Each user will come to a different conclusion as to which memory foam mattress size fits them best. Everything from physical stature to intended uses and number of users should be considered. In general, it is best to opt for the size just above the one that you feel you will need as personal space requirements may be underestimated in the decision making stage before the user has an opportunity to really get a feel for the bed with regular use.
With so many options available in affordable prices from reputable dealers who use quality materials and production processes, it is no wonder memory foam mattresses have grown to enjoy such popularity.

Getting the mattress is crucial as it is now becoming more essential to complete the bedroom arrangement focusing the comfort as well. And those being made now days tend to provide the comfort at full. The only thing that irritates is the price which is high enough to disturb the affordability of the buyer. Therefore, thinking about how to get from the affordable sets involves a lot of things to be taken care of.
It is not a necessary thing to get the king size foam mattress always. This is because even if you buy the king type with the medium quality, you will see the price still higher. It is rather a good idea to get from the queen size affordable mattress sets which are not so bigger in size as the king size and still they can adjust a couple to sleep. The advantage of getting the queen size affordable sets is that you will not have to pay the price as that of king size and it can be fitted in the room of medium or even smaller size.

Introduction: Menopause is a natural process that all women go through. It is believed that a major physical and psychological change in a woman\'s life occurs during this period, though every woman may view these changes differently depending on the society and culture they belong to. And, it is also believed that quality of life (QOL) during this transitional period plays a major role in the remaining life of the woman. Evidences support the clinical importance of the transition for many women as a period of temporary changes in health and QOL and long-term changes in several health outcomes may influence women\'s QOL and the likelihood of healthy aging. Aim: The aims of the study were to assess the QOL among women using structured Menopause-specific quality of life (MENQOL) questionnaire and to find out the association between the QOL among women with selected demographic variables. Materials and methods: The researchers used quantitative research approach in the study. A descriptive survey design was used in the study. The sample consisted of 100 menopausal women, selected using convenient sampling technique. The investigator used the demographic pro forma and standardized MENQOL questionnaire for collecting the data. After the assessment of QOL among menopausal women, the researcher distributed the information booklet on menopausal health. The study findings have shown that the participants had average QOL in their menopausal period. An information booklet on menopausal health may improve the QOL among menopausal women and create an awareness regarding menopausal symptoms and its management. Conclusion: The following conclusions were drawn based on the findings of the study: ‚Ä¢ Most of the mothers had average QOL during menopausal period. ‚Ä¢ An information booklet regarding menopausal health was effective in creating awareness among menopausal women on QOL during menopausal period.

Friends and the Christian church
The Bible
A host of scholars have been at work for centuries to discover and understand the Jesus of history, and with strangely divergent results. The great quest still goes on and I seek to learn from it. But I cannot separate the Lord and Master of the first disciples from his risen spirit and personality which has gone on unfolding itself to those who seek him, healing, renewing, inspiring, redeeming and guiding.
Thus I try to keep in touch with his life and message given first in Palestine, with the impact of his life and personality on the early disciples, as day by day I read a portion of the New Testament; I try, too, to learn something of what his spirit has enabled others to be down all the ages since, from the study of the lives of the saints, both canonised and uncanonised, and by reading some of their writings. In the life of many who would not be called saints, and some even who might not be thought of as good men or women, I find flashes of light which to me are sparks or gleams from the light of Christ. I know that my own thoughts of God, my experience, my clumsy and imperfect prayer, are all penetrated by what Jesus Christ has meant to me. In doubts and difficulty his faith in God‚Äôs love, his willingness to face even the awful burden of the cross and all that it involved, are a constant stay, bringing renewal of faith and of hope.
T Edmund Harvey, 194955 APIA students set to receive $500,000 total in scholarships to help advance their academic journeys
CHICAGO ‚Äì A student inventor, a formerly homeless nursing major, and an aspiring teacher, can put more focus on their dreams and less on how to pay tuition this school year. On Monday, November 8, McDonald‚Äôs USA in partnership with APIA Scholars ‚Äì one of the nation‚Äôs leading non-profit organizations for Asian Pacific Islander American college scholarships ‚Äì announced its 2021 McDonald‚Äôs/APIA Scholarship recipients. Furthering its longtime commitment to providing resources to students, the scholarship program, established in 2019, is dedicated to addressing the financial barriers that prevent students from pursuing higher education.
According to Pew Research, Asian Pacific Islander Americans are the most economically divided ethnic group in the U.S., with the top 10% earning nearly 11 times more than those in the bottom 10%. Pew Research also found that income inequality is rising most rapidly within the APIA community.
‚ÄúThere are tremendous socio-economic hurdles within the Asian Pacific Islander American community, which are often overlooked because of the model minority myth. APIAs are not a monolith and income disparities in our community are very real,‚Äù said No√´l Harmon, President and Executive Director of APIA Scholars. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to work with McDonald‚Äôs to address these issues and help underserved students reach their full potential.‚Äù
Aligning with the program‚Äôs mission to aid students who face challenges paying for college, 67% of this year‚Äôs scholarship recipients are from families in significant financial need. Half a million dollars in scholarships will be awarded to 55 APIA students, which includes 15 four-year scholarships for $20,000 each and 40 one-year scholarships for $5,000 each. The scholarship recipients were selected based on their academic achievement, leadership ability, and community involvement.
Many of this year‚Äôs McDonald‚Äôs/APIA Scholars have overcome personal hardships that have inspired them to uplift their communities through education. Some of their stories include:
- Daisy, 19, is a Filipino-American student from Las Vegas, who is formerly homeless and a survivor of domestic violence. Inspired by the help she received during her time of need, she is pursuing a career in nursing to take care of others.
- Shanay, 18, is an Indian-American student inventor from Madison, Mississippi who created an affordable 3D-printed prosthetic after witnessing the daily struggles of his double amputee aunt. He plans to develop a prototype for global production.
- Harjot, 18, is an Indian-American aspiring teacher from Kent, Washington on a mission to diversify U.S. history curriculum. In addition to ensuring inclusion of different voices and perspectives, he hopes to increase minority representation among educators.
‚ÄúThese are tough times, but we remain committed to helping students reach their dreams regardless of their financial limitations,‚Äù said Elizabeth Campbell, Senior Director of Cultural Engagement, McDonald‚Äôs USA. ‚ÄúMaintaining our partnership with APIA Scholars enables us to identify those in need and make a difference in their lives.‚Äù
Representing 17 Asian Pacific Islander American subgroups across 28 states, this year‚Äôs class of McDonald‚Äôs/APIA Scholars are both ethnically and geographically diverse.

38% are Southeast Asian (Vietnamese, Hmong, Cambodian, Filipino, Karen, Burmese, Chamorro/Guamanian, Fijian, Tahitian, and Tongan)
29% are East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean)
20% are South Asian (Bangladeshi, Indian, and Pakistani)
9% are Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
4% are West Asian (Afghan).
‚ÄúAs small business owners, we are committed to serving our local communities and know the importance of investing in communities of color,‚Äù said Willie Cho, a Seattle-based McDonald‚Äôs Owner/Operator and National Diversity Marketing Committee Lead. ‚ÄúThrough initiatives like the McDonald‚Äôs/APIA Scholarship and APA Next, we are feeding and fostering communities, and remain inspired to make a difference.‚Äù

the Medusa Oak: Icon of Medieval Sherwood Forest
Named 'Medusa' by the Rangers at the Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve...
This beautiful ancient oak has survived an attempt to fell her in the not too distant past- and has sprung back to life with serpent-like branches reclaiming her former crown. She sits proud; shrouded in a skirt of moss and lichen surrounded by young oak saplings and slender Silver Birch...
Due north of the Major Oak, Medusa sits at the norteast boundary of Birklands wood (A crown wood in the heart of Medieval Sherwood Forest). A number of Medieval perambulations of the wood mention a boundary 'mere point' or marker known as 'Musmere' ( the mossy boundary mark)... one perambulation goes further and mentions 'A bound called Musmere Oake'. This location is at the northeast of Birklands wood...
Could this moss and lichen covered oak tree with its reborn crown of serpents be the Musmere Oak of Medieval tradition?

Daily life in Medieval Sherwood Forest- Peasant Rights
Medieval society and the medieval landscape were for the common person predominantly rural and agricultural in nature.
Very little of the landscape was not utilised, and in some areas such as the ‚ÄòChampion‚Äô (from the French champ- for field) landscapes of the
Midlands,
almost every inch was turned over to arable- especially in the boom years of
population expanse during the 13th century.
In
Sherwood Forest it was similar, in that almost every
resource was used.
Every village had its great open fields, where crops were rotated through the season, and the people farmed strips of land spread throughout them. Each year one field stood fallow to recover for the following years crops.
This fallow field was fertilized by the animals of the village. Pigs and sheep would be concentrated at night into temporary pens to ‚Äòfocus‚Äô their fertilization efforts.
Between these times it was necessary to graze animals away from the open fields.
No matter how much an animal fertilizes a field it will always take more nutrients than it returns, if it grazes exclusively from the same field that it fertilizes, as it requires nutrients to grow.
An external source of nutrients and energy was therefore required, and in
Sherwood
Forest this came from the great heaths and Lyngges ( Old
Scandinavian for heather- see There‚Äôs Vikings in the Heather entry).
Shepherds and swineherds would tend their flocks and herds on these vast swathes of lowland heath around
Sherwood Forest that
stretched for mile after mile across the open countryside. Vast areas such as
‚ÄòBasforde Lyngges‚Äô, the heaths of Rufford Abbey Lordship, ‚ÄòBudby Oute Fieldes‚Äô and
the ‚ÄòMoor of Kirby‚Äô, would be dotted with these herds, and the sight of flocks
and shepherds would have been common to the traveller passing through the
forest.
Each parish had their own areas of woodland, usually at their edges.
In the more populated southern ‚ÄòThorneywood‚Äô area they occupied the high ground between parishes, such as on the ridges between the villages of Lambley, Woodborough and Calverton.
These woods often joined together to form giant woods that could cover miles, but they each had names reflecting to whom they belonged. Carleton Wode, Gedling Wode, Basforde Wode (named after villages) Kettulbarne Haw, Fox Swaht, Prior Stobyn, Samson Wode (after landscape features or owners past and present).
In the ‚ÄòHigh Forest‚Äô, (the northern part of Sherwood Forest) these woods were sometimes vast such as the great Maunsfelde (Mansfield) Wode, Sutton Wode, Blidworth Wood and Hay Wode, as well as the great crown woods of the Hay of Birklands, Bilhaugh and Lyndhurst Wood (see Lyndhurst Wood- the chief wood of Sherwood entry).
It is worth reminding that nobody could actually cut down the tress in these woods for timber because it was forbidden by Forest Law (see Forest Law page). However the rights to the woods were heavily guarded by the people, because they had other kinds of rights within them.
As well as the rights to pasture on the great heaths and commons peasants had the right to graze their animals in woodland at certain times of the year. One such time was the ‚ÄòPannage‚Äô season (just after the acorns fell) when peasant could graze their pigs on acorns in the woods of the forest.
These rights to access woods were strictly controlled under Forest Law with ‚ÄòAgisters‚Äô acting as tax collectors to control quotas and extract fines (see Forest Law Page)
Peasants also had the right to take some smaller timber from the woods for ‚ÄòHaybote‚Äô (hedge repair) and ‚ÄòHusbote‚Äô (house repair).
These rights were often jealously guarded!
An Inquisition Post Mortem into the rights of the people of Clipstone Manor, dated
20th April 1327 early in the reign of Edward III shows some of the rights of the peasant to the
resources of their land.
The Inquisition was presented in front of John De Crombwell Keeper of the Kings Forest beyond Trent, by the oath of John de Annesley; Philip de Caltoft, knight; Thomas Whaton; Richard Russell; Richard Ingam; John de Holm; Richard de Bestewod (Bestwood); Thomas de Lyndeby; Simon de Lameley; John le Warde of Crathethopre; William Basage; and john Moigne of Carleton‚Ä¶
‚ÄòThe King‚Äôs tenants of his manor of Clypston in Shirwod (Sherwood), which is of ancient demesne of the crown of England, and their ancestors, tenants of the same manor, from time immemorial have been accustomed to have all ferns growing in a place which is now called the park of Clypston, for thirteen shillings and six pence, to be rendered yearly to the King‚Äôs ancestors by the hands of the justice of the Forest; and to collect the leaves fallen from the trees in the same place for manuring their lands, without rendering anything therefor; and to have pasture for all kinds of beasts in the same, doing in return the custody of the vert and venison in the same place by two of the tenants‚Äô.
This shows how the peasants had customary rights to access the ‚Äòpark‚Äô for livestock grazing, and to gather ferns and leaves for fertilizer, (in exchange for looking after the deer and timber for the King)
It also shows that they were empowered enough to appeal through the court system to protect those rights.
The reason for the inquest is that Edward II had closed off access to the park, preventing them from their customary rights. The newly crowned Edward III was being petitioned by the men of Clipstone to have their rights returned. They also informed the King that he was losing the money they would normally pay for their rights!!!
Presumably he would be more likely to listen if his wallet was affected.
The men also pointed out that they could not get sufficient pasture outside of the park for their needs- as stated earlier nutrients for flocks and open fields needed to come from somewhere other than the fields themselves.
So as can be seen the landscape of Sherwood Forest provided opportunities for people to make their living from agriculture and from accessing the resources that the Forest provided around them. It was also the case that people would guard these rights vigorously, petitioning through the courts and to the legal system.
The laws of the land prevented many people from having many things, but they also enshrined rights over generations and the law could be called upon to protect those rights if they were threatened.
(More on farming practices in Medieval Sherwood Forest including the ‚ÄòBreck System‚Äô, and more on the courts and laws of everyday medieval life coming soon).Resident Registration

The Best Jewelry Making Supplies To Buy On Amazon
Is there anything better than spending an hour wandering around a bead store? Bead lovers know that no online shopping experience compares with visiting a bead store in person and touching ALL. THE. BEADS. Of course while you're there, it's easy to pick up other jewelry making supplies as well, such as beading thread or a new pair of pliers.
Also, being at the store in person is best for designing jewelry and color matching beads. I have been known to take a little plastic bag filled with beads I'm trying to match or color coordinate with into the bead store. Yes, I am that person! We all know when designing a new beaded jewelry piece, seeing how the colors will go together just can't be done right on a computer screen.
Also, I know when I shop at a local bead store, I'm supporting a small business and helping to ensure they will be around for a long time to come!
However, there are beading and jewelry making supplies that you will want to always have on hand, and you can't always make time for a bead store run. For those items, you can't beat the convenience of shopping on Amazon.
For that reason, I've compiled a list of my favorite go-to jewelry making supplies that I like to buy on Amazon. The convenience factor is huge, and more often than not, the items are cheaper than anywhere else. Another great thing is all of these items are Prime eligible, which means if you are a Prime customer, they arrive super fast, and with free shipping!
Ready? Let's get started with my list of my favorite jewelry making supplies you can buy on Amazon.
This page contains some affiliate links (which means if you make a purchase after clicking a link, I will earn a small commission at no additional cost to you). Read my full disclosure policy here.
1. FireLine Beading Thread
I've always been resistant to using any kind of fishing line for beading, but once I tried FireLinefor beadweaving, I was convinced! After many years of using Nymo, FireLine is now my go-to thread for bead weaving and I never want to be without it! I like the FireLine 6 lb. weight in Clear for bead weaving because it is small enough to pass through tiny seed beads and Delica beads multiple times, but it's strong enough to protect your finished piece. It also adds a little structure to your piece as you are weaving, which is another feature I really like.
FireLine is available in Clear and Smoke colors, so there's a color option for dark and light beads (Smoke is a very dark grey). I've found that it doesn't knot up as often as traditional beading thread, and when it does get tangled, it's a lot easier to untangle the knot. FireLine is also very resistant to abrasion from sharp glass edges, which is a big deal. Nymo and other traditional beading threads will start to fray over time when bead weaving with many tiny glass beads.
FireLine shouldn't be your first choice for heavier bracelets and necklaces - for those projects, you'll want to use a flexible beading wire like Beadalon (available in Silver or Gold Color) or Soft Flex. But for bead weaving and any other lightweight project with seed beads, FireLine can't be beat.
You can pick up FireLine beading thread from Amazon here.
2. Elizabeth Ward Bead Storage
These Elizabeth Ward Bead Storage Solutions bead storage boxes are another thing I resisted for a long time. I'm so glad I decided to try them! Yes, they are more expensive than cheap fishing tackle boxes, but in my opinion, they are SO worth it. Really, they are way more than bead storage boxes... they are a bead storage system.
I'm so crazy about them that I've thrown out all of my mis-matched, differently sized tackle boxes and moved all of my beads and findings into a series of these storage boxes. It was quite an undertaking, but I'm so happy I did it.
I know what you are thinking. Those bead boxes are expensive! You can buy a fishing tackle box from Wal-Mart or a craft storage box from Michael's for a couple of bucks! And yes, that's true. But these bead storage containers are far and away better than the cheaper alternatives. Let's talk for a minute about why.
But what about fishing tackle boxes for jewelry making supply storage?
I started out storing my beads and findings, like most people do, in fishing tackle boxes. Yes, they are cheap and easy to pick up at places like Walmart, so you can have a bazillion of them without spending a fortune.
However, I didn't like how the compartment sizes were either too deep, or too wide, or not wide enough, or all the same size. I also didn't like how my seed beads were in different boxes and containers than my larger beads ( like my Czech and Swarovski crystals) because of the size differences. Of course my findings didn't work in a box with compartments all the same size either, so I had to get different tackle boxes for those.
Yeah, I know some tackle boxes have adjustable compartment walls, but when you pull them out, all the beads on either side of the wall flood together into the new, larger space.
You can tell I've really thought this through.
Also, the fishing tackle box compartments don't close individually. If you accidentally drop your open bead box (and who hasn't done that at least once?), all of your beads will go EVERYWHERE.
Finally, when it's time to take your beads out for a project, you can't easily remove them to compare them to other beads as you plan. Instead, you have to fish them out a few at a time from their compartment. Oh, and don't get me started on the knuckle scraping as you get the beads out of their individual compartments... it's a pain.
The ideal jewelry making supplies storage solution
So, imagine a world where your beads live happily ever after all together, in their own individual little bead boxes with their own individual lids. Imagine seed beads in tiny bead boxes, and tall findings like headpins in a little bead box that fits them perfectly, too. Whatever size your beads, findings, jump rings, crystal beads, or crimp beads are, you have a little bead box for each one that they fit in just right.
Now imagine ALL of those different shaped bead containers fit neatly into rows in a bead box with a lid. You can have a limitless number of combinations of small, medium, and large bead boxes within one bead storage box. Want to store your beads by color? No problem. Just move the small bead containers around to make new rows by color.
What about having all of your seed beads in one storage box, larger beads in other boxes, and then findings on their own in another? That's no problem either (and that's what I do).
Features and uses
You can also use these storage boxes as project boxes if you want. You can easily load up the rows with assorted beads and findings for a project you are working on so you can see all the colors and how they work together. You'll have everything in one place, too, so you can bead on the go if you do that sort of thing (I certainly do!).
Elizabeth Ward Bead Storage Solutions bead storage boxes are available in a variety of configurations. The 45 piece box shown above has 45 small containers in varying sizes. They also have an 82 piece version, perfect for seed beads or Delica beads, because all the containers are the same very small size. These two versions are the ones I use as my bead storage system.
The 4 piece box has a bead tray perfect for travel (but doesn't fit any bead containers). The 2 piece box has only a top lid and bottom, so just the empty box. You can buy the bead containers separately and configure the containers in whatever sizes you like. You can also use the 2 piece box as a project board, with a half of it filled with bead containers and the other half with your tools, string or wire, and your work in progress.
These bead boxes are available at bead stores and some craft stores, but no one can beat the price on Amazon, which is why I have them on this list!
Labeling the beads and findings storage boxes
To make remembering where you bought certain jewelry making supplies and beads easier, these storage boxes come with a full sheet of sticky labels that you can write a note on and stick to each container:
The labels can go on the top of the container, or the bottom, as shown above. I actually prefer to make my own labels for these storage containers, though. For my seed bead storage, I like to put the seed bead number (ex: DB1250) on a small, clear label I print out with my Dymo label maker, like this:
This way the label doesn't cover up the clear bottom of the container.
The DYMO label maker spits out labels quickly and is a breeze to use. In fact, my 8 year old daughter loves to be in charge of printing the labels and putting them on the bead containers when new seed beads arrive!
This is the Dymo label maker I use, which can be found here on Amazon.
3. Wubbers Jewelry Making Pliers
No list of jewelry making supplies would be complete without jewelry making tools. There are so many great tools out there, both in stores and online. If you are new to jewelry making, you will want to check out my Beginner's Guide To Jewelry Making Tools post. In it you'll find specific information about what features you want to look for when tool shopping. I also give you my recommendations of the 3 must have tools you need to have to get started jewelry making! You can read that post here.
Jewelry making tools are the most expensive things you'll buy when you are getting started making jewelry, and it's great to be able to save money when you can. Amazon has great prices on my favorite jewelry making tools from Wubbers.
Wubbers offers a wide variety of traditional jewelry making tools, like round nose and flat nose pliers. They also offer a variety of specialty jewelry making tools as well. The quality is great and although they are a little more expensive than some of the tools you can buy from the craft store, they are so worth it. The prices on Amazon are the best I've seen, too, which is why I recommend always buying them on Amazon.
About Wubbers' plier sizes
Wubbers' traditional jewelry making pliers come in two sizes, Classic and Baby. I have both, but I prefer the Baby size. They aren't really small, just smaller than the Classic which I think are a tad too big for the average sized hand.
Both Classic and Baby size Wubbers come with teal colored hand grips and a spring mechanism, which are two features I highly recommend in
my Beginner's Guide To Jewelry Making Tools post. They are all around great pliers and I plan to invest in some of their specialty tools when the need arises!
You can see of the Baby sized Wubbers pliers on Amazon here. You can buy them individually, or they also have sets of 3 or 4 pliers that come with a handy little wood stand. Wubbers pliers are great!
4. Darice Clear Storage Box with Screw Top Lids
Do you bead on the go? I know I do. I'm out of the house a lot with my kids' various sports and activities, and I always like to have a bead project with me for the down times during things like baseball practices and dentist appointments.
I do a lot of beadweaving with Delica beads, and for works in progress to take on the go, I love these little Darice clear storage boxes with screw top lids. Again, they can be purchased at a lot of stores, but the prices on Amazonmake it affordable to have a few of them on hand.
Here is an example of how I use these storage boxes as portable project boxes:
My setup involves taking out all of the screw top containers and only using the ones that I need. Inside the box is my beading pattern which has a color coded beaded chart (every bead color has a letter A through E). I also have my favorite pair of small curved Fiskars scissors and a small spool of FireLine tucked away in there.
I use my handy dandy Dymo Label Maker to print clear labels with the letters A through E so I can easily identify the beads in the screw top containers. In addition, I stick a pencil in the box to mark the pattern rows as I go, pop the top on, and that's it!
Again, I love these little boxes, and they are a great jewelry making item you can find on Amazon.

The Best Jewelry Making Pliers Of 2021
If you are interested in jewelry making, you need a helpful set of tools to assist you in molding wire, attaching findings, and getting in hard to reach places. These tools will help you make beautiful pieces of jewelry.
The most important tools you will use are your pliers, and you can purchase these tools by themselves or in kits that include several different tools.
Oftentimes, the tool sets are an easier way to get the job done, but you‚Äôll want to keep your eye out for quality. After all, you don‚Äôt want a tool that gives up right when you are in the middle of making a pair of earrings.
What are the best jewelry making pliers? The best jewelry making pliers will vary by project and material type, but in general they should be easy and comfortable to grip and constructed well, with a box joint. You will likely want to invest in multiple pliers of different shapes and types to perform different tasks.
In this article, we‚Äôll go into more detail about how to choose the right pliers for your uses and go through some of our favorite choices out there.
We looked at a variety of different jewelry pliers and narrowed down our top picks based on certain features. For instance, if you are working with soft metals, you‚Äôll want to stick with a choice like the nylon-jawed Beadalon Round Nose Pliers.
What Kind of Jewelry Making Pliers Do I Need?
Often when you are just starting out with a jewelry making venture, getting a kit that contains several jewelry making pliers is the best (and most economical) option.
As you start to develop your skills and may even be working with soft metals that damage easily, you‚Äôll start to want more specialized jewelry pliers and tools. But what do you use these tools for?
- Chain Nose Pliers or Snipe Nose Pliers: You may see these tools by either of these names, and they are an integral part of your jewelry making supplies. They have jaws that are smooth and flat, unlike household pliers that typically have teeth. You can use them to hold a variety of different findings, open and close jump rings, and even flatten crimps. They will provide a handy grip when you are making your jewelry pieces.
- Bent Chain Nose Pliers: Bent chain nose pliers or simply bent nose pliers are useful for handling jewelry making supplies without the handles getting in the way. They let you grip in hard to reach areas, making them an important part of your tool box. You can use them to open and close jump rings and even shape wire. You can use them in conjunction with your regular chain nose pliers or even flat nose pliers.
- Flat Nose Pliers: Flat nose pliers have a wider surface on their jaws than other pliers, which makes them especially useful for hold large, flat surfaces. They can be used for bending and shaping even sharp, defined angles in metal sheets or wire. You can also use flat nose pliers for opening and closing jump rings. Consider using them in conjunction with your chain nose pliers.
- Round Nose Pliers: Round nose pliers have limited uses in jewelry making, but they can‚Äôt be readily replaced by other pairs of pliers. Use them for creating loops on headpins or eyepins or for making loops in your pieces of jewelry.
- Crimping Pliers: These tools are designed to work with crimp tubes, often used for finishing jewelry off. When used appropriately, the crimp the tube into a smooth and rounded crimp.
- Punch Pliers: Punch pliers contain punch pins that allow the tool to make perfectly rounded holes in jewelry pieces or blanks.
- Looping or Coiling Pliers: Also called bail making pliers, these tools are designed to wrap wire into different shapes with ease. They can also be used to make jump rings and eyepins.
- Cutters: You will often find cutters sold with pliers, and you will need a good pair or two when jewelry making, for a variety of things, including cutting off old findings if you are repurposing old jewelry or trimming wire to the appropriate shape. You can also trim headpins to an appropriate length for your project with these. The underside of the cutters is flatter than the top side, and it allows you to get closer to your project than using the top side.
- Flush Cutters: Flush cutters are basically an upgraded version of normal cutters. They allow you to get a nicer finish when trimming wire, and you‚Äôre less likely to need to file down sharp edges.
There are many more unique pliers and cutting tools available on the market that you may need to acquire as you embrace your jewelry making abilities, such as the rosary pliers and bow opening pliers.
Picking the Right Jewelry Pliers for You
When you are making jewelry, the tools you will lean on the heaviest are pliers and cutters, so you will want to have a good set of tools. Picking the tools you will use may depend on several factors, namely cost and how they feel in your hand.
You could spend $30 on pair of pliers, but if they hurt your hand, they aren‚Äôt going to be worthwhile to use. That‚Äôs why starting out with a set of economical tools is often best, allowing you to get a feel for different tools and their sizes as you learn to use them in your new craft-making adventure.
Another factor to keep in mind is the actual construction of the tools. Pliers are generally made with either a box joint or a lap joint.
Lap joints are typically a characteristic of lesser quality pliers, often becoming loose over time, sometimes quite quickly. Box joint pliers tend to retain their alignment and don‚Äôt develop looseness as they are used, allowing them to outlast and outperform lap joint pliers.
Our Favorite Jewelry Pliers
When picking out what jewelry pliers you are going to purchase, you really should get the best pair you can afford. We have listed pliers at affordable price points, including some sets and some individual pliers that should really be part of your toolkit:
Check them out in more detail below! By the way, we‚Äôve tried to make everything simpler by separating the pliers that come with kits from those that come individually.

These tools are small sized, which fit comfortably into many people‚Äôs hands. That said, if you have larger hands, it may be harder to wield them. The tools are constructed out of carbon steel and are plated with a nickel coating for rust resistance.
If you‚Äôre sensitive to nickel, you‚Äôll want to be careful handling these, however. The tools also feature round spring and double spring designs, and the grip handles are ergonomic and comfortable for most people to use for long periods of time.
Overall, these tools are designed to last you awhile when you‚Äôre working with them.
2. eoocvt Mini Bead Jewellery Tool Kit

They are also made from drop forged steel, providing strength and durability. The biggest downside to these tools is that they are often confused with lesser quality Craftsman tools; don‚Äôt be fooled, if you‚Äôre looking at Craftsman, these are the tools you want.
4. Darice Jewelry Pliers Set
Check Current Price on Amazon
This set has comfortable handles and the major tools that you need to use when making jewelry. In addition to jewelry pliers, such as a serrated tip long-nose pliers and straight nose internal pliers, this set even includes wire cutters, which are great for finishing off your jewelry pieces.

The worldwide pandemic caused many of us to watch more television than ever before. With that in mind, it‚Äôs time to start changing our television watching habits to keep us mentally and physically fit. Here‚Äôs how not to watch TV, according to those who know about healthy habits best‚Ä¶
Without Moving
Of course, we all know the term ‚Äúcouch potato.‚Äù Well, as the name implies, the habit of not moving while watching television is not too great for your health. And it‚Äôs not just about gaining weight, either! Most recently, one 2019 study revealed that watching TV in a sitting position for two or more hours without moving results in a 70% increased risk of developing colorectal cancer at a young age!
‚ÄúBeing active can help improve your hormone levels and the way your immune system works,‚Äù stated the American Cancer Society. So, not only should you take a standing and stretching break every hour or so, but every week adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise. If you love intense exercise, 75 minutes a week should be enough.
But sitting too long is just one way we watch television wrong‚Ä¶
Blue Light Reduction
While our grandmothers weren‚Äôt exactly right that bright screens would make us go blind, screens are certainly not great for our health. Exposure to the blue light produced from screens, both television and computers, can disrupt the health of your eyes and skin. In short, it makes people age faster. A study published in the journal Aging and Mechanisms of Disease in 2019 found that too much blue light exposure can damage cells in the brain and eyes.
How can you prevent this? Well, there are a few things you can do! Spend some time in the sunlight, not in front of artificial light, every day. Also, wear blue-light glasses and don‚Äôt watch too much TV after working all day.
While Eating
Eating in front of the television, better known as ‚Äúdistracted eating,‚Äù can build some terrible habits. And it‚Äôs not just eating in front of the television ‚Äì it‚Äôs also eating in front of the computer or while using your phone! You see, human brains simply stop notice how much we‚Äôre eating when we‚Äôre not focused on the task at hand.
‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt mindful of what‚Äôs going into your mouth, you don‚Äôt process that information,‚Äù said Harvard Medical School. ‚ÄúThat means it doesn‚Äôt get stored in your memory bank. And without a memory of having eaten, you are more likely to eat again sooner than you might have if you ate mindfully.‚Äù
Right Before Bed Or Instead Of Sleeping
Who doesn‚Äôt love a late-night snack? Well, it turns out that late-night snacks are not exactly great for your sleep schedule ‚Äì and neither is watching television to fall asleep! Both snacks and blue light deeply affect the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences research. To combat this, the National Sleep Foundation recommends no television, smartphones, or computers for 30 minutes before bed. Instead, enjoy a cup of lavender tea and a book, or listen to calming music.
Following these tips will help you remain healthy while you watch television.

DNA is a multibillion-dollar industry in 2021 and satisfies many life science applications, including drugs, reagents, siRNA, PCR, diagnostics, synthetic biology, and many others. Enzymatic DNA synthesis, or EDS, is a new approach to manufacturing DNA that is much more efficient and user-friendly and could disrupt the current market.
Thomas Ybert is the CEO of DNA Script which is out with a new benchtop enzymatic DNA synthesizer called SYNTAX. He says in contrast to old chemical synthesizers, the new ‚ÄúDNA printer‚Äù takes virtually no expertise to run and will return much of the current business from service back to the old model where biologists make their own, having the power to ‚Äúgo from design to results in less than 24 hours.‚Äù
‚Äú[Biologists] are programming biological systems. DNA is the programming code. And you want this design-build-test cycle to go as fast as possible. It‚Äôs very clear that the next revolution will be from the life sciences. And we want to enable people to design-build-test super quickly.‚Äù
Investors appear happy with the company, just pouring in $165 million last month. The SYNTAX system is available now. With all that hassle of chemical synthesis cleared away by this new easy-to-use technology, will researchers and others return to making their own DNA?‚ÄúWhat worked on the Atkins Diet regimen?‚Äù is a frequently asked question. The Atkins diet is not a brand-new one, but the claims of people who use the program to achieve their goals is new. It is essential to first comprehend what failed on the Atkins Diet plan before taking a look at possible solutions.
The workout was a high healthy protein, low carbohydrate based method. Each representative performed would have a predetermined collection of workouts for the body. The team had a pre-determined amount of exercise in the fitness center which they would certainly finish 2 times per week. Her exercise generally entailed training weights and running on the treadmill. Each set worked out a concession between the two sides, each side exercising a compromise in between the opposite side. Each collection would have a minimal variety of associates to finish to obtain the body weight made use of to being exhausted. gym keyring
The trouble with this kind of workout is that you can end up being bored. Each regular becomes like a little problem where there are many smaller items missing than the whole picture. So you may find yourself believing, well this is easy, I can do this all the time, why should I do this? If it is simple, why should I do it? When the answer to these concerns is taken into consideration the solutions commonly become extremely clear.
The primary reason the exercises on the Atkins plan did not produce outcomes was lack of high quality. Each regimen is meant to be executed five to 7 times weekly, or concerning sixty to seventy reps. This is far excessive stress on the joints as well as muscle mass. If these muscular tissues are worn out and not totally prepared to manage this amount of work then you will only feel weak throughout the actual workout itself which defeats the purpose.
The right amount of resistance ought to be made use of in your workouts. For best outcomes you need to use workouts that focus on constructing the toughness as well as endurance of the larger muscles in your body. These exercises ought to be 2 days weekly and not a single exercise. The more workouts that are done at the same time the much less reliable the exercise ends up being.
One day in a gym can be very reliable as an exercise. However, you can quickly end up being bored if you are doing the same regimen. A much better option is workout splits that entail 2 various workouts for every muscle group. This way you can alternative each exercise by spending just one day in the fitness center. You can likewise invest someday in the health club and then alternate backward and forward between hefty and also lightweight or in between cardio workouts. pendlay row form
There are numerous ways to do an exercise split. In my very own point of view the most effective means is to just do 2 collections of 8 to twelve repetitions with eight to twelve associates in between. Then change the exercises up by doing sets of twelve to twenty one reps with eight to twelve associates in between.
When picking workouts for your exercise you must pick ones that are mosting likely to construct and tone the significant muscle mass groups in your body. If you have actually been inactive or obese you may require to drop weight as well as begin exercising again. If your exercise contains stay up, bring up or bench press you will certainly not be able to construct adequate biceps as well as triceps muscles to get the body you want. Begin exercising with heavier weights and also lower associates until you can remove the fat around your shoulders.
Cardio exercise is another great way to burn calories and also slim down. This is one of the most effective workout part divides for the whole body. Your legs, abdominal muscles, back, shoulders and also arms all take advantage of cardiovascular exercise. You ought to select details cardiovascular workouts such as aerobics, walking, bike riding or running and you can likewise do various other sporting activities such as tennis, badminton, football, dashing, basketball as well as a lot more.
Another kind of workout you can do at the health club is what is called a broad or substance set. This means you will be performing 2 or even more exercises with exercising weights. For instance, if you are making use of dumbbells for bench press you are performing 4 workouts: squatting, deadlift, overhanging press and also bent over row. You would certainly after that do a solitary arm above press and also deadlift. You can additionally do four different sets of 12 representatives of each of these exercises with exercising weights.
The final leg workout split you will certainly learn more about today is called a hamstring workout split. This workout concentrates on boosting your hamstrings and glutes. It is done by using a cable television device or a security round. You merely do a common hamstrings exercise however as you raise the resistance you gradually pull down on the ball thus contracting your hamstring muscles. To do this workout merely remain on the security round in a seated position with your feet in addition to the maker and pull the ball up to your breast degree pushing your legs bent on both sides.
Second, you require to figure out which works out to perform during your exercise. While a personal fitness instructor may be able to assist you toward the very best exercises, there are lots of additional workouts that you can do by yourself. As long as you are executing the ideal workout, there is no demand to have an instructor‚Äôs aid. If you are just starting and see instant results, however, it may still be smart to speak with a health and fitness professional in your area.
Next off, you need to know which muscular tissue groups you intend to target with your exercise routine. For example, if you are looking to tone as well as define your arms, then you must concentrate on workouts that target these muscular tissues using heavy weights and also high reps. Nevertheless, if your objective is to bulk up as well as construct mass, after that you will focus on lower weight/rep sets and utilize lighter weights as well as reps. So ensure that you recognize what you are attempting to complete before you begin working out. bodybuilding clothes
Finally, you require to remember to relax between your collections. The significance of rest in between sets can not be stressed enough. When you relax between collections, you not just allow your muscle mass to come to be much more limber, yet your heart can likewise loosen up even more conveniently, which permits your body to proceed applying its maximum muscular endurance for several a lot more sets. So preferably, you must relax between collections for 3 mins, or as near to 3 minutes as possible, although you can take your workout to the health club a few mins longer if you wish.Manchester United have approached Zinedine Zidane about becoming their manager but, according to sources close to the former Real Madrid boss, he is not interested in going to Old Trafford at this point.
Zidane ended his second spell as Real manager in May this year.
He won three consecutive Champions League titles with the club from 2016.
After leaving in 2018, he returned a year later and won La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup in 2020.
The same sources have said legendary former France and Real midfielder Zidane, who is out of work, would not be keen on a move to United right now.
He has been linked with the French national side and Paris St-Germain, and would prefer to consider those options when or if they become available.
Mauricio Pochettino, who has regularly been spoken of as a future United boss, is the current manager of PSG, who have full confidence in the Argentine and have made no movements to replace him with Zidane.

In the past 3 weeks, news that the Chinese government was cracking down on ICOs and forcing cryptocurrency exchanges to halt trading has sent the markets tanking.
Trading volumes on the cryptocurrency exchanges are down significantly, and the pull-back in activity is not just from the Chinese Yuan and exchanges, but across all currencies and global exchanges. (see the following 2 charts, from)
We can analyse what we know and don‚Äôt know, and give some context to these developments.
First, let us be reminded that Chinese regulators and authorities decisions and policy statements are aimed at the Chinese market. They are not directives for the rest of the world to follow. China‚Äôs government scope is at the national level.
Second, the timing of this crackdown may be related to the upcoming 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPP), scheduled to start on Oct 18th 2017 in Beijing. That is one of the most important meetings in China‚Äôs political calendar, and it has been widely reported that the latest announcements are politically motivated muscle-flexing by the CPP.
We know the following:
- Capital flight via cryptocurrency was real, and the Chinese authorities didn‚Äôt like that. It wasn‚Äôt clear to them where the billions of dollars in crypto gains were going, past the exchanges.
- The KYC/AML practices of Chinese exchanges were not all up to par with the rest of the world. Previously, many exchanges didn‚Äôt require stringent KYC, until AML was strictly mandated by the People‚Äôs Bank of China in January 2017.
- The ICOmania had reached another dimension in China with over zealous promoters and real scams that took place. Although the pace of ICOs has been strong outside of China, there were hundreds of ICOs inside the country that we didn‚Äôt even know about.
So it was expected that some kind of order was overdue. The political coincidence made the moons align more squarely for that perfect storm to take hold.
Despite this turmoil, the global fundamentals behind blockchain, cryptocurrency and ICOs are intact. As much as one would like to think that what China does doesn‚Äôt matter, the reality is that when China sneezes at crypto, the rest of the world catches the cold.
For one, Chinese partcipants represent 30-35% of many ICOs, so their absence has been felt, even if the ban doesn‚Äôt officially affect non-China ICOs. Some ICOs who had Chinese investors on their radar (via KYC pre-registrations or direct contacts), have experienced a downturn in money raised from that specific region.
Second, the share of Chinese exchanges on total cryptocurrency volumes used to be close to 45-50% before the ban, and now estimated to have dwindled to perhaps about 15%. Some Chinese users can still get away with trading by using VPNs and accessing external exchanges.
With all that backdrop, let us be reminded that China has also previously banned Facebook and Google, but those companies continued to thrive, while China promoted their own versions of these services (Weibo, RenRen, Baidu Tieba). Furthermore, China has its own Twitter (Weibo), YouTube (Youku Tudou), Yelp (Dianping), Tinder (Momo), Apple (Xiaomi), Uber (Didi Kuaidi), PayPal (Alipay), eBay (Taobao), and other home-grown social media giants like WeChat and Tencent QQ.
You get the idea? So, why not expect China to have their own cryptocurrency too, not based on Ethereum or Bitcoin, but based on their own currency, the Chinese Yuan?
That brings me to the next big rumor coming out of China, which is the possibility of issuing their own crypto Yuan. This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise given that reports that China‚Äôs Central Bank has been looking at the digital currency have been around for more than 1.5 years.
What remains unknown is if this current hiccup will affect the Chinese Bitcoin miners supremacy, which stands at about 80-85% of total market share. So far, miners have not been affected, but I am sure they are worried. Several questions arise:
- Will the Chinese government require Bitcoin miners to go through the central switch and have their transactions flagged? That would certainly affect the competitive speeds required for transaction mining.
- Will Chinese miners start to diversify their operations outside of China? One of China‚Äôs largest miners, Bitmain has already started activities and shown interest outside of China.
- Will other countries or organizations jump on this opportunity and start to increase their Bitcoin mining capabilities? Some candidates include Russia, Iceland and Canada for countries, and why not the large multinational banks, Amazon or Google for that matter?
Going forward, my predictions on China are:
- China will update their regulation on crypto-exchanges and ICOs after the Party‚Äôs convention. Given the current mess, it was easier to wipe the slate clean, and start from that point forward with new rules.
- We will see a Crypto Yuan emerge, but with some peculiar parameters around its creation. It won‚Äôt be just like another free floating cryptocurrency, and it may not have all the properties of a cryptocurrency, but maybe only selective ones. Even with some restrictions, that move will be a boon for the crypto-markets, as it will serve to validate the future of cryptocurrencies.
- The Chinese share of Bitcoin mining will decrease. Some of the existing miners might be tempted to mine for the crypto Yuan, unless the government decides to monopolize (or not require) that function. Simultaneously, other parts of the world will pick-up some of the Bitcoin mining activity.
In summary, China wants control, and China will get control. That‚Äôs their default modus operandi. Crypto-Tech is no different than the Internet and Web businesses.
What happens in China doesn‚Äôt always stay in China anymore. We have not seen the last of that whale‚Äôs boat capsizing moves.Natural burial grounds offer a way of caring for our dead which is kinder to the earth. In a biodegradable casket or shroud, without embalming or a vault, we are buried in a protected green space where we contribute to the earth‚Äôs renewal. Individual grave markers are replaced by a communal marker, or modest flat rocks. The land is restored to its natural ecosystem, with meadows, woodland and un-manicured nature. Natural burial grounds are sanctuaries for both the living and the dead, and the people who run them are fuelled by passion for both the planet and the families they serve. It is an end of life option that you may value if you‚Äôd like to avoid the environmental damage done by cremation or conventional burial.
If if this idea is meaningful to you, please lend your voice by signing up. We need to demonstrate to decision makers that this is something people value.
We get asked lots of questions, and you‚Äôll find lots of answers here:The last turn/hex-based computer game produced on this subject was Talonsoft‚Äôs Divided Ground in 2001. That game and HPS‚Äô earlier Middle East ‚Äô67 were both designed by John Tiller and covered the four big conflicts in the middle-east between 1948 & 1985: 1948‚Äôs War of Israeli Independence, the Suez crisis of 1956, the 1967 Seven-Days War and the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Much has change since then, and using Tiller‚Äôs engine, Jason Petho has led a crack team to update the Campaign Series to cover conflicts since 1973 and some interesting but overlooked operations in the 1950s and 1960s.
In January 2018, Campaign Series: Middle East received a mammoth 2.0 update. We highly suggest you read this article to find out what‚Äôs changed.
The Desert Can Be a Busy Place
The terrain graphics are more complex than one might think. Different kinds of sand, small but deep streams and marshes affect movement; palm groves and fields obstruct sight and provide sites for ambushes; rocks provide cover and three kinds of roads can aid movement. Other man-made features include gleaming white villages and farms, rock sangars and impressive city buildings. All of these are shown clearly on the seven zoom levels, giving players a feel for their situation.
Jordanian troops defend Jerusalem‚Äôs Old City in 1967.
Units can be seen using NATO symbols or icons with or without bases. The counter type changes with zoom level or player choice. The trademark info box shows unit‚Äôs six attributes such as morale and strength along with the all-important action bar. More information can be found by opening the Unit Handbook and Unit Viewer. For excitement, tanks explode into flames, artillery blasts create smoke, and small arms fire streaks to its targets. If air strikes are available, planes and jets zoom over the map. An essential complement to the graphics is the sound effects. The new Extreme Fog of War option makes enemies virtually invisible, not to mention identify. However, the different weapon sounds can indicate the type of weapon, giving a feel for range and direction to a trained ear. Including movement sounds for vehicles, helicopters and boots, the sound effects for this game are impressive.
A Few New Twists
Mechanics are vintage Tiller: select with left click, move and shoot with right click, order from menu bar, tool bar or hotkeys. Different highlights show particular unit status. In large scenarios, moving units or small groups one hex at a time is tedious. Destinations can be marked several hexes away but the pathfinding algorithm may not choose the wisest route, forcing players back to said tedium. Two functions allow units in the same organization (brigade, regiment, etc.) to be moved in column or echelon but these formations are useless when contact is made. If ever a game called for other grouping methods, it‚Äôs this one.
A tank column moves along a road in 2D.
New additions to options and units add some color to this tired rhythm of clicks. The Extreme Assault option removes the possibility of a single tank automatically overrunning infantry. New units include mobile recovery vehicles to remove movement-blocking wrecks and mobile bridging units allow movement over streams. Some units can create IEDs. Adding humanity to an otherwise cold business are the civilian counters that, if attacked, count against players‚Äô victory points. The most impressive not to mention long overdue new unit type is helicopters. Whirlybirds transport units, provide long range recon and direct fire support when armed. Helicopters fly at three heights, trading speed for safety. This improvement literally adds a new dimension to the system.
Use of the old and new mechanics and units is explained in a fine 207-page PDF manual where questions are answered with headers like ‚ÄúHow do I clear a minefield?‚Äù. So simple even website editors would use it. Four boot camp scenarios help with the learning curve and three training scenarios explain PBEM mechanics. The battle generator and scenario editors are explained in great detail.
Forty Years of Tragedy
All of these features are used in over 130 historical and hypothetical scenarios as well as three linked campaigns. Not surprising all the many major engagements of 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973 are covered. What makes this game a notch above others are the under-reported incidents. Israeli settlers and militia are engaged by Arab irregulars. The French fight a losing battle in Algeria while the British try to keep the lid on Aden. The Israelis pursue bloody punitive excursions into Lebanon, Syria and PLO camps. Jordan kicks out Black September in what amounts to a civil war. These topics are not only relatively obscure but serve as a trace for the evolution of combat in the region. It‚Äôs a long way from second-hand World War II weapons to Saggers.
Helicopter gunships cover a French advance in Algeria.
These clashes take place on 250 meter hexes with counters ranging from platoon to individual vehicle level. Scenarios can have less than six units to over 750. Most scenarios last from ten to twenty turns with serious missions lasting up to fifty turns and a few going for seventy to eighty turns. Depending on scenario complexity, players can be anything from company to army commanders. Players opting for the latter should be congratulated on their tenacity: this scale is fine for up to six on the nine step complexity scale but, after that, play becomes work.
Surprisingly Tense
The three linked campaigns, covering Syrian operations in 1967, British operations in Aden in 1964 and Israeli operation in 1973, are branched. Scores that are high or medium get ranked and go on to other missions; losers get the sack.
My first campaign mission was to take an Israeli tank brigade in 1973 from one end of the map to an exit hex at the other end in fifteen turns with two village objectives in between, and I had two parallel roads. Should be easy peasy, right? Trouble began even before contact was made through traffic jams on the better road. As I approached the first village, I sent a tank to the south for a recce. Wham! An artillery shell out of nowhere demolished it. Advancing a tank platoon into the village, ineffective fire surprised me. I thought turn-based games were calm. I was Wrong! The enemy only became visible when the company attempted to enter his hex.
Concentrated fire only disrupted him so I sent two tanks around to his flank. Again, my fire only caused disruption. Another round of fire caused him to retreat to the northwest, allowing me to take the objective. In my first mistake caused by bloodthirst, I sent the platoon to chase him. A turn later, I overran ran him but my unit was out of position and off the road. Meanwhile, other snipers opened up as I headed west out of the village. I should have let my infantry handle them but their transports had been delayed by the traffic jam so I sent a tank that was quickly destroyed by a Sagger. I lost two more vehicles heading to the second village but got a measure of revenge when my artillery took out two enemy positions in a palm tree grove. The light dawned on me that speed was my friend and time was my enemy. With only three turns left, I bypassed enemy positions and exited the bulk of my forces. Unfortunately, I left some troops on the map chasing low value targets and a trail of burning tanks. I scraped by with a minor defeat and sweat on my brow.
Israeli tanks clear a village.
I could argue that the Tiller engine is antiquated and clumsy but it still possess a fair amount of flexibility and can be adapted in many different ways. Without these qualities, the stream of fine games based on it would not exist. Campaign Series Middle East: 1948-1985 is a great example of how the system can be updated and turned into an exciting game, although from a usability standpoint there‚Äôs still room for improvement.

The case pulls Vic out of his northern Ohio comfort zone to the Sunshine State, where he crosses paths with a corrupt local cop, a famous writer with a taste for booze and women, and a sleazy strip club owner who knows more than he‚Äôs letting on. Throw in one very cute Latina who develops a crush on him and the puzzle becomes more complex. Can Vic solve Ariel‚Äôs problem before the blackmailer ruins her life? Will Ariel convince Vic to give their failed relationship another chance?
Vic sat on a white plastic chair on the beach at his resort, watching the setting sun. People walking along the water‚Äôs edge were silhouetted by the mix of yellow, purple and blue while the evening tide lazily lapped ashore. After his encounters with Bronson and Broussard, Vic had spent the rest of the afternoon doing research on the Internet, but he found it difficult to focus. Part of me wants to solve this puzzle while another part isn‚Äôt in a hurry to go back home. Which one will win?
Vic smiled at the memory of their poolside romp the night before and found himself drawing comparisons to the previous times. I shouldn‚Äôt do that but it‚Äôs hard not to. Ariel still has it‚Äîlooks, passion and more heat than a kiln. I almost wish she hadn‚Äôt dragged me into this. Almost.
He was startled by a familiar smoky voice over his shoulder.
‚ÄúHow did I know this is where I‚Äôd find you?‚Äù
Vic looked up at Ariel, dressed in a light blue sarong with a floral print. She held a silver bucket filled with long-necked green bottles and had a folded beach blanket draped over her arm. Vic looked her up and down.
‚ÄúSlumming?‚Äù he asked.
Ariel laughed and held out her hand. Vic took it, stood, then walked with her toward the water. When they were within fifty feet of the incoming tide, Ariel spread the blanket on the sand. She set the bucket in the middle, then sat cross-legged and pulled her dress just over her knees. Vic joined her and took two of the Mojito wine coolers from the bucket. He opened them and handed one to Ariel.
‚ÄúJust like old times,‚Äù he commented.
‚ÄúRemember how we sat out here, staring into the night and talking about who knows what?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat who-knows-what covered a lot of things, as I recall.‚Äù He took a drink and placed his hand on Ariel‚Äôs knee. ‚ÄúWhat you told me last night. That was tough for you to admit, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
Ariel smiled shyly and looked down. ‚ÄúOkay, you got me. Let‚Äôs talk about something else. What did you do today?‚Äù
Vic took a drink. ‚ÄúI ran into a friend of yours this afternoon.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho?‚Äù
‚ÄúA cop named Broussard.‚Äù
Ariel took a long swallow of her drink, then cradled the bottle in both hands while looking ahead. ‚ÄúYeah, I know him.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the story with that guy?‚Äù
‚ÄúFormer high school football jock who became a cop when he blew his knee and couldn‚Äôt get a college scholarship. Pretty good at his job, from what I hear.‚Äù
‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù Vic skeptically replied. ‚ÄúAriel, I‚Äôve been doing this long enough to know a peevish lover when I see one. Broussard‚Äôs more protective of you than I am of my mother. Try again.‚Äù
Ariel took a deep breath. ‚ÄúEric Broussard was a mistake. One night before Hal died we had one of our knock-down drag-outs and I stormed out of the house. I went to The Dry Dock to drown my anger and there was Eric.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe give you a shoulder to cry on?‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd a pillow to wake up on. I broke things off after a couple of weeks but he had trouble letting go. Since I became single he‚Äôs been sniffing around me like a bloodhound on a manhunt.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat explains the third degree he gave me. He can‚Äôt stand the idea of someone else sitting in his canoe.‚Äù
Ariel laughed and looked at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been called a lot of things, but never a canoe.‚Äù
Vic smiled. ‚ÄúNo offense intended.‚Äù
‚ÄúNone taken.‚Äù She took a long swallow. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôve you been doing the last three years?‚Äù
‚ÄúI spent the first few months trying to get over you.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you succeed?‚Äù
‚ÄúBarely. After that I got on with my life. What about you?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe same. You may not believe this, but I really had a tough time getting you out of my system. You don‚Äôt know how many times I was tempted to pick up the phone and call you, to explain why I did what I did.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat stopped you?‚Äù
Ariel looked at him. ‚ÄúI figured you‚Äôd hang up on me. Was I right?‚Äù
Vic glanced down for a moment. ‚ÄúMaybe. Since we‚Äôre being up front, there were times I almost called you, too.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù
He looked up at her. ‚ÄúI was afraid of what I might say. I was pretty pissed off when I left here and even after time passed I didn‚Äôt know if I could be civil toward you. It‚Äôs also the reason I never came back here. I think I was afraid I‚Äôd run into you and say something I‚Äôd regret.‚Äù
‚ÄúI knew you were a hard-ass but I never figured you for the vindictive type. But I think you not calling and telling me what a self-centered bitch I was backs up something I always liked about you.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were always considerate of my feelings. The whole time we were together you didn‚Äôt try to control me, you were interested in what I had to say, and you treated me like a person instead of a one-night stand.‚Äù
Vic grinned in embarrassment. ‚ÄúStop it. I treated you the same way I treat everyone.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd here I thought it was because I was special.‚Äù
Vic gazed dreamily at her. ‚ÄúYou are special, Ariel. That‚Äôs why I was so attracted to you.‚Äù
She gave him a playful smile. ‚ÄúYou mean it wasn‚Äôt because I was good in bed?‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay, that didn‚Äôt hurt your attractiveness factor, but I realized I liked you for what you are.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs that?‚Äù
Vic paused a moment. ‚ÄúSomeone who‚Äôd been knocked around by life but didn‚Äôt let it get them down. You just got back on your feet and kept punching. It‚Äôs a quality I‚Äôve always admired.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She drained her bottle and placed it in the bucket. ‚ÄúYou want to know what really drew me to you?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were the first person I‚Äôd met in a long time who didn‚Äôt want something from me because I was loaded. That didn‚Äôt impress you and I was pleasantly surprised. What really did it, though, was the night we had an expensive dinner at Ophelia‚Äôs on The Bay and you insisted on paying the check, even though I had a tab there. That really told me something about you.‚Äù
Vic placed his hand on her knee and rubbed it. ‚ÄúIt was worth it. That was the most romantic place I‚Äôd been to down here, and I was getting to share the evening with someone very special.‚Äù He laughed softly. ‚ÄúRemember the first time we went to the Mar-Vista on Longboat Key? You were meeting me there but the hostess wouldn‚Äôt let me wait at the bar because the reservation wasn‚Äôt in my name. She treated me like I was a party-crasher trying to get into a Miami Beach club.‚Äù
Ariel laughed. ‚ÄúThen when I showed up she almost lost her tan. Remember the look on her face when I asked her if she really needed her job?‚Äù
Vic‚Äôs laughter subsided. ‚ÄúYeah, I do. That told me something about the pecking order down here. I guess money really does talk.‚Äù He took a swallow before continuing. ‚ÄúKnowing what I do about you, I still can‚Äôt see you getting along with that kind of attitude.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all part of the little power games people think they have to play to impress everyone. Either you play along or you pick up your marbles and go home.‚Äù She reached over and ran her hand along his thigh. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt ever change the way you think.‚Äù
She stretched out on the blanket, crossing her feet at the ankles. ‚ÄúWhat else did you do today?‚Äù
‚ÄúI visited Derrick Bronson to see what light he could shed on things.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you catch him early enough in the day to get some coherent answers?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, but he couldn‚Äôt really tell me anything.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou know he bases most of his sleazy characters on people who live down here, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
Vic looked at her with raised eyebrows. ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt. Anyone ever get legal with him about it?‚Äù
‚ÄúA few people tried but he‚Äôs always careful to change enough details so they‚Äôre more caricature than character. One of these times, he‚Äôs going to get careless and meet an end fitting enough for one of his villains.‚Äù Ariel faced Vic and pointed her index finger at him with her thumb in the air like a pistol. ‚ÄúBang, between the eyes.‚Äù She held her finger straight up and blew imaginary smoke from the tip.
Vic laughed. ‚ÄúOkay, which book do you appear in?‚Äù
She gave him a shocked look. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember the nymphomaniac axe-murderess from Nights Can be Deadly?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat was you?‚Äù Vic asked in mock surprise. ‚ÄúNo wonder I liked that character.‚Äù
She leaned over and kissed him. Vic placed his hand under her mane of hair and massaged her neck while thrusting his tongue deep into her mouth. Ariel‚Äôs scent was natural and intoxicating, a bit of perfume mixing with her personal chemistry to arouse his senses and libido. The sound of the tide rushing onto the beach provided the perfect background music, bringing back memories of long-ago nights.
He pulled back slightly and peered into her eyes while playing with a strand of her hair. ‚ÄúYou still know how to get to me.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat goes both ways. In fact, I‚Äôm going to let you in on a little secret‚Äî I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs ever gotten to me quite like you do. Does that surprise you?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, it does. Why?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen we make love, you‚Äôre more interested in making me a part of it.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I follow.‚Äù
‚ÄúA lot of guys make me feel like a spectator. You don‚Äôt.‚Äù She brushed his cheek. ‚ÄúTo the victor go the spoils. Remember when I said that after we made love?‚Äù
‚ÄúUh-huh. Remember what I called you?‚Äù
She giggled. ‚ÄúLove Buns. I always thought it was cute.‚Äù
‚ÄúKnow why I called you that?‚Äù Ariel shook her head. Vic placed his hand on her ass and gave her a firm squeeze. ‚ÄúBecause you have the cutest butt I‚Äôve ever seen. It even looks good when you‚Äôre naked.‚Äù
She cupped his cheek. ‚ÄúThank you. Want to take your canoe for a ride?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Captain. The water looks rough.‚Äù
‚ÄúTake some Dramamine.‚Äù She kissed him again, then whispered in his ear. ‚ÄúLet me be your little plaything tonight. Anything you want to do. Just let your imagination run wild.‚Äù
‚ÄúAfter last night, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much imagination left.‚Äù
She ran her fingers over his brow. ‚ÄúLast night was make-up sex. Tonight it‚Äôs all about making love. You do remember the difference, don‚Äôt you?‚ÄùBy Joy Kyalo
The Salary and Remuneration Commission (SRC) has dismissed the health workers plea for an increment in risk allowance.
In a letter dated December 10 to the Council of Governors (CoG), SRC Chairperson Lyn Mengich said the allowances will be unaffordable.
‚ÄúAs provided for in the revised guidelines on Collective Bargaining Agreement in public service, affordability is one of the key considerations by the commission when determining parameters for collective bargaining negotiations,‚Äù she said.
According to Lyn, Counties have indicated unavailability of resources to cater for the resultant review of the CBA item as proposed by trade unions.
She advised the county public service boards to negotiate with respective trade unions with view of retaining the current rates of risk allowance up to the end of the current view cycle.
‚ÄúAny proposals to the SRC should take into account affordability and will also be subjected to pay determination principles,‚Äù said Lyn.
Striking clinical officers and nurses wanted their rates increased to sh30,000 per month.
Doctors are currently earning sh20,000 risk allowance per month, nurses sh3,850 per month, clinical officers sh3,000 and other officers sh2,000.
SRC have said that they want these rates maintained.
The Council of Governors (CoG) on Thursday urged striking health workers to understand prevailing circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and put the lives of Kenyans first at a time medical staff are demanding provision of adequate personal protective equipment to shield themselves against COVID-19.
CoG Chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya, through a statement to newsrooms said the medics are well placed to call off the strike advising them to heed to a court order suspending the strike pending a scheduled hearing of a petition challenging a planned strike.
‚ÄúAs you are all aware the doctors went to Court and Court directed that the industrial action by the doctors to be suspended pending the hearing and determination of the application therefore the doctors are well placed to call off their strike,‚Äù he said.Zaxs Original Bruise Cream ‚Äì #1 Selling Bruise Cream, Speeds Healing by 4 Days!, Reduces Pain & Inflammation, Reduces Discoloration, Ideal for Medical Cabinet & 1st Aid Kit

There are no reviews yet.The Carers Ministries Team at Rayleigh Baptist Church (RBC), Essex, are the recipients of the Queen's Award for Voluntary Services(QAVS), the MBE for volunteer groups.
The Queen's Award is given to recognise outstanding contributions to local communities by groups of volunteers. The RBC Carers Ministries Team is one of 224 charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups to receive the prestigious award this year.
The Award recognises that the volunteers within the RBC Carers Ministries Team offer effective support and time out for carers. Carers can access help on the telephone, as well as attending three different sessions throughout the month:
The caf√© started 12 years ago with small local beginnings, but has steadily grown in numbers, both in volunteers and the carers and their loved ones who have registered for support.
While part of Rayleigh Baptist Church, no one is expected to embrace their faith. The only criteria being that they are a ‚ÄòCarer‚Äô. Everyone is welcome and the support services are free and make a significant contribution to improving the well-being of adult carers and their families.
In a statement, the church said the Carers Caf√© and its satellite services ‚Äòcombat loneliness and isolation, signposting to useful contact and empowering Carers to make social connections with those who share a common factor ‚Äì ‚ÄòThey Care‚Äô.‚Äô
On being asked what receiving the QAVS means to the team, leader Georgina Biggs, said, 'Being awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service is a great encouragement to the team and gives credibility to the work we do, enabling Carers to come forward with confidence.'
When the awards were initially announced on 2 June (the anniversary of The Queen‚Äôs Coronation), Lord Petre, the Lord Lieutenant for the County of Essex, said, ‚ÄòI am delighted that the Rayleigh Baptist Church Carers Caf√© has been recognised by Her Majesty the Queen, as the winner of the Queen‚Äôs Award for Voluntary Services.
‚ÄòVolunteers at Rayleigh Baptist Church Carers Caf√© Ministries Team offer effective support and respite to carers and the support it extends to the carers and their loved ones is exceptional.‚Äô
With Lord Petre having retired in August, the RBC Carers Ministries Team received the award from his successor Jennifer Tolhurst on Tuesday, 12 September.Do [‚Ä¶]

Turkey & Blessing
Updated: Nov 25, 2020
There‚Äôs a wistful (and embarrassing) story in our family surrounding the blessing of the meal. First, let me say how thankful I am for a father who insisted we all eat our meals together at the table. And that no one picked up a fork, filled a plate, or took a bite until he had said ‚ÄúThe Blessing.‚Äù
Daddy had his own special brand on that charge. At every meal it was the same:
‚ÄúGa‚Äôlawhmakathanfufuh‚ÄôleezanallourblessinswebefuhChristsakeameh.‚Äù
Not once did it occur to me this was a sentence which could be separated into distinguishable words. ‚ÄúChrist‚Äù and ‚Äúblessings‚Äù were identifiable, but within the context, I always thought ‚ÄúThe Blessing‚Äù was an amalgamated phrase which must be said in one breath -- and very fast, before the meal got cold.
It became clear something was missing in the context the first time I was invited to Sunday dinner by my best friend, Sharon. In true mid-century Father-Knows-Best style, her dad welcomed me and invited me to say ‚ÄúThe Blessing‚Äù over the meal. Pleased to be able to share our unique, albeit unintelligible family blessing with this new host of friends, I quickly agreed. All four siblings held hands, with heads bowed, Dad at one end of the table, Mom at the other, as I recited with great gusto,
‚ÄòGa‚Äôlawhmakathanfufuh‚ÄôleezanallourblessinswebefuhChristsakeameh.‚Äù
The roar and chortled snorts that occurred was far from the praise I expected! Mr. Ryder, broke out in a hearty guffaw. He quieted the bunch, politely thanked me, then went on to properly bless the food and hands that prepared it. I was red-faced and wished I did not have to open my eyes, mortified that my family blessing was something less than effective in ensuring that the food was, indeed, blessed.
You can be sure the following morning, eyes wide open, I watched my father and listened intently as he said ‚ÄúThe Blessing‚Äù at the breakfast table. It was a few meals later before I finally had all the words properly sorted out, given his comfortably relaxed position, arms folded, head bent over his plate, and monotonal rote phrasing.
‚ÄúGood Lord, make us thankful for these and all our blessings, we beg for Christ‚Äôs sake, Amen.‚Äù
Well, who knew that ‚ÄúThe Blessing‚Äù was supposed to make sense to anyone but God!? Many moons later my sisters and I fondly came to refer to ‚ÄúThe Blessing‚Äù as ‚ÄúThe Ga‚Äôlawh‚Äù.
What exactly is ‚ÄúThe Blessing‚Äù, and How Does One ‚ÄúBless‚Äù a Meal?
We read that Jesus gave thanks and ‚Äúblessed‚Äù the bread, broke it and gave it to the disciples to feed the five thousand on a hillside. He also ‚Äúblessed‚Äù the bread and broke it when He shared the last supper with those in the upper room. What do you suppose he said that made bread so blessed it would multiply from five loaves to over five thousand? And what would bless the bread, which He Himself identified with as ‚ÄúBread from heaven‚Äù, like tangible manna that would multiply and ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the thousands and thousands of followers that would come after his resurrection?
I‚Äôve come to believe it was ‚ÄúThe Blessing‚Äù, the same blessing spoken in the beginning over Adam and Eve by God in the garden of Ed I'm thankful and blessed to be on that assignment to be fruitful and multiply The Blessing in the earth, to replenish all that is diminished by sin, hatred, disease and greed with the love of God, and that I'm learning to take territory in the spirit everywhere my feet are planted. This Thanksgiving, let's all be mindful to be fruitful and multiply kindness, joy, hope, and compassionate love, as Daddy said, "for Christ's sake, Amen."As a replacement for the much-loved mobile library, the Bass Coast Shire Council (BCSC) is proposing a 13 or possibly 36 square metre Waterline Regional Library at Grantville.
This is a much smaller floor space than the mobile library it replaces.
It is a book-collection point, not the promised ‚Äòsuperior‚Äô replacement service.
Moreover, it provides walking-distance proximity for patrons in just one town, not multiple towns.
Such a miniscule library will not attract patronage from outside Grantville. Its dimensions are not those of a regional library, instead approximating a one-town ‚Äòclick and collect‚Äô depot. Click and collect‚Äô is already more conveniently and universally provided from the current mobile library to all Waterline towns.
By comparison, Inverloch has a 192 square metre library (386 per cent higher), and Phillip Island a proposed 650 square metre library (677 per cent higher).
On a per-capita basis this equates to a Waterline regional library approximating 200 square metres, not 36 square metres.
The smaller library means Waterline ratepayers will be effectively cross-subsidising Inverloch and Cowes libraries.
The evidence suggests the mobile library service was terminated non-transparently, non-consultatively, non-partially, and in complete secrecy.
Remarkably, BCSC also voluntarily and gratuitously relinquished its ‚ÄòLiving Library‚Äô grant eligibility (valued up to $750,000) which would have preserved the mobile service.
The mobile library should be retained until such time as a 200 square metre Waterline Regional Library is constructed.
These matters are to be discussed at the Grantville Business and Community Association (GBCA) AGM at 6.30pm, Friday 20th September at the Grantville Hall. Residents interested in advancing services in their Waterline region are encouraged to attend.

But what do Korean teens think about South Korea‚Äôs makeup styles versus the American counterpart?
First the teens weighed in on the South Korean trends.
- ‚ÄúOh, the Korean lips are so pretty‚Äù
- ‚ÄúKorean style is beautiful‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love with the Korean lip color‚Äù
- ‚ÄúKorean is too beautiful!‚Äù
Then some teens showed their support for American style makeup.
- ‚ÄúI really want to try the American style!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe latter (American style) is something I‚Äôd really like to try, but it doesn‚Äôt really suit me‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI want to try the American way but I‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt look good on me‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI really like American makeup!‚Äù
While others thought both styles brought something to the table.
- ‚ÄúWow, both lips are beautiful!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúFirst eye makeup (Korean) and second lips (American).‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI like both‚Äù
And one netizen summed up both looks.
- ‚Äú‚Ä¶The conclusion is, they are both pretty!‚ÄùBut starting with action on the product‚Äôs tertiary or transport packaging ‚Äì the material that protects and ships the product in bulk through distribution ‚Äì can lead to more immediate results for packaging waste reduction and help set the operational and cultural conditions for greater success downstream when consumer compliance is needed. CPG suppliers and their retail partners have an opportunity today to make meaningful strides and quantifiable impacts on their end goals by transitioning to a reusable system for their transport packaging.
Research conducted by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation reports that 10% of the reuse potential in the plastic packaging market is from transport packaging (labeled as ‚Äúlarge rigid containers‚Äù) and from dunnage material like pallet wraps, which often can be eliminated with reusable products. When adding up the current amount of non-plastic single-use containers in CPG and retail supply chains, the reuse and waste-elimination potential skyrockets for CPG companies.
RPA member The Kroger Company provides an excellent example of the actions and results from targeting transport packaging. As part of their goal to divert 90% or more of solid waste from landfills by 2020, in route to be a ‚ÄúZero Waste‚Äù company, Kroger adopted a circular economy model by incorporating systems with reusable plastic containers (RPCs) and pooled pallets, achieving source reduction of millions of pounds of single-use packaging requiring waste management from disposal.
In carrying this foundation of waste prevention forward to their customers, Kroger just announced it will phase out single-use plastic bags and transition to reusable bags across its Family of Stores by 2025. With the operational and cultural framework in place for the reuse of tertiary and secondary packaging, Kroger is better positioned to have positive influence on customer behaviors for their reuse and recycling of primary product packaging, a key focus of the CPG goals. And this is a reciprocal winning relationship, as Mintel research shows 63% of US shoppers believe reusable and repurposable packaging is a key factor in purchasing decisions.
CPG companies can assist retailers like Kroger and expand packaging source reduction by converting their own tertiary packaging into a reusable system. The derived benefits would not just be environmental, but also lead to performance and cost-saving advantages. CPG conversion to reusable transport packaging can also spur synergies and innovations with their retail customers, such as enabling better load utilization, automation compatibilities and one-touch handling in warehouse and fulfillment centers, all minus the accumulation of packaging waste.
Conversion to reusable transport packaging systems does not have to wait until 2025, as reusable products and services are widely available and used today. And the Reusable Packaging Association (RPA) serves as a resource assisting companies at all points in the supply chain with their reusable packaging needs. When making commitments to design out waste and adopt a systems‚Äô approach for the management of materials, converting to reusable packaging for supply chain distribution of consumer products is a great place to start.

This report presents facility policies related to hepatitis C testing and treatment and hepatitis B vaccinations, based on the 2000 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities, which gathered data from 1,584 State institutions.
Abstract. At midyear 2000, 1,113,035 inmates (94 percent of all inmates) were held in facilities that reported having a testing policy for hepatitis C. Thirty-three percent of tests in facilities that tested only targeted groups were positive compared to 27 percent of those in facilities that conducted broad tests (random basis or all inmates). Of the 1,033 facilities that provided hepatitis B vaccinations, 680 (66 percent) had a policy to vaccinate inmates in high-risk groups.

Hi,
I have a question concering obtaining multiple DAQ readings from a single device. I am reading the values of several thermocouples using an NI 9213 device (which has up to 16 TC lines). In my attached Labview code, I am taking in the values of two different thermocouples (one is being used in a PID controller, the other simply measures temperature at another point and writes the data). However when I try to run this VI, I get the following error:
"Error -50103 occurred at DAQmx Start Task.vi:5
Possible reason(s):
NI Platform Services: The specified resource is reserved. The operation could not be completed as specified.
Task Name: _unnamedTask<D5>"
I know this has something to do with the hardware internal clock, since I am re-using it multiple times for different data readings, but I am not exactly sure how to get around it. I saw on a separate post that I might have to merge all the DAQ readings into one task and then run Start Task once? Is that correct, and how would I go about merging them?

Yes, I actually did a little bit of searching before asking my question. It seems that merging my DAQs into a single task should eliminate this error, but I am a little unsure how to do this.
If you look at my code, I currently have two DAQmx VIs running. One is a DAQ Assistant that is reading a thermocouple, and the other one is a Create Channel where values will be written to a counter PWM output. Both of these occur outside of a while loop, and the latter VI is the one that the Start Task VI is wired to.
In addition to these two measurements, I have several other thermocouples that I would like to read and record measurements from. I want to turn these TCs on/off at will using boolean switches, so my idea was to use sequential case structures where one task (and its error) would be wired to the next, etc. But I am unsure where to insert these additional DAQ measurements (within the while loop, immediately after I update duty cycle in my PID controller?). I thought I would have to Start my task after all of the thermocouple readings were incorporated, but since I am doing these measurements every second, would my Start Task have to be inside the loop as well? Does that work?
Or would it be easier to change my DAQ Assistant VI to read multiple channels? In that case, I am unsure of how to select which channel to read from in each of my case structures (since I have to write each reading to a different spreadsheet column every second).
I am sorry if this seems overly complicated, but my program is designed to do a multitude of things (because a complicated Labview program is UNHEARD OF).

I have actually tried reconfiguring the DAQ Assistant to now read multiple thermocouples, and I get an error saying that I must change my DAQ Read.vi (which initially only read the first TC) to a multiple-channels type of DAQ. However when I do that and select N-channels 1 sample, the output is a 1D array (which I'm assuming has the current readings from each thermocouple in an array?).
Would I now be able to select specific values using something like the Index Array function? That way all my measurements are now in the same DAQ Assistant, and I can call the values one at a time without error.

Yes. N channels 1 sample will give you a 1-D array where each element represents a channel. Index array will get you each element of the array.

'
Are we products of our environment? When it comes to German cars, the answer is an unequivocal ja! The country‚Äôs varied, challenging terrain and prevalence of speed have factored into the equation of fine cars engineered to run hard. Three days in Germany may not seem like much time, but considering some of the nation‚Äôs best cars are produced in the lower regions, you will have ample time to sample them, push them and immerse yourself in their makers‚Äô heritage.
All prices are listed in U.S. funds.
Day 1: All about the bimmers
BMW M6 CoupeYour first stop will find you at the multi-brand, multi-vehicle BMW headquarters. Just as they continuously improve their vehicles, they don‚Äôt let their facilities slip much either. BMW Welt is designed to leave a strong impression on its visitors. Pronounced velt (meaning world) the multipurpose complex promises to astound with its design and contents. This may also appease some critics who feel the historical displays don‚Äôt measure up to the superior factory tour, which even attracts non-car enthusiasts.
Being steeped in BMW culture will no doubt leave you yearning to unleash one of these incredible cars. This is understandable and the company enables you to do just that with their Driver Training series. Varying greatly in cost from about $130 to over $1,100, courses cover subjects from everyday driving safety to advanced techniques or even defensive driving for chauffeurs ‚Äî just in case. Only instead of Kevin Costner with a bad haircut, you‚Äôll learn from pro drivers who take this sort of thing very seriously ‚Äî even by German standards. After learning how BMWs are built and the proper way to experience the ride, enjoy a light bite to eat from one of the restaurant choices within BMW Welt as you reflect and re-energize for the rest of the day.
Although there‚Äôs much to see and do in Munich, our ambitious itinerary suggests we keep moving. Besides, you‚Äôll be itching to explore the M6‚Äôs capabilities, especially now that you have the driving know-how. Head out on the A9 for Ingolstadt about 45 miles north. You‚Äôll find it a charming old-world city, but tonight you‚Äôll be staying in one of its most modern buildings. Hotel im GVZ strikes a nice chord between contemporary and inviting with spacious and well-appointed rooms for about $170. Even better, it‚Äôs conveniently close to the Audi complex, where you‚Äôll start your day tomorrow.
For dinner, drive to the central city where you‚Äôll find Maximilian Restaurant at the Hotel NH Ambassador, which rewards the eye with warm tones throughout the dining area. The international and regional meals are all satisfying, but you‚Äôll really enjoy the Mediterranean dishes.
About the car: A lot of luxury coupes match their owners‚Äô profiles: sporty at heart, but a bit soft on the outside. Although the standard 6 Series is no Bavarian cream puff, the M6 manages to achieve even greater heroics. At the heart of it all is a 500 bhp V10 that launches you from 0 mph to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and swiftly reaches its governed top speed of 155 mph (rumors suggest 200 mph is no problem without the limiter) with grace and poise.
Feed your speed demon with Audi and Porsche...Yuusha Party no Kawaii Ko ga Ita no de, Kokuhaku Shite Mita (WN)
I tried to protect my ex-commissioned men.
"What are you talking about?Happiness. I'm sure I need your song.We need another push for the yuga we just saw.Duke is going home with Irene, so you can sing like a blessing.Sophia is your boss.Let him hear a beautiful voice. "
"... convinced"
I thought it would make me feel depressed, but I was easily convinced and saved my life.
Well, even if you solve everything first, you might decide to party with Happiness.
Cecilia will look into the venue and I'll go to cooking and grocery shopping.
"Why don't we stop by Raven?"
It's just noon, so let's plug in some dinner.
Go to the Knights headquarters with their approval.
On the way, I stopped by the bakery and bought a slip into Raven.
Of course, don't forget your share.
Happiness cares about Raven's health or buys sandwiches with healthy meat and plenty of vegetables.
I bought two or the same products myself.
I made a sandwich sandwiched in gravy steak.
Cecilia used to sandwich dry fruit.
I arrived at the Knights' headquarters ready to plug it in.
"... oh, did you rub someone with Raven?"
As I approached the Knights' headquarters, I saw two figures.
There's no doubt one of them is Raven, the other one doesn't know.
A little bearded uncle.
I don't think he's asking for directions.
You don't look like an adventurer, you're dressed like a fine gentleman, and you're a nobleman.
"I wonder if I can talk to you, that.Maybe we should just wait and hide until it's over. "
"That's right. If we go like this, we might break the story. Let's wait a little longer."
"... Raven"
I was about to see how things were going.
Happiness whispered Raven's name and ran into the two people talking.
I was surprised at this, but we're both hiding, so I chased Happiness.
Raven's opponent, the old man, noticed the rushing happiness and sparkled his eyes.
"This is Happiness.Thank you for saving my troupe the other day.... and then there was a voice saying that I wanted to hear Happiness sing again.I don't have to join the theatre..... "
This old man came closer and spoke fluently.
You're with the theater group Raven was talking about.
The attitude and the content of the story suffice to understand how much you are entering happiness.
Happiness suddenly got nervous and hid behind my back.
Well, I'm not good at happiness.
Let's use it as a shield.
"Hi. I'm Happiness's... brother.Something for Happiness? "
"Is this your family?My name is Westa and I am the head of a tour troupe.Could you join us in the theatre today, Mr. Happiness?I'm here to negotiate whether you can continue to appear in the form of an exclusive opening in Minerva, even if you don't want to join the club. "
This commander is desperate.
I'm convinced that Happiness' song is worth it.
Raven is struggling to cope, and Happiness is in such a state.
Let me tell you something.
"I'm sorry, Happiness."
Um, excuse me.
Cecilia took my place.
"My name is Cecilia Aquaraine.Happiness worked as a servant of the Mansion.Suddenly I was told to join the theater troupe.Happiness hasn't confirmed her intentions, so I wonder if she can respond if you can reschedule the day. "
Perfect response with care for happiness.
I have nothing to add.
You're in such a bad dress by naming yourself brother.
"I didn't know you were a servant of the Aqua Rain family... I see.We will also reschedule and hope to receive a good response at that time. "
Westa left after bowing politely.
I wonder why, I'm not good at making that smile.
There's no doubt that Happiness' song is worth it.
It's a bit confusing to leave Happiness in person...
"... thank you, Cecilia, for saving me. And the yoke."
"I just named him."
Nothing in particular.
Cecilia made it, that's all.
"I brought you a slip."
"... I see. It's been such a long time.It's not a good place to stand up. Let's go to my room. "
Take Raven to the Knight's Office.
It's like Raven's tired.
Are you busy with the Knights?
Looking at the movements of the other knights doesn't look like a busy time.
When he entered the room, Raven sat in his seat, and the three of us sat in the guest chair.
No, wait.
There are two benches for guests.
You should sit with me, Cecilia, Raven and Happiness.
Raven, why are you trying to eat lunch by yourself looking at the paperwork?
"Go ahead, Mr. Youki."
Thank you, Cecilia.
I received a sandwich from Cecilia, and I could no longer eat it.
"... nourishing"
"... thank you."
I don't think I'm particularly worried when I see you two eating your matching sandwich.
After all, the theater has become a source of concern for Raven.
Happiness is not sitting on a chair and is cheeking on a sandwich next to Raven.
Now is your chance to talk to Cecilia.
Hey, Cecilia.
Speak quietly to Cecilia.
The sandwich has already finished eating, so it does not violate the manners.
What is it, Mr. Youki?
"Raven looks a little strange.I wonder if you're worried about the troupe. "
"Happiness is involved.At first, Mr. Raven relied on Happiness.Is it good for Happiness to take a walk?Maybe you're wondering if you should push. "
"Happiness didn't sing in the theater troupe...."
I think Happiness songs are powerful.
The race of Harpy can be judged irrelevantly.
The voice is beautiful and the number of mouths is small, and the ability to express and think makes a normal conversation.
If we don't get Happiness's intentions right... we're still working hard.
However, it's different to sing as part of a theater troupe in front of many people.
"I think it would be better to do it with me in a way that doesn't come out often."
"Really? I miss Happiness from the Mansion, too, so I'd like you to stay as long as you occasionally star.Of course, it's my personal opinion, so ultimately it's up to Happiness to decide. "
"That's right. After all, no matter what people say, it's ultimately up to me to decide."
Raven and the others finished eating while we were having a private conversation with Cecilia.
Raven is looking at us like he's sorry.
"... Yoki, Cecilia. There may be a Knights in the room.I'm sorry, but I'd like to ask you to do something romantic at home with Cecilia. "
"I didn't."
"That's not what I was talking about, Mr. Raven."
We both deny it.
No, no, I was just talking to you.
I don't remember having such a hard time talking to you.
"... unconscious"
"... it seems so."
No, no, that's not exactly what I'm talking about.
Mikana also told me that I was an advanced person.
I'm just having a normal conversation., [‚Ä¶]

Evan is pretty excited about breaking in that new playset next weekend.One of the most negative results of Brasil‚Äôs much heralded Real Plan, implemented during the Itamar Franco presidency, was the establishment of some of the world‚Äôs highest interest rates. Although they were lowered to some extent during the Lula and Dilma presidencies, they remain higher than any other nation in the G20 with the exception of Argentina. In this, the fourth instalment of our partnership with Le Monde Diplomatique Brasil, Silvio Caccia Bava interviews Amir Khair about the last 20 years of Brazilian political economy, Dilma Rousseff‚Äôs fiscal austerity adjustments and the base interest rate.
Silvio Caccia Bava: Was the fiscal austerity adjustment necessary? We are talking about billions of reais in public spending cuts this year ‚Äì cuts in retirement pensions, health and education. Are these the only public spending cuts we need?
Amir Khair: The objective is to create better economic equilibrium and not to increase the gross debt because Brasil, unlike other countries, has an interest rate over this debt that transforms it into expenditure.
When people talk about the adjustments, they only consider reducing federal government spending, which is where the cuts are made, and reducing the federal taxes. This is the primary budget surplus. They ignore the issue of interest rates.
In 2005 we had the greatest budget surplus in history, reaching 3.9% of the GDP, but we also had a very high interest rate and the result was a 3.2% GDP deficit.
What is the primary outcome?
You calculate all the federal, state and county tax collection in the public sector, look at the costs and sum everything up. If you exclude the financial costs, which are the interest payments and financial revenue, you have the primary outcome. When you add the costs of interest payments and financial revenue you have the final, or nominal outcome of the public accounts. This is the main indicator observed around the world by all the institutions, the risk classification agencies,the IMF, World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, etc. The primary outcome isn‚Äôt as important as the final outcome and its twin, which is the gross debt in relation to the GDP.
With a very weak primary outcome ‚Äì as we saw in 2005 ‚Äì but lower interest rates, the result was a 2.4% GDP deficit this year, which was better than 2005. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to talk about public finances looking exclusively at the primary result, it is important to consider the primary outcome together with the interest payments, which is the final outcome. This is what alters the relationship between the debt and GDP- not the primary surplus or the interest payments alone.
The issue of interest is buried in the debate over fiscal issues in Brasil. It is hard to see any press venue outside of specialised magazines, even by people who are considered experts in the field, to talk about interest. They keep their distance because the big banks make the commands on fiscal issues.
OK, but you haven‚Äôt said if you think the adjustments are needed‚Ä¶
I think that a certain equilibrium between receipts and spending is important for a simple reason. Every time it spends more than it earns, the government issues bonds to cover the difference. When it does that it increases its spending on interest, and that is what has been happening.
Now, with the so-called adjustment underway, for which the government is struggling to reach a primary surplus of 1.2% of the GDP, the bill for interest payments will reach 7.5% of the GDP, because the Central Bank keeps raising the Selic rate, raising the interest rates that relate to the debt.
Will these spending cuts, along with the increase in the Selic and interest rates, resolve the issue of equilibrium between receipts and public spending?
No. There will be an easy to predict budget overrun even if they reach their goal of 1.2% of the GDP with their adjustments. We have a lot of debt above this. A simple calculation can show it. If the payment of the interest on the debt is 7.5% of the GDP ‚Äì and this is what we expect- and the primary surplus is 1.2%, this will cause a deficit of at least 6.3%. A deficit of 6.3% increases the relationship between gross debt- to GDP by 5 points and this is the indicator that everyone analyses.
I think that they chose a difficult path politically, because there are two types of cuts. The first is in spending that falls on the backs of the workers, reducing some of their rights. There may be abuses, but you are reducing people‚Äôs rights. The second is and cuts in benefits such as tax exemptions for businesses. Revoking these tax exemptions provokes strong resistance among powerful people who have influence over the Congress.. Many of the businessmen who finance election campaigns and put congressmen in power to defend their interests benefit from these exemptions.
There are estimates that these tax exemptions cost around R$100 Billion last year.
Yes, it‚Äôs possible. I don‚Äôt know the exact number, but it is a large amount, very large. This was made in a confusing form and the bill for these exemptions fell on the shoulders of the public retirement pension fund. It is an employers‚Äô contribution of 20% of the payroll that was eliminated and replaced with tax of 1 and 2% of their revenue. Those sectors that have a greater payroll than revenue benefited greatly, because they didn‚Äôt pass their savings on to the consumer through lower prices, they just increased their margins. If the government‚Äôs goal was to strengthen these companies it worked, without a doubt, but it was the price paid to maintain an artificial exchange rate.
What does the exchange rate have to do with this?
These companies don‚Äôt just compete with other Brazilian companies but with all of the others around the world and there has been a terrible price war underway since 2008. Companies from the US, Europe and Japan came in strongly in the international product placement dispute and are invading everywhere. When you have an exchange rate that is is out of place like Brasil has had since the Fernando Henrique Cardoso era and the Real Plan, you create a difficult situation for national companies to compete both internally here in Brasil and especially in the export market.
Does the government control the exchange rate?
The government controls the exchange rate. It is incorrect to say that the exchange rate is floating, alas, the exchange rates in the entire world are much more managed than floating. With the increase in the Selic rate the government attracts dollars and their abundance drives prices down. Today Brazil is flooded with dollars. There are around $300 billion applied in short term investments here. During the last 13-14 months the Central Bank issued around $114 billion in exchange swaps to maintain the value of the Real because, according to its vision, it should only control inflation by means of the exchange rate, which facilitates the penetration of foreign products.
What is the part that that rich and the big companies are paying in the current fiscal adjustment?
There hasn‚Äôt been one charge made on these large companies. They continue to receive financing through the BNDES (Brazilian National Social and Economic Development Bank) with interest rates that are subsidised by the population at large and they haven‚Äôt had their exemptions reversed. But these large groups have everything to lose with the economy moving slowly. This decreases their income. The current counterpart is that these large companies, in general, have fantastic cashflow generation and large financial reserves held for interesting investment opportunities. Since the investment is paralysed because there isn‚Äôt a future perspective of increased consumption, they invest in the financial market, applying their reserves in bonds and sometimes these large corporations make most of their profits from the financial sector.
Are there other strategies to confront this need to reduce public spending?
They exist but they are politically difficult.
As we all know, the communications sector here in Brasil is tied to the financial markets. It is very hard to find any criticism of the financial markets in the media.
If you work with the largest interest rates on consumption, you paralyse the country because it doubles the price of products that are bought on credit. I don‚Äôt see much possibility to move forwards and take advantage of the potential for consumption unless this anomaly of the basic interest rates isn‚Äôt changed. This affects the exchange rate and the public finances. It affects the working capital for companies that get financial bailouts from the banks and sacrifices the consumer. There are alternatives, but I am talking about another strategy.
I think that it would be intelligent to contain spending as long as you propose to work will all expense items, including interest rates. But, if you bring this to the table you will make allies and enemies.
Who would the allies for a policy that would change the interest rates be? In the first place, the labour union federations. Secondly a portion of the big companies that lose more in income than they gain in finance because they want a market for their products. Third, those companies that export, in general the large companies that traditionally export to Europe, the US, South America, etc. This group wants to see consumption. It feed on consumption and anything that strengthens it to compete abroad. This group does not want artificial exchange rates and it is clear to everyone that the current rate is artificial because of distortions caused by the Selic rate.
If the Selic rate is lowered, how high could the dollar go?
I can‚Äôt say for sure, but I estimate that it would be between R$4-R$5. I have followed this issue since 1980 and analysis shows that we are still at the bottom of the well with the current exchange rate of R$3. The historic average is above R$4.
If the Central Bank stops intervening in the exchange rate it will rise to between R$4 and R$5. With this, imported products will be more expensive and the Brazilian consumer will buy more locally manufactured goods. Companies that have more tradition with international markets will be able to reactivate their exports.
You learn a lot when reactivating exports because it is a difficult dispute. So, technology will improve, productivity will improve, innovation will improve, all through the external challenges where the fight is more complicated.
When the crisis started in 2008, the US, Japan, Europe, and China depreciated their currencies and injected money into the economy. Brasil did the opposite. It retreated. Why? Because the great mantra of the Brazilian system is the ghost of inflation. Any time a leader tries to take any other measure automatically a large racket begins, led by the banks, that says it will generate inflation.
And you can see that there are other ways of fighting inflation without increasing the Selic rate. Eighty percent of Brazilian inflation has nothing to do with the Selic. Trying to control inflation by exclusive actions of the Central Bank is a basic error of an economy in which the fiscal and monetary policies are not integrated.
I am skeptical about the possibility of lowering the interest rates, but this does not invalidate the need to start working in the social area, mainly on the impact that these interest rates have on the lives of the Brasilian people. To do this you have to increase support for society as a whole. The government never mobilised for this. It doesn‚Äôt have any strategy to confront the anomaly of the Brasilian financial market.
The current crisis is threatening productive chains such as oil and gas. Is this a passing crisis? Will we continue to develop these internal productive chains?
The policies that started during the beginning of Rousseff‚Äôs government tried to use Petrobras and Electrobras as a screen against inflation and this created a complicated financial situation for these companies, both of which had strategic plans that involved large investments that they no longer have resources to fund. Today Petrobras is behind on its payments. This effects other companies as they are forced to lay off workers and no longer see any perspective in the investments that were planned and canceled. Petrobras is straying from its large scale investments to cover its interest payments and foreign debt without the minimum need to do so.
It was a policy error to subsidise gasoline prices through Petrobras instead of the national treasury.
You said that the big fear used to justify all these cuts is inflation. Are there other ways to fight inflation other than the ones that are being used?
Brazilian inflation can be broken down into three factors, which make up the IPCA, the official indicator that measures inflation. One group is the prices that are called free, within which you have the food and beverage industry, which contributes to 25% of the IPCA. So, if you have inflation, for example, of 10% in one month in the beverage industry, it will increase the IPCA by 2.5% that month.
Another item is the service sector, which makes up nearly 70% of the GDP. This is made up by millions of companies and people, kitchen maids, drivers, manicurists, hair stylists, restaurants and so on. The service sector is strong and commerce is heavily tied to it. Services are tied to the law of supply and demand because it is a competitive market with millions of consumers and millions of service providers.
In my opinion, Lula‚Äôs greatest legacy was the entrance of between 30-40 million people into the middle class. This group wants cellphones, TVs, cars, and an enormous variety of things. It wants services, a lot of services that it didn‚Äôt have before. 40 million new service consumers created imbalance between supply and demand. This created an inflation of demand that averaged 8.5% per year, never dropping below 8%. Since services are weighted at 35%, if you do the math 35% at 8% contributes 2.8 points to the IPCA.
These prices are not controlled by the Central Bank. Service prices are set by the market and those of the food industry are controlled mainly by climactic conditions.
Finally the third group is based on the monitored prices, that is, prices that depend on government decisions at the federal, state and municipal level. What is this? Electrical energy and fuel prices are controlled by the federal government; water and sanitation prices are controlled by the state governments; and collective transportation prices are mainly controlled by the municipal governments.
Differently than the Lula and Fernando Henrique Cardoso governments, Rousseff‚Äôs government suffered from four years of punishment from the food sector. Few people talk about this. She had to deal with an inflation in food prices that didn‚Äôt depend on her and compensate for this by holding down the monitored fuel and electricity prices. Now we are seeing the results of this problem.
This years‚Äô inflation comes mainly from these monitored prices that are returning to the rates they had before they were held down.
There is a fourth group which runs outside, that is called the commercial goods. They are goods that are subject to international competition. If a company wants to increase the price of olive oil produced here, there will be oils produced in Spain, Portugal, Italy, wherever, that will compete with them. The head of household will go to the supermarket, look at the display and if there is a price increase, will experiment with another product. In this sector therefore the competition is closely tied to external factors.
Now, you don‚Äôt fight monitored prices with the Selic rate, you don‚Äôt fight service price increases with the Selic rate and you don‚Äôt control food prices with the Selic. They have nothing to do with each other and this is 80% of inflation. You only fight 20% of inflationary forces with the exchange rate and this is what the Central Bank does, playing hard with an elevated Selic rate, which attracts speculative dollars.
If you have a lot of dollars flooding in here, your currency gets stronger and this is the suicidal policy that has been in place since the beginning of the Real Plan in Brasil.
When there have been more costs than revenue in the entire context of public finance, including interest payments, what Brasil has done is simply issue public debt bonds. The Central Bank is prohibited from issuing bonds, but the National Treasury isn‚Äôt. So, the Central Bank requests the Treasury to issue them. If the Treasury were fiscally responsible, it wouldn‚Äôt do it. There has to be a limit for the federal debt. The Law of Fiscal Responsibility attempted to set mandatory limits on the state, municipal and federal governments, but neither Fernando Henrique Cardoso , nor Rousseff or Lula wanted to regulate and approve the part related to federal government spending in Congress. They wanted the freedom to increase the debt and they all defined the interest rates over these debts. If you regulate this part of the Fiscal Responsibility Law, this group will think twice whether it will issue bonds or not.
Another way to finance debt is to issue money. The government injects resources into the economy but automatically those who are against it will say that it will generate inflation because it puts more money in circulation. If it really worked that way, there would be huge amounts of inflation in the US, which nearly tripled its monetary base since the 2008 crisis. Europe, China and Japan did the same thing. Nevertheless, they are all afraid of deflation at the moment.
The monetary base of Brasil is around 4-5% of the GDP. In the world, it is over 30-40% of the GDP. With the current policy, the Brazilian government secures the economy by all possible measures and passes a huge fiscal cost onto the public sector in the order of 7-8% of the GDP, when in the rest of the world this fiscal cost of the debt is around 1-2% of the GDP.
Why don‚Äôt we do what the other countries do?
Because the government as well as the opposition and the analysts speak in the language of the financial markets, and this is what dominates in the Brazilian economy. It is rare to see an analyst make a broader level, more complete or more systematic criticism of the Brazilian economy.
Looking forwards, considering the situation that we are in, how can we get out of this downward spiral that the fiscal adjustments are inducing?
Sometimes I think that the crisis itself will show us the way. If we insist on the current path, we will finish the year with a 2% decrease in GDP. This hasn‚Äôt happened in decades and next year the estimate is for between 0-1% growth. What will be the repercussions of this be in social terms? Unemployment will increase. There will be social tension, people will react cautiously- they won‚Äôt want to buy and this will have repercussions in business profits. The social and economic situation affecting the country will worsen and could reach a point of a near rupture. We are not at this point yet because there is a little hope in the so-called fiscal adjustments.
You cannot sit calmly with the understanding that this will worsen. You have to be alert and start looking for allies in this process, and put your mouth on the trombone.
Looking for allies implies that they will be put together to deliver a minimum agenda. What is this agenda and who are the allies?
Speaking in terms of the working class, the biggest alliance is the one made to defend employment and, in second place, for improvements in salaries and benefits. With the business class, you have allies among companies trying to increase earnings. Every company wants to increase its earnings, improve its competitive position, and this improvement is tied to economic growth. This is another important ally. And finally, one ally that is rising up now with great force is civil society, the population itself that is organising and complaining about what it receives from the public sector. This group is still amorphous from the point of view of its proposals, etc, but it is a group that yells and bothers. You have to speak for this group too, which can be a marvellous ally; not a group that speaks in terms of impeachment or not, of return to the military dictatorship, but one that will toughly hold the government to task and if it tries to respond with more taxes.
In the case of Curitiba at the moment, it‚Äôs the teachers.
This is one of the strong examples. It‚Äôs very moving. This group has straight relations with the government and depends on it as salaried public workers and they vote, make noise and the social networks multiply their clamour and power. When you start having concrete things‚Ä¶ For example, Mais Medicos is an excellent government program which has started placing doctors in places that never had them before. In this way you create a favourable public opinion and the group that is against it begins to lose power. There have been a lot of experiences already made, its now a question of really putting this all into practice.

Many future students begin by checking out the medical assistant schools that are closest to their homes and then gravitate toward those that have the most affordable tuition. While cost and location are very important, such things as accreditation, job assistance and internship programs are important issues also. You may want to look into some online medical assistant programs as an alternative also (more about that later). The bottom line is that prior to selecting a college you must finish your due diligence and compare all important aspects of the schools you are assessing. And to assist you with that process, we have provided some questions that you should ask each of the colleges on your ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù list. But before we start that review, let‚Äôs briefly talk about the role of a medical assistant and the type of training and credentials that are offered.
The Responsibilities of Medical Assistants
The job of a medical assistant can be varied as well as demanding. Primarily their duty is to make sure that the Greensboro AL clinics, hospitals and other healthcare centers where they work operate successfully. Based on the size or type of facility, they can be more of an administrative assistant, a clinical assistant, or in smaller practices both. They are tasked with giving direct support to the physicians, nurses and other health professionals but can also be found performing duties at the front desk or in an office. Some of the potential duties of a medical assistant include:
- Filling out insurance forms and submitting claims
- Setting and verifying appointments
- Taking vital signs and weighing patients
- Collecting blood and other fluid and tissue specimens
- Preparing instruments and rooms for physicians
- Providing basic support during examinations and procedures
Even though Greensboro AL medical assistants may carry out almost any duty Programs and Certification
In contrast to most other medical professionals, medical assistants are not mandated to become certified, licensed, or to earn a college degree. However, a number of Greensboro AL employers would rather hire graduates of an accredited medical assistant training program (more on accreditation later ) that are certified. There are basically two options provided for a formal education. The first and shortest way to becoming a medical assistant is to earn a diploma or a certificate. These programs normally take about a year to complete, a few as little as 6 to 9 months. They are designed to teach the fundamentals of medical assisting and prepare graduates for entry level positions. The second alternative is to attain an Associate Degree, which are typically two year programs available at junior and community colleges as well as vocational and technical schools. They are more comprehensive in nature than the certificate or diploma programs, and include liberal arts courses in addition to the medical assistant courses. They usually have a idea for those who wish to advance their careers. It will not only help in obtaining a position after graduation, but it can also enhance initial salary negotiations. A number of possible Greensboro AL employers just will not hire a medical assistant that has not received accredited formal training or certification.. Additional certifications are offered also, including the CMAA and the CCMA that we discussed earlier which are provided by the NHA.
Online Medical Assistant Classes

They are a good alternative for individuals who may not have time to go to classes on campus but could fit them in if accessible at home. This is an especially good solution for students who continue to work full-time while pursuing their certificate or degree. As an extra benefit, some online schools have lower tuitions than the more traditional on-campus alternatives. Supplemental costs including those for textbooks, commuting and school supplies can be lessened as well. But remember that any requirements for clinical training or internships must still be met, but they can often be performed in regional Alabama medical care facilities. If you can learn without the formal structure of attending supervised classes on-campus, then this mode of receiving your education might be the ideal option for you. With the online classes and the practical training, everything necessary to achieve proficiency to perform as a medical assistant in Greensboro AL is provided.

Is Job Placement Help Offered? Getting that initial job can be a challenging task for medical assistant school graduates unless they have a little help from a job placement program.

It also suggests that it has a large network of contacts in the Greensboro AL area to help place students in jobs.
How Large are the Classrooms? Class size might be an indication of how much personal instruction you will get throughout your training. Small classes and classes with a higher teacher to student ratio are more prone to offer increased access to instructors and face to face interaction. If convenient, try to monitor a couple of classes before enrolling in a college in the Greensboro AL area to experience what the teaching atmosphere is like and just how much attention the students get.
Is Class Scheduling Accessible? If you plan on attending a medical assistant program while you continue to work on a full time basis, it‚Äôs essential that the college you enroll in offers classes that fit your schedule.

1. Alektorophobia

However, she does have a weakness that I‚Äôm sure will leave you surprised: Chickens. Well, you don‚Äôt really trust any chicken you‚Äôve met in life, do you? Domino does. Every. Day.I‚Äôm not sure how many battles can be lost before the war is over. I suppose it never is if you just keep fighting. Maybe one day I will change my name to Rocky or the Champ, but not yet. I‚Äôm just taking the hits and trying to get to the next day. The government wore me down and it was going to cost a lot of money for a lawyer or I needed to try a different way to fix my status here.
I‚Äôd been encouraged to go home and see my Dad by my cousins who had visited and were feeling a bit nervous about his decline. It would also be a good chance for me to get to the French Consulate and renew my Visa with the correct status. I started planning. It was going to be a world wind trip starting from San Francisco to Orange County, then to New York and end in New Jersey. The adventure would take 3 weeks and promised much missed visits and American comforts.
I would leave after the DELF results came, allowing me enough time to send off paperwork for dual citizenship. I came out of the exam feeling triumphant. I knew there was no way I was going to fail, I only needed 5 points to pass and the studying had really been showing my improvement . My French friends where telling me how much better I was writing but when the results came and I found that I failed again I couldn‚Äôt believe it and either could they. I was so devastated I couldn‚Äôt share the news out of sheer embarrassment. Since then I am numb to it, and accept that it will happen in time and vow to return to school witch can only help.
I
left France in great needed of a break and arrived in San Francisco to find I had issues with my SIMM card preventing me from having contact with anyone. It seems that when my iPhone was stolen the year before, I bought a new one that was not a ‚ÄúGlobal Phone‚Äù meaning an American SIMM card would not work and my paying to my American number had been a waste of money over the last year and a half.
I was at the Sprint store when I was told that I needed to get to the hospital in Orange County. My dad had been moved from rehab to the Hospital and waiting for my flight in a couple days was no longer advisable. He was having issues breathing and they had put a chest tube in. I never imagined in my life that I would ever walk up to a ticket counter and asked for the next ticket they had. It was like a scene a movie. Appropriate with how much my dad and I shared this passion.
I was taken directly to the hospital from the airport and spent the next several days there with exception of the Consulate Appointment witch had to happen in order for me to be able to get back into France when the trip was over. I know my Dad would tell me to go and I made the trip very quickly with no issues.
I was honored to be there with him when he took his last breathe. We were watching a movie on Turner Classic Films and I held his hand and made jokes listening to him snore like a bear making me laugh. It was our last slumber party and I felt a relief for him as he took his last breathe and knew that the pain was gone. It was not the trip I had planned and I was lucky to be there. I assured him though he was not conscious that I would not give up and continue to strive to live life fully and appreciate the gift I have.
With a new guardian angel watching over me, I pledged to come back to France and be a success. After bittersweet times with family and friends, I returned and went straight to the various offices that I already had become an expert at. I submitted my new papers and was discouraged when a typo was made calling me a ‚Äúvisitor‚Äù again and forced my way back thru the mobs of immigrants to show the documents to the security guards that awarded me the magic ticket. An appointment the next week.
It was a small victory when they agreed a mistake was made and vowed to correct it. Now I wait for their further instruction. After consulting with the various married friends I have here, I have been given a rough idea of what will come.
First there will be a one day orientation to go over the next steps. Then I will have 3 days of training on various things like French history and a test to evaluate my language skills and determine the number of hours they will school me for free. From my understanding this will not be the level I need help with and they will most likely give me a minimum number of hours to satisfy the process. But I am agree that a strong foundation and review is always a good thing especially when it is free.
After that I will be issued a new Con-joint Carte de Sejour with a questionable expiration. Until then, My Visa will be the key to the kingdom and I proudly point out the part that says ‚ÄúAutorise Travail ‚Äúmeaning I can work. As soon as the government offices were taken care of and the shopping and cleaning had all been done I began on the next real projects that will be taking my time away from Blogging.
I have committed to creating my own Tour company. Having had so much time to explore the city I have been complimented by Parisians as to the level of my knowledge and will stop offering my free tours I have gladly provide to friends and family and start making a living at it.
The idea is to have it be on both continents that way I can travel back and forth for business. Since I was fairly experienced giving tours in San Francisco and Napa, I decided that I will target the French market for this and secured my first client that will have me do a 3 day tour at the end of the summer.
I have a small support system here that I like to refer to as, ‚ÄúThe Team.‚Äù Each adds a given talent to my needs weather it is listening to my voice mail or helping with government forms. We all have them, but mine have a special place in my heart having adopted me so kindly as their pet American. One of my business savvy ‚Äúteam‚Äù members helped me to file my paperwork so that I am officially an auto entrepreneur, or what we call a self-contractor.
Of course each step of the way is a hard one. They lead to other steps, and inevitably they need additional Paperwork. Each paper I fill out is returned with three more that need to accompany it when returned, but I am still in the war.
My Social security is actually reimbursing me on small portions of bills and I was able to get a real Mammogram after a couple years and finding a doctor that speaks a little English. I suppose I am acclimating to French life. I have a an appointment with the unemployment offices in 2 weeks. Supposedly, if I attend this meeting with them, I may be eligible for some small amount of money to help me with my business. I try to see the glass as half full and keep busy and avoid being sad. I was able to end my trip to the states with a visit with my Aunt Grace who just celebrated her 92nd birthday.
I recall as a child visiting their home where her husband, my Uncle drew a picture of 3 of the dwarfs from the Snow White to represent my sisters and myself. Snow white was one of the most famous 35 mm films ever made and the first French book I bought when I started school.

Love you Allison this is beautiful thank you for sharing ‚ù§
Thanks Charlie, Hard to share sometimes, but im happy to have people like you in my life that understand. Send your Mom my love:)Class of 2019 Caldwell Fellow
At the College of Design, we have some of the best and brightest in terms of our students (faculty and alumni too). It is amazing to meet with these young individuals and learn first-hand how intelligent they really are.
I recently met with Nikki Knapp who is a freshman in the Art + Design program working towards a degree in Design Studies with a concentration in biology. Two uniquely different studies, yet surprisingly complementary. ‚ÄúBiology has made me aware of how beautiful life forms are, how complex they can be. Things like genetics are so interesting. I think the application of design and biology are not that different.‚Äù
‚ÄúI was almost not coming here (to the College of Design); I was going to Chapel Hill to study biology. Then all of these things started to show me different signs that led me to the College of Design. A TED talk about doing what you love was inspiring and I realized this was a sign,‚Äù Knapp said emphatically.
Knapp has a positive outlook and is passionate about many things. She is optimistic and excited for what lies ahead. Recently, Knapp was selected as one of the NCSU Caldwell Fellows Class of 2019. This is a prestigious award for exceptional students who excel in the areas of outstanding character, leadership potential, scholarship, and dedication to service. Twenty-five students were chosen to be part of the NCSU program and the selection process is rigorous and intensive.
Applicants were required to complete three essays, seven response questions, and submit a three-minute video on how they fit within the Fellowship program. From these submissions, 60 candidates were chosen to participate in a day-long selection process. This process included numerous 30 to 40-minute interviews that determined the 25 recipients. ‚ÄúIt was stressful but an amazing experience,‚Äù said Knapp.
‚ÄúI got to meet all the 2019 Caldwell Fellows at a retreat this past weekend. It was amazing. They all have so much substance; such a unique and inspiring group of people. We stayed up all night just talking and getting to know everyone.‚Äù
The Caldwell Fellows program invests in students who possess a passion for learning, leadership for social change, and serving others. The program is in honor of Chancellor John T. Caldwell (1959-75) and his vision that encourages scholars to ‚ÄúThink BIG.‚Äù It facilitates the opportunity for students to maximize their college experience through financial support for tuition, a stipend that provides travel and collaborative experiences, and coaching and mentoring from community and business leaders.
Recent past recipients of the College of Design include Class of 2018 Amanda Crawford (Industrial Design) and Sam Linville (Graphic Design), Class of 2017 Allison Press (Graphic Design) and Caswell Turner (Art + Design), and Class of 2016 Jocelyn Barahona (Architecture) and Bethany Faulkner (Graphic Design).
Knapp is thrilled to have been selected for this opportunity and is grateful for the chance to enhance her college experience. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm most excited about the travel. I‚Äôve not traveled a lot and the opportunities (available through the Caldwell program) are about cultural immersion. The only requirement is that we have to write a reflection which is wonderful,‚Äù she said with delight. ‚ÄúEvery summer, I‚Äôm going to get to do something and it‚Äôs going to be great.‚Äù
This summer, Knapp is taking part in a ‚ÄòMountain to Sea‚Äô backpack trip to the Pisgah National Forest and the Outer Banks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a true experience. The benefits of being grateful for what you have and the opportunity for development and leadership skills as you work as a team,‚Äù Knapp said are the reasons she selected this event.
Her reflection on the future: ‚ÄúI would love to teach. My passion would to some day be a teacher in the high school or college level. The people who have impacted me the most are teachers who have experience in the professional world and then became teachers for the love of what they do.‚Äù
As a freshman, Knapp has learned much and participated in as many activities and programs that her schedule will allow. As the member of the Design Council, which is a student-run organization within the College of Design, Knapp is the Community Relations and Outreach coordinator.
‚ÄúNikki represents the best of the College of Design ‚Äì she‚Äôs been a wonderful addition to Design Council as part of the Community Relations effort and she works hard to serve the student body in the College of Design. I‚Äôm very grateful for the privilege of working with her and the rest of the Design Council team,‚Äù stated Sam Linville, President of Design Council and sophomore pursuing a degree in graphic design who is also a Caldwell Fellow.
Her favorite class: ‚ÄúI really enjoy design thinking. While you are in it, it may not seem like it‚Äôs important and then you realize it‚Äôs so critical. We have a lot of guest lectures that allow us to see what they have accomplished and how they apply design thinking. The most important person in the room is the one who is not supposed to be there. Someone said this in one of the lectures and it struck me as so true and powerful.‚Äù
About Nikki: ‚ÄúI have a lot of passions. A big thing in my life is music. I‚Äôve played the piano since I was young and just recently, I just started writing songs. I like lacrosse and played all through high school. I‚Äôve thought about playing club or intermural but I don‚Äôt have the time. I have a little sister who is my best friend and a large part of my life. She is a junior in high school at Cardinal Gibbons. I miss her. I always thought she would be great in design because she is so creative.
Knapp is ready to take on any challenge or opportunity presented to her. She is ready to live a Designlife..With you I‚Äôm confident

Can hanging upside down from a branch, hardly moving for up to 18 hours a day, help an animal survive? In the case of a three-toed sloth ‚Äì yes !
Sloths
This strange and appealing animal, one of the most common larger mammals in New World rainforests, has a lifestyle that is unusual but that suits it perfectly for life in the canopy. It‚Äôs way of surviving is based on using as little energy as possible. That means it doesn‚Äôt need to eat as much, and it can live on leaves, which are not very nutritious.
Sloths spend mos of their time upside-down, hanging from branches by their three-inch-long claws. They even sleep and have babies in this position. Sloths eat the leaves of around fifteen to thirty different kinds of trees. But they spend most of their time in the branes of a few favorites.
Leaves are hard to digest, so sloths have special large stomachs. Their digestion takes place at the same pace as the rest of their lives ‚Äì very slowly. Food can take up to a month to pass through a sloth‚Äôs digestive system.
This is a long time, and leaves don‚Äôt supply much energy. So sloths live in ways that use up as little energy as possible. Moving little and slowly is one way to save energy. They also burn their food at a very slow rate. And they don‚Äôt keep their body temperatures as constant as most other mammals (to do so takes a lot of enery). Sloths use their surrounding to adjust their body temperatures.
Because of this, a sloth that needs to warm up after a chilly night must climb to a patch of sunlight in the upper canopy.
This warms it up, but also puts it in danger. Out in the open, a sloth has no protection. If a hungry eagle spots it, it cannot run.
three-toed sloth
The rest of the time though, down in its usual spots among the leaves, the sloth is pretty safe. It has tiny plants growing in the grooves of its hair. These plants make its hair look greenish. This color, and its very slow movements, make the sloth very hard to spot among the leaves. It tends to look more like a bunch of epiphytes than like an animal.
And in fact, for many insects, a sloth is home. Over 900 beetles have been found on a single sloth‚Ä¶and other creatures like mites and other insects also live in its fur.
A few years ago, scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama found that on of these insects, a kind of moth, not only lives on the sloth but depends on it to feed its developing young. Here is how it happens.
About once every two weeks, a three-toed sloth makes a very, very slow trip all the way down to the ground. Here it digs a hole and deposits its droppings in the hole.
At this point the moths that livein the sloth‚Äôs fur fly out and lay their eggs in the droppings. The droppings will be food for the moth‚Äôs developing offspring.Œî

Fluctuation is a problem when doubling up because when you get over fifty % of the way there, a downward tilt drags you back down, you then climb once more to eighty % then you go back again down to 60 percent.

Krav Maga is the hand to hand combat taught to the Israeli Army. It is very easy to learn and consists of simple and intuitive movements that are designed to disable an opponent as quickly as possible. If you attend and come prepared with a can do attitude we can teach you how to defend yourself from a variety of situations within a very short period of time (typically 1.5 to 2 months).
Krav Maga is focused on real world situations. It was derived from street fighting techniques, wrestling, boxing, kickboxing, judo and jiu-jitsu. By reviewing Billy Manne‚Äôs resume one can easily deduce that Krav Maga comes naturally to someone who has high level experience in all these martial arts.
Billy Manne offers something that many other trainers do not. And that is years of real world street fighting experience. Literally hundreds of street fights, as during the 70‚Äôs, 80‚Äôs, and 90‚Äôs Billy and his team were employed to clean up gangs who were threatening night clubs and residents. Of course today this no longer continues but there are not too many styles that Billy has never faced in real world situations. And he knows all about the psychology of the fight ‚Äì when to start ‚Äì how to disguise your intention or properly work an Adrenalin dump, the actual fight and proper execution of the ending.
Core Principles
Boost Your Self Confidence
Having the physical capability to defend yourself is clearly reflected in your body language and personality. You are less likely to become a target when your body language is confident ‚Äì you also become more capable of identifying trouble.
Build Strength & Flexibility
If you are training for health reasons, why not learn something that could one day save your life? Krav Maga will make you strong ‚Äì both mentally and physically.
Release Stress
Today‚Äôs lifestyle is stressful. Many hours in front of computers, often long periods of inactivity. Quite simply our bodies were designed to move and Krav Maga will provide you with a healthy physical and mental stress relief.
Learn To Defend Yourself
Learn to recognize dangerous situations ‚Äì how to prepare yourself mentally and how to actually fight. Billy does not run a pretend dojo ‚Äì you will become the best fighter you are prepared to be and you will be battle tested. Real world confrontations are rehearsed and drilled.
Billy Manne teaches Krav Maga for people living on the Mornington Peninsula including Frankston , Somerville, Seaford, Langwarrin, Carrum, Chelsea Heights, Frankston South, Langwarrin South, Bonbeach, Karingal, Patterson Lakes, and Mount Eliza suburbs.
More information on Krav Maga can be found here Krav Maga Frankston at Billy Manne Martial Arts

Behind the village is a large cavern, where the leaders of the tribe are often found.
The Witherbark trolls have made a loose alliance with the nearby Boulderfist clan of ogres against the forces of Stromgarde and Hammerfall. The ogre and troll forces have even secured and are currently in control of a section of Stromgarde itself.
By the time of the Battle for Stromgarde, the Witherbark trolls still remained active in this area and were the target of the Alliance and the Horde who wished to see them disappear.[1] Among them, Nimar the Slayer was a priority target for his dangerousness,[2] taking many fighters with him in death.[3]

LEQ11105250. Especially suited for harsh conditions and fleet cleaningFacts about knights , pages and squires. By Chloe
Monday 17th June | 3 comments
Knights had to be a page then a squire then a knight. When knights were jousting the went up to 6o mph on their hoses. Knights had several horses and different activities. Knights go to special tournaments where they fight and joust on a horse. When a king or lord taps someone on their shoulder they become a knight. it takes 21 years to become a knight. A squire looks after a knight and makes sure the knight is safe. You can be a page at the seven. Pages serve the food to the king, queen and lords. Pages sleep on the floor next to the knight that they train. Before knights joust someone measures the lances to make sure they are all same length. When a knight falls of a horse when he is fighting his squire comes and helps him to get back to the castle where it‚Äôs safe. Girls and boys can be a knight. When knight go to the toilet they don‚Äôt use toilet paper because it wasn‚Äôt invented so they used leaves to wipe their bottom. A knight is a professional soldier who fights people who try to attack their castle. A squire looked after the knights weapons and made sure they were safe. When a page trains to be knight they get piggybacks of their friends instead of riding on a horse. If a knight loved a lady he wrote poems for her and performed them for her. Knights wore shiny armour. At first a knight fights with a wooden sword and shield. Knights were used to protect the castle and fight other army‚Äôs . A boy who wanted to be a knight was taught to behave properly from an early age. Each knight has a special helmet and each knights helmet was a different size.
Well done Chloe. You have tried your best.
Look forward to reading about your favourite bits from your visit to Skipton Castle. My memory of the castle from when I was a girl was the toilet and they called it the long drop.
If your family wants to learn more about castles and knights they can visit Knaresborough Castle on Sunday 30th June where they can see knights, battle enactments and birds of prey for free.
Wow Chloe, I think not only are you like a walking encyclopaedia about Nocturnal Animals, but also now about Knights. I also thought your model of a castle was amazing. We must photograph it and put it on the blog. I hope you are looking forward to your trip ‚Äì I think you will impress the adults at the castle with your knowledge! See you in the morning ready for an exciting day out! From Mrs Fisher. üôÇTrue Faith and the Invisible World

We have a limit of time and space. it means that we are living in a three-dimension world. How can we understand over a three-dimension world?
and we have also a limit of five senses such as eyes, ears, and nose.
How can we convince what we listened, saw, and smelled?
That's why God said that my thoughts are higher than our thoughts.
We must believe in the Bible which is God's words.

Total 6
There are so many more worlds that people do not see and do not realize. While fully realizing and believing in God Elohim, who created the visible and invisible worlds through the Bible, let us become wise people who do not forget to give thanks in any circumstances and prepare for the eternal heaven of the world to come with firm faith.
Who is able to enter the everlasting world, where there's no more death but eternal happiness? In this age, you have to follow Christ Ahnsahnghong and God the Mother as long as you want to be saved. Of course, I do not mean the knowledge of Elohim God. Because even slanders also know Elohim God. We have to possess firm belief on Them. The firm belief on Elohim God will help us to do our best for the invisible world. When we are humble before God's words in the Bible, we'll be led to God's kingdom.
Amen. God recorded his thoughts in the Bible. Unless we believe the Bible, we get to ignore them, in the result, we will not be saved. Let's listen to God through the Bible and obey God's will.
True, there are so many things that humans' naked eyes cannot see, however we believe their existence. Even though we cannot see them, we can prove their existence in some ways. It is same as our God. Even though we cannot see our God, however God surely exists since we can find many evidences to prove that fact. Furthermore, faith is starting from believing what we cannot see. If you believe God's existence, you will see amazing evidences, which God left for God's people.
We have no way to reach eternal life by ourselves. But we can find the way to eternal life to get to the heaven through God's teachings in the bible. Let's see God in zion through our spiritual eyes and ears God has granted by the blood.
Yes, we live in a limited world. Our home Heaven is an unlimited world, but we cast down to this limited world because of our sins. Heaven is a world beyond three-dimension that we who are living in this limited world cannot imagine. That's why we have to follow God's words to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Let's follow God's words until the end.Discover.Our community is operating as normal. Please call or stop by for a tour. Our community is operating as normal.

The demo should be viewed on the module's Java Stdout port in a terminal window 80x24 characters. It appears more "movie-like" when viewed on the Teraterm terminal emulator, rather than on ZOC (which seems to "flicker" too much).
The Concept Board Button-A acts as a Fast Forward Button, skipping through the movie.

This week, all across America small town papers will be publishing news like this from the Benton Daily Record in Arkansas. During the first month and an half of 2005, they made 35 arrests for marijuana possession and 4 arrests for meth.
"Marijuana has been, and will continue to be, a very popular drug for every age group," Cpl. Kelley Cradduck of the Rogers Police Department said Wednesday. "Marijuana, in many respects, is a first love for many of these dopers. I still believe that the way some groups portray it, (marijuana) is still not viewed as it should be - as a dangerous drug."
A dangerous drug he says. It's a plant, a medicinal herb used for centuries in folk medicine and current scientific research around the world is reproving its medicinal value. That aside, most cannabis consumers are not violent criminals - they're responsible citizens. When it's associated with a crime, there are always multiple drugs involved, oftentimes alcohol.
But the police have good reason to go for these little busts. They are under pressure to submit statistics to some central authority and all those easy arrests are needed to justify their budget. But while they are processing the paperwork on non-violent possession of a plant - a drunk driver is getting away. Some petty thief is breaking into a car or your apartment while you're in town for dinner. In the nearest big city to where I live, people get shot every day and murdered about once a week. They make a lot of possession busts around here as well.
They can't be everywhere at once and municipal budgets are shrinking - not growing. Isn't it time to review our priorities on what constitutes crime?
In Benton County there will be 35 non-violent marijuana cases clogging the law enforcement system. The police won't be able to investigate your break-in while they're in court testifying and they will have that much less time to investigate violent crimes.
This is the money quote from Benton County:
Cradduck agreed with Allen's assessment. "I think meth is more prevalent than those numbers are telling, but it is harder to catch," Cradduck said.
Exactly, but it presents more of a concern to the community. It's not going to get any easier to solve if they keep spending billions of your tax dollars on taking penny-ante marijuana possession cases through the court system.Article writing providers are typically tailored produced.

As you would expect, you are taught about past successful companies, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how they succeeded.‚Äù They teach you about great business leaders, people who have succeeded. You are taught how to do business planning in order to optimize your chances of success, and they teach you how to finance your attempt at success. In effect, signing up to be a business or finance major is an act of self-determined success, and the entire system is a culture that naturally values, and in effect worships, success.<br><br> <br><br>Here is the rub: new value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything you are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering. Allow me the time to explain how this is so, why it matters, and what we should do about this situation. I promise you, in its entirety, the following is something you‚Äôve never heard before, and the ramifications of ignoring the advice herein most assuredly leads to unhappy software engineers. As an industry, we've been perpetrating the same management mistakes on developers for several decades now. It's either time to fix this problem or be disrupted by those that already have. <br><br>The shortest of management histories as to how we got here, in 3 parts<br>Traditional management often fails software engineers for honest reasons that have to do with the essence and root purpose for the existence of management, and certain gaps which are yet to be filled by management theory, educational systems, and practices. To understand these gaps which manifest as systemic failure that negatively impact software engineers and other creative types, we must first understand the problems that our current management systems were created to solve.<br><br> <br><br>There are three dominant forms of management, two are well known, but the third is barely known or understood at all, and all three are critical to the realization of value. In historical order by which they were discovered is Financial Management, Business Management, and Creative Management. The next three sections are a short summary of the three dominant management systems, the problems they overcome, and the type of value for which they were invented to govern. To best understand why CEOs are failing software engineers, the essence and properties of these three forms of management must be clearly understood.<br><br> <br><br>Part 1, Financial Management (aka. Liquidation Management to govern Liquid Value)<br>The problem being solved in 1602 was the vast need for cash to build more ships. Namely, how was The Dutch East India mercantile company going to fund the effort to meet the high growth and high demand for Asian silks, spices, coffee, tea and wine. The answer came in the form of modern capitalism, granting shares in the enterprise to the public in exchange for cash to build more ships and hire more crew. It worked beautifully, the funds began to flow in from the newly formed public market, and the Dutch East India Company quickly became a powerhouse in global trade.<br><br> <br><br>This was the nexus moment of the birthing of the financial industry and financial management. But our take-away from this historic moment is as follows: think of public markets as a management system for transmuting value; ergo, financial management was formed in order to optimize the transformation of one form of value (coin/gold/cash) into another form of value (tangible and intangible assets: ships, companies, recipes and patents) that have a higher return or fulfill a deeper purpose, and when desired, to liquidate said investments back in to cash to invest in the next highly valued venture. The purpose of Financial Management is to manage liquidity, and its practices are to conserve, develop and exploit cash, usually in the form of investments or loans. Therefore, this type of management is better thought of as Liquidation Management as it primarily manages the liquid form of value that we typically refer to as cash.<br><br> <br><br>Liquidation management is naturally return-on-investment (ROI) oriented. So, the most natural way to motivate effectiveness in this type of work is to give financial team members a small stake in any higher than expected returns achieved, and a small piece of cash efficiencies achieved. This is usually done by establishing reasonable financial targets with corresponding bonuses.<br><br> <br><br>Part 2, Business Management (aka. Replication Management to govern Replicated Value)<br>In the 1890s, as a result of the electrification of cities and an abundance of cheaply manufactured steel from pig iron, the world was in the midst of the second industrial revolution. Rapid growth was being fueled by sprawling railways, a swiftly expanding electrical grid, and an abundance of factories powered by an array of newly created, electrically powered equipment.<br><br> <br><br>The over-arching problem being solved by Fredric Taylor and Henry Gantt was the absence of an effective and reliable system to manage industrial work, particularly manufacturing. The problem was three-fold:<br><br>Incentives were wrong ‚Äì workers got paid a small flat fee for the day without respect to productivity, even when the equipment wasn‚Äôt working which was occasionally viewed as a feature by the crew<br>Work practices were wrong ‚Äì each man did his job as he felt best without respect to the sustainability, effectiveness and needfulness of motion which often resulted in ‚Äúslack,‚Äù down time when either the equipment or labors could not work<br>Management was clueless ‚Äì management practices tended to be governed by friends of the elite who never learned to do the actual work, pushed what work they had downward, and managed badly from abstraction<br>The solution came in the form of Fredric Taylor‚Äôs ‚ÄúScientific Management.‚Äù A system of management which leverages time and motion studies to establish sustainable, documented best practices for all workstations in the factory. Given established best practices that were timed by Taylor using a stopwatch, reasonable production quotas could then be enacted, which if achieved, as Gantt proposed, should result in bonuses for both management and workers. As a side benefit, factory output and time-to-delivery of an order could be calculated with a high degree of precision. Thus, given established times for known work practices, uniform materials and known recipes/designs, reliable master planning was now possible.<br><br> <br><br>The combination of establishing sustainable best practices that are easily trained (Taylor), and aligning incentives based on known, reasonable, production goals (Gantt) worked astoundingly well. Before and after results documented by Gantt in his book, ‚ÄúWork, Wages and Profits,‚Äù showed as much as a 300% improvement in factory productivity by using Taylor‚Äôs system of management.<br><br>As it turns out, adoption of a scalable management system which has actual improvements in results is a big deal.<br><br>The system worked so well, that Gantt was solicited by the military to help with ship and munitions production. The corresponding increase in ship production and factory output proved to be beneficial to the United States as it entered World War I, and arguably, subsequent improvements in production over the following 21 years were, in large part, responsible for winning World War II. As it turns out, adoption of a scalable management system which has actual improvements in results is a big deal.<br><br> <br><br>This was the nexus moment for modern business administration and the birthing of management science. But our takeaway from this historic moment is as follows: scientific management is a system that takes known recipes and practices and transmutes them into valuable (desired/needed) replicated goods; ergo, business management was formed to effectively replicate known value, and known recipes, using best practices, elimination of waste, and high-quality predictive planning.<br><br> <br><br>As replication work is naturally date driven according to expectations set with the customer during the sales process, the best way to motivate staff to do this repetitive, labor intensive work, is to provide them a bonus for achieving or surpassing reasonable production goals that were set to meet the demand, and to align management incentives to the production goals such that management is incentivized to help the staff achieve their time-boxed goals.<br><br>‚ÄúEngineering management is largely taught as a specialized form of business management, whereby much of the same thinking used to optimize manufacturing, unfortunately, gets applied to creative pursuits such as software engineering and product design.‚Äù<br><br> <br><br>Part 3, Creative Management (aka. Creative Management to govern discovery of New Value)<br>As liquidation management (finance) emerged out of the need to fund new ventures, and replication management (business management) was formed out of the need to scale production of replicated value, similarly, creative management has naturally emerged out of the need to scale the discovery of new value.<br><br>What is Creative Management? Creative management is one of three dominant forms of value management. Its purpose is to establish a system of management that enables and motivates creative staff, such as software engineers, writers, designers and artists, to discover and realize new works of value. Creative management is also the lead system in new ventures and productions, having been established to optimize the discovery and realization of previously undiscovered value in the form of new works, new productions and new solutions.<br><br>However, we have not yet had a nexus moment for creative management, though elements of successful creative management systems are beginning to emerge as modeled and practiced in several recent tech companies. Traditionally, engineering management has been the concrete expression, or proxy, for creative management applied to technical endeavors. However, engineering management is largely taught and practiced as a specialized form of business management, whereby much of the same thinking used to optimize manufacturing, unfortunately, gets applied to creative pursuits such as software engineering and product design. This approach to engineering management is the natural extension to Taylorism; but applying replication management techniques to creative work is a systemic mistake that actually disadvantages companies that are developing software ‚Äì this is because the skills, workflows and founding principles for discovering new value are almost entirely different from those needed to efficiently replicate value. Whereas replication management is focused on transmuting recipes and ingredients (discovered value) into replicated goods (replicated value) by a committed date, creative management is passionately attempting to discover new recipes, to meet unmet needs, through a series of value attempts, most of which fail. Therefore, the purpose of a creative management system is to find previously unknown recipes (unknown value) and transmute it into discovered value ‚Äì new recipes and new ingredients.<br><br> <br><br>Since at present, we have no formalized understanding and teaching regarding the role of creative management, we must look to empowered creative leaders of dominant companies to understand the practices and policies that best fill the creative management void. It is these types of leaders that have the power to setup supporting management systems that best enable creative staff, such as software engineers, to do the work of discovering new value. In alignment with management systems theory which postulates that management most know how to do the work, virtually all of the leading technical companies that are creating new value and transforming the world are led by people who have professionally done the work of creating new things for several years. It‚Äôs also interesting to note that many of these leaders are software engineers. Though this is only correlation, not causation, it does strongly imply that the skill set needed to create new value (new recipes, new designs, and new solutions) is significantly different than the skill set needed to replicate or liquidate existing value.<br><br> <br><br>The problem being solved by empowered creative leaders, the true proxy for a creative management system, is how do you best motivate and enable your staff to rapidly discover new value? Their systemic solutions are too extensive to document here; but in brief, know that the systems these creative leaders have put in place proceed out of who they are as creative forces:<br><br>‚ÄúMove fast and break things‚Äù ‚Äì Zuckerberg<br>‚ÄúEvery day is day one‚Äù ‚Äì Bezos<br>‚ÄúIf you're changing the world, you're working on important things. You're excited to get up in the morning.‚Äù ‚Äì Page<br>‚ÄúWe do lots of Stuff. The only way you are going to have success is to have lots of failures first‚Äù ‚Äì Brin<br>‚ÄúWhen something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.‚Äù ‚Äì Musk<br>‚ÄúSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.‚Äù ‚Äì Gates<br>In summary, though system embodiments vary, the above quoted creative leaders share the following creative system principles:<br><br>You learn by failing, and new value comes from a critical mass of new learning<br>So, fail often, fail quickly, but fail smartly (failure without learning is waste)<br>Build platforms, practices and cultures that help people discover value<br>Relentlessly discover new value, even when the odds are against it<br>Empower your creative staff to transform the world by solving meaningful problems<br>Practically speaking, these creative principles take the form of equipping and empowering teams to make a series of rapidly evolving value attempts. These value attempts are passionately revised and improved upon until a candidate solution achieves market traction. Thereafter, additional features may be added to the solution to facilitate deeper market penetration. The work of the creative team is deemed to be successful when the end user needs are reliably satisfied by the new solution.<br><br> <br><br>In order to maintain and foster creative motivation throughout the creative process, many of these leaders employ some form of shared conception, a desire to pursue a common compelling need, which forms a strong shared attraction. There are four elements to these strong attractors:<br><br>Need ‚Äì a thing that needs to be created, something that‚Äôs missing from life<br>Belief ‚Äì belief it can be created, that the idea is possible, even viable<br>Opportunity ‚Äì a career opportunity to create that thing, a chance to do it<br>Anticipation ‚Äì shared anticipation of the better, envisioned future<br>These elements form a strong attractor and shared conception is the practice of sharing and iterating the same strong attractors with investors, customers, creative staff and management, thereby aligning customers, staff and management on a set of highly anticipated emerging solutions. Not surprisingly, this form of creative motivation is often present in Silicon Valley startups, including many of the dominant companies established by the leaders quoted above.<br><br>How do you best motivate software engineers? You attract them to significant, life changing work by elevating the need, the thing that's missing from life or society, a problem that needs to be solved, and extending a personal, creative opportunity to solve that problem. Software Engineers are motivated to solve epic problems with solutions that people love. Continuously communicating to them the "why?" is critically important. Knowing why enables software engineers to evolve technical solutions that best fit customer needs.<br><br>The best way to motivate creative staff is to attract them to meaningful work through the use of strong attractors. Sure, you must also pay creative staff well enough to meet their standard of living; but, as Maslow points out in his theory of human motivation, beyond physical and safety needs, people have a need for esteem, recognition, and actualization. Just having a real possibility of meaningfully fulfilling these higher order needs is enough incentive to strongly motivate the heart and minds of most creative workers, even in the presence of pressure and adversity which often accompanies the solving of difficult problems through intense periods of failure. All greater transformational works of value are, necessarily, sustained by this type of motivation.<br><br> <br><br>It is important to understand, when motivating software engineers and creative staff via the use of strong attractors, that all four elements must be present. In other words, the staff must believe in your vision, and the envisioned solution or outcome must actually be viable. There necessarily must be a real opportunity to actualize the envisioned product or service, and the staff must catch the envisioned outcome such that they share your anticipation of that better future. When any of the four elements of a strong attractor are missing, the staff‚Äôs motivation will be crippled, resulting in under tones of creative drifting, frustration, apathy and possibly even despair. Therefore, it is super critical to have viable strong attractors that are in pursuit of a real opportunity and genuine needs.<br><br> <br><br>Three Types of Management for Three Types of Value<br>Our takeaway from the above history is that there have been three dominant forms of management. Each naturally proceeding out of the type of value they manage, and each having their own optimal practices and associated means of motivation.<br><br> <br><br>In order to avoid making the same systemic management mistakes, I have become convinced that it‚Äôs super important to understand our history (how we got here), namely that value is an organizational force that resulted in the creation of our existing management systems, and yet we must learn from our emerging future which is driven by the discovery of new value (where we are going), lest we are doomed to amble around in our ignorance. Before proceeding to advice regarding what CEOs can do differently to better support their software teams, let‚Äôs be certain we are on the same page regarding our understanding of value and where we are going. For the sake of brevity, allow me to just blurt out the obvious observations:<br><br>Firstly, for our purposes here, let‚Äôs agree that: value is the reliable fulfillment of unmet needs without mitigating-levels of chaos<br><br>Let‚Äôs also agree that dominant management systems are a derivative of the nature of value<br><br>That value comes in four forms: undiscovered, discovered, replicated and liquidated<br><br>That value (the fulfillment of unmet needs) is achieved by transmuting value through each of the four states using the three dominant forms of management systems<br><br>Each value transformation system has an input value type and an output value type<br><br>That these value transformation systems have their own unique forms of work and motivation<br><br>That the 3 value systems form 1 value fulfillment cycle (solution fulfillment, order fulfillment, cash fulfillment)<br><br>It is this big picture, which as management, we are working to refine, filling in the gaps, and perfecting its practices. Namely: value is the net result of a value fulfillment cycle comprised of:<br><br>3 types of management systems<br>working together to transmute 4 types of value<br>by discovering products and business solutions<br>that reliably meets customer‚Äôs needs<br>without chaos<br>The tip of creative management is learning to think of the value fulfillment cycle functionally as a high velocity change engine that takes value attempts often in the form of minimal viable products and design studies, having some associated customer development (see Steve Blank, customer development) effort running in parallel with the engineering/solution effort.<br><br>What is the value fulfillment cycle? The value fulfillment cycle is the process by which unknown value is discovered, replicated, and monetized. This value-oriented process is at the core of all businesses and consists of connected workflows that serve three separate functions: solution fulfillment, order fulfillment, and cash fulfillment. The overarching cycle is overseen and governed by three dominant management systems: creative management, replication management, and liquidation management ‚Äì traditionally considered to be creative/engineering, business, and financial management. Each of the three value management systems have differing practices and a differing means of motivation that directly tie back to the type of value they are transmuting; yet all three must work together in order to effectively realize value.<br><br>This sort of value-oriented thinking is driving creative management to actively automate and commoditize the value fulfillment cycle. In so doing, they are breaking down classically siloed constraints that slow down the discovery of value. Why? Because these silos, often the result of department-oriented thinking, have the effect of slowing down realization of value by serializing the discovery of value, discovery of chaos and discovery of customers. So, to break down these silos, in part, many of the mentioned creative leaders are empowering small teams of creative staff to swing for the fences (doing the full value cycle) on big, important problems, and they are having a great deal of success. Because, as it turns out, having an over-arching management system that reduces the time it takes to discover and actualize value is a big deal.<br><br> <br><br>How are CEOs failing software engineers?<br>First, many companies are lacking an effective creative management system, and from the above history lesson, we can correctly infer that healthy companies are always a combination of the three dominant types of management. For example: every exceptional restaurant has an executive chef to do the creative work; hosts, waiters, porters and line chefs to do the replication work; and, an accountant to effectively cashflow the enterprise. To stay healthy, all three types of management must be empowered to hold each other accountable to the pursuit of satisfying the needs of the customer.<br><br> <br><br>We also know that companies that do not have an effective creative system either die over time, or they are tied to another entity that is doing the creative work. Sure, there are some exceptions; but in general, if you are lacking a thriving creative management system, you are definitely impeding the discovery of new value, and you become a prime target for what Clayton Christensen termed as ‚Äúdisruptive innovation.‚Äù This is essentially the process whereby market leading companies are gutted by smaller entities that are discovering new value at much higher rates than traditional companies. Stop and consider for a moment, ‚Äúwhat happens when larger companies with more funding figure out how to stay disruptive by using creative management systems that empower lots of small teams?‚Äù Of course, there are several tech companies that are doing this now, and they are disrupting traditional businesses at an exponentially, increasing rate. This is due, in no small part, to their successful creative management systems.<br><br> <br><br>Considering the above history again, it should be clear that not having an effective creative management system is a huge gap in the value fulfillment cycle. If this gap remains unaddressed, the market will solve the problem by investors, over time, moving their money to entities that are discovering new value at higher rates. So, if you have this kind of systemic void, it‚Äôs really in your best interest to address the gap as soon as possible, and I would encourage you to give some serious consideration to empowering an effective creative management system.<br><br> <br><br>Also, as it turns out, the three things that software engineers overwhelmingly want from management, when asked, is for management to:<br><br>Provide a clear sense of purpose, vision and mission<br>Invest in my growth by having opportunities for advancement<br>Grant autonomy and delegate authority<br>In other words, software engineers want to function in small empowered teams that are hotly pursuing meaningful value which could potentially transform their community, the company, and their lives into some epic, next level thing. When you think about their response, it kind of sounds like the basis of an effective creative management system that pursues new value. That‚Äôs likely because many software engineers are, at their very core, creative staff that yearn to pursue new value and, given their answers, they are in effect begging management to provide the big-picture charters under which they can actualize their creative force. My advice to you is to let them do it. But it is critical that these teams have a clear mission charter and budget, and that they also have the supporting roles needed to succeed embedded in the team itself.<br><br> <br><br>Second, new value (fulfilling previously unmet needs) is the by-product of applied new learning that is gleaned from an often-painful series of individual- and group level- failed value attempts. To put some meat on better understanding this point, new products that truly address new points of need (new value) aren‚Äôt a function of time and money; instead, they are the result of learning from hundreds of small failures that must necessarily occur in the pursuit of discovering a new solution (new value). When Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook‚Äôs mantra, ‚Äúmove fast and break things,‚Äù he was simply giving his team permission to learn quickly by unleashing tens of thousands of value attempts. In point of fact, most smaller products are the result of hundreds of failed individual value attempts and dozens of failed group level value attempts, and large products and services are the result of tens of thousands of failed individual value attempts, and hundreds of failed group level value attempts.<br><br> <br><br>Given this understanding, I have five points of advice for CEOs of companies that do software engineering:<br><br>Since learning from failed value attempts is the only path forward to discovering new value, our goal must be to get the cost of failure down (not the number of failures), and the rate of learning up. One of the easiest way to achieve this goal is to get the size of the teams down by investing in individual and small team level value attempts.<br>The next thing to do is make sure your teams have the research, promotion, and analysis skills that are needed to rapidly discover actual need, and to rapidly test and learn from their solution attempts. Lacking these skills, your teams may never discover industry changing value as their rate of learning will simply be too slow to compete.<br>Next, invest in platforms and tools that speed your team‚Äôs ability to make value attempts. Why? Because, often a platform can help with customer discovery and doing solution promotion, as well as gathering the metrics needed for learning and analysis, all of which can amazingly increase the speed at which your teams discover value. Since you are going to be making a lot of low-cost value attempts, you really should invest in automation that speeds value discovery.<br>When discovering new value, drive to value; when scaling discovered value, drive to date. Meaning: don‚Äôt gate value discovery by setting arbitrary release dates. In effect, a release date is nothing more than saying to the team, ‚Äúwe are going to give up on discovery of the actual needed value by <insert arbitrary date here>.‚Äù Of course, that‚Äôs nonsense. Also, dates don‚Äôt increase the rate of learning from failure; they in fact have the opposite effect, the team will be much less likely to discover the value needed as they will actually increasingly fear failure as the date approaches, and they will therefore slow down the rate at which they are breaking things, which effectively puts an end to new learning ‚Äì no more bugs found, no more value found. If the customers need hasn‚Äôt been met yet, it‚Äôs just a huge waste and confusing to all involved to release something that doesn‚Äôt actually meet the need. It‚Äôs even worse to release something by an arbitrary date that has the appearance of meeting the need but is riddled with business risking- or life risking- levels of chaos.<br>When motivating the team, the correct motivation pattern to apply to the discovery of new value is shared conception using strong attractors. Go back and reread the creative management section regarding motivation, it‚Äôs worth a second look, if not a third.<br>Here‚Äôs the most important bit of advice to CEOs and leaders of software teams<br>Some people think, in order to best foster a creative learning culture, you should celebrate failure; personally, that‚Äôs a bridge to far for me. But, at a minimum, you must at least endure failure, and if it‚Äôs possible for you, full-on embrace the failure that‚Äôs always associated with discovering life changing value.<br><br> <br><br>I promise (take me up on this), that if you set out to fail every day by taking truly new and different value attempts from which you learn, at the end of 90 days, you will have a small pile of new value. It‚Äôs just impossible to fail that much, unless you‚Äôre not learning, and not discover some truly new bits of value. Even better, if you and your favorite team of 50 engineers do the same exercise of taking value attempts for 90 days, and you aggregate those bits of value together along the way, you quite often have the basis for an industry leading product or service that you might even spend the rest of your career improving and delivering, and the world would be a better place for you having done that.<br><br> <br><br>Personally, I am still shocked by the number of times I consider my failed value attempts to be waste. I am also appalled by the number of times that I deliberately avoid starting from a blank page; instead, I almost always reach for the safety-blanket of Google in hopes of finding someone else‚Äôs work to leverage ‚Äì an existing known, good, starting place. It‚Äôs as if, deep down inside, I am ardently, even violently, trying to avoid the failure that comes hand-in-hand with starting from a blank page. Perhaps you can relate to the thought, ‚Äúwhy waste time starting from a blank page when you can be way more successful starting from some known good place?‚Äù The truth is, ‚Äúnew‚Äù necessarily means you better not be able to google your idea, because if you can, it isn‚Äôt new, right? Yet, in place of embracing failure by taking new value attempts, I find myself starting out each new day doing something that I already know, a thing that I'm already good at, because that makes me feel valuable.<br><br> <br><br>This is best referred to as failure avoidance syndrome, and I promise that, as CEOs or leaders, we have a bad and almost creatively lethal dose of it.<br><br>What is failure avoidance syndrome? Failure avoidance syndrome is a common and even normal sociophysiological condition that causes us to associate productivity and value to the completion of known tasks, while avoiding attempts that will likely lead to failure. Failure avoidance is, straight-up, a combination of success conditioning and brain chemistry, and it leads to us feeling that starting from a known good place is more valuable. This phenomenon is due, in no small part, to how our brains, in response to the thrill of successfully completing a rewarded task, releases euphoric chemicals that strongly reinforce the behavior that led to success. Conversely, the disappointment and menace often associated with failure results in our brains releasing a different set of chemicals that act to dissuade us from making additional mistakes (even, and especially, new value attempts) that might threaten our safety, social acceptance, and well-being.<br><br>The net effect of our success-based conditioning and our natural brain chemistry is failure avoidance. In other words, discovery of new value is actually safe guarded by a sociophysiological curse that most commonly manifests as a natural, strong aversion to failure. However, when doing creative work, we must find positive ways of pushing past the chemically reinforced sense of waste and failure avoidance.<br><br> <br><br>This necessarily means that the journey of discovering life changing value requires us to endure large amounts of failure. For me personally, I‚Äôm learning to embrace the failure of taking daily value attempts versus comfortably filling my days with planned success; it‚Äôs a big step, but one that I‚Äôm committed to doing.<br><br> <br><br>In summary, for better value discovery results:<br><br>Empower individuals to take daily value attempts<br>Use light weight value attempts and amplified learning<br>Drive to value, not to date<br>Seed your creative teams with research, promotion, and analysis skills<br>Avoid forcing individuals into the same ways of thinking about a problem<br>Encourage your creative staff to move fast and break things<br>Embrace failure, celebrate learning<br>Personally, fail more often. If you‚Äôre not failing, I promise you, you aren‚Äôt learning, and you‚Äôre therefore likely not leading your industry either, seriously.<br>Regarding the institutions who are setting up management to fail software engineers<br>Listen up Ivy League educators and macro economists. Take note of the three (not two) types of dominant management systems. Whereas you can align the motivation of workers and management within the same type of work, aligning motivations across types of work (such as replication to creative) that are dissimilar in nature using the same incentives isn't a thing. It doesn't work. It can't work. It's confusing, frustrating, and demotivating when a system of management is ignorantly applied to a type of work that it cannot possibly, effectively govern. Yet, as a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô society, we've created a prevailing global management system that perpetrates this offense repeatedly. Just stop it. Seriously, it‚Äôs ineffective, it‚Äôs upsetting to your developers and creative staff, and in the long run, it‚Äôs in no one‚Äôs best interest.<br><br> <br><br>While you‚Äôre at it, go back to your management textbooks and curriculum and write in Creative Management, and go back to your economic models and factor discovery of new value into your theories of economic growth. Also, many of you need to go back to your companies and apologize to the developers and creative staff to whom you aren‚Äôt listening.<br><br> <br><br>In closing, if you are genuinely interested in speeding the realization of value, spend some more time studying value fulfillment theory: the cycle by which unknown value gets discovered, replicated, and transmuted into cash. And then, consider reorganizing your company to unleash the creative force of your software engineers.<br><br> <br></div><br><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_attr">On Mon, Sep 21, 2020 at 1:23 AM Mike Spencer <<a href="mailto:mspencer@tallships.ca">mspencer@tallships.ca</a>> wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex"><br> > <a href="" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><br> ><br> > Any comments?<br> <br> 100% javascript page, no text.

Even I must admit, as a former skeptic, I now really enjoy my air fryer. I mostly employ my air fryer as the a perfect tool for roasting vegetables and not for heating frozen foods ‚Äî but that's a story for another day.
One other great feature of an air fryer: They're super easy to clean.
We've got a few tips for cleaning an air fryer but before we get too detailed here's the TL;DR: dish soap and water. That's the best and most basic method of cleaning that will remove any grease and grime from your air fryer.
Really that's it. Just wash your air fryer with dish soap and water and you'll be good. But we've got further advice below to help you with the details.
1. Remove the basket and wash
Now, each air fryer is a bit different, but the general construction typically includes a pull-out drawer with an inset basket or grate to hold food. These components are typically made of nonstick material. You'll want to remove the drawer and basket/grate and hand wash it all with soap and warm water. It's important you use a sponge or soft cloth ‚Äî absolutely nothing abrasive. You don't want to pull up any of that nonstick material.
Now the good news: typically speaking, this is a super simple process. Because the components are nonstick, the food should come right up. If something is really stuck, I try to use a fingernail or paper towel to get it off, again, doing my best to not scratch the nonstick surface. For the model I own, this whole process takes a couple of minutes, at most. I make sure to clean it after every single use to avoid any gunk build-up.
Then you simply dry the basket and drawer and you're all set to go for the next time you air fry.
You may be able to load these parts of your air fryer in a dishwasher as well. Make sure to research your specific model to see if it's recommended. If you do use a dishwasher, be sure to load the components carefully so the nonstick surface is not damaged.
2. Clean the heating element and interior
Now, this step isn't necessarily something you'll have to do after every use. But every once in a while you'll want to clean the interior of your air fryer where the cooking drawer is inserted..
3. Clean the exterior of the air fryer
How do you clean the outside of an air fryer? Huge surprise coming: soap and water with a sponge or cloth. Just wipe it down, dry it off, and get on with your life. I also sometimes use a disinfectant wipe if that's what I've got lying around. Since it's just the exterior of the appliance and not where you'll cook, it doesn't do any harm.
So there you have it, that's all you've got to do to clean your air fryer.Description

Matt McCauley used to lay down three grooves at a time racing his DN but has backed off on the ice sailing to focus more on the low end of things- specifically the bass. Similar to the DN as it is made of wood and kind of hard to transport but lots of fun to play with once you get it set up.
Presumably he is only laying down one groove at a time these days, unless of course he is getting into some complex polyrhythmic stuff- you never know with these jazz cats‚Ä¶.
The former NEIYA Commodore was spotted playing in a jazz trio during an art show at the Guilford, CT Art Center. He was last sighted at the DN Gold Cup in Kingston, ON where he won a brand new North FO-1 sail- Glad to see him out and about and playing up a storm- hope to see him on the ice this winter!

Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC), with the funding support of the Innovation and Technology Fund of the HKSAR Government, had partnered with the Hong Kong Society of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to organize the Hong Kong Forum of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (HKFAIR 2021) recently.
HKFAIR 2021 brought together leading experts in AI and information technology from Mainland China and Hong Kong, featuring six academy fellows including Professor Tan Tieniu, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Vice Minister of the Liaison Office of the Central People‚Äôs Government in the HKSAR, who along with 18 experts and representatives from world-renowned companies shared on the latest development and innovative applications of AI technology covering different sectors.
Willy Lin, Chairman of HKPC, said in his welcoming address, ‚ÄúHKPC strives to help Hong Kong businesses to achieve digital transformation with diversified R&D services, enabling enterprises to accelerate reindustrialization with ‚ÄòIndustry 4.0‚Äô and ‚ÄòEnterprise 4.0‚Äô to overcome adversity and can plan for the future. AI and robotics technology are one of the areas in the National Key Technologies Research and Development Program. Hong Kong not only possesses internationally-recognized R&D results but also plays a unique role as the ‚Äòsuper connector‚Äô in the development of GBA. All these will certainly expedite technology and industry upgrading. HKPC is also active in collaborating with local and overseas R&D organizations to promote the wider relevant applications in Hong Kong and GBA for the development of smart industries to create new impetus for the economy.‚Äù
At the opening ceremony, Yang Qiang, President of HKSAIR, said, ‚ÄúThere is no need to explain the importance of AI and robotics technology as we are at the center of the technology revolution era. HKSAIR aims to promote the successful local application of AI and robotics industry and serve as the bridge and catalyst between academia and industry, and between Mainland China and Hong Kong development. We hope to leverage the forum to foster closer cooperation among distinguished professors and outstanding entrepreneurs in Hong Kong and GBA, conjuring up a local AI and robotics development roadmap to sow the seeds of prosperous development and contribute towards the synergy of government planning, scientific research, product development and industrial manufacturing.‚Äù
Through the presentations and panel discussion with the participation from experts, local enterprises can grasp the latest applications and development trends of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics technology to help establish the relevant technology development roadmap and smart industries in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
The opening ceremony of HKFAIR 2021 was officiated by Paul Chan, Financial Secretary, and Alfred Sit, Secretary for Innovation and Technology..

I have an old kilim that had seen better days, needed a good cleaning and repairs to the fringe after one of my dogs took a liking. The whole experience from walking in to picking up my rug was outstanding. They were so friendly and helpful, told me what to expect and called me after a few weeks to give me repair options. It has been years since my kilim has looked so good, been so clean and the repairs they did are amazing. Thank you so much Tabrizi, I couldn't be happier.

Thank you

We purchased a beautiful hand-knotted punja rug from Tabrizi eleven months ago. The rug was punctured by the leg of a couch (how, we're not quite sure). We brought the rug back to Tabrizi several months later and the owner (Maher Ghazzawi) repaired the damage free of charge. At the time, we had also brought the rug back with the intent of removing pilling that had developed due to traffic. Maher explained that what we were seeing was a characteristic of the style of rug we'd purchased (punja) - and that there was not much that could...
Thanks Maher!
From: Caroline Smith
Maher is kind and professional. He helped me find a gorgeous rug for my new home. I would recommend that people seek Maher‚Äôs advice if they are in search of the perfect rug! C.Smith
Beautiful rugs!
From: Nathaniel Street
The rugs are beautiful, but what makes Tabrizi stand out is the people who run it. Maher Ghazzawi has earned his self-proclaimed title as the "Rugologist." He has a deep technical, historical and cultural understanding of rugs and will direct you to the best. He listens to you and will go out of his way to find the rug perfect for you. And he's patient and great with kids; our two-year old son had a blast playing! I don't enjoy rug shopping, but going to Tabrizi was different.
King was great to work with!
From: Josh Tan
Bought 3 rugs for my home from Tabrizi rugs. King was great to work with. Very patient from very indecisive buyers but we never felt pressured or rushed. Quality was excellent and pricing was great! I would definitely purchase again in the future!
Excellent service!

Love the place - like being in a REALLY GOOD candy store. Staff knowledgeable and helpful.
A huge selection to choose!
From: Susan Smith
Who knew buying a rug could be so much fun. Maher is personable, friendly, knowledgeable and just plain fun. The rug we selected happened to be right on the top of the pile. There is a huge selection to choose from, and Maher will steer you in the right direction based on your needs. The prices are good as well. Thank you for making buying a rug fun and easy. It looks great!

Lucy McBath announced Monday that she would run for a new district in the Atlanta suburbs against fellow Democrat Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux after the Republican controlled-state legislature redrew McBath‚Äôs district to make it a safely red seat.
Georgia Republican legislators created a map that would drastically change the lines of the two competitive seats north of Atlanta held by the two Democrats. If Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signs it into law and the map survives potential challenges in court, it would essentially give the GOP a 9-5 advantage in the state, rather than the current 8-6 advantage.
In a statement, McBath claimed that Republicans were trying ‚Äúto draw me out of Congress.‚Äù
Following the 2012 murder of her son Jordan Davis, McBath quit her job as a Delta flight attendant to work as an activist with Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action. In 2018, McBath ran for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich‚Äôs old seat and beat Republican Rep. Karen Handel by a point and beat her again in a 2020 rematch by over nine points.
‚ÄúIt is no mystery why Republicans and the NRA have decided I‚Äôm their top target,‚Äù McBath said. ‚ÄúAs a Black woman, activist, and mother on a mission‚Äîthey would like nothing more than to stop me from speaking truth to power about the gun lobby and Republican Party in Congress.‚Äù
In 2018, Bordeaux, a former Georgia State University professor, won a close Democratic primary before losing to Republican Rep. Rob Woodall by fewer than 500 votes. After Woodall retired, Bordeaux won her 2020 race against Republican Dr. Rich McCormick by about three points.
Bordeaux said she has strong ties to the Gwinnett county-based district, and worked to ‚Äúexpand Medicaid, lower healthcare costs, create universal pre-K and address our unique transit needs,‚Äù while securing loans for small businesses.
‚ÄúGeorgia‚Äôs 7th district deserves a representative that understands their issues,‚Äù Bordeaux said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve run five elections here, and I have deep connections with the diverse communities in our district.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Father! But Father!‚Äù, some of you are surely saying. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt those the guys who ‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Ä¶make the Mystic Monk Coffee! Yes, indeed they are.
My favorite photo has to be this one.
Help these guys build their new monastery!
‚ÄúBut Father! But Father! Is this way to drink a mystic monk coffee with a shot rather tableware consuming, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
I would prefer the use of a Calvados instead of a .308 bullet. Cheaper in tableware consumption and I think it tastes better too.
Yours in Christ
Marcus, the one with the C
Thanks, Fr Z‚Ä¶ fun way to start our day!
I especially enjoyed seeing pics of monk music and his Excellency getting a ride on monk-mobile.
I think it‚Äôs cool when Bishops go deer hunting:
Religious men with coffee and firearms, what‚Äôs not to like?
Carhartts, guns ‚Äì no rainbow vestments: fantastic!
Men are returning to the priesthood.
THis is so Cool!
It is great to see that these Bros and Priests and Bishop are real men! They did not give up their masculinity in giving their lives to Christ.
Fr Z Do you have a good vennison meal that you have cooked that you could show us? My favorite is Burgundy peppercorn venison loin steaks, with asperagus, cheesey mashed potatoes and a fresh garden salad.
Maybe Cowgirl could chime in here on a collaboration between the two of you on venison!
Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶
Bishop Etienne cares enough about his priests and religious to go spend some time with them, praying, snowmobiling and having himself photographed even in what many of his fellow bishops would consider politically incorrect circumstances (ie firearms).
Bishop Etienne also is so devoted to the Blessed Mother that he even has her initial M prominently displayed on his coat of arms.
Hmmmm‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt think? No. There couldn‚Äôt be a connection between the two? Could there?
After years of enduring so much lavender, we give thanks oh Lord for a return to to purple amongst your shepherds!
Thanks for some good news to start the day, Fr. Z!
Jack in KC
Man, we really miss Bishop Etienne here in Southern Indiana. I‚Äôm glad that God called him to higher service in the church.
Thanks so much for alerting us to Bishop Etienne‚Äôs blog‚Ä¶I hadn‚Äôt realized he was blogging. I knew him as a child when he was associate pastor at my parish. After he had been there for a few months, my younger sister went up to him after Mass and told him that his homilies had really improved! :-)
Woo hoo! What a cool picture!
A Bishop in the great outdoors with manly monks-I love it!
Did they catch anything on this hunting trip?
Wonderful! I always love how joyful they look. There are some nice photos of them on the New Mount Carmel Foundation website. I would link to the sledding one, but I am afraid the link would be too long and I don‚Äôt know how embed it. I don‚Äôt even know how to spell that‚Ä¶embed, imbed, em-bed? I am trying to say it with two syllables, but it looks like one to me. Oh well.
COMPLETELY excellent! Carhartts are da bomb ‚Äì don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôd do without them in the duck blind or on the training field, especially with all the snow we‚Äôve had.
Nice rifle, too. I think I have the same one ‚Äì Ruger M-77 in .308 with a 4x scope, but with a wood stock not nylon camo. Nylon is better in the snow and wet . . . .
I‚Äôll take a big thermos of Mystic Monk and extra cups with me the next time we go out with the dogs. It‚Äôs appreciated.
That photo would make a good ad for MM Coffee, Carhart, and Remington firearms. Package it up Fr Z, it may be a money maker
Exchief,
Do you think it‚Äôs a Remington? I can‚Äôt see the fore-end, but I thought the comb was more prominent on a Rem 700 . . . ?
Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with either one.
The camo makes it a little tough to make out some of the details but overall (including the camo pattern) it looks like a Rem 700. Cold as it appeared to be when the photo was taken I‚Äôd be more interested in the Mystic Monk coffee than the rifle :)
Religious summit meeting, Wyoming style.
I LOVE IT!!!
His Excellency‚Äôs big ‚Äúcheese-eating grin‚Äù says it all!

We‚Äôd love to have priests come up to Alaska and spend time in Carharts, with guns, and going hunting. I know lots of fine places to stay with good cooks. We are always in need of GOOD Priests who need a nice ‚Äúretreat.‚Äù
Love the pictures!
more fun than a barrel full of monk-eys
sorry, couldn‚Äôt help myself
love to let these guys loose on some happy clappy parish, carharts, guns and all. The on eagles wings types would swoon
;>)
Monks (and bishops) on 4-wheelers are pretty cool too.
I guess if you‚Äôre going to be the bishop of a place like Wyoming, you had jolly well better be able to meet your flock where they live!
(we have some fine rural areas in Georgia where 4-wheelers, Carhartts and good rifles by whatever manufacturer are appreciated, but Catholics tend to be pretty thin on the ground out there. They mostly hang around Atlanta metro, where eagles wings types and swooners abound.)
We‚Äôve seen Nuns With Guns, now we have‚ÄîCarmelites in Carhartts? Religious With Rifles? Either way, I love it!
Tony
You deserve a gold star for those two
Hey, if those rifles are Remingtons, they‚Äôre made not far from where I live here in Upstate NY!
‚ÄòCarmelites in Carharts, Religious with Rifles‚Äô-yeah, Tony Layne, you deserve TWO GOLD STARS for that!Throughout the Bang Kachao site, the idea of' living with water' is visible.

City Times and Other Poems
by Vihang A. Naik
Reviewed by Ronnie Alvarado
City Times and Other Poems is divided into six sections that all feature a similar theme. The first section, ‚ÄúLove Song of a Antigone Poems by Marie Slaight and Terrence Tasker (Artist)
Reviewed by Timea Barabas
Certain stories are timeless, and they can be reshaped in many ways, without losing their essence, such is the story of Antigone. First introduced to the world as a heroine by Sophocles, she now re-emerges in The Antigone Poems of Marie Slaight. However, the heroine of this volume is not one woman, but all.
This volume‚Äôs cover is haunting through the intensity of its simplicity. Before we read Slaight‚Äôs poems, we see Terrence Tasker‚Äôs work, to whom this volume is actually dedicated. Tasker‚Äôs charcoal drawings close each of the five chapters of the book and their raw quality matches that of the poems. Even if there aren‚Äôt that many drawings, they leave their imprint not just on the pages, but on your memory as well. The beauty in Terrence Tasker‚Äôs drawings lies in his ability to allow and almost unnoticeably push the viewer to project their own images over his. The images I saw were filled with pain, desolation, and silent despair. Also, the format of the book is very well thought out since it becomes a tool to control the reader. The empty page which faithfully follows each poem forces us to reflect ‚Äì even if only fractions of a second ‚Äì more on what we have just experienced. It dictates the tempo of Marie Slaight‚Äôs song.
Her words align themselves obediently to the rhythm of some foreign tribal drums. It‚Äôs not so much the words themselves, but how they are put to use that empowers these poems. Their order seems unnatural at first, but each time you read them, they speak to you more. Also, many unexpected associations challenge the reader‚Äôs imagination ‚Äúlike scattered dynamite/dissembled power/shattered glass‚Äù. There are certain words that reoccur almost obsessively (blood, daemon, sun) which haunt Antigone through her journey. But the beat that overshadows all the other instruments is the fusion of pleasure and pain. It is this fragile string which interweaves both of these contrasting emotions that ties all the poems together. There is a voluptuousness about pain, and a distress in pleasure that Marie Slaight is not afraid to explore.
Although the female spirit seems to be dominating throughout The Antigone Poems, the feelings these speak of transcend the rigid barriers of gender. Universal themes like love, passion, pain, lust, loneliness are combined in a unique way through a strong imagery. The poet makes use of all our senses to perceive inner states in a more organic way. So, we come to smell the odor/see the colors/hear the melody/sense the warmth/taste the flavor of Her emotions.
Disclosure in Accordance with FTC Guidelines 16 CFR Part 255A woman on Reddit has shared her predicament after her boyfriend asked if he could propose to her using a customised ring he had originally intended for his now ex-girlfriend.
Titled ‚ÄúIs it unreasonable rejecting an old engagement ring?‚Äù, the woman, who goes by the username ‚Äòthatgirlwithqns‚Äô, shares that she is unsure what to do in the situation, because whilst she understands the practicality of it from his side, she doesn‚Äôt like that it was originally designed for another woman.
‚ÄúMy boyfriend and I have always talked about getting married,‚Äù the woman began. ‚ÄúRecently he asked if I was okay with him giving me an old engagement ring.‚Äù
Providing context, she explains that her partner was with his previous girlfriend for four years and planned to propose to her before they ended their relationship. That was three years ago, she explains, and he now still has the customised ring, which was sourced from overseas.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what the actual value of the ring was, but according to him he spent few thousand dollars on the ring in total. This was not even including the money spent flying to and fro.‚Äù
Side note ‚Äì Forget about engagement rings. Now it‚Äôs all about engagement piercings apparently. The Mamamia Out Loud team discuss it on the podcast below. Post continues after audio.
‚ÄúHe asked if I was okay with him giving me the old ring because it‚Äôs just been sitting in his cupboard, and he felt like there was finally a purpose to that old ring.‚Äù
The woman admits that she understands ‚Äúthe practicality of it‚Äù since ‚Äúit‚Äôll go to waste if he doesn‚Äôt use it‚Äù.
And, by not purchasing a new ring, she continues, the couple will be able to save their money for .‚Äù
‚ÄúAm I being unreasonable? I don‚Äôt need an expensive ring, and I don‚Äôt need diamonds, but I‚Äôd like the ring to be bought with me in mind.‚Äù
The user explained that they had explored the option of selling the bespoke engagement ring, but that the jeweller explained it would only be worth a few hundred dollars ‚Äì considerably less than what he paid for it.
‚ÄúThe ring was only expensive because of all the customisations that he had made to it,‚Äù she clarified. ‚ÄúThe jewel/material of the ring itself was not that expensive.‚Äù

when you love someone - you know in your heart what is right - -
Personally, I'd sell the ring and take the lady ring shopping !
But then - on the other hand - how many girl friends have NO trouble moving into his house - assuming the first wife was not a housekeeper -
NO! Don't give her the same ring. There are so many different ways to give a diamond ring a new look . From adding diamonds/or gemstones, to upgrading the setting, to trading in the ring for a completely new one.- coachcollaborative
Mental Gymnastics
Have you ever thought about what is going on in your mind when you are Coaching someone?
How all of the training, theories, models, practice, feedback, research, ,evidence, experience, intuition, data, the specific client you are working with and their journey computes in your mind and folds in to the Coaching process? It's a big question, and a hard one to wrap one's mind around. And, the complexity, nuance and sophistication of those inner workings are often not understood or respected by others, which is one of the factors that contributes to people thinking that what we do isn't hard.
In today's episode we hold some space for exploring this idea through the mental gymnastics metaphor, and use a few client examples to illustrate the way this amplifies richness, authentic personalization, intrinsic motivation and sustainability in the change they are pursuing.

However, given the spread of COVID-19 and the anticipated continuation of restrictions on large events in California and elsewhere around the nation, we had no choice but to cancel this year‚Äôs event to comply with the current state of legal restrictions and to act in the best interest of our staff, customers and stakeholders.

The AME was set up as in the charter of the United Worlds to simplify exchange. The AME is not a replacement for dollars, renminbi and pounds, but all interstellar banking within the borders of the UWE must be conducted in AMEs, and then can be converted later to the currency of choice.

A new bikeshare expansion was announced by the city today, adding new stations both in existing neighbourhoods, as well as expanding outward to new areas.
There will be 105 new stations, and an addition of 1,250 new bikes as part of the expansion, bringing the total to 468 stations and 5,000 bikes.
A map indicating areas (in purple) where the Bike Share program plans to expand. Image via Toronto Parking Authority.
Here are the neighbourhoods that will receive new stations in the bike share expansion:
Furthermore, reserve funding from several downtown wards will be used to fund the program, meaning those wards will receive new stations as well. They are as follows:
The province agreed to contribute $6 million to the expansion, with the city matching $1.5 million for a total of $7.5 million. The new stations should be open by summer of this year.

Aiming to gain experience in a number of fields, Marc worked in every department throughout his internship at Project11.Now, as it happens, the Little Frigging Ladies Synchronised fondling display team are already to give the annual Little Frigging mixed-doubles fondling demonstration that ‚Äì as a tradition dating back to the week before the introduction of colour TV into the locality ‚Äì is both ancient and noble.
Now, those of you who have not had the pleasure of receiving a synchronised fondling from a team of experts can well imagine, it is not an experience for those not able to stand firm under such an onslaught. This is especially true when the highly dexterous fingers of the ladies are moving around your person in a manner that brings gasps of astonishment and delight to the watching audience.
It is a strong man who is not almost overcome by the time the ladies have finished even their first ministrations and are ready to commence on some of the more complex manoeuvrings that denote a synchronised fondling team at the height of their powers. Such manoeuvres as: ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Crouching Mangle Operative, Hidden Sock Retrieval, The Pummelling Panel Beater, The Hopping Tax Inspector and so on often leave many a volunteer fondlee with tears in his eyes in gratitude for the way the Little Frigging Ladies Synchronised fondling display team have taken him in hand.
Many a gentleman in the audience too has to sit there once the display is over as he contemplates such a fate befalling himself, unless he immediately takes himself in hand and feels himself swelling up with pride at what he has witnessed.
Yours perversely:

PeccƒÅvƒ´‚ÄòRHOM‚Äô: Where Are the Original Miami Housewives Today?
The Real Housewives of Miami gave viewers a peek into how Miami socialites live and party.
The original cast was a fascinating blend of homegrown Miami natives and South Florida transplants, which included the wife of a famed attorney and professional basketball player. Despite the major drama and plenty of spice, this arm of the franchise only ran for three seasons.
The first episode aired in February 2011 and introduced viewers to the unique South Florida lifestyle and the women who were part of high society. Only two of the original cast members remained as main cast members for all three seasons with a few dipping in and out of the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù status. So where is the original cast today?
Lea Black
Lea Black, wife of famed attorney Roy Black continues to have a presence on Bravo. She‚Äôs made numerous appearances on Flipping Out and is often a guest on Jeff Lewis‚Äôs SiriusXM radio show. She‚Äôs active on Twitter, sharing insightful political opinions.
Black also has her own skincare line. She also offered a nice discount on her beauty line during the quarantine too. ‚ÄúEnjoy 50% off select Lea Black Beauty and Skincare with code SPRING2020 at checkout on leablack.com. Treat yourself to this premium skincare collection today. Shop now at leablack.com.‚Äù She also continued to host The Black‚Äôs Annual Gala. Black was a main cast member for the entire series.
Adriana de Moura
Adriana de Moura and Black were besties, then they weren‚Äôt. Did the ladies ever squash their beef? They weren‚Äôt in the best place in 2013. ‚ÄúI pretty much felt like she sold out our friendship in order to stay relevant,‚Äù de Moura told Bravo‚Äôs The Daily Dish in 2013. ‚ÄúShe threw me under the bus. It was very hurtful.‚Äù So hurtful that Adriana seemed doubtful as to the future of their friendship. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on it,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just very hard because once that trust is broken‚Ä¶‚Äù
Viewers watched de Moura fall in love and get engaged to Frederic Marq. The couple put their gorgeous Miami crib on the market in 2018. They asked close to $5 million for the 2,795-square-foot Spanish-style abode. Like Black, de Moura remained on the series for the duration.
Alexia Echevarria
According to her bio, Alexia Echevarria is the ‚Äú‚ÄôCuban Barbie‚Äô [who] holds the pulse of Miami‚Äôs Latin culture. As the Executive Editor of Venue Magazine, Alexia spotlights the latest fashion trends as well as up-and-coming Latin film and TV stars.‚Äù
A big part of Echevarria‚Äôs storyline was the horrific 2011 car accident her youngest son Frankie endured. Her son was only 13 years old when he was in the accident, spent three months in a pediatric intensive unit and then three months in rehabilitation. Echevarria often shares photos of both of her sons and recently celebrated Frankie‚Äôs birthday.
‚ÄúHappy Birthday Frankie!! You are my strength and my angel ! God has been so good to me . He gave you as my son two times. You have taught me that no matter what, we all can find new ways to live our life and be happy with it. You have made me a better person,‚Äù she wrote in a birthday post. Echevarria was a main cast member for season one and season three. She appeared as a friend during season two.
Marysol Patton
Marysol Patton was the Miami-based public relations executive who was looking for love during season one of the show. Patton eventually found love with French businessman Philippe Pautesta-Herder. The couple had a breathtaking wedding ceremony atop a snow-covered mountain in Aspen but divorced two years later.
Patton‚Äôs mother, ‚ÄúMama Elsa‚Äù also became a focal point of the show. Elsa often provided spiritual guidance to her daughter and others on the show and had a huge fan following. Patton confirmed to Page Six that her mother died on Mother‚Äôs Day in 2019 at age 84.
,‚Äù she shared. Patton was a main cast member for season one and two, returning as a friend during season three.
Larsa Pippen
Larsa Pippen is the wife of former NBA player Scottie Pippen. Unlike the rest of the cast, Pippen lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, about 30 minutes north of Miami. She only appeared on the show for season one and a big part of her storyline was being a mother to her four children, who had some nanny issues.
Since leaving the show, Pippen moved back to Chicago. She told the Chicago Sun-Times that, ‚ÄúI feel like the people in Chicago are really grounded. It‚Äôs better for our family.‚Äù She also became extremely close friends with Kim Kardashian. She appeared on Kourtney & Kim Take Miami after leaving RHOM and is still pals with Kardashian today. Pippen only appeared on season one of the show.
Cristy Rice
Cristy Rice only appeared on RHOM for season one and was recently divorced from NBA player Glen Rice when she appeared on the series. At the time, she was a single mom of three children and ran a clothing store. In 2014 she rolled out her own swimwear line.
Rice‚Äôs children are now teens and young adults. She recently shared a family picture in November. ‚ÄúWhere there is family, there is LOVE‚ô•Ô∏è

Sales Director for Playson, Blanka Homor explained in a company presser that signing with MaxBet is ‚Äúa welcome step for the company‚Äù as it ‚Äúoccupies a leading position within the key market of Romania.‚Äù
Homor went on to say that the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmulti-award-nominated offering has continued to expand and improve in recent weeks with an innovative range of new mechanics and gaming titles, so we have no doubt that it will prove highly beneficial for our new partner.‚Äù

TiFFist: Galas and Masters?
Galas
‚Äî
Well! The Galas themselves are an interesting bunch. While last year‚Äôs Galas included the likes of Ray, which went on to win, uh, I believe the scientific amount is ‚Äòa buttload‚Äô of Oscars, this year Torontoist‚Äôs hot tip for that kind of thing is probably not Walk the Line, even though Johnny Cash is a dead musician (I‚Äôm sure the academy is colorblind enough to not repeat themselves.) and the film looks great. Check out a trailer here to see how skilfully Joaquin Phoenix does the Man in Black.
Of course, Torontoist would be doing the city a disservice by forgetting about Toronto‚Äôs own David Cronenberg, showing A History of Violence, his new film starring Viggo Mortensen, which appears to entirely lack his usual stick of something really gross to shock the audience (remember when Madame Butterfly opened her kimono to reveal a dripping egg sac?!), relying on psychological horror to provide the thrills. Of course, some might say Viggo Mortensen‚Äôs face is freaky enough, which makes the fact that this gala is sponsored by ‚ÄòHandsome Male Models‚Äô all the more funny (Sorry, Viggy.)
And, though he was born in B.C., we‚Äôll give Atom Egoyan‚Äôs new film, Where the Truth Lies some props because he moved here at 18 and studied at U of T. (Though secretly, Torontoist has never been a big fan of his movies.)
Also showing are Cameron Crowe‚Äôs probably warm and funny and cool (or bland, depending on your opinion of him) Elizabethtown, Guy Ritchie‚Äôs ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs sweep away Swept Away‚Äô Revolver, which will shock all by revealing Jason Stantham has hair, And Jackie Chan‚Äôs ‚ÄòNO MORE CHRIS TUCKER!‚Äô celebration The Myth.
But Torontoist‚Äôs honest soft spot, and the one film it‚Äôs desperate to see, is Nick Park‚Äôs, absolutely cannot be bad at all, there‚Äôs no chance, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit. After the tragic lack of decent kids films last year that resulted in A Sharks‚Äô Tale getting a Gala (what were they thinking?) TIFF come back and literally rock Torontoist‚Äôs wrong trousers right off.
Masters
‚Äî
Masters traditionally show new work from the big names of cinema (those, uh, not big enough to get a gala, I guess) and this year is no exception. People who loved ‚ÄòThe Last Waltz‚Äô, Scorsese‚Äôs magical concert film with Ontario‚Äôs very own The Band (If Torontoist are ever drunk and loudly singing ‚ÄòThe Weight‚Äô at you, please let them get it out of their system, it‚Äôs easier for everyone) may or may not be pleased with No Direction Home: Bob Dylan. Having just read (if you can call it that) Dylan‚Äôs book Tarantula, Torontoist are less than convinced.
A probable must see, even if the showings are early in the morning and Zatoichi wasn‚Äôt a patch on the originals, is Takeshi Kitano‚Äôs Takeshis, considered so unothodox when it was sneak previewed at the Venice Film Festival that the audience had no idea what to do when it ended. Audiences didn‚Äôt understand the languid though gorgeous Dolls, though, so Torontoist remains excited.
Torontoist also want to point out Alexander Sokurov‚Äôs The Sun, as it might get overlooked. Sokurov‚Äôs astounding Russian Ark, a tour of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg done in one single shot was a treat, so Sokurov‚Äôs steady hand inspecting the concept of Emperor Hirohito‚Äôs divinity during WWII infers a likely hidden gem of the festival.
And finally, for those of you who have been burned by the Brothers Grimm (Torontoist hasn‚Äôt seen it, so can‚Äôt comment on the controversy) Gilliams real film, Tideland, the curious sounding story of a inquisitive girl living on the praries with her junkie parents. It‚Äôll probably freak Torontoist out the way ‚ÄòThe Fisher King‚Äô did, all those years ago when Torontoist was a mere nipper. Who doesn‚Äôt like to get freaked out?

The Hawkesbury Canoe Classic
The Hawkesbury Canoe Classic is a fun paddle with a serious purpose. Each year around 600 paddlers paddle 111 km overnight in the moonlight, down the Hawkesbury River from Windsor to Brooklyn, to raise money for charity.
The Wisemans Dash, a shorter version of 67 Km finishing at Wisemans Ferry was introduced in 2016. This is a great introduction for newer paddlers, or a warm-up for returning paddlers. an excellent safety record, with the long-term health of paddlers over-riding any other considerations.
The first paddlers leave Windsor at 4:00pm on Saturday and pass 21 safety checkpoints during the night. The fastest craft arrive at Brooklyn in less than 10 hours, but the average time is closer to 15 hours.
The Hawkesbury Canoe Classic has been run since 1977 and is made possible by volunteers who put in hundreds of hours of time throughout the year, landowners who allow us the use of their land for the weekend and the paddlers and their support crews.
The Hawkesbury Canoe Classic has raised almost $4 million for medical research. The major beneficiary for this year's event will be the Arrow Bone Marrow Transplant Foundation.This column is the second of two parts. ‚Äî Editor
Folks have been using the media for impression management ever since print was the only game in town. Even would-be authors knew about image.
Remember when members of the gentler sex adopted pseudonyms or settled for unisex initials to hoodwink sexist publishing houses into supposing they were men?
As many as a million radio listeners were duped into believing America was being invaded by Martians when Orson Welles interrupted dance music with mock radio news announcements.
His 1938 ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù radio play seemed so authentic that listeners were actually injured during the ensuing panic.
The Television Age also saw image manipulation on a grand scale ‚Äî and not just by savvy politicians. In 1968, Andy Warhol famously said, ‚ÄúIn the future, everyone will be world famous for 15 minutes.‚Äù
Arguably, Warhol was echoing the ‚Äúmedium is the message‚Äù theory of Marshall McLuhan. The communication theorist held that of all the existing media, only television possessed the ability to thrust the ordinary citizen (as opposed to the overachiever) center stage. Fame, however, was ephemeral ‚Äî evaporating as quickly as it had appeared when somebody else took a turn.
Prompted by the rise of online social networking, blogging, podcasting and uploading to video-sharing sites, David Weinberger rewrote Warhol. His ‚ÄúCluetrain Manifesto‚Äù version read, ‚ÄúIn the future, everyone will be famous to 15 people.‚Äù
But is 15 enough? Probably not ‚Äî if you are going to all the trouble of managing your online image. And most of us are.
A study conducted by Pew‚Äôs Mary Madden and Aaron Smith reported that 57 percent of adult Internet users have employed a search engine like Google to discover what information is available about them on the World Wide Web.
Seventy-one percent of those under 30 report adjusting their privacy settings to limit information shared online. That‚Äôs so grandma and future employers aren‚Äôt privy to what went on in Vegas. Ever.
Still, whether young or old, there is always the danger of a message intended for friends to inadvertently go viral. In 2011, Alexandra Wallace found that out the hard way when she uploaded a three-minute diatribe against Asian student cellphone usage in the school library.
While the university decided not to discipline the political science major and part-time bikini model, Wallace informed the Daily Bruin that her reasons for leaving UCLA, where 37 percent of the student body is Asian, included ‚Äúthe harassment of my family, the publishing of my personal information, death threats and being ostracized from an entire community.‚Äù
While Wallace only intended ‚Äúto produce a humorous YouTube video,‚Äù the clip was eventually shared with millions via social media sites and email.
Question: Since popularity is the goal on Facebook and Twitter, exactly how do you maximize your fan base? Answer: Think positive.
According to Jonah Berger, author of ‚ÄúContagious: Why Things Catch On,‚Äù good news usually spreads faster and farther than bad. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòif it bleeds, (it leads)‚Äô rule works for mass media that just want you to tune in,‚Äù wrote the social psychologist from the University of Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúThey (just) want your eyeballs and don‚Äôt care how you‚Äôre feeling. But when you share a story with your friends and peers, you care a lot more how they react. You don‚Äôt want them to think of you as Debbie Downer.‚Äù
Berger and behavioral economist Katherine Milkman devised a unique experiment to test his theory. They analyzed the content of articles making The New York Times ‚Äúmost emailed‚Äù list.
What they discovered was that the more emotional the stories, the more likely they would be shared. In terms of specific content, while readers seemed to be aroused by both positive (awe-inspiring, exciting or funny) and negative (anger- or anxiety-inducing) stories, they definitely preferred positive.
Brain areas associated with social cognition tend to light up the most, according to Emily Falk at the University of Michigan. She‚Äôs a neuroscientist attempting to determine the type of thoughts that gather the most buzz.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd expect people to be most enthusiastic and opinionated and successful in spreading ideas that they themselves are excited about,‚Äù writes Dr. Falk. ‚ÄúBut our research suggests that‚Äôs not the whole story. Thinking about what appeals to others may be even more important.‚Äù
But there is a dark side to impression management as well ‚Äî envy.
According to a study titled ‚ÄúCyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking,‚Äù the more time you spend on Facebook, the more you will perceive life as unfair ‚Äî since everybody else seems to be enjoying the perfect vacation, perfect family, perfect life.
This quote by author Jon Foreman recently appeared on Facebook: ‚ÄúGreed, envy, sloth, pride and gluttony: these are not vices anymore. No, these are marketing tools.‚Äù

11 ensp 0183 ensp27 January, 2016, New Delhi: In order to attract more sellers on to its ecommerce platform, Snapdeal‚Äôs loan card may prove a fruitful move to increase its business. One of the India‚Äôs largest retail marketplaces, Snapdeal is planning to give loans of worth Rs 1000 crore over next six months to its sellers. The company feels that this step will allure more sellers on to its platform and with that; it will be able to offer a huge variety of products to its customers.
To make the loan process smoother and quicker, company has omitted the lengthy processes such as documentation of financial statements and collaterals etc. Instead of that, it has adopted a first of its kind system called industry first credit rating engine on the lines of Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL). The system automatically generates customer‚Äôs history and gives feedback by analysing his transaction history, risk behaviour and payback capability.
Commenting on the development, Vijay Ajmera, Senior VP, Capital Assist Programme, Snapdeal said, ‚ÄúThere are similar credit rating engines used in Europe and the US such as Kreditech and Kabbage. This is the first time that such an innovative credit rating engine has been developed in India to provide cash to merchants.‚Äù
Company will be keeping the loan interest rate around 2-3% lesser than what online sellers would otherwise get from the bank. ‚ÄúLoans as small as Rs 30,000 have been sanctioned to help small businesses scale up from scratch. They aid our smaller sellers grow and expand their businesses. They even help them stay loyal,‚Äù adds Ajmera.Members of the public gather during a Covid-19 vaccine drive.

Why Tal played 1.Nf3 is beyond me, Keres hardly ever played the Sicilian, Maybe Tal was trying to play a Sicilian via 1.Nf3,c5 2.e4. After 1.e4 Keres might have played 1...e5 a closed Ruy lopez would most likely have been played.
Forcing Tal to play a positional game gave Keres the best possible chance to beat him. I mean why invite tal into a tactical skirmish!
Now *that's* what I call <CENTRALIZATION>.
It may not be a lost position, but he certainly gives White a good position out of the opening.
Keres writes, "This game was played in the last tour, five rounds before the end of the tournament. At that moment, Tal was leading by a margin of 2.5 points over me. I had therefore to play for a win at all costs in order to retain even theoretical chances of gaining first place."
After 11 Na4, Tal attacks Keres' bishop on c5, and Keres adds, "A new line, instead of the customary Rb1. With the text-move White plans to initiate the well known pressure on the c5 square after 11 ... Be7 by 12 Be3. Thus he would attain a position that would ensure him a lasting initiative without any danger of losing. Hence black chooses a different, perhaps riskier, continuation so as to lead the game away from the usual paths."
Keres retreats his bishop to b6, and after the exchange ends up with a rather ugly position of doubled b pawns and white with the 2-bishop advantage. There aren't many who would want to play black's position from move 11 needing a win against a strong white player. Rybka sees the position as .33 for White at this point.
Keres writes, "An essay at appreciating the position that has now arisen might seem at first glance to make it appear much more favorable for white than it really is. He enjoys the advantage of two bishops, controls the important d4 square, while his opponent's pawn position reveals marked weaknesses on the queen-side. But if one tries to suggest a plan by which white can increase his supposed advantage then one is pulled up sharp by unexpected difficulties. It becomes apparent that Black's position too contains various advantages that should not be underestimated."
Keres estimates that Tal's move 15 a3 is a mistake, "white overestimates his position and apparently imagines he can quietly increase his pressure in the center ... Something must of necessity be undertaken against the positional threat of 15 ... Bh6."
An interesting psychological study of how to play against Tal if one needed a win, which is a bit different than the game evaluation of previous posts.

RSS FeedAccording to a recent study, people who only took five hours sleep a night gained two pounds in a week. Sleep deprivation can cause weight gain because when sleep deprived, people eat less breakfast meal, but more snacks. Scientists proved that lack of sleep slows down the metabolism by causing the body to burn fewer calories. Not getting enough sleep not only makes you feel tired but also makes you fat, a research suggests.
A number of studies have observed that people who are taking a sleep of five hours or less are more likely to gain weight and weight-related health problems such as type-2 diabetes. To reduce weight, you don‚Äôt need to follow any diet for weight loss or buying weight loss products. All you need to do is to follow a healthy lifestyle, which includes a sleep of at least 6 hours. This helps you in maintaining a healthy weight throughout your life.

People who sleep for five hours or less each night are more likely to gain weight because they eat more snacks. They consume more calories in the form of after dinner-snacks instead of eating healthy food items. People who take adequate sleep are able to reduce their consumption of fat and carbohydrate and shed the pounds. The findings are alarming for millions of people who are taking less than five hours of sleep each night. It has been estimated that about one in three adults doesn‚Äôt take enough sleep. During periods of insufficient rest, people take a small breakfast but consume a lot of calories in the form of snacks that are rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and fibers. A lack of sleep encourages weight gain by boosting hunger.
Science has proved that fewer hours of sleep can affect your waistline. Sleep deprivation affects your brain in such a way that it makes you eat more snacks. It slows down your metabolism and makes you feel tired. By sleeping fewer hours, you are programming your body to eat more and feel lethargic. Feelings lethargic leads to poor food choices like junk food, eating fewer vegetables and fruits, and drink more soda. The feeling of fatigues is often confused by a sign of hunger. You end up by consuming a major amount of calories, but don‚Äôt burn them through exercising because you feel too tired to workout, which results in gaining about 2-3 extra pounds a month.
So, next time when you wonder that the results of a healthy eating and workout habits are not visible, then be mindful of your sleep patterns. Taking a sleep of 5 hours or less creates a vicious cycle in your body, which makes you more prone to several factors that contribute to weight gain. The study states that the more sleep-deprived you will be, the higher your levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which cause an increase in your appetite. And it is not suggested that you suddenly become ravenous for kale salads or make your mood to take weight loss supplements or weight loss pills. According to the study, it takes a bit of willpower to choose the healthy salad over the junk sandwich. When you feel tired, you go for whatever going to be easy to prepare and what makes you feel better in the moment.

Always keep in mind that a healthy lifestyle is necessary to maintain a healthy body. A healthy lifestyle includes six-hour sleep, which is necessary for performing daily activities of life. Taking sufficient sleep will promote a healthy mind and enhance your overall body function. Sleep helps you to get instant relief from fatigue. A lack of sleep also decreases your body‚Äôs ability to process the sweet stuff.Updates

An adventurous personality investigates new horizons.
I inhabited the world of Surrealism until 2003, using symbols to comment on personal, social and political experiences.
During 2004, my physical and emotional environment underwent a huge upheaval.
Accompanying this was a growing awareness of how to step aside and view words and actions with a different consciousness. Consequently my creative focus shifted to reflect this evolving spirit.
Without knowing where to go, I dived into pure abstraction with eleven works on paper and no perceived outcome. This was a revelatory encounter.
I had jumped off the proverbial cliff into deep water and have been sinking, swimming or floating with each new work ever since. Occasionally I land on a new shore, and emerge astonished with the destination.
An excitement for the unknown and unpredictable is the driving force.

The sample was knitted with: Shibui Knits Cima in 'Tar' for MC, Shibui Knits Silk Cloud in 'Cove' for CC1, Shibui Knits Silk Cloud in 'Fog' for CC2.
Yardage
- MC: 485 yards/443 meters.
- CC1: 158 yards/ 144 meters.
- CC2: 356 yards/ 326 meters.

We celebrated my cousin‚Äôs 10th birthday ‚Äì and America‚Äôs at the same time! We have been doing a lot of celebrating lately ‚Äì and I apologize that this isn‚Äôt really a ‚Äúwedding post‚Äù but I had to share. My ever-so-studious fiance just finished 2 more classes through Northeastern University for his Master‚Äôs and earned A‚Äôs in both (brag!). And last week, I was offered a BIG promotion with my company, while staying in the Communications arena.
I had to wait to make the announcement ‚Äì which was tough ‚Äì especially since I wanted to shout it from the rooftop! I applied for the job on a whim, thinking I really had no shot, it was grades above where I was, I had just earned my Master‚Äôs which they wanted but I didn‚Äôt have a lot of post-Master‚Äôs experience to apply, and I had just been promoted back in December so another jump so soon was not realistic. But alas, I had all of the qualifications and apparently didn‚Äôt sound too much like Miss South Carolina in my interviews.
I am so excited for this opportunity and all of the doors that it opens for me, and for my future family. Overwhelmingly, people have been happy for me (lots of screaming, jumping hugs in the elevators at work and tons of text messages), but I did have one person tell me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt expect to be Top 10 again.‚Äù We are fortunate at my company to still get bonuses and those are based on your rating for the year. Last year, I was a Top 10 performer for the company and man, it felt good. Disappointing to be told that when I just got a ‚Äúdream job‚Äù and am over-the-moon happy. However, since I‚Äôve been reading Lean In by Sheryl Sandburg, I feel empowered. I feel excited. I feel like I can do anything.
First and foremost, I am going to marry the love of my life and spend 11 spectacular days in Aruba with him. But then, we can focus on our careers and figure out where we want to be before we start a family. I‚Äôm not the girl who wants to be a stay-at-home mom (nothing wrong with it!). I enjoy working, and I especially enjoy new challenges and opportunities. My fiance is the same way and while he is knee-deep in his Master‚Äôs studies right now, he is well on his way to his next opportunity. I can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds for us.
The next 43 days hold lots of last minute details, DIY crafts and collecting of RSVPs. Counting down!

Roger Bolton
Interview Segments on Topic: Characteristics/Qualities of PR Professionals: What characteristics of yours worked most effectively for you? Was it your ability to write clearly? Speak clearly or how do you get your viewpoints really across in that kind of general atmosphere.
Bolton: Again I think writing is the critical skill that I brought. But I think to be a good writer you got to be able to think clearly and express yourself clearly and so the ability to communicate orally also comes into play. But I think its understanding and having the appreciation for the complexity of issues, respecting a wide set of points of view, being able to understand and assimilate those points of view and look for common ground that really is the critical factor.
Interviewer: I tell you that‚Äôs a great story there in more ways than one. What qualities do you think the CEOs look for in someone who holds a senior public relations job?
Bolton: Well I mean the traditional ones of being good at the fundamentals of communications. I think they also look for a sense of calm in crisis. A wise ability to think clearly about difficult issues and the conviction to offer strong and sound advice, sometimes advice that they may not even want to hear. And you can sense when they don‚Äôt want to hear it. But you know you don‚Äôt throw it in their face but you have to kind of quietly and persistently be a conscious. And I think they want that actually and they look for it. And again I think some people are afraid to speak up and not say what they really believe and to say what they think is right and it doesn‚Äôt work out over time.
Interviewer: You have a wide acquaintanceship among the senior public relations people and know quite a few of them. What characteristics do senior public relations people have that are sort of self-defeating tendencies that they [inaudible]? What‚Äôs your observation on that?
Bolton: Well you don‚Äôt see it often, but there are some who seem to let their own ego get a little bit in the way and they start to become the story. Or to see themselves as being maybe bigger than they really ought to be. It‚Äôs a staff role after all and you‚Äôve got to recognize that ultimately you‚Äôre not the decision maker. You‚Äôre the advisor. And I think it‚Äôs important to take that role on seriously with some degree of humility. But also with a centered calmness and conviction that is not, that doesn‚Äôt waiver from day to day and issue to issue.
Interviewer: Okay, on selecting people for your department, what characteristics and abilities do you look for?
Bolton: Well I look for several things and I think I would start with integrity and ethics. And you know we were just speculating a moment ago kind of off camera about how where does it come from that some people seem to have it and some don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know that I can answer that question. But I do think that you look for it. And particularly in public relations you have to have a respect for and a dedication to the truth and a willingness to say this is what‚Äôs right. This is the way we see it and we‚Äôre going to stand up behind that. I think you look for that. I think it‚Äôs one of the things you hire for. You also hire for sort of basic communications ability with writing skill being the single most difficult commodity to find and yet the most critical that you must have and so I look for that. I hire for it. I also look for and hire for strategic thinking. I find that there are people who are actually pretty good reasonably good public relations professions who are able to execute well but aren‚Äôt able to think critically and strategically about business issues and business problems. And for senior roles I‚Äôm looking for the latter. I really do want people who can understand strategic objectives and help a business think about how to accomplish its goals.
Interviewer: Well you‚Äôve answered my next question because I was going to ask you if it makes any difference when you are hiring at the senior-level or an entry-level position. If I heard you correctly you no you look for pretty much the same thing on an emphasized strategic level.
Bolton: Yeah more emphasis on the strategic thinking at a senior level I would say. But you know what I want strategic thinking all up and down my department. Even at the most junior levels. I‚Äôve got people who are advising businesses on important PR considerations. And if they don‚Äôt understand that business and if they don‚Äôt understand how to think critically about the business needs and about how to apply communications skills to help the business accomplish its goals. And at the same time be strong enough to stand up for truth and doing the right thing. And have a broad perspective on the need of constituents that person‚Äôs not likely to be very successful. People who are good at writing and can write press releases but sort of sit there and wait for someone else to say oh go write a press release about such and such aren‚Äôt of much value.
Interviewer: I can say amen to that. What about education experiences. Do you look for any particular type of educational experience either in new hires or senior people?
Bolton: I love it when I find journalism experience and journalism training. But I don‚Äôt necessarily think that formalized public relations or journalism training is critical to success. I think that experience is and if you‚Äôve got a law degree or an economics degree or a business degree and yet you‚Äôve proven that you can function effectively as a communicator, I think that that‚Äôs just fine.
Interviewer: I was going to ask you if you preferred any particular type of business experience or any kind of experience in addition to the educational and personal trades and I gathered that you were saying that you did to some degree like people who have financial background or something else. Are there other ingredients that you would add to that mix as far as prior experience goes?
Bolton: I‚Äôm actually pretty open you know. It‚Äôs always nice from an Aetna perspective if you can find someone with healthcare experience. But it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs not essential. I think talent. Strategic thinking. I think an ability to understand business and economic issues is pretty important. But we need a variety of people who understand consumers and consumerism and all those sorts of issues as well.
Interviewer: What would you do you have any way you would assess a public relations experience. If you put them on a layer I‚Äôve heard you put journalism sort of on top and I wonder if you put public relations or advertising or mass communications if there‚Äôs any room for somebody. How would you rate those?
Bolton: I don‚Äôt you know what no I don‚Äôt think you do. I think you hire for what for the role that you are looking for. I mean if I‚Äôm looking for a speech writer or an internal communications specialist, it‚Äôs nice if they have some background in that. A media relations specialist may have been a PR person for an agency for for a company or may have a journalism background or both. I actually don‚Äôt like to hire journalists directly. But people who have a journalism background or training who have been in PR with an agency or another company are often prized.
Interviewer: You sound like an old timer.Top 10 Cybersecurity Startups in India

One of the world‚Äôs greatest mathematicians and physicists was Isaac Newton. Newton‚Äôs third law of motion loosely translates that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The pedestrian application of this law is that if you push someone, they will push back, or with every food you eat, you have to generate waste.
Every human, regardless of age, has to generate waste. The process of eliminating human waste depends on the region, seeing that some countries use sewage systems with others not being so lucky. However, is it possible that we can all use human waste to improve our gardens? This article focuses on human poop and how it can be composted.
Contents
Is Human Waste Compostable?
Human waste is compostable, although the composting process will differ, depending on the location where the process is taking place. For instance, human waste should not be added to the general home compost bin, unless properly managed. A composting toilet can do the job for you even if it is at home.
On the other hand, it is generally safe to compost human waste at an industrial composting plant. The main reason why composting human waste at home in your composting bin is discouraged is because of the harmful bacteria and pathogens that could be present in the waste.
To effectively kill them, hot compost is therefore advised and is primarily absent in most domestic composting bins. However, if yours is a hot one, go right ahead.
Human waste is rich in plant-healthy nutrients, making it ideal for growing your crops, especially as fertilizer or compost. However, it also contains viruses, pathogens and bacteria that cannot be effectively be removed by the standard home composting process.
This makes composting human waste using such domestic bins unsafe, for the process in general and also for the vegetables, berries, fruit trees and other edible plants. This is why a composting toilet is advised, although it also has its own rules about composting human waste.
Alternatively, use large-scale composting facilities, which have the technology and heat to process the waste at high temperatures for a lengthy period. The resulting product is heavily regulated and frequently tested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure bacteria and pathogens are below detectable levels.
Where the waste is approved, it makes for perfect fertilizer that can improve soil quality and reduce the dependence on chemical fertilizers.
There are expert composters who argue against using composted human waste on edible plants, primarily because of the small chance that dangerous bacteria are still alive in the human waste.
This is absolutely true and you should avoid using human waste or composted human waste as fertilizer on your edible plants, fruits or other plants.
The only time such compost can be completely safe is if it underwent a hot compost and all the harmful pathogens were killed in the process. The pathogens and bacteria can live through the waste and be taken up by the edible plants and end up in your system once again.
The only safe place to take the uncomposted waste, other than the sewerage system is burying it. if you have to use it, apply it to non-edible plants. Otherwise, simply wait for the fecal matter out then compost it, or take it to an industrial plant and hot-compost it before applying it on edible plants or crops
Can You Use Human Poop as Fertilizer?
Yes, human poop can be used as fertilizer. In fact, it has been used for a similar purpose for centuries. According to JSTOR, in eighteenth-century Japan, human excrement played a vital role in agriculture.
In fact, the potential use of human excreta as a fertilizer in agricultural fields can be an incentive for people to collect and treat fecal sludge so it can be used to increase soil health.
Unfortunately, prejudice and lack of knowledge have stood in the way. The application of human excreta-derived fertilizer (HEDF) in agriculture does not pose a risk of pathogens or heavy metals.
However, according to a group of scientists from the School of Water, Energy and Environment at the Cranfield University in the UK local regulations and perceptions can be a problem.
Dried human feces are high in phosphorus, potassium and some micronutrients. This is why human excreta has been proven to have a good fertilizing potential, providing essential plant nutrients as well as organic matter contributing towards building soil structure and reducing erosion.
Where the excreta is treated appropriately, like composted under the appropriate heat, and killing all pathogens, the poop will make for a good fertilizer that is safe to use for agricultural purposes. Unfortunately, not so many farmers or gardeners can prefer to use such bio-solids as fertilizer due to the prejudice imposed on them.
Luckily, since they have a positive effect on the soil, farmers might not discriminate on such a fertilizer. The major risk associated with using human poop as fertilizer is the potential disease-causing pathogens present in the poop, as well as the antibiotics, hormones and endocrine disruptors that appear in such manures.
Is Human Faeces a Hazardous Waste?
Human waste is not hazardous waste, although it requires additional care before using as fertilizer or before composting. Human feces can be classified as hazardous if it contains dangerous diseases and bacteria such as cholera, rotavirus, E Coli, pinworms, norovirus, hepatitis and dysentery, among others.
These conditions are dangerous and at times fatal, meaning the fecal matter will be a biohazard. However, human waste is not classified as medical waste so there have to be additional regulations on how such material is handled.
They also require proper disinfection by experts specializing in human waste clean-up because of the high exposure risk to infectious diseases. Failure to clean up such waste can result in similar health conditions affecting those cleaning the waste. It might also result in litigation in different jurisdictions.
Generally speaking, hazardous waste is any waste that presents a substantial threat to public health, or the environment. It is illegal to dispose of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste at the same landfill site in several jurisdictions, for the hazardous waste will affect the land, underground sources of water, nearby rivers and of course the environment in general.
Also, depending on the toxicity of the hazardous waste, it could be between dangerous and fatal to humans, animals and birds living next to or coming into close contact with the landfill. The most common items described as hazardous include certain paints, inks and pigments, solvents, pesticides, electric waste and vehicle fluids, among others.
Human waste, luckily, does not fall under such category, although a lot of caution should be exercised when handling fecal matter that contains bacteria or diseases like those mentioned above.
Rather than considering human waste hazardous, it is best to classify it as offensive waste. Offensive waste is any waste that is non-infectious but may be unpleasant or cause offense to those that come into contact with it.
Offensive waste includes condoms, urine, vomit, medical or veterinary waste, incontinence pads, sanitary waste, nasal secretion, sputum, and of course human and animal feces. The moment you meet with any of these waste, they will offend you and could be even so if you are a member of certain religions.
A common misconception with offensive waste is that because it is not technically hazardous, it may be placed into general waste as long as it is done with caution. This is incorrect and you should separate such offensive waste from other general waste and place it in an offensive waste bin.
How Long Does It Take for Human Waste to Compost?
The duration upon which human waste composts is entirely dependent on the composting process used.
1. Cold composting
This is the classic composting process and can easily be done at home. Here, organic matter is collected and exposed to weather conditions, usually at temperatures not higher than 40¬∞C.
With such temperatures, the composting process is particularly slow and can be slower if either the weather conditions do not facilitate the process, or the contents inside the composting bin are placed improperly.
Composting human waste using the cold composting process will take months and pathogens in the fecal matter will not be completely destroyed.
2. Vermicompost
This is the composting process where earthworms are introduced into the mix. The worms can eat and digest 1.5 times their own body weight per day and since they inherently dig through everything, they are best suited to break down organic matter.
Unfortunately, fecal worms, even if the name suggests otherwise, do not like direct contact with human feces. Composting using worms creates a lot of moisture which can then drain to a certain extent. The worms also feel most comfortable at temperatures not beyond 30¬∞C.
The method of composting fecal matter also relies on a neutral pH inside the composting bin. Additionally, urine should not get into the worm compost as the ammonia in urine can kill the hard-working worms. Where the process is done well, can take a few months, but a slightly shorter time than when cold-composting
3. Hot composting
Hot composting involves construction, rebuilding and reduction phases. The entire process can take about 20 days and is the sure way to kill all pathogens and eggs present in fecal matter.
It is the best way to ensure human waste is composted properly and can be used on edible fruits and food crops as the matter undergoes high temperatures of about 65¬∞C.
How Do We Dispose of Human Waste?
Advancements in life have enabled us to eliminate our waste through toilets. Toilets are available all over the world and require enough water for proper running. Unfortunately, there are some areas where such water may be unavailable, there are breaks in the sewer line, or the toilets are unavailable entirely.
Of all ways to dispose of trash, human waste should never be disposed of with regular trash and should be placed in a separate waste bag.
In doing so, such waste can then be taken to the municipal, city or local composting facilities, that use hot compost and come up with compost that is safe for use on edible crops. You can also come up with your own makeshift toilet where you use a plastic bucket and seat lids.
There are also portable or camp toilets that can be purchased and the mechanism to empty them is easy once they fill up. Another thought is to look for compostable toilets which have a mechanism on how to eliminate or compost human waste with ease.
You can also look for commercially made waste bags that contain powdered absorbent and bacterial enzymes that break down human waste allowing the entire bag to be disposed of in regular trash. However, you will still need a bucket and seat lid for when a toilet is not available.The Royal Commission into Family Violence identified the critical role that schools have in creating a culture of respect, aiming to change Australia‚Äôs story of family violence for future generations. In 2016, respectful relationships education became a core component of the Victorian Curriculum.
Respectful relationships education focuses on building and promoting gender equity in relationships and challenging gender stereotypes. Teaching and learning about respectful relationships is an essential part of a whole school approach to the prevention of gender-based violence.
In 2017, Buckley Park College was selected as a lead school to implement this whole school approach. Our vision was to strengthen our culture of respect and equality across the school, with the aim this would filter out into the entire community via our students. Our efforts have been acknowledged and we have been accepted to continue this work as a lead school in 2020.
Over our journey we have embedded curriculum material across a number of subjects, established a strong working party to drive this work, conducted whole staff training on key messages, established a student voice group, led several partner schools to implement respectful relationships within their schools, hosted a number of student forums facilitated by our students, developed policy to support this work and our journey continues.
At Buckley Park College we see the importance of this work and how implementation of this content will assist our students to be a part of creating genuine and lasting change so that every child has the opportunity to achieve their full potential.

For a general fully continuous life insurance model, the variance of the loss-at-issue random variable is the expectation of the square of the discounted value of the net amount at risk at the moment of death. In 1964 Jim Hickman gave an elementary and elegant derivation of this result by the method of integration by parts. One might expect that the method of summation by parts could be used to treat the fully discrete case. However, there are two difficulties. The summation-by-parts formula involves shifting an index, making it somewhat unwieldy. In the fully discrete case, the variance of the loss-at-issue random variable is more complicated; it is the expectation of the square of the discounted value of the net amount at risk at the end of the year of death times a survival probability factor. The purpose of this note is to show that one can indeed use the method of summation by parts to find the variance of the loss-at-issue random variable for a fully discrete life insurance policy.
The celebrated Hattendorff Theorem [6] in life contingencies is perhaps best viewed as an application of the result that increments of a martingale over disjoint time intervals are uncorrelated [3]. The purpose of this note is to present an elementary derivation of a version of the theorem. The word ‚Äúelementary‚Äù is used in the sense that the key tool in the derivation is the technique of summation by parts.
We consider the model, presented in Sect. 7.4 of [1] and also in Sect. 5.5 of [4], of a general fully discrete life insurance on (x). For j = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, the death benefit in the jth policy year is bj, payable at time j, which is the end of the policy year; the premium paid in the jth policy year is œÄj‚àí1, payable at time j ‚àí 1, which is the beginning of the policy year. Let Kx denote the curtate future lifetime of (x); for simplicity, we shall use K for Kx. The insurer‚Äôs loss at issue random variable is
For j = 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, let jV denote the reserve of the policy at time j; also, define
the present value of the net amount at risk at the end of policy year j + 1. The version of Hattendorff‚Äôs Theorem that we shall derive is
Note that we do not necessarily assume 0V = 0.
Derivation: It follows from the reserve recursion formula,
that
where Œî denotes the forward difference operator. Applying (3) to Eq. (1) yields
Because
Eq. (4) can be rewritten as
with the definition
Thus, deriving formula (2) is equivalent to showing
Because \( \Pr \left[ {K = k} \right] = {}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k + 1}p_{x} = - \Delta {}_{k}p_{x} , \)
To evaluate (8), we use the summation-by-parts formula,
Hence,
which implies
With \( {}_{k + 1}p_{x} \times q_{x + k + 1} = \Pr [K = k + 1] \), the series on the right-hand side of Eq. (9) is
because \( \rho (0)q_{x} = \varphi (0) \). It follows from (9) and (10) that we have derived (7). Thus we have presented an elementary derivation of formula (2).
(i) We were motivated to seek this summation-by-parts derivation because there is a rather straightforward integration-by-parts derivation in the fully continuous case [5, 7]. Let Tx denote the future lifetime of (x). The fully continuous analogues of (1) and (2) are
and
respectively. To derive (12), we apply the following form of Thiele‚Äôs differential equation,
Because \( \int_{0}^{{T_{{_{x} }} }} {{\text{d}}(v^{t} {}_{t}V)} = v^{{T_{{_{x} }} }} {}_{{T_{{_{x} }} }}V - v^{0} {}_{0}V = v^{{T_{{_{x} }} }} {}_{{T_{{_{x} }} }}V - {\text{E}}[L] \), we obtain
Hence (12) is proved if we can show that the expectation of the square of the right-hand side of (13) is
This is equivalent to showing
Equation (14), simpler than its discrete analogue (7), can be readily verified by an integration by parts, as shown on page 43 of [5].
(ii) One may better understand (5) by noting that \( \rho (j)q_{x + j} \) is the present value of the cost of insurance based upon the net amount at risk for policy year (j + 1).
(iii) Formula (2) is particularly useful if the death benefit, payable at the end of the year of death, is a face amount plus the reserve, because the net amount at risk is then just the face amount. (The face amount can be allowed to change from year to year.) Type B Universal Life insurance policies have such death benefits [2, 8].
(iv) As noted above, we do not necessarily assume 0V = 0. For j = 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, let
be the time-j prospective loss random variable; this is (7.4.4) in [1]. Then,
see (7.4.5) in [1]. Formula (2) is generalized as

Customer Reviews
Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Powerful I bought this mixer to replace my smaller Kitchenaid Artisan stand mixer. It's motor is powerful and doesn't bounce off my bench at high speed. It's a great machine however I find it difficult to put the attachments on. I have to have the bowl in place first before fitting the attachments which is annoying should I want to remove the bowl to scrape down. Also another point I don't like about it is that the beater doesn't reach the bottom of the bowl so unmixed flour etc remains stuck. I like the mixer for the power as I make a lot of dough however usability is terrible and would prefer the smaller tilt head design.
Date published: 2021-04-11 3 out of 5 by FECart from It‚Äôs OK, not built as well as older machines After 2 years, this mixer needed a new PCB at a cost of a few hundred dollars. I attempted to contact KitchenAid Australia via their website, Facebook page and messenger (their phone contact waiting time was over an hour). I wanted to ask if it was acceptable for the circuit board to disintegrate after 2 years. 2 months on, I‚Äôve still had no reply. Quite disappointed with the product, but even more disappointed with the service.
Date published: 2020-09 5 out of 5 by Tassiedevil from Excellent mixer as expected from KItchenAid I purchased this mixer predominantly to make dough mix. I still have a KitchenAid KSM150 which is about 20 years old and still working beautifully but as I make enough dough for 2 loaves thought it was time to upgrade. This mixer is a dream, attaching the bowl took a little while to become accustomed to but the mixer is so much more stable when handling a heavy mix. I love both my mixers and would not consider a different brand.

Where can we send your download link?
Print the Play Dough Mat to heavy paper for each of your children. Explain to your children that flowering plants start from a seed. The seed needs 3 things to grow: good soil, water, and sunlight. The seed will sprout when those 3 things are present. As the flowering plant continues to grow, the plant produces flowers and fruit (seeds). The cycle then repeats itself. Write the words for the parts of the flower on a separate sheet of paper or an index card (see photo above). Younger children can use alphabet stamps to stamp the letters (or just the beginning letter of each word) on the line provided on the mat. Older children can write the words or stamp the letters.
Extend the discussions by laminating the flower papers and using as a play dough mat. The children can follow the flower colors or create one of their very own!
Extension #2: Print the following Plant Cards ‚Äì Plant Cards for Preschool and Kindergarten ‚Äì on heavy paper to aid in discussions. Have the children use the cards for a ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù sequencing activity: seeds, sprout, and flower. The children can use the soil, water, and sunlight cards as visuals to paint or draw what ‚Äúingredients‚Äù are necessary for a plant to grow.
Extension #3: Print several copies of the cards, laminate (or cover with clear contact paper), and have the children play a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù style matching game on a table or the floor. Place all the cards face down. Each child should draw two cards, one-at-a-time, to find matching cards. If the cards do not match, the cards are turned face down again and another child takes a turn. The game is over when children have lost interest or when all the matching cards have been found.
Parts of a Flower Play Dough Collage Craft
Materials needed: Brainstorm with your children what materials in the classroom or at home they could use to make the flower. Gather all of the items into a bin (some suggestions: pipe cleaners or Wikki Stix for the roots; any dry bean or black construction paper for the seeds; green construction paper for the stem and leaves; and pipe cleaners, Wikki Stix, or tissue paper for the flower petals).
Have the children make a large play dough area on a table, placemat, or laminated board. The play dough will act as ‚Äúglue‚Äù so none is needed to hold the collage materials in place. Hang a visual for younger children to look at, if desired. Younger children will use the collage materials in many creative ways! Older children, too, will amaze you with their flower creations!

March 15, 2021It‚Äôs easy to feel the weight of expectation when thinking about building culture into your business. The fantasy working environments of Google or Pixar, the radical management practices of Netflix, or the carefully crafted ‚Äòfriendliness‚Äô of Innocent Drinks all feel expensive in terms of planning and investment.
But your company culture already exists. The services your business provides, the people you‚Äôve hired and your shared values are already in place. So how can you go about making it work for you, and what impact will it have?
Crafting a culture statement
A company culture may well ‚Äòemerge‚Äô, but in order for it to be an effective part of your business strategy you need to be able to define and communicate it. By its very nature, distilling your culture into a clear statement has to be a collaborative process with input from your team.
Start by considering the three core values you hold as the leader of your organisation. Then, working with your management team, have them identify three values for each of the following:
- Their personal integrity
- What helps customers decide to do business with you
- What the company wants to be known for
The resulting list may contain overlaps and similarities. Refine what you have whilst bearing in mind the characteristics needed to fulfil the business‚Äôs mission, where your focus should be to achieve success, what qualities you value in who you hire and what traits might conflict with these values. Your final list will form the basis of your culture statement. This should sit alongside your vision and mission statements as the bedrock for your organisation‚Äôs operations.
The impact of a strong company culture
Research has shown that companies who adopt a ‚Äòperformance-enhancing‚Äô culture can achieve up to six times higher revenue growth than those without. But aside from the bottom line, there are other advantages to being able to define and effectively communicate your culture:
- Attract and retain better employees, lowering costs and improving levels of expertise.
Your company culture should seek to support professional success, growth and pride in the role staff play. It should also empower staff and enable autonomy. Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄòResponsibility and Freedom‚Äô policy may be a little too radical for smaller business to implement effectively but the principles are sound. A good culture will provide the context within which staff have the freedom to act in the best interests of the business and the customer in the moment, whilst still upholding the company‚Äôs long-term values. This loose/tight concept is extremely effective in motivating staff and improving performance.
- Ability to adapt to change.
Having a clear set of values and practices independent of specific technologies or processes creates a ‚Äòfamiliar‚Äô environment for customers. This sense of safety means customers are far more likely to come with you when you seek to adapt to a changing marketplace.
- Encourages customer loyalty and advocacy.
A clear culture creates a consistent customer-experience no matter how they choose to interact with you. In a world where poor service is so rapidly shared, consistency and clarity are keys to customer service success.
The power of your company culture comes from its ability to directly impact your customers‚Äô experience of your business and services. It doesn‚Äôt need to consist of expensive planning sessions, grand gestures and sparkling campuses.
A good company culture is one in which your staff can thrive and grow, where autonomy is enabled through a shared vision and where every interaction with your customers makes them feel like a VIP. A well-defined and strategically aligned company culture has the ability to drive all these elements and really set your business apart ‚Äì which ultimately leads to greater impact, greater profit, and greater.On a hot day in early July, the Charlottesville Area Tree Stewards and their teenage helpers were rolling stones at Greenleaf Park.

If you need to prove and allocate construction project delays, you should engage a scheduling consultant qualified with CPM (critical path method) analysis. You should also engage counsel to assist in preserving your rights, as well as presenting and maximing your arguments for delay.
There are numerous methodologies used to quantify and allocate delay. You want to discuss the most effective analysis for your case and facts including whether you want/should use a forward-looking prospective analysis or a backward-looking retrospective analysis that factors in as-built data. In doing so, you want to make sure you understand the pros and cons of each methodology including the bases to attack the methodology that will be subject to cross-examination. The five primary CPM methodologies are as follows:
- As-Planned Versus As-Built. This methodology compares the as-planned baseline schedule to an as-built schedule reflecting progress to assign delay. An as-built schedule that reflects progress includes actual start dates, finish dates, and durations. The actual dates and durations are compared with the as-planned dates and durations on the baseline schedule to determine delay. Under this methodology, the delay impact is determined retrospectively.Don't miss out on the benefits of Advertising Mail
Not so long ago, digital marketing was cited as the death knell for Direct Mail but opinions have been changing and a report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, published on 3 November 2019, raises significant concerns over The Right to Privacy (Article 8) and the Digital Revolution.
The issues in a nutshell
The report itself makes very interesting reading but to summarise, the committee says the ‚Äúconsent model is broken‚Äù and should not be used as a blanket basis for processing, as it puts too much onus on the individual to understand the risks associated with web-based services.
Rt Hon Harriet Harman MP, Chair of JCHR said:
‚ÄúIndividuals are giving away lots of information about themselves when using web-based services and the expectation is that they should know about the risks of using the internet. Individuals cannot be expected to know whether their data is being used appropriately and what risks this poses to their right to privacy. Instead there should be adequate regulation in place to ensure that everyone‚Äôs privacy is protected online.
‚ÄúIt should be simple to know what data is shared about individuals and it must be equally easy to correct or delete data held about us as it was to us to sign up to the service in the first place. These rights already exist, but they clearly have yet to be effectively implemented by companies and enforced by regulators. The Government must address this, urgently. We say it often, but it bears repeating again now: rights are meaningless if not enforced.‚Äù
What‚Äôs going to happen?
Changes to online data collection and sharing are being called for and this will impact on digital marketing and how companies reach their customers online. As more organisations consider the success of GDPR compliant advertising mail it will raise its profile for future campaigns. JicMail stats reveal: 65% of all addressed mail is opened. On average each item is passed on 1.2 times and read 4.2 times by each person who receives it. Not surprisingly the more people in a household, the more a piece of mail is shared and passed on.
Where do I start?
Whatever the size of your business, there are lots of opportunities to benefit from direct mail, from advertising to customer engagement, acquisition to renewal. Citipost Mail can help you with every aspect of the process, including printing and delivery. We will give you access to the best prices and incentive rates to make sure you are never paying more than you need to. Our team will be delighted to talk to you about our range of services including our hybrid mail solution, Digi-Mail, which allows you to upload, print and post your mail without leaving your desk.

Most local building authorities require that even residential electrical wiring meet local code specifications. An inspection must be performed upon completion of work before drywall is installed, and a ‚Äúcertificate of inspection‚Äù provided by the inspector or licensed electrician.
Finding the Right Contractor
When hiring an electrical contractor, make sure they meet these guidelines:
Provide a written quote for the price of the work they will be doing.
Provide references of completed projects, and proof of current liability insurance.
Are licensed for work in your locality
They will obtain the necessary permits and application for inspection
They will provide the signed certificate of inspection upon completion
After selecting a contractor, and when drawing up the contract, be sure to include detailed information on project specifics. Include such things as start and finish dates, specifications of fixtures and materials, and a detailed payment plan. It is normal for the contractor to ask for 10 to 33% of the project cost in advance.
The Inspection Process
Because wiring, circuit boxes, and fixtures must meet electrical code and be inspected before other aspects of the project can be completed, it is important to meet with all other contractors when planning and scheduling work, to insure the project progresses smoothly.
In addition to the mentioned inspections, if there will be any buried cable involved, that will also need to be inspected before trenching is backfilled. Wiring to the meter, the main disconnect, and grounding must also be inspected..Here are some ideas of things to try :

Description
Galletto Radiatori / H2O Performance are available for (Ducati Panigale V4, Panigale 1199, 1098, Monster, Hypermotard, 748,916,996,998 models)
The more horsepower an engine develops the more heat it creates. Once an engine reaches around 85¬∞C (185¬∞F) you start loosing power and at about 118¬∞C (244,4¬∞F) you could loose.
Why an Aluminum Racing Radiator
Although the concept of a radiator is quite simple, getting a radiator to work properly under the extreme conditions of auto racing is not as simple. Most stock motorcycle radiators are not designed to stand up to the stress of racing, this includes both their strength and performance.
Most radiators for street applications are designed around the principle of getting the job done for the lowest possible cost. As a result most stock/OEM radiators are merely adequate for the task of cooling a motorcycle engine during normal usage. Forget about under the stresses of racing. The tubes in a radiator are the primary source of cooling and the fins are secondary. Since tubing is much more expensive than fins, most stock/OEM radiators increase the amount of fins to reduce the amount of costly tubing required. A good aluminum racing radiator does just the opposite. More tube surface for primary cooling and fewer fins allowing it to cool much more effectively. The increased number of fins on a stock/OEM radiator can also adversely affect the performance of the radiator. Since additional fins allow less space for dirt and debris to pass through, it becomes harder for the air required to dissipate heat to pass through the radiator.
This is very important in racing where more dirt, rubber and other debris is present. Additionally, the higher fin count can represent a small air restriction, which causes air to flow around the sides of the radiator rather than through it. One additional thing to keep in mind is that most stock motorcycle radiators are designed to work with unrestricted airflow. When placed behind bodywork it becomes much harder for them to work efficiently.
Two additional benefits of aluminum racing radiators are strength and weight. Most aluminum racing radiators have the tanks welded to the tubes rather than brazed or sealed with epoxy. This makes the radiator much stronger and more capable of standing up to the rigors of racing.
Water and Oil Radiators are supplied with all silicone hoses and fittings.

Fajitas
It‚Äôs one of those favorite dishes on the menu at Mexican, Tex Mex and Southwestern-style restaurants. Fajitas refer to grilled meat or chicken usually served as a taco or alongside grilled peppers, onions and flour or corn tortillas. Fajitas are so simple to make at home. A delicious fajita starts with a great marinade. For this recipe, I‚Äôve chosen a simple combination of ingredients, but if you prefer more heat, you can always add some red pepper flakes or a pinch of cayenne. For the chicken, I prefer skinless boneless chicken thighs, but chicken breasts work well too. For the meat, you‚Äôll want something with a little bit of fat like a skirt or flank steak. With colorful peppers always available, a combination of green, red, yellow and orange bell peppers make a beautiful presentation along with a large, sweet yellow onion. To give the fajitas a real authentic flavor, you can toss your flour tortilla into a hot dry skillet or griddle for just a few seconds to give it the char marks and delicious flavor. Of course, you‚Äôll want to top off your fajitas with all of your favorite fixings‚Äô like avocado, pico de gallo, cilantro, shredded cheese and sour cream. Plan ahead so the protein can marinate for several hours, then fire up the skillet or grill and get cookin‚Äô south of the border style!

- The Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool (VRFCAT¬©) is a computer based virtual reality measure of functional capacity that relies on a realistic simulated environment to recreate routine activities of daily living.
- The VRFCAT contains the components of a shopping trip, including searching the pantry at home, making a list, taking the correct bus, shopping in a store, paying for the purchases, and getting home.
- The VRFCAT, MATRICS‚Ñ¢ Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), and the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment, Brief version (UPSA-B) were administered to a sample of people with schizophrenia to examine concurrent validity.
- These data were also compared to data collected from healthy controls to examine discriminant validity.Frank-Markus Winkler is Managing Partner and member of capiton‚Äôs management Board.

EN-3: Student Life
Does the institution have one or more co-curricular sustainability programs and initiatives that fall into the following categories?:
The name and a brief description of each student group focused on sustainability:
There are over 13 sustainability-related clubs and organizations that are senate recognized for the 2014-15 academic year. These groups range from activism on campus to promoting innovation for sustainability projects to raising awareness of local foods and farms. Collectively, these groups promote sustainability awareness on campus, in the community, and around the world. Dickinson supports these groups financially through student senate, but all are student-governed.
The Sustainability Coalition, also student-governed, is a monthly forum where social, cultural, and environmental groups come together and collaborate. Current members of the sustainability coalition include (many more members participate, but are not listed here): Eco-Reps program, coordinated by the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE), connect sustainability to the residential experience. Eco-Reps are volunteer peer-educators that coordinate outreach and education to a residence hall community about sustainable living, including energy efficiency and the current infrastructure for composting and recycling. Eco-Reps host events in their residence halls and work with residence life staff to make sustainable living options more prevalent in campus housing.
Athletic Eco-Reps:
The Athletic Eco-Reps program plays a strategic role by promoting greater interaction and communication between athletics and sustainability, two prominent stakeholder groups within Dickinson College's community. Dickinson, as well as 5 other schools, created a statewide consortium of colleges and universities to engage student athletes in sports greening and in leadership roles to promote sustainability in athletics and recreation.
The Handlebar Bicycle Co-Op:
The Handlebar, operated and maintained by the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE), operates on co-op model that is 'for' students, faculty, and staff, 'by' students, faculty, and staff. Shop volunteers teach Handlebar users how to maintain their bikes, re-assemble parts, and make repairs when necessary. Volunteers are always welcomed and can be trained through our educational workshop program. The shop and its volunteers reuse bikes and bike parts (formerly EarthNow! and Students Interested in Sustainable Agriculture -SISA) initiates sustainability-related projects and initiatives such as a campus-wide ban on the sale of plastic water bottles, an audit on paper use, and a Green Screen Film Series to view and discuss documentaries. They do event planning including the annual Local Foods Dinner and Earth Fest..

A brief description of gardens, farms, community supported agriculture (CSA) or fishery programs, and urban agriculture projects where students are able to gain experience in organic agriculture and sustainable food systems:
The Dickinson College Organic Farm is a 50-acre working farm and educational resource that provides produce to the college‚Äôs dining hall, a local food bank, a local farmers' market, and 130 families who are members of the Farm‚Äôs Campus Supported Agriculture program. Located a short drive from campus in Boiling Springs, PA, the USDA-certified organic farm includes many sustainable operations practices, such as PV arrays, solar hot-water systems, and biodiesel-run tractors and trucks. Students work on the farm growing organic produce and caring for humanely raised livestock as volunteers and paid student farmers under the direction of the farm manager and assistant farm manager. The farm is also a site for numerous research projects, class visits, service learning projects, workshops, and tours.

A brief description of student-run enterprises that include sustainability as part of their mission statements or stated purposes:
The Idea Fund is a "sustainable project incubator run by students".
The Idea Fund supports social entrepreneurship that empowers citizens to leverage their diverse skill sets, solving problems through innovation and creativity. Dickinson College provides students with a liberal arts education that encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving. The Idea Fund creates a forum through which students may exercise those skills in the Dickinson community. We envision a community that uses top quality academia to innovate and enact positive change.
The mission is to empower students to identify and solve problems in the community by equipping and connecting them with the skills, networks, and resources to effectively design and implement viable projects. These goals are achieved through three main services: Project Consulting, Innovation Grants, and Revolving Loans. All students are welcome to receive Project Consulting, designed to aid students in writing business proposals, applying for funds, building teams, and networking in the Dickinson community for sustainability and beyond.
Example Idea Fund supported project:
The Peddler is a bike-powered coffee convenience cart that sells organic, fair-trade coffee. The store is student-led, owned, and run and maintains the highest standards of sustainability, entrepreneurship, and social justice.

A brief description of the sustainable investment or finance initiatives:
Dickinson does not have a student-managed SRI Fund. However, the Idea Fund manages a revolving loan fund that supports campus projects that conserve energy and promote other sustainability goals. The college committed an initial contribution of $15,000. The fund will be supplemented by estimated cost savings that result from Idea Fund projects.

A brief description of conferences, speaker series, symposia or similar events related to sustainability that have students as the intended audience:
Dickinson annually awards the Sam Rose ‚Äô58 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism. The prize was created to focus attention on the need to reduce the impact of human lives on the planet, particularly given the rising population predictions for this century. The $100,000 prize has now supported three winners who have all conducted 3-5 day campus residencies to interact with students in public lectures, small round table discussions, class visits, and leader lunches. Winners include:
Bill McKibben - 2012
Lisa Jackson - 2013
James Balog - 2014
Mark Ruffalo - 2015
The residencies were established to allow close interaction with students as the donors wanted to endow the prize at Dickinson because they fully support sustainability across curriculum, which promotes student awareness of the environment and training for professional careers in the sciences as well as responsible living for the protection of all life forms.
We themed the whole Fall 2014 semester around the Balog residency in a series entitled One College, One Community.

A brief description of cultural arts events, installations or performances related to sustainability that have students as the intended audience:
Sue Coe, the recipient of the 2013-2014 Dickinson Arts Award, had a week long residency to open her exhibition, The Ghosts of Our Meat. The exhibition explored important sustainability questions on food and agricultural production and ethical considerations of non-human entities.
Additionally, James Balog's exhibit Ice: Portraits of Vanishing Glaciers was hosted Sept. 20 through Dec. 5, 2014 in Dickinson's Waidner-Spahr Library. Visitors were invited to the exhibit featuring 15 color photographs, Extreme Ice Survey's time-lapse video loop, and informational panels that highlighted the effects of climate change on glaciers around the world.

A brief description of wilderness or outdoors programs for students that follow Leave No Trace principles:
The Dickinson College Outing Club aims to foster a respect and love of nature within the student body, the faculty, and the staff by providing the leadership and resources needed to explore the outdoors. The club holds weekly meetings and leads a trip about once a week. Trips include day hikes, backpacking trips, top roping and bouldering rock climbing adventures, kayaking excursions, and camping trips. The club follows Leave No Trace principles and trains fellow students in the principles. Beginning in Fall 2014, Outing Club leads pre-orientation programs that introduce new students to outdoor resources in our region.
The Dickinson Outing Club has maintained a strong contingency of members trained in Leave No Trace policies. Their members seek to implement sustainable practices during their excursions. Additionally, many members are involved in various sustainability initiatives on campus and enhance their appreciation for the natural world through this club and other opportunities.

A brief description of sustainability-related themes chosen for themed semesters, years, or first-year experiences:
The theme for the Spring 2014 Clarke Forum speaker series was water. Concerns about a coming water crisis are gaining the attention of scholars, not just in countries where water is scarce, but globally. Water scarcity and water quality are interrelated problems that are both likely to deteriorate in the face of climate change. Speakers explored how water impacts all of us in ways we are often unaware. Topics ranged from the global to the local, from the impact of climate change on regional water scarcity, to the prevention of conflict about water resources, and the implications of drinking bottled water.
The semester theme in spring 2013 was Living in a World of Limits, which brought Bill McKibben, David Orr, Michael Mann, Michael Shellenberger, and other speakers to campus. In 2010-2011, Dickinson had a year-long theme, Food for Thought, which brought Eric Schlosser, Michael Abelman, Marion Nestle, Anna Lappe, Sandra Steingraber, Heidi Skolnik, Jenn Halpin, Sally McMurry, and other speakers to campus.
The website URL where information about the theme is available:
A brief description of program(s) through which students can learn sustainable life skills:
Students learn bike repair at The Handlebar Bicycle Co-Op. At The Handlebar, we operate with a 'Hands Off' policy, empowering our co-op users with the opportunity to challenge themselves while learning bike mechanics. ‚ÄúHands Off‚Äù means that volunteers do not repair others‚Äô bikes; they simply assist in bike repair and educate visitors on tips and tools of bike repair and maintenance. Volunteers are allowed to demonstrate how to do something or to offer an extra hand. Patrons may become frustrated when unable to perform a specific task, but sometimes it takes more than one try to use a tool successfully or to get something right. The slow and sometimes frustrating process of figuring out a task on one‚Äôs own proves far more educational than simply observing an experienced volunteer at work. Volunteers always relay their methods and tips when working with bikers and never underestimate another person‚Äôs abilities and desire to learn.
The website URL where information about the sustainable life skills program(s) is available:
A brief description of sustainability-focused student employment opportunities:
The Center for Sustainability Education, The Alliance for Aquatic Resource Monitoring, and The Dickinson College Farm all hire students to run programming and operations. These three programs consistently employ over 30 paid student positions each semester. Additionally, paid, sustainability-focused student employment exists with sustainability summer camps offered by Dickinson, Dickinson Dining Services, and GIS projects.
The overarching goals of all these positions are to provide students the opportunity to create and/or improve sustainability programs and/or operations at Dickinson College in an effort to fulfill the objectives of our climate action plan and educate students on how to live more sustainably.

A brief description of graduation pledges through which students pledge to consider social and environmental responsibility in future job and other decisions:
The Sustainability Graduation Pledge allows graduating students to commit to:
‚ÄúI PLEDGE TO APPLY SUSTAINABILITY LEARNING AND VALUES FROM MY DICKINSON EXPERIENCE AS I EXPLORE AND IMPROVE THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF ANY ORGANIZATIONS FOR WHICH I WORK AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH I LIVE."
The sustainability graduation pledge has been active since 2013.
Graduating seniors are also eligible to join Alumni for a Sustainable Dickinson, a group founded in 2003 that works to promote sustainability at Dickinson amongst our alumni community..Camiant aims to provide a single multi-service platform for provisioning, bandwidth management and billing interfaces for broadband services

Camiant selling to Tekelec for $130M

//= $authorImg ?>
Save Article
Marlborough-based Camiant Inc. has agreed to be acquired for $130 million by a North Carolina IP and mobile data management company, Tekelec. According to Tekelec officials, the sale is expected to close within a week, subject to the usual closing conditions. Susie Kim Riley, founder and chief technology officer of Camiant, said that Tekelec would ‚Äúmake an ideal partnership to extend the power of policy control and create the foundation of the intelligent multi-service network.‚Äù Riley was named a Mass High Tech Woman to Watch honoree in 2006. According to Riley, the Camiant staff of more than 100 employees will stay on in Marlborough and become Tekelec employees once the sale closes. ‚ÄúThis is a strategic acquisition and there are absolutely plans to keep on doing what we need to, to meet our 2010 and 2011 goals,‚Äù Riley said. For her part, Riley will become chief marketing officer of Tekelec and will remain based in the Marlborough office which will become ‚Äúa center of excellence for Tekelec in the Boston area,‚Äù she said. Riley said it was Tekelec‚Äôs solid standing in the market that made it attractive as a buyer. ‚ÄúI think Tekelec is a company that has very sound footing in its business. It knows how to really scale a business,‚Äù she said. Camiant focuses on policy control, technology that regulates what types of applications can be used on a typical mobile or broadband platform, and what rights those applications have within the operating platform. The company, which was founded in 2003, has 30 customers worldwide, including Verizon, Vodafone, Sprint, Comcast and Cox Communications, and it lists more than 100 employees. Privately held Camiant had raised at least $16 million in funding from Matrix Partners, North Bridge Partners and Pilot House Ventures, according to federal documents. The company‚Äôs last funding round was in 2006, worth $8.1 million. Tekelec also purchased subscriber data management company Blueslice Networks Inc. of Montreal for $35 million.

Now MCU fans can bring these powerful artifacts home thanks to a new series of scale-model collectibles called the Marvel Museum Collection.
Each of these pieces ranges from 6 to 8 inches tall and features an accurate recreation of a different weapon or mask from an MCU movie, complete with a decorative display base. The first Marvel Museum Collection wave will consist of four collectibles - the Iron Man Mark VII helmet, Cap's shield, Black Panther's helmet and Thor's hammer Mjolnir. Get a closer look at all four pieces in the slideshow gallery below:
The Marvel Museum Collection is produced by Hero Collector, an imprint of the UK-based Eaglemoss that focuses on genre properties like Marvel. While Eaglemoss generally offers figurines and collectibles through subscription services or through specialty retailers, the company is taking more of a mass-market approach to this series. All for Marvel pieces will be sold in Walmart stores beginning in May 2021, before debuting through other retailers and on the Eaglemoss website.
Naturally, this first wave barely scratches the surface of the iconic weapons and costumes in the MCU. With any luck, we'll see Hero Collector tackle everything from the Infinity Gauntlet to Star-Lord's helmet to the Eye of Agamotto in future waves. Let us know what MCU weapons you'd like to own in the comments below.

This mindset doesn‚Äôt allow business owners to see that their company is both a business and also a brand. While you may think that you are saving time at the moment, ignoring creating a brand identity can cause you more headaches down the road. IF you choose to ignore your business‚Äôs branding then your messages may be getting through to your audience but may produce undesired results. While not an immediate issue, the impact from this method will get you more questions than sales, and customers who may not understand your brand, so they purchase from competitors.
In order for your small business to compete, you must create a connection with your audience through engagement, marketing, and messaging. Your brand is one of the most valuable assets to your business, and when done right can bring amazing benefits. We will walk you through some tips on how to create a brand identity for your local small business.
Brand Identity 101
Your business‚Äôs brand identity is more than just a logo or a name. A brand identity is the culmination of how your brand feels, looks, and speaks to clients. It influences the customer experience and affects how others view your business. With all of this in mind, your small business‚Äôs brand identity will not reveal itself to your overnight. It takes research, time, and deep thinking, and once accomplished, will bring great results.
Research is Key to Brand Identity
You cannot create a brand that resonates with your customers if you don‚Äôt research who your customer base is. First, take the time to truly understand and learn about your primary and secondary audiences. Develop archetypes that define their interests, hobbies, and values.
Once you have this deeper understanding of your customer base, move on to competitive research. Look at how other companies in your industry position themselves in terms of personalities, themes, and visual elements.
Finally, don‚Äôt forget to interview the people closest to your business, your employees. They have an important point of view on how the company should be portrayed. They also can help you with what has and what has not worked with your brand in the past.
Create Assets
Once you finish doing research, you can begin the fun part. You get to translate all of what you learned into a visual asset. Here is a list of common assets brands use.
- Logo
- Color Scheme
- Typography
- Iconography
- Photography and Other Graphics
Refine Your Current Brand‚Äôs Identity
Your brand‚Äôs identity may change over time, and that is totally acceptable. Once you have created your initial brand identity, start refining it based on feedback from your customers. Try testing out new strategies and methods to see what works best. Always make sure to ask customers who are loyal to your business for their feedback. This not only creates a closer connection with them but also helps you learn what really works and what doesn‚Äôt.
These are just some of the many different methods that you can use to help your small business brand become more recognizable, which will benefit you in the long run.

Story and photos by Mark Shaffer
It‚Äôs the time of year in the Lowcountry when all you have to do to break a sweat is walk outside; when the slightest bit of exertion raises a serious risk of spontaneous combustion. Our favorite way to avoid bursting into flames involves the combination of ‚Äúconditioned air‚Äù (God bless you, Mr. Carrier) and alcohol (thank you, God). What follows is a breakdown of our favorite watering holes in the historic district. The research was exhaustive.
ON THE WATERFRONT
Hemingway‚Äôs (above)
920 Bay St.
(843) 521-4480
Open daily at 11:00am.
The joint was named after him on a whim, but Papa would feel right at home here. The bar‚Äôs practically painted with character. Located in the bottom of the magnificent Thomas Law Building, Hemingway‚Äôs is a first class dive bar and a one-of-a-kind on the waterfront. This is where Beaufort‚Äôs service industry professionals go to drink. On an average night you might need a shoehorn and a can of Crisco to squeeze into the joint. It‚Äôs also the perfect spot for a pre-lunch eye-opener or a post work shot and beer. Sundays are made for the bar‚Äôs famous ‚Äì and inventive ‚Äì Bloody Marys under the pergola on the breezy dog-friendly patio. Tell Zo√´ we sent you.
The actual heart pine bar seats half a dozen patrons with a few tables along the whitewashed brick wall. The place is festooned with autographed currency ‚Äì an old sailor‚Äôs tradition. Back in Beaufort‚Äôs movie-making days this was a hangout for stars and crew alike. The ‚ÄúWall St.‚Äù subway sign from ‚ÄúDie Hard III‚Äù hangs on the wall. Happy hour runs from 5-7 daily with 50 cents off beer and $1.50 off liquor and the usual cheap shots, so to speak.
Luther‚Äôs Rare and Well Done
910 Bay St.
(843) 521-1888
Open 11 am daily
Each time I walk into Luther‚Äôs I expect to find Norm Peterson and Cliff Claven arguing over ‚ÄúFinal Jeopardy.‚Äù Luther‚Äôs has a serious Cheers vibe (no accident) but with a terrific view of the river. The Marine Corps flag flies over the shady pet-friendly deck and families pack the place during graduation weekends at Parris Island. The Corps motto ‚Äúsemper fidelis‚Äù (‚Äúalways faithful‚Äù) certainly applies to Luther‚Äôs crack team of regulars whom you‚Äôll find polishing the same bar stools on any given day swapping stories and telling lies.
Portraits former owners Charles and Julie Luther hang on the east wall with a sign bellow that reads, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt drink all day unless you start in the morning.‚Äù The faithful have taken this to heart. There‚Äôs something happening most nights with live music Thursday through Saturday. Daily happy hour runs 4-7 with booze & beer discounts. Damn good burgers.
Plums
904 Bay St. (843) 525-1946
Open daily at 11 am
The year Plums opened ‚ÄúTop Gun‚Äù was flying high at the box office. The bar‚Äôs aged a lot better than Val Kilmer. Both Plums and its fine dining sister establishment, Saltus, pack in locals and visitors alike. I once had a conversation with a couple from Chicago who‚Äôd been coming to Beaufort every spring for nearly two decades. They looked forward to sitting in the window seats at the bar all year long. ‚ÄúWhy here?‚Äù I asked. The woman grins. Her husband points to the view. ‚ÄúBecause we don‚Äôt have that in Chicago,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd here it comes with cold beer and fried oysters.‚Äù That‚Äôs Plums in a nutshell..
Q On Bay
822 Bay Street
(843) 524.7771
Open daily at 11:00 am
Four things matter most at Q: barbecue, beer, sports and music. What Q does better than anyone else downtown ‚Äì or north of the Broad, for that matter ‚Äì is craft draft. You‚Äôll find 32 rotating taps of seasonal brews at Q like the Holy City Farmhouse Ale from just up highway 17 and the Fat Pig Bearded Ronin from some other place farther away. (Hey, is that PBR hiding between the Stone IPA and Abita Blueberry Wheat?) Order up a beer flight to taste your way through the high gravity stuff while avoiding the usual consequences.
Q features happy hour from 4-7 with discounts on beer and well liquor and there‚Äôs live music from Wednesday through Saturday. Thursday nights bear witness to the growing local legend of the Bull Grapes. There are few spots better to catch a game on the giant flat screens or just sit and soak up the river view. Oh, and there‚Äôs barbecue ‚Äì all manner of barbecue. And the sliders and tacos come in a variety of flavors including brisket, pulled pork & chicken, shrimp & fish. The slow smoked wings, however, rule.
Saltus River Grill
802 Bay St.
(843) 379-3474
Open daily 4pm
If it weren‚Äôt for the perfect view of the Woods Memorial Bridge the Sonoma style patio might fool you into thinking you were in California wine country. Inside the sleek, stone topped bar whispers sophisticated metropolitan chic. Here we begin the search for Beaufort‚Äôs best craft cocktails ‚Äì specialty drinks made from fresh ingredients that are either invented in-house or riffs on classics. Saltus also boasts a world-class wine list and a good selection of draft and bottle beers, including seasonals and micro brews.
But for us the major draw is the sushi and Tuesday it‚Äôs half price. Saltus also has a raw bar with select oysters and seasonal specials and Chef Brian Waters‚Äô small plates are locally sourced and seasonal.
OFF THE WATER
Emily‚Äôs Restaurant and Tapas Bar
906 Port Republic St.
(843) 522-1866
Open 4:00pm daily
Owner Tommy Winburn bought the massive antique bar on eBay and flew to Wisconsin to find it ‚Äúin a barn in about a hundred pieces.‚Äù A photo of the original location in Little Chute hangs on the wall. The former owners wandered in recently and shared some bar lore. The story goes that before he became the target of Elliott Ness‚Äô Untouchables, Al Capone would hang out there conducting mob business between Milwaukee and Chicago. During the glory days of Lombardi‚Äôs Packers, the bar in Little Chute was a favorite spot for players far from curfews and restrictions. So, belly up to that sprawling piece of well-worn American oak and imagine sharing it with the original Scarface and NFL Hall of Famer, Paul Hornung. My guess is that Hornung would be more fun.
There‚Äôs no happy hour but the price of cocktails drops on Port Republic Street and the wines are fabulous values by glass or bottle. A good selection of bottled beer makes up for a lack of draft. The tapas menu is huge and you can‚Äôt go wrong with Chef Long‚Äôs award winning fried oysters. In the fall local Gamecock faithful gather here and on the first Saturday in May hats are worn and whiskey is spilled on Derby day.
The Old Bull Tavern
205 West Street
(843) 379.2855
5:00 pm ‚Äì till, Tues ‚Äì Sat
Five nights a week you‚Äôll find one of Beaufort‚Äôs most vibrant social and culinary scenes beneath los cuernos del Toro, the horns of the bull. Some bars pour booze. The Old Bull makes cocktails. Chef John Marshall‚Äôs throwback sensibility is evident on the cocktail menu with a short list of classics like The Corpse Reviver #2 (gin, Lillet Blanc, Cointreau, lime juice and Pernod) from Harry Craddock‚Äôs classic 1930 ‚ÄúSavoy Cocktail Handbook.‚Äù
House Cocktails change with the seasons and the available local ingredients (the Bull‚Äôs all about local). At this writing the LBG is a cool summer mix of lemon, basil, canton ginger and vodka. My personal favorite is the Purgatory, a sassy blend of silver tequila, fresh grapefruit juice, honey and a kiss of habanero. Favorite bar snacks include the Green Eggs & Ham (wasabi deviled eggs & prosciutto) and the artisanal wood fired pizzas. Hint: if you want a seat at the bar, get there early.
Breakwater Restaurant and Bar
203 Carteret St.
(843) 379-0052
Open Monday ‚Äì Saturday 5pm
Luxuriously appointed with plush leather banquettes and George Nelson bubble lamps the bar & lounge at Breakwater echo a bygone era of style and grace. Call it casual sophistication. When we started this column back in ‚Äò09 I wrote that ‚ÄúMaybe this is a little like the vibe in Sherman Billingsley‚Äôs famous Stork Club back in the day. It‚Äôs not hard to imagine Frank and Marilyn canoodling in a corner or Rocky Marciano knocking back a shot and a beer at the bar, his knuckles still swollen from knocking out Archie Moore.‚Äù Much of the impressive ‚Äúwall of wine‚Äù is available by the glass, and this is the only happy hour off the waterfront with discounts on beer, wells, wine and bubbles. Expect stellar service here. Breakwater‚Äôs crack staff of mixologists whips up seasonal craft cocktails and classics to pair with the daily food specials. Get more mileage out of your martini with small plates like the Waygu Beef Sliders and Crispy Seared Pork Belly. Chef Shaw‚Äôs fried chicken is pure love on a plate.

Aspen electeds consider citywide face mask zonE
Aspen City Council on Monday voted on first reading on an ordinance that would require people to wear face coverings in all indoor and outdoor public spaces throughout the city limits.
If passed on final reading Tuesday night, there would be no exemptions for those who are exercising, or those on a bike.
The new law would eliminate the current rule that masks only need to be worn if a person is going to be within six feet of another and are not part of the same household.
It also would exempt people who are stationary while eating al fresco, as well as indoors.
There also are exceptions for age and medical condition. Also exempt are those inside a private residence or working in a professional office who do not have face-to-face interactions with the public or co-workers. Performers, who are 25 feet away from spectators, also would be exempt.
A majority of council during Monday‚Äôs special meeting agreed that the emergency ordinance, if passed, be in effect immediately and last until Nov. 1, when it would be reevaluated.
Council members Rachel Richards, Ann Mullins and Skippy Mesirow were in support for the zone to encompass everything in city limits to keep the message simple and clear that wearing a mask is necessary all the time in public to slow the spread of COVID-19.
Council member Ward Hauenstein and Mayor Torre favored a more condensed area, known as the ‚Äúcentral zone,‚Äù which encompasses the areas between Original/Neal Street on the east, Aspen Street on the west, Aspen Mountain to the south and the Roaring Fork River.
Hauenstein said he would extend it to Herron and Newbury parks, the No Problem Joe Bridge area and the base of Highlands.
He and Torre said they were concerned about compliance in such a large area like the entire city. They also said the zone is to address condensed areas where aerosol spread of the virus is more likely.
Torre and Hauenstein voted in favor of the citywide zone to move the ordinance forward for further discussion on Tuesday but voiced their reservations.
‚ÄúI hate to vote against this but I have serious questions‚Äù on such a wide swath of the city, Torre said. ‚ÄúThis is tough stuff guys ... unprecedented is not a word that is underutilized these days.‚Äù
Because it‚Äôs an emergency ordinance, four out of five council voters must vote in the affirmative for it to pass.
Richards and Mullins, who supported a more condensed zone last week, said feedback from citizens since then have convinced them to get more draconian.
‚ÄúThe fear that our residents are developing of our guests I think is a very negative thing,‚Äù Richards said. ‚ÄúThere is starting to be some real disdain and questioning whether we should be a community like this at all, a tourism community, when our guests don‚Äôt seem to care about our health or our public safety ... people are worried about this ... (the virus) is spreading like no tomorrow.
The city of Aspen is beefing up its health protection team and aligning it with Pitkin County‚Äôs to ensure better compliance with COVID-19 public health orders.
The team is in the process of following up on 14 complaints forwarded by the county that were received by members of the public between July 15 and July 22.
The complaints that require investigation are being extracted from the county-wide database, which had a total of 60 complaints since it‚Äôs been up and running for the past month, according to C.J. Oliver, the city‚Äôs director of environmental health.
He said team members will contact the business in person to discuss the complaint, or potential violation, and provide whatever assistance they need to tighten up the operation so they are complying with local and state orders.
‚ÄúWe are trying to get them to understand what is expected of them and help them,‚Äù Oliver said.
He is in the process of hiring two new full-time consumer and employee health protection specialists, who will help with education, compliance and other COVID-19 matters.
One individual, who has a background in retail management, is scheduled to start Aug. 6.
The other person, who currently lives in Eagle and has a background in public health and retail, has the job offer but is looking for housing and will either accept or decline by Wednesday, Oliver said.
Both employees will be paid just under $30 an hour and will receive full benefits.
The positions are open-ended.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have these folks in the field as long as there‚Äôs COVID compliance to be done,‚Äù Oliver said.
As part of its $6 million COVID-19 relief and recovery package that Aspen City Council approved in April, $350,000 has been committed to the health protection team.
That money goes to full-time staff, equipment, technology, specific printing and record-keeping systems.
The current city health team, which consists of a handful of city staff members and community resource officers, has been in the field for about a month.
Because of their regular job duties, they are limited to a couple of hours a day to focus on COVID-19-related issues.
The new specialists will provide a more consistent presence in the community, Oliver noted in a memo to council for its Monday work session.
It also will add capacity to the city‚Äôs COVID-19 response, which has been behind in some regards as public health orders continue to change.
‚ÄúI feel like we‚Äôre trying to play catch-up,‚Äù Oliver said, adding he looks forward to offseason so he can get the team up to speed to help businesses prepare for winter.
Additionally, his team is working closer with Pitkin County staff to better align health protection efforts in both jurisdictions to make sure information is consistent for all businesses and people who are subject to the public health orders in the area.
‚ÄúI want people to experience seeing the same thing at the ABC as they are in Snowmass Village and here in Aspen,‚Äù Oliver said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to be in lockstep with the county and I‚Äôm excited to get these ships aligned.‚Äù
Shared information includes databases for tracking contacts, communication on enforcement actions and county public health support with subject matter expertise, and tools to perform complaint investigations and contacts with businesses.
County staff is attending the city‚Äôs health team meetings to assist and collaborate, and city staff is taking part in county discussions for similar reasons, Oliver said.
County staff has been sorting through the complaints that don‚Äôt require an official investigation, or are not actually violations of the public health order.
Those types of complaints make up at least one-fourth of the volume coming into the county, according to Oliver.
Data recently provided to the Pitkin Board of County Commissioners indicated that more than 70% of complaints are occurring in the city.
Oliver said the city will use the county database to extract trends and identify focal points in the field.
The majority of complaints are originating from behavior in restaurants and from those who are concerned about people not wearing face coverings, according to Oliver.
There have been a small number of businesses that have been challenging and have required more frequent visits as public health orders have come down.
Some have been issued notices of violation of the county public health order, which is prosecuted through the county.
Scarlett‚Äôs, a restaurant and bar, along with The Gym in Obermeyer Place, have been cited for allegedly violating aspects of the public health order.
However, Oliver said the majority of restaurants are working cooperatively with staff to establish systems to help ensure ongoing compliance with the public health orders.
‚ÄúI feel like we are making good progress,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere have been significant improvements in the businessRobert Eckelman

The chef, who founded the non-profit World Central Kitchen, told Yahoo! News in a recent interview that he feels this position would be vitally important, especially as Americans are facing immense challenges related to food and hunger during the COVID-19 pandemic. Feeding America estimates that one in six Americans could face hunger as a result of the pandemic. Jos√© said that this proposed position would be separate from the Department of Agriculture and focus specifically on food itself and the systems around distributing it and accessing it.
‚ÄúWe need to understand one thing: that food is more than the USDA. Food is more than just all of the mechanics of a smart agricultural system,‚Äù he said in the interview: ‚ÄúFood is immigration. Food is health. Food is national security. Food is job creation. Food is economic growth."
‚ÄúWe need to make sure that we have somebody near the president that sees food as what it is: a very important issue that sometimes falls between the cracks,‚Äù he continued.
This isn't the first time he has called for such a position. The chef wrote an op-ed for The New York Times last week titled simply "We Need a Secretary of Food."
"This pandemic year has reminded us of so many things we have forgotten, or ignored. But it will also show us the path forward, to someday feeding all of America equitably. By returning to our roots, I believe we can build a better future for ourselves and our communities," he wrote in part.
Jos√© has shown support for Joe Biden in the past and the two even discussed food insecurity and the state of the restaurant industry during a town hall hosted by Yahoo News. While he said he is happy with his current roles and wouldn't say if he would take such a position, it's clear Chef Jos√© will continue to step up to support and advise leaders.
‚ÄúIf President Biden needs my help or the help of the other 350 million Americans I know, all of us, we will be there,‚Äù he told Yahoo!. ‚ÄúMyself, I‚Äôm there already, I don‚Äôt need to be called.‚ÄùNovember 18, 2020
Thousands more apply for MD unemployment as legislatures work to improve the system
Credit: WDVM, Roshan Davis
MARYLAND (WDVM) ‚Äî Seventeen-thousand Marylanders have applied for unemployment benefits just within the last week, according to Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, and that number is only going up. With coronavirus restrictions increasing across the state, many residents are once again facing the possibility of losing their jobs.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the unemployment rate in the state has more than doubled, according to Maryland Congressman David Trone. And as cases spike all over Maryland, state legislatures are looking for ways to continue to assist their constituents as current protections expire.
‚ÄúPeople are literally being evicted from their homes because they‚Äôre not able to receive these unemployment insurance benefits,‚Äù said Van Hollen.
Even with representatives working to provide aid to Maryland residents, legislatures worry that the state of unemployment will get worse before it gets better and that Marylanders could see a shocking rise in the percentage. Even with the holiday season approaching, during which many people find temporary work due to the increased demand for retail employees, large layoffs are expected to occur around the start of 2021.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question,‚Äù said Trone. ‚ÄúI could see ten percent unemployment, frankly, in a heartbeat.‚Äù
This is no doubt a stressful thought for residents of the state. Thousands of people are still waiting in long phone lines to reach the Department of Labor, and have been waiting for several weeks or months to be able to file their claims. State legislatures are aware of this backlog and are calling for something to be done.
‚ÄúWe are grateful to all the people who are processing those claims,‚Äù said Van Hollen. ‚ÄúBut we also have to fix the system. The state of Maryland needs to improve.‚Äù
Along with working to improve the speed of processing claims, Maryland legislatures are working to expand the reach of the state‚Äôs benefits in order to help people who may have been previously left out of the conversation.
‚ÄúThe new legislation we‚Äôre working on will pick up part-time, gig workers, and extend for full-time workers, while this pandemic continues to reach the absolute high point it‚Äôs ever had,‚Äù said Trone.
Maryland‚Äôs congressional leaders seem to be cautiously optimistic about the future of pandemic relief, but they also emphasize that all Marylanders must work together in order to better our situation.
‚ÄúIf we want to open our schools and our economy, the best thing we can all do is wear a mask and listen to the public health experts,‚Äù said Van Hollen./cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46654080/usa-today-8672934.0.jpg)

In its recommendations, the randomly selected Thuringian Citizens' Forum Covid-19 calls on the state government to avoid further area-wide school closures if possible. "This was one of the most important demands," said Justice Minister Dirk Adams (Greens) at the presentation of an interim report by the Citizens' Forum on 14 September 2021. He emphasised that the demand had mainly referred to education, but that the Citizens' Forum also pleaded in other areas to avoid closures in autumn and winter as far as possible.
The dialogue format had been initiated by the state government to get the citizens' opinion on how to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim was to incorporate the recommendations of the citizens' forum into further planning for future pandemic emergency situations. The forum was launched at the beginning of June 2021; the participants met online in four regular sessions and in one working group session. They were advised by experts. According to one of the participants, the number of participants fluctuated between 30 and 51.
55 recommendations
About 55 recommendations for measures from the citizens were included in the interim report..
In the area of care and health, the 13 immediate measures include sponsorships and networking of staff for improved working conditions. In addition, framework conditions for the training of refugees in care are to be created. Bureaucratic processes are to be shortened through digitalised application procedures. The Citizens' Forum has also suggested creating low-threshold further training offers on digital competence locally. In addition, projects for the further training of volunteers should be subsidised unbureaucratically.
Digital teaching concepts and more transparency
In the area of education, the Citizens' Forum advises striving for appropriate digital teaching concepts and educational reform and increasing motivation to learn. In the area of work and culture, the participants suggest that opening scenarios should be explained and justified more transparently. They reject a blanket closure of institutions. There should be vouchers for the use of cultural institutions. Educational work on hygiene measures should be intensified.
Furthermore, the Citizens' Forum recommends the establishment of a Covid-19 hotline and a digital noticeboard for citizens' questions and suggestions. The importance of sport in general as a contribution to health should be focused on.
Citizens' Forum a reflection of the population
For the citizens' forum, 4,002 randomly selected citizens from 73 Thuringian municipalities were contacted. The citizens' forum was then formed from 52 people who were interested in participating. These 52 participants corresponded to the composition of the Thuringian population in terms of region, gender and age group.
A final survey showed that the majority of the participants could imagine participating in citizens' forums on other topics. Most participants are in favour of a mixture of digital events and face-to-face sessions. Only 18 per cent would like to see further citizens' forums conducted predominantly in face-to-face sessions.
More citizens' assemblies on Covid-19
The Thuringian Citizens' Forum Covid-19 was one of several randomly selected citizens' assemblies that discussed measures and ways out of the Covid-19 crisis. The German states of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Saxony had also convened such citizens' assemblies. Citizens' assemblies on the pandemic also existed in France at the national level and in the three cities of Chamb√©ry, Grenoble and Nantes, in Bristol, England, and in the US state of Oregon.

For we will not require that you punish our accusers;IIL ‚Äî diver. But lest we should seem to be reasoning sophistically, we consider it right, before giving you the promised many her that is divorced from another husband, committeth adultery.‚Äù And, ‚ÄúThere.‚Äù.‚Äù.‚Äù And again He answered them, ‚ÄúRender therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar.‚Äù
CHAPTER XVIII ‚Äî PROOF OF IMMORTALITY AND THE RESURRECTION.,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúFear not them that kill you, and after that can do no more; but fear Him who after death is able to cast both soul and body into.
CHAPTER XXI ‚Äî? And what kind of deeds are recorded of each of these reputed sons of Jupiter, it is needless to tell to those who already know. This only shall be said, that they are written for the advantage and encouragement.
CHAPTER XXII ‚Äî ANALOGIES TO THE SONSHIP OF CHRIST..
CHAPTER XXIII ‚Äî THE ARGUMENT.
And that this may now become evident to you‚Äì(firstly), of which there is neither witness nor proof‚Äìwe shall bring forward the following proof.
CHAPTER XXIV ‚Äî VARIETIES OF HEATHEN WORSHIP.
In the first place [we furnish proof], because, though we say things similar to what the Greeks say, we only are hated on account of the name of Christ, and though we do no wrong, are put to death as sinners; other men in other places worshipping trees and rivers, and mice and cats and crocodiles, and many irrational animals. Nor are the same animals esteemed by all; but in one place one is worshipped, and another in another, so that all are profane in the judgment of one another, on account of their not worshipping the same objects. And this is the sole accusation you bring against us, that we do not reverence the same gods as you do, nor offer to the dead libations and the savour of fat, and crowns for their statues, and sacrifices. For you very well know that the same animals are with some esteemed gods, with others wild beasts, and with others sacrificial victims.
CHAPTER XXV ‚Äî FALSE GODS ABANDONED BY CHRISTIANS.
And, secondly, because we‚Äìwho, out of every race of men, used to worship Bacchus the son of Semele, and Apollo the son of Latona (who in their loves with men did such things as it is shameful even to mention), and Proserpine and Venus (who were maddened with love of Adonis, and whose mysteries also you celebrate), or AEsculapius, or some one or other of those who are called gods‚Äìhave now, through Jesus Christ, learned to despise these, though we be threatened with death for it, and have dedicated ourselves to the unbegotten and impossible God; of whom we are persuaded that never was he goaded by lust of Antiope, or such other women, or of Ganymede, nor was rescued by that hundred-handed giant whose aid was obtained through Thetis, nor was anxious on this account that her son Achilles should destroy many of the Greeks because of his concubine Briseis. Those who believe these things we pity, and those who invented them we know to be devils.
CHAPTER XXVI ‚Äî MAGICIANS NOT TRUSTED BY CHRISTIANS..
CHAPTER XXVII ‚Äî GUILT OF EXPOSING CHILDREN., the things which you do openly and with applause, as if the divine light were overturned and extinguished, these you lay to our charge; which, in truth, does no harm to us who shrink from doing any such things, but only to those who do them and bear false witness against us.
CHAPTER XXVIII ‚Äî GOD‚ÄôS CARE FOR MEN. reason why God has delayed to do this, is His regard for the human race. XXIX ‚Äî.
CHAPTER XXX ‚Äî WAS CHRIST NOT A MAGICIAN?
But lest any one should meet us with the question, What should prevent that He whom we call Christ, being a man born of men, performed what we call His mighty works by magical art, and by this appeared to be the Son of God?.
CHAPTER.
CHAPTER XXXII ‚Äî CHRIST PREDICTED BY MOSES.aea,.
CHAPTER XXXIII ‚Äî MANNER OF CHRIST‚ÄôS BIRTH PREDICTED. (Saviour).
CHAPTER XXXV ‚Äî.‚Äù
CHAPTER XXXVI ‚Äî DIFFERENT MODES OF PROPHECY.
But when you hear the utterances of the prophets spoken as it were personally, you must not suppose that they are spoken by the inspired themselves, but by the Divine Word who moves them. For sometimes He declares things that are to come to pass, in the manner of one who foretells the future; sometimes He speaks as from the person of God the Lord and Father of all; sometimes as from the person of Christ; sometimes as from the person of the people answering the Lord or His Father, just as you can see even in your own writers, one man being the writer of the whole, but introducing the persons who converse. And this the Jews who possessed the books of the prophets did not understand, and therefore did not recognise Christ even when He came, but even hate us who say that He has come, and who prove that, as was predicted, He was crucified by them.
CHAPTER XXXVII ‚Äî UTTERANCES OF THE FATHER.
And that this too may be clear to you, there were spoken from the person of the Father through Isaiah the prophet, the following words: ‚ÄúThe ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master‚Äôs crib; but Israel doth not know, and My people hath not understood. Woe, sinful nation, a people full of sins, a wicked seed, children that are transgressors, ye have forsaken the Lord.‚Äù XXXVIII ‚Äî UTTERANCES OF THE SON.
And when the Spirit of prophecy speaks from the person of Christ, the utterances are of this sort: ‚ÄúI have spread out My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to those who walk in a way that is not good.‚Äù And again: ‚ÄúI gave My back to the scourges, and My cheeks to the buffetings; I turned not away My face from the shame of spittings; and the Lord was My helper: therefore was I not confounded: but I set My face as a firm rock; and I knew that I should not be ashamed, for He is near that justifieth Me.‚Äù And again, when He says, ‚ÄúThey cast lots upon My vesture, and pierced My hands and My feet. And I lay down and slept, and rose again, because the Lord sustained Me.‚Äù And again, when He says, ‚ÄúThey spake with their lips, they wagged the head, saying, Let Him deliver Himself.‚Äù And that all these things happened to Christ at the hands of the Jews, you can ascertain. For when He was crucified, they did shoot out the lip, and wagged their heads, saying, ‚ÄúLet Him who raised the dead save Himself.‚Äù
CHAPTER.
CHAPTER XL ‚Äî CHRIST‚ÄôS ADVENT FORETOLD,.‚Äù And we have thought it right and relevant to mention some other prophetic utterances of David besides these; from which you may learn how the Spirit of prophecy exhorts men to live, and how He foretold the conspiracy which was formed against Christ by Herod the king of the Jews, and the Jews themselves, and Pilate, who was your governor among them, with his soldiers; and how He should be believed on by men of every race; and how God calls Him His Son, and has declared that He will subdue all His enemies under Him; and how the devils, as much as they can, strive to escape the power of God the Father and Lord of all, and the power of Christ Himself; and how God calls all to repentance before the day of judgment comes. These things were uttered thus: ‚ÄúBlessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful: but his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law will he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, which shall give his fruit in his season; and his leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever he the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine new things? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast their yoke from us. He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I been set by Him a King on Zion His holy hill, declaring the decree of the Lord. The Lord said to.‚Äù

CHAPTER XLVII ‚Äî DESOLATION OF JUDAEA.‚Äù.
And again, how it was said by the same Isaiah, that the Gentile nations who were not looking for Him should worship Him, but the Jews who always expected Him should not recognize.‚Äù
CHAPTER L ‚Äî HIS HUMILIATION PREDICTED..
CHAPTER LI ‚Äî THE MAJESTY OF CHRIST..‚Äù Hear, too, how He was to ascend into heaven according to prophecy. It was thus spoken: ‚ÄúLift up the gates of heaven; be ye opened, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty.‚Äù And how also He should come again out of heaven with glory, hear what was spoken in reference to this by the prophet Jeremiah. His words are: ‚ÄúBehold, as the Son of man He cometh in the clouds of heaven, and His angels with Him.‚Äù
CHAPTER LII ‚Äî CERTAIN FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY.
Since, said in like manner with reference to this; it is as follows: ‚ÄúTheir worm shall not rest, and their fire shall not be quenched;‚Äù.‚Äù

CHAPTER LVII ‚Äî AND CAUSE PERSECUTION..
CHAPTER LVIII ‚Äî AND RAISE UP HERETICS..
CHAPTER LX ‚Äî PLATO‚ÄôS DOCTRINE OF THE CROSS.
And the physiological discussion concerning the Son of God in the Timoeus of Plato, where he says, , both vipers and asps, and every kind of serpent, which slew the people; and that Moses, by the inspiration and influence of God, took brass, and made it into the figure of a cross, and set it in the holy tabernacle, and said to the people, ‚ÄúIf ye look to this figure, and believe, ye shall be saved thereby.‚Äù And when this was done, it is recorded that the serpents died, and it is handed down that the people thus escaped death. Which things Plato reading, and not accurately understanding, and not apprehending that it was the figure of the cross, but taking it to be a placing crosswise, he said that the power next to the first God was placed crosswise in the universe. And as to his speaking of a third, he did this because he read, as we said above, that which was spoken by Moses, ‚Äúthat the Spirit of God moved over the waters.‚Äù For he gives the second place to the Logos which is with God, who he said was placed crosswise in the universe; and the third place to the Spirit who was said to be borne upon the water, saying, ‚ÄúAnd the third around the third.‚Äù And hear how the Spirit of prophecy signified through Moses that there should be a conflagration. He spoke thus: .
CHAPTER LXIV ‚Äî FURTHER MISREPRESENTATIONS OF THE TRUTH. [Cora, i.e., the maiden or daughter] at the spring-heads. For, as we wrote above, Moses said, ‚ÄúIn the beginning God made the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and unfurnished: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.‚Äù In imitation, therefore, of what is here said of the Spirit of God moving on the waters, they said that Proserpine [or Coral was the daughter of Jupiter.. And in like manner the actions of those others who are called sons of Jupiter sufficiently condemn them..
CHAPTER LXVIII ‚Äî CONCLUSION.rian‚Äôs decision, but because we know that what we ask is just. And we have subjoined the copy of Adrian‚Äôs epistle, that you may know that we are speaking truly about this. And the following is the copy:
EPISTLE OF ADRIAN IN BEHALF OF THE CHRISTIANS..
EPISTLE OF ANTONINUS TO THE COMMON ASSEMBLY OF AS.
EPISTLE OF MARCUS AURELIUS TO THE SENATE, IN WHICH HE TESTIFIES.
The First Apology of St. Justin Martyr, a defense of the Christian Faith addressed to the Roman Emperor around 150AD by the Roman Teacher and apologist, Justin who was later martyred in Rome for his faith. Justin treats of idolatry, heresy, prophecy, and the symbolism of the cross. He mentions Plato, Moses, the apostles, and many figures from the new and old testament scriptures. Most fascinating is his reccounting of the charges against the Christians which led to their exection‚Äìatheism, cannibalism, and sexual perversions associated which what Romans had heard about their eucharistic rituals. To correct these misconceptions, Justin provides an outline of baptism and the eucharistic liturgy of the Roman church at that time which provides us with a priceless glimpse into early Christian worship.

As Justin investigated the matter, his realized that he had found the wisdom that he had been searching for all of his life. Justin then became a Christian teacher and lived for a while in Ephesus, after which he moved to Rome, the Imperial Capital. He wrote and spoke openly about Christ, addressing two ‚Äúapologies‚Äù or defenses of the Christian faith to the emperor himself. Justin Martyr became one of the most influential teachers of the 2nd century. Though contemporary writers tell us that he wrote extensively on many topics, only his two apologies and his Dialogue with Trypo, the Jew, survive today..Office Tab Enterprise 14.10 Crack is an ad for Microsoft Office group.

As I close out one year and look forward to the next, I‚Äôm getting excited about a few places I know I‚Äôll be going: a few countries in Europe and the western USA.
My one big regret now that my daughter is off to college is that we never made a long trip out west to hit the wide-open spaces of states like Wyoming. Sure, we carted her off to lots of exotic destinations around the world, but we never hit the major state parks of the Great American West.
I‚Äôm planning to make up for that in the coming year. I‚Äôve got somewhere to be in Montana in September, so I think we empty nesters with no school schedules to deal with now are going to take the whole month to explore that state and Wyoming.
If it were winter I‚Äôd want to go skiing, but I‚Äôm thinking September might still be a good time to stay and take hikes from any of the cabins in Jackson Hole. My wife‚Äôs not much of a camper, but a nice cabin with a porch view she can live with. The National Elk Reserve is near here too.
I know the the stunning natural beauty of Wyoming is the main draw, so we‚Äôll probably do some lake kayaking, some biking on lonely roads, and just enjoying some quiet time in nature. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the tentative list of places to visit in Wyoming to work the rest around.
Devil‚Äôs Tower National Monument
The Devil‚Äôs Tower National Monument was the first declared national monument in the United States. This ominously named monument has a summit is almost a mile above sea level. There are a lot of legends and strange theories that try to explain its creation, so naturally it was the setting for the classic sci-fi movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I‚Äôve been wanting to go here ever since I saw that film in theaters 40 years ago.
Its shape makes it look like an entrance to the underworld, thus the Devil‚Äôs Tower name that stuck. In reality though the origin is more prosaic: it was formed by volcanic activity in the area and then erosion.
I think we‚Äôll be able to shoot some photos from different angles since there are eight miles of trails here that span the rock and the surrounding meadows. It would be especially stunning toward the end of the day in September, when the autumn sun turns it red. It looks like the nearby Belle Fourche River is a good place for kayaking or rafting too.

It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing that my schoolteacher sister has been to Yellowstone National Park but her travel writer brother has not. This is the world‚Äôs oldest national park, after all, designated in 1872. It spans 3,468 square miles (8,983 square km), so it‚Äôs not hard to get away from the car and RV crowds. ‚ÄúJust go a couple miles in on any trail,‚Äù someone who lived near there told me once, ‚Äúand you may not see another soul.‚Äù
Most people just visit the Old Faithful Geyser (erupting every 92 minutes) and hot Prismatic Springs near the parking lots, but in this vast area there are lots of trails through forests and meadows where animals roam. Plus there are grand mountains next to postcard-perfect lakes, so I‚Äôm looking forward to roaming the area for a while with my camera.
Update ‚Äì I fixed this! I made it to Yellowstone National Park for three days in September of 2019. It blew me away and was like nothing else I have ever experienced. Just try to go when it‚Äôs not peak season though. It gets quite crowded in the summer.
Grand Teton National Park
There are 200 miles of trails in Wyoming‚Äôs Grand Teton National Park, so I‚Äôm looking forward to some good hikes around these majestic mountains. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be doing any backcountry camping with my wife along, so I won‚Äôt have to worry about the $45 fee. Or this: ‚ÄúBackpackers are required to carry approved bear-resistant canisters except where food storage boxes are provided.‚Äù
It‚Äôs $35 per vehicle to get into the park, but I think we‚Äôll spring for the annual America the Beautiful pass, which gets you into every national park and federal site (2,000 of them) for just $80. That covers everyone in your car, so we‚Äôll both be set. If you‚Äôre active military or are a fourth-grade child, it‚Äôs free. If you‚Äôre a senior citizen, it‚Äôs $80 now, but that covers you for life.
There are also log cabins for rent by one of the lakes but despite how rustic they are, they‚Äôre pricey. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be staying at the Jackson Lake Lodge either since a room with a view is $449 a night, even in late September.
Thermopolis
After a few days of hiking, we‚Äôll be ready to hit the hot springs of Thermopolis. You don‚Äôt really think of Wyoming as a land of volcanoes since there are no active cones sticking up, but volcanic activity is the force behind the bubbling mud and geysers of Yellowstone. It‚Äôs also why you get hot springs in the aptly-named Thermopolis town.
Their website bills the place as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs largest mineral hot springs,‚Äù so I guess they‚Äôll have room for two more in September. And hey, the Hot Springs State Park Bath House is free! There‚Äôs also a swinging bridge and the Wyoming Dinosaur Center, plus herds of bison are roaming around, so I should get some good photos from there.
One of the Dude Ranches
We‚Äôre not sure where yet, but we‚Äôll probably end up at a dude ranch for a few days at least. It seems like one of the natural things to do in Wyoming to see the landscape on horseback instead of through the windows of a car. I know from previous experience that I suck at milking cows though, so I think I‚Äôll skip that part.
Update ‚Äì From a travel writing prize I won, we got to stay at The Ranch at U Cross outside of Sheridan. No milking or chores, just horse riding and hiking.
We‚Äôll have to make a second trip to get to the great national parks to the south we haven‚Äôt been to yet, though we did make it to Bryce Canyon and Zion in Utah on an earlier trip.

Can you figure out motions in a repeating pattern?
Paige began a repeating pattern with pat, clap, clap.
- What could Paige‚Äôs next three motions be? Show your thinking.
- What will Paige‚Äôs 10th motion be? What about her 20th motion? What about her 50th motion?
- What is a repeating pattern? What could Paige repeat?
- What could Paige do next? After that? And after that? Why does that make sense to you?
- What will the 82nd motion be in Paige‚Äôs pattern? What will the 99th motion be in Paige‚Äôs pattern?
- How can you determine what any number motion will be without working all the way through the pattern?
- Imagine Paige telling you she was starting a pattern that is different from the one you thought of. What else could her pattern be?
This task asks students to create a repeating pattern given the first three motions of pat, clap, clap. Although not identified by content standards in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, describing, duplicating, and extending repeating patterns is foundational for primary students. Patterns and generalizations are at the core of doing mathematics as students engage in repeated reasoning and look for structure across mathematical domains.
While many students may perceive the pattern as an ABB pattern and extend it on this basis, that is not the only solution. In fact, students may generate diverse patterns using these three actions as a starting point. For example, students may:
- Add a pat or a clap to create a four-motion core unit of pat‚Äìclap‚Äìclap‚Äìclap (ABBB) or pat‚Äìclap‚Äìclap‚Äìpat (ABBA)
- Add one or more new motions to create a core unit of four or more motions (e.g, pat‚Äìclap‚Äìclap‚Äìear tug for an ABBC pattern)
The outcomes for the 10th, 20th, and 50th motions will depend on the repeating pattern that students have created and extended. Students may extend their repeating patterns through the 50th motions, or they may look for predictability in the numbers for the motions. For example, if they extend an ABB pattern, all of the second B‚Äôs (the second clap in the pattern‚Äôs core) will fall on multiples of 3. These landing points for that motion can be used to identify motions for numbers that are not multiples of 3 by either extending beyond or working backward.
Students may choose to use an app to create an alternative representation of their repeating pattern.
- In the Pattern Shapes app, students might create an equivalent pattern using pattern shapes. For example, if they consider these three motions the start of an ABBC repeating pattern, they might represent and extend the pattern using green triangles (A‚Äôs), orange squares (B‚Äôs), and blue rhombuses (C‚Äôs) (as shown here).
- Alternatively, students might use the Number Frames app to create an equivalent representation of an ABB repeating pattern using counters or other images. They might even use a customized frame structure to duplicate and extend the pattern core and highlight predictable quantities (as shown here).
- The Number Line app provides a structured tool for tracking motions in the repeating pattern. If students create an ABBA pattern using Paige‚Äôs first three motions and an added pat, representative labels for these motions can be positioned on the number line and extended through any number of motions (as shown here).
Recognizing, describing, and extending repeating patterns are valuable mathematical activities in their own right. To push students‚Äô thinking further, consider asking them questions that attend to the patterns in positions of specific motions. What do you notice about the pats? How could you predict the next pat or any pat? What do you know about the numbers before or after the pats? Questions such as these will help students extend their thinking about repeating patterns to generalizations related to multiplication and even division with remainders!20 November 2019Runet Rating 2019: Mobile app developers ratings

I really didn't need it but I just couldn't leave it in the shop! I kept looking at the box. Yesterday Bob was in the mood to get something done so I asked him to hang it.
It is cute, I was given one several Christmas's ago, it also remained in the box for a couple of years.

How big would you make the letters?
I want to make a wallhanging from a quote I found, it would be five lines, the longest line would be 25 (type count) words. I always seem to make original artwork to big, so would like some thoughts on how big you would make the letters.
Jo
I don't understand why you need to rip it. First of all, it is a wonky quilt. You could cut it straight and let the cubes be slightly off kilter and it would look great. If you want them straight, cut the background fabric slightly off kilter so it winds up being square. Then quilt as desired. It would waste some fabric, but I publicly promise that if you deplete your fabric stash, I will buy you some.
I think I'm missing the issue here. Then again, I am the president of the half ass club, so there is that to consider.
I wondered why you hand basted it. I would have loaded the wide fabric on the long arm and basted it there, but again, I don't always understand what y'all are talking about.
1/12/21
I can answer these all important questions since the project is mine. :-) Not Ami's. :-)
Re wonky quilt: it wasn't supposed to be wonky. It inadvertently turned out that way. It offends my sensibilities that the placement defied my dictates. I don't mind that the shape of the hexagons isn't rectangular ... *that* part was intentionally asymmetrical and I like that. But, doggone it, the hexagons themselves ought to on the straight and narrow! No drunken hexagons!
Re cutting the background off kilter: yep, I considered that. But having the background off-grain, once again offends my sensibilities. I worry that when I quilt it to an on-grain backing, what kind of horrors will I experience? Perhaps none but I'm looking at the glass half-empty. I know the other shoe is gonna drop and reveal itself when the quilting is done.
Re President of Half-Ass Club: I salute you. I hope you find the other half. :-)
Re hand basting vs basting on the longarm: I thought about this and here's the scenario that I came up with. I'm worried that I'm gonna get bubbles in the hexagons if I just lay the hexies on top of the background fabric and baste. I'm worried that the hexies will "travel"" on the top because I'm basting as I go with nothing to hold the hexies in place.
I had thought that if I hand baste the hexies first then hand applique the perimeter, I can then cut away the background fabric underneath the hexies. In this manner, it would be kinda like if I had put borders only all the way around the hexies. Then I'll have only one layer on the longarm.
If I leave the background fabric under the hexagons, there will be a LARGE expanse of hexies on top of the background fabric, attached only around the perimeter. I think that is a disaster waiting to happen because the tension on the background fabric will be different than the tension on the hexagon applique.
So, that was my thought process. Convoluted and quite possibly over-thinking it, but that's the way my brain operates. :-)
You and Mishii crack me up!!!
You and Pirate crack me up!!

This morning has been an interesting time. In some donations came this HUGE quilt top of foundation-pieced 5‚Äù blocks. It was in one huge piece and a Long row of 3 blocks strip.
i didn‚Äôt really want to make more blocks. But, I didn‚Äôt want to waste any of them. Adding 3 rows to the big piece made it HUGE and HEAVY. I knew my ladies would NOT like finishing that. So I figured out I could rip both pieces in half and then join the 1/2 strip to the smaller quilts.
so, I have 2 of these. They are about 50 x 70 each. Somebody did some crazy piecing!

Abstract
In this paper a general methodology for the analysis of large concrete dams subjected to seismic excitation is outlined. It is valid both for gravity dams (2D representation) and arch dams (3D representation). The method allows for non-linear material behaviour of the dam, ‚Äòtransparent fictitious boundaries‚Äô for dealing properly with in-coming and out-going seismic waves, and an efficient procedure to deal with dam-soil-fluid interaction. The mechanical behaviour of concrete is modelled using an isotropic damage model which allows for tension and compression damage, and exhibits stiffness recovery upon load reversals. Emphasis is placed in the treatment of fluid-structure interaction, regarding both formulation and efficiency aspects. A gravity dam and an arch dam are analysed subjected to artificially generated earthquakes of different intensities, and the results are used to study the degree of (un)safety of the dams.

Institutions, like my own, are grappling with how to utilize new technologies to develop distance-learning strategies that would be equivalent in methodology and outcome to traditional residential programs. Many educators, fascinated by the glamour, ask themselves, "How can I use this awesome technology to do distance learning?" The result is often strong in the "Gee-Whiz!" factor, but it remains to be seen whether or not students learn.
Another approach, one which I have chosen to follow, is to attempt to isolate the educational methodologies that have proven most effective in traditional situations. These methods would then be implemented in a distance-learning form using whatever technology best accomplishes the educational goal.
The "Simulated Lecture" Model
For example, consider the lecture-that venerable relic of the information-starved Middle Ages. If students back then could have photocopied or electronically transmitted information with the ease with which we can do so today, I doubt whether the lecture would even have survived as an educational medium. Yet it is one of the most emulated models in modern distance learning programs.
The typical high-tech simulated-lecture is one in which satellite classes participate remotely in a class held on the home campus. Watching the presenter on a video screen, the remote class has an audio (and/or video) link with the instructor, who-in the most advanced implementations of this model-is able to view the remote audience(s) as well as local students. While this model d'es make classes available to certain satellite locations, it d'es not make them accessible from virtually every location.
Furthermore, the need to hold the satellite classes at the same time as the home campus means that working students may not be any more free to attend a satellite class than a normal residence class. I referred to this model as the "simulated lecture" because such great emphasis is put upon the presenter. The instructor presents the information, technology conveys it to the student, who then-we hope-absorbs the information. Interaction with the instructor is typically limited to questions and answers, and it is this rather modest degree of interaction that distinguishes this mode of instruction from a videotaped lecture.
The Correspondence Course Model
Another popular educational model adapted to high-tech distance learning is essentially a high-tech form of the correspondence course. Technology is used to deliver course materials, interact with the instructor/grader, deliver assignments for grading, take exams, etc. Yet the basic limitations of the postal form of correspondence course remain in effect: students study in splendid isolation, maintaining a tenuous touch with their grader/instructor by means of e-mail or telephone.
While the correspondence course model allows students to take classes anywhere the underlying technology will reach, and to participate according to their own individual schedules, the model lacks the crucial ingredient of interaction with other students. Since one instructor may be working with many dozens of extension students, the level of student-instructor interaction is often not particularly high.
In fact, my first exposure to correspondence course instruction acquainted me with the cursory style typical of the genre. A red-inked "Nice work" was often the sum total of feedback resulting from 14 hours of study, research and writing.
A final objection to the correspondence model is its inherent lack of credibility from an accreditation point of view. While it may be argued that a well-run correspondence course can produce a better outcome than a mediocre residence class, the perception remains that correspondence programs are not educationally credible.
The Online Mentored-Seminar Model
A third educational methodology seems to me to be superior to either the lecture or the correspondence course model. I refer to the small group seminar, where students-guided by a faculty mentor-discuss course material with which they have previously grappled individually. Following are some criteria for a well-conducted course objectives are met and that all participants have equal opportunities to benefit from the discussion.
How can a mentored seminar be adapted to meet the needs of a geographically diverse student population that must interact asynchronously? In other words, students must be free to choose when they participate and from wherever they live. The obvious medium that springs to mind is electronic mail. Can mentored seminars be implemented using e-mail as the sole instructional medium?
Case Study of an Online Seminar
In an effort to investigate the possibilities of online mentored seminars, I arranged to conduct an experiment that merged a distance-learning module with an already-scheduled resident school course: Church History Survey. The objective was to simulate a geographically diverse group of students who would participate at times of their own choosing.
My student test population differed substantially from what a genuine mentored-seminar population would look like. In an actual online course, students who register for it would either already have access to e-mail and the skills to use it, or would be sufficiently motivated to acquire them. No one in my test population had ever used e-mail; only two were familiar with the concept. Further, none had registered for the course because they were attracted to the online module.
In fact, most students initially felt the online module to be a burden; it turned out to be a very good thing to have scheduled the online module during the seventh and eighth weeks of a nine-week quarter. The first six weeks were crucial for educating the test population in the desirability of acquiring new communication skills and in helping them to attain minimal competency in using e-mail.
My test population, therefore, could fairly be said to represent a worst-case for testing the mentored-seminar model: they were ignorant and unmotivated. If the model proved effective with this group, it would likely be equally effective with a motivated group who already had e-mail skills.
The mechanics of how a "seminar" can take place using e-mail requires explaining about a "list-server." A list-server (also called a list serve) is a program that automatically re-mails e-mail messages to a list of recipients. This is what makes it possible for each participant to communicate with the "group," just as takes place in a live seminar.
Our list-server was set up so that students would address mail to it at the address [email protected] The list-server would then re-mail the message to all participants. In this way every student received what every other student posted to the group. A list-server also makes it possible for students to participate using any computer or e-mail system to which they have access. We believe that the ability to use a wide range of computers and software at relatively slow transmission speeds is important if students from Third World countries are to participate. Since the International School of Theology has sister schools in Asia and Africa, we wanted to be sure that the technical requirements were not beyond the reach of the lowest common denominator.
Key to Online Discussion-the Thread
The list-server provided the mechanics of interaction, and the use of "discussion threads" provided the framework. Each student had been assigned chapters to read, assignments to prepare, and exams to take as a part of the normal residence class. These went on in parallel with the online module, and would probably be a part of any mentored-seminar online course.
Instead of in-class discussion, however, the online discussion was stimulated by an initial, somewhat open-ended question, posted by the instructor. This question was designed to begin a "thread" of discussion that would accomplish some portion of one or more of the course objectives.
Students could respond to the thread question in a variety of ways, but each had to respond to every thread at least twice each week. Students could respond to some aspect of the thread question, challenge the validity of some assumption of it, or otherwise post a message indicative of grappling with the theme of the discussion. The first response posted gives the next student the opportunity to interact with the original question, or some aspect of the predecessor's response. In the same way, subsequent posters-now receiving in their electronic mailboxes the cumulative discussion-could interact with many aspects of the developing discussion.
Mentor Do's and Don'ts
The role of the mentor is to monitor the discussion-thread as it evolves, making sure that fruitless avenues of exploration are pinched off, and that course objectives are fulfilled. He or she d'es this by judiciously posting supplemental questions that re-orient the thread-discussion. This format presupposes that motivated students with access to information sources and who are interacting in a community of scholars are capable of educating themselves on the course content.
It is important for mentors to not assume a heavy-handed approach to moderating the discussion, or to begin to lecture. Note that students were encouraged to begin "unofficial" threads on class-related subjects of their own choosing. These threads operated exactly like the official ones except that participation was not mandatory.
In addition, students were free to interact privately with each other by e-mail-mail not directed to the list-server. Such mail is accessible only by the addressee(s)-not even the mentor can read it. This informal mode of interaction would be analogous to students whispering together during class. While usually undesirable in a residence classroom, it could have important learning benefits in an online seminar.
A final advantage of the online seminar is that all interactions can be preserved by participants. Messages can be collected by thread-topic, saved, edited and become permanent records for future reference. This contrasts with the completely ephemeral nature of verbal discussions in live seminars.
Key Observations from the Study
The results of the experiment were illuminating, and exceeded my expectations in all areas. Here are some of the issues addressed in the experiment:
- Would students assume "ownership" of the discussion, or would they merely make purely pro forma responses in order to meet the minimum requirements of the course?
While the first two or three postings appeared rather stilted, students were quick to begin interacting with each other with considerable passion. By the third day the ice was fully broken, and students had all but forgotten the original thread-question as they rushed into furious debate on thread-related issues. Even though each student was only required to participate in each thread three times a week, most participated between four and six times a week.
- Would students be stimulated by online discussion to the point of pursuing their own educational objectives?
It became evident very quickly that the student-to-student interaction grew sufficiently intense that individual, self-directed research began to take place. Deeply involved with the course material, students began to cite authorities to buttress their arguments. Some drew from very obscure corners of the library for facts and quotations that they hoped the group would find persuasive.
It was especially refreshing to see how frequently students analogized from current events to historical situations in the period under study. I interpreted this as evidence that they were going beyond absorption of information and were actively synthesizing it with their understanding of the present.
- Would students be able to overcome the inherently "high-tech, low-touch" medium of e-mail and generate some form of class esprit?
The most surprising aspect of the online culture that developed was how it bore little relationship to the live, in-class culture that evolved during the first six weeks of the course. Students had to get to know their "e-mail-selves" all over again, with occasional misunderstandings and friction as a result. Several times a student would chide another for what was perceived as excessively strong language. Students also shared helpful tips, such as how to easily quote from previous messages in order to provide a context for their own input.
I found that the orientation to e-mail that I gave in the weeks prior to the online module was not nearly as effective as online student-to-student counsel. When I was unable to deliver a new thread-question on schedule (I was in Ukraine and my e-mail connection was not functioning), the students decided to formulate their own thread question, which they posted. This was so successful that when I rejoined the discussion I found the online debate in full swing, with several students expressing a desire to continue the online discussion into the Christmas break.
- Would the shy, reserved, generally non-participatory students find the online seminar more conducive to their personalities?
This turned out to be the case. Those who participated the least in class often posted the most thoughtful, cogently reasoned arguments in the online forum. One student wrote me private e-mail expressing his great satisfaction at having as equal an opportunity to interact with the group as those whom he considered natural persuaders. In this sense, the media of the online seminar evened the playing field quite a lot, and individuals made substantially more equal contributions than in a typical "live" seminar situation.
Further Questions Remain
While the online seminar module of the course proved to my satisfaction that most of the positive qualities of a graduate seminar could effectively be replicated in an online version, some significant issues remain:
- Quality versus quantity.
It may be argued that the total participation of an individual in an online seminar over the course of a term might amount to only a few dozen pages of text, an amount that might represent the verbal contribution of a single seminar in a face-to-face group. Can an online seminar be truly comparable to a live, real-time seminar in the face of such a disparate amount of participation?
In fact, the quality of the online discussion content was, in general, far superior to the general run of live-seminar discussion. The fact that each student had access to the whole discussion thread gave them the broad context in which to make significant new contributions. Knowing their input would be carefully scrutinized by the group caused them to think through their proposals carefully, research them fully, and argue them persuasively.
- The role of supplemental materials.
Since the experimental online seminar was piggy-backed on an existing residence class, students were exposed to live lectures and live discussion, as well as the usual reading, research and written assignments. Through the medium of e-mail, an online seminar could utilize similar reading and written assignments. Texts and supplemental course content could be e-mailed to students, just as they could submit written products for evaluation.
But what of the "face-to-face" aspects of a live seminar? Is it absolutely necessary to include videotaped lectures to supplement the online discussion? This aspect of online seminars remains undecided.
Conclusion
Based on this study, it is apparent that the model of the mentored-seminar, an educational model that dates back to Socrates and Plato, has enormous flexibility and educational integrity in its online form. While more research needs to be done, it seems likely that online mentored-seminars have the capability to provide an educational experience equivalent in methodology and outcome to those conducted live in an on-campus setting. Furthermore, they are based on technology that is firmly in place on a worldwide basis. Finally, this model makes great use of our greatest educational resources-motivated students-and has great potential for fulfilling the promise of online education in a cost-effective, human-centered form.

Ingredients
- 200g/1& 2/3 cups chickpea/gram flour
- 1 tsp vegan bouillon powder or crumbled stock cube
- 450ml warm water
- 1-2 tbsp olive oil for batter + 1-2 tbsp olive oil to grease the baking tray
- 75g/about 5-6 whole artichoke hearts, sliced (tin or jar)
- ¬Ω red onion finely sliced (optional)
- 50g/about 8 whole sun dried tomatoes (chopped into thirds with scissors). If using the dried variety, soak in hot water; if the ready-soft in oil from a jar.
- About 8 pitted black olives. Use whole or chop roughly
- 20g vegan hard cheese (cubed) (optional) - we like Violife Prosociano, a vegan Parmesan-style cheese
- Black pepper and salt
- Handful of chopped dill and 1 tbsp chives, chopped fine with scissors plus a bit more of each for garnish
Instructions
- Pour the warm water into a large bowl and sieve the gram flour into it plus the vegan bouillon. Make sure you whisk constantly to avoid lumps. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave for at least a couple of hours - or overnight.
- Preheat the oven to 220¬∞C (fan)/450¬∫F/Gas Mark 7. You can be prepping the rest of the ingredients now if you wish.
- Remove any foam that has formed on top of the batter and then stir in the 1 tbsp olive oil, dill, chives, salt and pepper.
- Line the bottom of a baking tray (or oven proof skillet) with the 1-2 tbsp oil so it forms a thin coating. Heat in the oven for a few minutes until smoking hot.
- When the oil is hot enough, remove the tray from the oven and pour in the batter. Then add the olives, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, capers, red onion and vegan cheese chunks (optional). Or try the potato and pea option - see above!

Low temperature is one of the most important environmental stimuli that control gene transcription programs and development in plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the HOS1 locus is a key negative regulator of low temperature-responsive gene transcription. The recessive hos1 mutation causes enhanced induction of the CBF transcription factors by low temperature as well as of their downstream cold-responsive genes. The hos1 mutant plants flower early, and this correlates with a low level of Flowering Locus C gene expression. The HOS1 gene was isolated through positional cloning. HOS1 encodes a novel protein with a RING finger motif near the amino terminus. HOS1 is ubiquitously expressed in all plant tissues. HOS1-GFP translational fusion studies reveal that HOSt protein resides in the cytoplasm at normal growth temperatures. However, in response to low temperature treatments, HOS1 accumulates in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of HOS1 in wild-type plants causes cosuppression of HOS1 expression and mimics the hos1 mutant phenotypes.

This is based in recent history. Pew recently took a look at what several big-city school districts, Chicago included, have done with shuttered school buildings (PDF). Reuse as charter schools has been the most frequent:
It's hard to unload a school building, as Pew found. They're not just big, old, intended to be single-use, and expensive; closing schools tend to follow population decline, which means the buildings are often in generally declining neighborhoods that are not only undesirable on the real estate market but surrounded by plenty of other vacant buildings. WBEZ's Elliot Ramos made an excellent series of maps that shows how the schools on the CPS's current list also cluster near abandoned properties and city-owned vacant lots. Be sure to scroll down to the last map, which shows just how dense those can be. So it's not too surprising that the buildings are recycled into other government uses, including charter schools.
The Pew Report also demonstrated just how much the Chicago charter-school population has spiked in recent years.
This did make me wonder how Chicago's charter school population compares to other cities in its weight class (Phoenix, as a result of its massive annexation, is covered by double-digit school districts, so I left it out). It turns out that, despite the big percentage increase, we're near the bottom (all data from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools for 2011-2012):
New York: 4.7%
San Francisco: 5.9%
Atlanta: 10.3%
Chicago: 11.1%
Dallas: 11.7%
Los Angeles: 14.9%
Houston: 17.8%
Philadelphia: 23.4%

If you are an experienced casino player, be it offline or online casino, then you must be familiar with texas hold‚Äôem poker. Have you heard of slow playing texas hold‚Äôem poker? If yes then we bet the first you heard it, you thought slow playing is taking time to make your decision or moving your hands slowly. It is one big misconception.
The term slow playing is used to mention a player playing strong hand weakly so that he or she could encourage other players or better-called opponents so that they can be encouraged to stay in the hand and also may be contributing more chips to a pot that a player is expecting to win.
This idea is similar to the word ‚Äúsandbagging.‚Äù In this, a player who loses the nuts watches the other opponent lead with a bet, he doesn‚Äôt rise, instead of that he just calls or sandbags to disguise the strength of his hand.
If you want to compare then slow playing is a bit like other complex games such as check-raising or raise. It wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to say that slow playing is a deceptive play and if it is handled smartly then it can result in winning a bigger pot as compared to what you have had while playing a strong and fast bet. Today we will tell you some of the dos and the don‚Äôts.
Let‚Äôs first talk about
Do‚Äôs
Let‚Äôs consider a situation where you have flopped very strong and slow playing would be one of the options, you got eight hearts and eight aces that are appearing on the flop to provide you with a set. In this case, you have the strongest hand. Below are some of the factors that can affect the game.
Do slow play versus aggressive player
This technique works best when you are playing with an opponent who is playing a high percentage of hands (also called loose). Also can be played with the opponent showing a tendency to bet and raise a lot of post-flop which are termed as aggressive. These opponent players are not likely to bet the hand for you.
While playing against such players it can be beneficial to simply call on the flop, then raise the turn with your set. It is obvious that against a few loose players you will want to continue betting your strong hand and let them successfully raise you. This could also be seen as a better way to achieve even more chips in the middle.
Some Don‚Äôts
Resume the same situation that we created- you have flopped that set of eights. Now let‚Äôs look at a factor that should be kept away from the game while slow playing.
Don‚Äôt play versus tight opponent
If the opponent tends to fold too much and play a few hands which are called tight, slow playing is usually a bad idea. Also, when they do play they are doing a lot of checking and calling. We cannot count on these players to bet themselves and that‚Äôs why you need to work on building a pot after you have flopped that monster.:format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/R-6680366-1461625005-1131.jpeg.jpg)

The article investigates the attempt by the German legislator to monopolize the national gambling market. Since January 2008, the new gambling treaty aims to organize the gambling market in a well-regulated manner as well as to reduce gambling addiction. An analysis of the market structure reveals that the treaty lacks a reasonable economic justification. Moreover, an empirical investigation of current market practices shows that the prohibition of online gambling has led to various monopoly avoidance strategies on the part of both the German gambling industry and gamblers themselves. Finally, the new regulation faces various legal challenges with respect to the EU Services Directive. The article proposes an alternative regulation, which may overcome the current economic and legal difficulties.

Some very creative jobs, others not so interesting creatively but interesting in other ways, the team of people working on them, maybe the dynamics of the team and/or the product or people we had to sell. Just figuring out the simple makeup needed to contribute to complete the picture and realizing how this seemingly small detail could be so important and add to the success of the image. Everyday was different and an opportunity to learn something new and luckily enjoy my work and meet wonderful people. Sometimes it was much later that I learnt from these photoshoots, all of a sudden the light bulb went on and I realized, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs what it was about‚Äù but most often it was gradual and a building process.
I was recently given the opportunity by @macpro to use my makeup talents and enjoy another wonderful experience. Working with Maripol @maripolarama on her shoot for Macpro. Initialy it was rather daunting as we were a group of makeup artist ‚Äúdoing our thing‚Äù so to speak and to be next to these excellent artists who were my piers (not in age, but in talent) and who I grew to admire was a little intimidating. We usualy don‚Äôt work together in a group like that. Each one had such a different approach but because of the atmosphere that Christian Mitchel De Beaupre the Artistic Director of Macpro and Maripol the Artist/photographer created we all without exception relaxed, created and enjoyed. You will see this from the results which you should search out #macproxmaripol. @macpro @maripolarama @lindamasonnyc. This day will certainly remain one of my most memorable. Here are some photos I took of the model Kalyn @kalynjoy while I was preparing her for Maripol before she steps infront of Maripol‚Äôs camera. The great hair was by @bok_hee
I knew that Maripol was very talented and reknowned especialy for the work she did for Madonna, but it is only really through working with someone that you get a true appreciation for their generosity, knowledge and talent. Thankyou Maripol.CSOP Asset Management has announced the launch of the CSOP Hong Kong Dollar Money Market ETF (3053 HK) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It becomes the first money market ETF available in the territory.
CSOP Asset Management has launched an HKD money market ETF on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The actively managed fund invests in Hong Kong dollar-denominated short-term deposits, including commercial paper, certificates of deposits and commercial bills.
Benchmarked against the 3-month Hong Kong Dollar Interest Settlement Rate (3-month HIBOR), calculated by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.
It comes with a management fee of 0.30% per annum (estimated ongoing charges of 0.5%) and is expected to achieve around 1.5% annualized return after management fees.
The fund will invest around 75% of the assets into relatively longer duration deposits (greater than one week) with the rest in shorter duration deposits. The average duration of deposits will not exceed 90 days.
Louis Lu, portfolio manager at CSOP Asset Management, said the 3-month HIBOR had increased from 1% to over 2% in the second quarter of 2018, a level only seen in 2008 over the past decade.
He added: ‚ÄúThe rate may continue the upward trajectory due to expected monetary tightening in both the US and China. The US Fed is widely expected to raise rates two more times this year. And Hong Kong Monetary Authority is in a boxer‚Äôs stance to defend the weak end of the Hong Kong Dollar band, effectively narrowing the Libor-HIBOR spread. Meanwhile, China is determined to continue the deleverage process, draining some capital out of the market.
‚ÄúLast but not least, Hong Kong Stock Exchange is actively attracting unicorn companies to list in Hong Kong. Market players should not be surprised to see HIBOR hike further, thanks to liquidity squeezes during popular IPO period.‚Äù
The minimum required investment in the fund is around HKD 1 million ($130,000), with distributions paid in HKD annually in December subject to portfolio manager‚Äôs discretion. Distributions may be paid out of capital.
CSOP notes the fund may be used as a flexible cash management tool for both institutional investors and retail investors.
‚ÄúBefore listing, we have already got initial investment intentions from many corporate treasuries, high-net-worth investors and brokers,‚Äù said Melody He, managing director, head of sales and product strategy of CSOP. ‚ÄúOur goal is to provide a revolutionary solution to investors for cash management. We hope that after all the technical hurdles are cleared in the market, Hong Kong investors will finally embrace a flexible, efficient and transparent cash management investment tool.‚Äù
CSOP has initiated talks with internet giants to explore the possibility of bringing this money market ETF to a broader base of users.After the country‚Äôs top lender State Bank of India (SBI), IndusInd Bank has launched EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments) facility on debit cards.

Microbiological Quality of Foodservice Menu Items Produced and Stored by Cook/Chill, Cook/Freeze, Cook/Hot-Hold and Heat/Serve Methods
J Food Prot (1984) 47 (11): 876‚Äì885.
Published: 01 November 1984
Abstract
Microbiological quality of menu items prepared by cook/chill, cook/freeze, cook/hot-hold and heat/serve methods for producing and storing menu items in foodservice systems is reviewed. Of the 40 studies, 21 focused on the cook/chill method and two on the heat/serve. Nine studies on the microbiological quality of delicatessen and fast food were also reviewed. Microbiological evaluation included total plate count, mesophilic aerobic plate count, psychrotrophic aerobic plate count, streptococcal count, staphylococcal count, clostridial count, coliforms, fecal coliforms, yeast and mold, Clostridium perfringens , Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Clostridium sporogenes , Streptococcus faecium , Staphylococcus epidermidis , Bacillus cereus , Bacillus spp., coagulase-positive staphylococci, fecal streptococci and Salmonella . In 29 of the studies, heat was applied to menu items at one or more process steps - initial heating, hot-holding and/or final heating. Initial heating temperatures for entrees ranged from 45 to 90¬∞C, while final heating temperatures ranged from 23 to 98¬∞C. Times ranged from 15 to 90 min for initial heating and 0.33 to 35 min for final heating. Continued research is needed to provide data on effects of time and temperature on the microbiological quality of menu items. Such data will provide foodservice practitioners with adequate assurance that chosen thermal processing methods destroy microorganisms of public health significance.

Fate of Bacillus cereus in Whipped Potatoes During Pre-Service Holding as Could Occur in a Conventional Foodservice System
J Food Prot (1983) 46 (5): 408‚Äì411.
Published: 01 May 1983
Abstract
Dehydrated potatoes were reconstituted (50 1/2-cup servings), mixed, transferred to a pan and the surface was inoculated with spores of Bacillus cereus to give ‚â•40 colony forming units (CFU) per 20.3 cm 2 . Survival of the organism was determined following pre-service holding, (52¬∞C; 32% relative humidity; 1 h) as could occur in a conventional foodservice system. No statistically significant differences were found in numbers of B. cereus before and after pre-service holding. Although the mean surface temperature (56¬∞C) of whipped potatoes was below the maximum germination temperature of B. cereus (59¬∞C), mean internal temperature (63¬∞C) and surface temperature (56¬∞C) of whipped potatoes were never low enough for growth of vegetative cells to occur.

Temperature Histories of Menu Items During Meal Assembly, Distribution and Service in a Hospital Foodservice
J Food Prot (1983) 46 (2): 100‚Äì104.
Published: 01 February 1983
Abstract
Temperatures from the same menu items were obtained during the processes of meal assembly, distribution, and service under actual operating conditions in a hospital using the cook/chill/re-heat/serve method of foodservice. Internal temperatures of all portioned menu items on one supper tray were recorded for a total of 18 meals, over a 6-week period. At meal assembly, internal temperatures of 20 chilled menu items, from a total of 93, were ‚â§45¬∞F (‚â§7¬∞C). After distribution of meals in unrefrigerated food carts from the central kitchen to galleys in patient units, internal temperatures of 11, from a total of 93 chilled menu items, were ‚â§45¬∞F (‚â§7¬∞C). After cold-holding in galley refrigerators or freezers, internal temperatures of 26, from a total of 99 menu items, were ‚â§45¬∞F (‚â§7¬∞C). During meal service, menu items that were to be served hot were heated in microwave ovens. Of the 40 menu items which were microwave-heated, internal temperatures of 25 items were ‚â§165¬∞F (‚â§74¬∞C). Findings emphasize the need for managers to become aware of temperature quality as meals are transported through subsystems in the food service on route to patients. Improvements in procedures and equipment used and increased supervision of time-temperature relationships were recommended, especially when microwave-heating menu items. Temperature surveys should be part of the Food Quality Assurance Program in every hospital foodservice.

Fate of Staphylococcus aureus in Beef Loaf, Potatoes and Frozen and Canned Green Beans after Microwave-Heating in a Simulated Cook/Chill Hospital Foodservice System
J Food Prot (1980) 43 (12): 916‚Äì923.
Published: 01 December 1980
Abstract
The fate of Staphylococcus aureus in cook/chill systems before and after microwave-heating was determined, using inoculated beef loaf, dehydrated potatoes and frozen and canned green beans. These foods were prepared according to time and temperature recommendations of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) model for hospital cook/chill systems. Beef loaf was initially cooked to a mean end temperature (ET) of 66 C, potatoes were rehydrated and heated to a mean ET of 79 C and beans were not cooked initially. Products were covered and stored 24 h at 6 C. Products were portioned, 100 g/portions, stored covered 2 h at 6 C, and microwave-heated: beef loaf and frozen beans 20, 50, 80 or 110 sec; potatoes 25, 45, 65 or 85 sec and canned beans 20, 40, 60 or 80 sec. Number of S. aureus in products decreased as time of microwave-heating increased. When the mean ET of samples was approximately 74‚Äì77 C (HACCP model), microwave-heating did not consistently result in lethality of S. aureus . When time of microwave-heating in the present study was equal to time to reach 74‚Äì77 C in the prestudy, an ET of 74‚Äì77 C did not consistently occur in the food samples.

J Food Prot (1978) 41 (10): 788‚Äì793.
Published: 01 October 1978
Abstract
Preparation and service of hot entrees in hospital cook/chill foodservice systems require two heat processes. After preparation and mixing, beef loaves composed of ground beef and eggs were heat-processed initially to end-point temperatures of 45, 60, 75, or 90 C in a convection oven operating at 121 ¬± 6 C; stored 24 h at 6 ¬± 1 C; portioned into 100-g slices; and single portions were microwave-heated to ‚©æ 74 C. Four heat treatments of beef loaves were compared to a fifth treatment which excluded initial heating. Quality of beef loaf was evaluated by mesophilic and psychrotrophic aerobic plate counts, coliform counts, streptococcal counts and pH. Microbial reductions caused by handling and processing were: aerobic mesophilic plate count, 88 to 99%; psychrotrophic aerobic plate count and coliform count, ‚©æ 99%; and streptococcal count, 71‚Äì99%. Increasing end-point temperature of initial heat processing consistently (P ‚©Ω 0.05) decreased mesophilic and psychrotrophic aerobic plate counts. Coliform counts and streptococcal counts did not show a statistical relationship to end-point temperature of initial heat processing. No statistically significant differences existed in any microbiological counts among five treatments of beef loaf portions after microwave-heating. Varying end-point temperature of initial processing had no consistent statistical effect on the pH of beef portions. Temperatures of ‚©æ 74 C for microwave-heating of beef portions after chilled storage and before service are strongly recommended since chilling 5000 g of beef loaf to ‚©Ω 7 C required 10 to 14 h at 6 C.

BEHAVIOR OF CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS IN PRECOOKED CHILLED GROUND BEEF GRAVY DURING COOLING, HOLDING, AND REHEATING
J Food Prot (1974) 37 (10): 494‚Äì498.
Published: 01 October 1974
Abstract
The suitability of handling practices used in school kitchens was evaluated using ground beef gravy that was contaminated with Clostridium perfringens . Cooked gravy was cooled to 110 F (43.5 C) and inoculated with a mixture of vegetative cells and spores of C. perfringens NCTC 8239 to provide approximately 10,000 organisms/g. After inoculation, gravy was packed in bags, refrigerated for 16 h, held for 5 h at 82 F (28 C) or 42 F (5.5 C), and then heated in a compartment steamer for 35 min or until the temperature of the gravy at the center of the pan reached 165 F (74 C). C. perfringens was enumerated at intervals during cooling, holding, and heating of the gravy. The number of viable cells after 16 h of refrigeration at 42 F (5.5 C) was influenced by the first 6 h of cooling when the temperature of the gravy was in the range that permitted growth of C. perfringens (65‚Äì122 F; 18.5‚Äì50 C). Plate counts of gravy held for 5 h at 82 F (28 C) or 42 F (5.5 C) indicated stablization of the C. perfringens population. When 165 F (74 C) was the final temperature to which the gravy was heated, no viable cells of C. perfringens were found.

TEMPERATURE AND MICROBIAL FLORA OF REFRIGERATED GROUND BEEF GRAVY SUBJECTED TO HOLDING AND HEATING AS MIGHT OCCUR IN A SCHOOL FOODSERVICE OPERATION
J Food Prot (1974) 37 (9): 457‚Äì462.
Published: 01 September 1974
Abstract
The practices of handling precooked chilled gravy in school kitchens were simulated to determine if they could contribute to outbreaks of foodborne illness. Time-temperature measurements and bacteriological tests were made at intervals during chilling, holding, and heating of gravy. Sixty-six pounds of cooked ground beef gravy were packed hot (158 F, 70 C) in bags, cooled in chilled water for 1 h, and refrigerated for 16 h. The gravy was held for 5 h at 82 F (28 C) and at 42 F (5.5 C) and then it was heated in a compartment steamer for 35 min. After 1 h cooling in chilled water, the mean temperature of gravy was 82 F (28 C) and after 16 h of refrigerated storage, the temperature was 45.5 F (7.5 C). The mean temperature of chilled gravy held at 82 F (28 C) remained about 50 F (10 C) for 4 h and reached 64 F (18 C) at the end of the 5-h holding period. The mean temperature of gravy held under refrigeration for 5 h decreased 2 F, from 45.5 F (7.5 C) to 43.5 F (6.5 C). After 35 min of heating in a compartment steamer, the highest temperature was 136 F (58 C) for gravy initially at 65 F (18.5 C) and 128 F (53.5 C) for gravy initially at 47 F (8.5 C). Bacteriological tests indicated that the greatest increase in the number of total aerobic bacteria in gravy occurred during cooling rather than holding. Although some samples yielded coagulase-positive staphylococci, the numbers changed little during holding or heating. Clostridium perfringens was not found in any samples of the gravy..

10 insurance companies increase their profit margins? Some of us might like to think that increased efficiencies and systems that benefit customers would somehow translate to increased profits, making everyone happy. This, of course, is not the case.
Insurance companies make profits by refusing to pay medical bills for sick people. Let me reiterate: Insurance companies increase profits by rejecting claims made by the sick people they ‚Äòensure.‚Äô They are not some wonderful organization filled with compassion and the will to do good. They are companies that make more money every time they turn down a request for payment. Gramma gets sent home even though everyone knows she can‚Äôt take care of herself in her current condition ‚Äì insurance company profits go up. A child needs an expensive medication to treat a devastating unusual disease ‚Äì the insurance company says that medication is not on their approved list. Profits go up.
It‚Äôs important to remember this basic concept when dealing with insurance companies. Their goal is to pay as little as possible. So your goal as a patient or patient‚Äôs caretaker is to fight like hell to do whatever you have to do to force them to pay more. If, for any reason, you are not able to fight, you lose. You must do whatever you have to do to find someone who can fight for you. Phone calls must be made. Appeals must be filed. Internet research must be done. This is not easy. And it‚Äôs not simple. And it‚Äôs not good for your nervous system (says she who just received a 6pm Sunday evening phone call notifying her that her latest appeal had been approved and therefore her husband, who can not walk, among other things, will not have to go home tomorrow). You‚Äôre seeing it as an important health issue. A life and death matter. The insurance company is seeing it as a profit and loss chart.

The safety partners offered motorists this and other responsible party hosting tips at a mocktail party held recently in Geisinger Lewistown Hospital‚Äôs fourth-floor lobby.
‚ÄúGeisinger Lewistown Hospital was honored to host this event,‚Äù said Deb Erdman, injury prevention coordinator for trauma at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville.
‚ÄúWe value the partnership with PennDOT and teamwork with Geisinger Hospitals throughout the region. Events like this are valuable reminders for us all in the community to keep everyone safe.‚Äù
At the event, hospital employees and patients were invited to enjoy a non-alcoholic beverage recipe, operate the impaired driving simulator and complete activities while wearing impairment simulation goggles.
Participants were also encouraged to join the conversation online by sharing a safety selfie from the event using #CelebrateSafe.
Corporal Scott Davis, Drug Enforcement Classification Program and DUI Enforcement Program coordinator, spoke of the Independence Day Impaired Driving Mobilization which runs through Sunday, July 7.
He explained that Drug Recognition Experts, police officers who are trained to recognize drivers under the influence of drugs, will be out in force during the mobilization.
PennDOT distributed Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB) literature on the legal ramifications of DUI, alcohol impairment charts and non-alcoholic beverage recipes at the event.
PennDOT encourages everyone to always plan ahead by designating a sober driver or arrange for alternate transportation. Download the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration‚Äôs SaferRide smartphone app, available on Google Play for Android devices and Apple‚Äôs iTunes Store for iOS devices. SaferRide allows users to call a ride service or a predetermined friend and identifies the user‚Äôs location so he or she can be picked up.
According to PennDOT 2018 data, there were 44 people killed in crashes between 6 p.m. Friday, June 29, and Sunday, July 8. Eight of those fatalities were the result of drug-related crashes and 17 were the result of alcohol-related crashes.
As Pennsylvania is a popular destination for boating, PennDOT also stressed the dangers of boating under the influence.
‚ÄúMany residents and travelers from out of state will celebrate the holiday by taking advantage of Pennsylvania‚Äôs vast network of rivers, streams and lakes,‚Äù said Karen Michael, District Executive for PennDOT.
‚ÄúWe want to remind them that BUI can be just as deadly as DUI and encourage them to make safe, responsible choices.‚Äù
According to PLCB, more than 650 people die in boating accidents annually, and alcohol use is the leading known contributing factor in those fatalities.
The legal penalties for BUI consist of fines ranging from $300 to $10,000, up to five years imprisonment and suspension of boating privileges for a year.
Watercraft operators may also be convicted with a blood alcohol concentration lower than .08 if they are deemed incapable of safely operating or being in actual physical control of the movement of the watercraft.

Good coffee & good chocolate ‚Ä¶ beautifully put together.
In this case the Anyetsu from Wellega, Ethiopia roasted by Novo Coffee. Ritual adds this coffee to the fantastic Mid Mountain Blend, in which case 60% cocoa has been chosen. And the sum ‚Ä¶ is a feast for your tastebuds!
Very easy to eat (so beware, your bar is gone before you know it), but thanks to its rich taste it gives a lot of satisfaction. And yet a little caffeine kick. Not to start just before bedtime.
We don‚Äôt know exactly how they do it, but in this review they say ‚Äúas if a perfectly brewed cup of coffee has been poured into the bar‚Äù.
The review of the Commodity Connaiseur gives a score of 8.8 and says ‚ÄúNever has chocolate tasted more like coffee and never has coffee had so much of the qualities of chocolate‚Äù
The makers themselves are also satisfied with the result and say: ‚ÄúUnlike any coffee & chocolate combination that exists. Fruity Ethiopian coffee comes together with the balanced flavors of our Mid Mountain Blend. The result is a delicious, soft coffee-infused chocolate that appeals to every coffee lover ‚Äú.
Taste tones mentioned by the makers: blueberry, honey, coffee.
Ingredients: cocoa, cane sugar (organic), cocoa butter (organic), coffee.
May contain traces of peanuts, nuts, grains.

Commenting on its results, the group‚Äôs CEO and President Rob Shuter confirmed that MTN intends to go ahead with an IPO of its Nigerian unit regardless of the financial demands placed on it by the country‚Äôs Central Bank and government. Previous reports had suggested that the group was reconsidering the float due to ongoing issues in the market.
MTN has denied any wrongdoing after receiving a demand for $8.1 billion which the Central Bank of Nigeria claims was illegally repatriated from the country. The Nigerian attorney general then alleged that MTN owed the government $2 billion in unpaid back taxes.
The group has stated: ‚ÄúWe remain resolute that MTN Nigeria has not committed any offences and will continue to defend this position vigorously‚Äù, adding that it is cooperating ‚Äúextensively‚Äù with authorities to resolve both cases.
With regard to its Q3 results, MTN noted that its Nigerian business had ‚Äúhad an excellent quarter‚Äù, citing increased data revenue. Its Ghanaian business also fared well, while as a group it saw a 2.5 million increase in subscribers compared to the previous quarter. However, year-on-year its total base actually fell from 229.8 million to 225.4 million.
Noting that its service revenue had grown above expectations at 10% year-on-year, MTN attributed ‚Äústrong growth in voice and data revenue‚Äù to the 5 million data subscribers it added in Q3. In addition, it attracted 1.7 million new mobile money customers during the quarter.2015 Chaleur Estate 1.5L
RED MOUNTAIN AV:
While I always think of the Harrison Hill release as the Margaux in the lineup, the Chaleur is much more Pauillac/Saint Julien in style. The 2015 Chaleur Estate checks in as 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 10% Cabernet Franc. It‚Äôs a full-bodied, deep, concentrated effort that offers terrific cassis and black cherry fruits, graphite, scorched earth, licorice, and crushed rock-like minerality. Like all the 2015s from DeLille, it has an elegant, pure, focused style and is beautifully balanced.

They get their nickname from the 1/4 inch gap between the leading edge of the hood and the nose, in Italy they call it the ‚Äúscalino‚Äù, which translates literally to ‚Äústep‚Äù.
A Brief History of the Alfa Romeo Sprint GT Veloce
Giugiaro designed the svelte body and Alfa Romeo created a shortened version of the platform used on the four-door Giulia saloon. It was fitted with the legendary ‚ÄúBialbero‚Äù Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, an all-aluminum alloy unit with double overhead cams, a cross-flow head, and two valves per cylinder. Over the course of its remarkably long 1954 to 1994 service life, the Bialbero would be fitted to a huge variety of Alfa Romeo vehicles, its size would range from 896cc through to 2.0 litres, and its horsepower figures would range from 52 to over 220 depending on configuration.
1965 would see the introduction of the Alfa Romeo Sprint GT Veloce, an incremental upgrade over the Alfa Romeo Sprint GT that first hit showrooms in 1963. In Italian the word ‚Äúveloce‚Äù means ‚Äúspeed‚Äù, it was chosen as the model suffix as a hat tip to the upgraded Twin Cam Bialbero, which now produced a little more power and a lot more torque.
A 5-speed manual gearbox came as standard, sending power back to a a beam axle with coil springs, and a limited slip rear differential was (and still is) a popular upgrade. Front suspension is independent with coil springs and there are disc brakes on all four wheels ‚Äì giving the 105 series cars solid stopping power by 1960s standards.
In 1967 the Sprint GT Veloce was replaced with the 1750 GT Veloce, the new model had a Twin Cam that was upgraded to 1779cc, and produced 120 hp up from 108 hp on its predecessor. Perhaps the most obvious design changes were the switch to four headlights from the original two, and the loss of the step nose front end ‚Äì a design feature that became remarkably popular despite its unusual nature.
The Upgraded Alfa Romeo Sprint GT Veloce Shown Here
The concept of taking classic cars and sympathetically upgrading them to significantly improve performance isn‚Äôt new, but the work of companies like Singer Vehicle Design have certainly brought it into the mainstream.
The Alfa you see here was built by the specialists at Blankemeijer by a Dutch classic rally enthusiast who wanted a bespoke and highly competitive road rally car. A corrosion-free ex-Arizona ‚Äô67 Guilia Sprint GT Veloce was sourced by the team at Blankemeijer ‚Äì and the work began.
The donor car was taken down to a bare metal shell, some GTA body modifications were made and it was then repainted in Alfa Rosso 501. A fast-road 2 litre Twin Cam engine was built by the team at Van Giersbergen and now produces 160 bhp and 154 lbf.ft of torque ‚Äì a huge step up from the factory original.
Power was increased thanks to the use of 84 mm Cosworth pistons & liners, a flowed cylinder head with new valves and guides, optimized valve shape with sharpened and shortened guides, a 3 angle valve job, Catcam Camshafts, a hardened crankshaft, a 123-tune/ programable electrical ignition, twin Dellorto DHLA 40 carburetors, a Pipercross air-intake system, a full stainless header and exhaust system, and a high capacity radiator to keep it all running cool.
This engine was mated to a new gearbox with a hydraulic clutch, which was paired with a limited slip differential, and the suspension was rebuilt with Alfaholics Fast Road springs, Bilstein dampers, an upgraded sway bar, GTA-type adjustable top suspension arms, and a set of Alfaholics 15√ó7 Superleggera Veloce GTA wheels.
The completed car is one of the most fun-looking Alfas we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, and it‚Äôs being offered for sale at a price that‚Äôs less than the cost of buying a car and getting all the work done yourself.

The movie Christopher Robin is a heartwarming film that reminded me of the many reasons I love being a creative. There is something so special about being in the moment, taking in people and environments with an open heart and slowing down to be grounded. The film reminds a grown up Christopher Robin played by Ewan McGregor what it was like to be loved and give love. He is also reminded of the importance of playfulness in discovering new ideas with a fresh perspective.
Some of my favorite quotes from the stories on Winnie the Pooh:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre braver than you believe and stronger and smarter than you think.‚Äù ‚ÄîWinnie-the-Pooh
Winnie The Pooh: What day is it?
Christopher Robin: It‚Äôs today.
Winnie The Pooh: My favorite day.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always time for a smackeral of wonder.‚Äù ‚ÄîWinnie-the-Pooh
I have been enjoying reading the book ‚ÄúA Walk in the Wood: Meditations on Mindfulness with a Bear Named Pooh‚Äù by Joseph Parent. The book brings up the point of being grounded and connected to the earth. One of my favorite expeditions to take is to go grounding where your bare feet can touch the ground. I have come away with a clearer mind, sense of calm and inspiration to do something new.

There are just so many great fruits and vegetables available that grocery shopping is actually fun. An absolute must purchase during this season are strawberries. During the peak season, they're so sweet it's like eating candy. I usually just pop them right in my mouth but sometimes I'll make a fun dessert or throw them in my lunch salad. Toss them with some avocado and fried halloumi and it's like summer in a bowl. Try this strawberry avocado salad with halloumi and crispy chickpeas and you'll see what I mean.

**Helpful tips and common mistakes
For years now I always used to make my blackened chicken and strawberry salad when I wanted to add the berry to my meal. This year I wanted something different, hence this strawberry avocado with halloumi salad. I am a huge fan of all of these ingredients so it was pretty much a guarantee that this was going to be a winning dish.
Since we're using fresh strawberries, make sure to find sweet berries. The juicy sweet fruit will contrast perfectly with the salty halloumi and creamy avocado.
Prep the raw ingredients and cook the chickpeas and halloumi. For the chickpeas, it's imperative that you dry the beans as well as you can. This will help them crisp up beautifully. Cook them in a little bit of olive oil, add some sliced almonds, garlic, and lemon zest and there you have the crunchy component of the salad.
For the salad dressing, I wanted something earthy and creamy to balance the entire dish so I went with a green goddess dressing. I skipped the mayo and went with Greek yogurt for some tang but you can stick to mayo if your heart desires. Use a combination of herbs including cilantro, basil, and parsley, and blend everything together. If the dressing is too thick, add just a touch of water.
Toss everything together including the shallots and golden raisins and there you have a simple but beautiful strawberry and avocado salad with halloumi. As I said, it's a true winner!

I am sure you readers are as excited as I am for Christmas, which is just around the corner as is my Christmas Eve special! For this update, I decided that I was going to take a look at a toy that started in 1976 and is still going strong today, Stretch Armstrong! I am sure if you‚Äôre an older reader or a younger reader to this blog, you either had a Stretch Armstrong figure, know someone who did, or at least know who he is. It‚Äôs crazy to think that Stretch Armstrong, as of the posting of this update, is 43 years old and has faded in and out of toy stores over those decades and has now finally made it to an update here on Rotten Ink as one of my countdown to Christmas Eve updates. So sit back and pour yourself some eggnog, and let‚Äôs talk about the one and only blonde muscle-bound stretchable hero known as Stretch Armstrong and enjoy this flashback down action figure lane.
Jesse D. Horowitz developed the concept of Stretch Armstrong (originally called Stretch Man) for Kenner, and he had two different directions they were going to look at with one being a muscle blonde man and the other a large sumo wrestler. They went with the muscle bound blonde to keep costs down as the sumo was just too bulky. They brought in Bill Armasmith to develop the figure once Kenner loved the idea. When the figure went into production, they used a liquid sugar gel to give the figure his stretching ability and it became a hit with youngsters. And this also sparked other figures in the Stretch Armstrong series that included bad guys that he could fight with. The original run for this toy series lasted from 1976-1980, and those are now major collectors‚Äô items as many of the originals now are long gone to the toy chest in the sky thanks to them degrading. In the 1990‚Äôs, Cap Toys got the IP of Stretch Armstrong and tried a come back to the world of toys to once more capture the attention of the kids and become a must-have toy. They added a new villain as well as a dog sidekick called Fetch Armstrong, and this once more has a short lived run in toy stores before once more fading away. And from then on, off and on many more Stretch Armstrong remake figures have been released to stores, but have never captured attention like the original did in the late 70‚Äôs and has never made it back to the must-own figures on Christmas lists. Who knows what the future will hold for Stretch Armstrong and his conquest to once more dominate the toy aisles, but one thing is for sure, those youngsters from the past who owned one sure did enjoy playing with it and he will forever live on in their minds.
As I stated above, Stretch Armstrong had his own set of villains with the most popular being Monster Man who was a green skinned reptilian like humanoid who was released in 1978 and is our heroes most popular baddy. Monster Man is also worth lots of money as many of the original figures have not made it undamaged to this modern time. In 1977, the see-through alien Stretch X-Ray was released and was a strange looking guy who grossed out youngsters with his appearance of being able to see his guts and organs. He as well is very rare and the original sales for lots of money. Vac-Man was released in 1994 and was the newest of the Stretch bad guys and was also unique as he came with a pump that allows you to suck the air out of the toy and that made him stretchy. Vac-Man is a red skinned alien who was one mean creature. Growing up I remember the same kid who had Stretch Armstrong also had Vac-Man and all of us kids took turns playing with this figure! One thing is for sure, Stretch Armstrong had one kick butt rogues gallery that I would have loved to have seen in the pages of a comic book series when I was a kid and should have been made by Star Comics in the late 80‚Äôs or even early 90‚Äôs! Check out the pictures below to see his foes in all their evil glory!
Really quickly, we should talk about the clones of Stretch Armstrong as this figure series had its fair share of imitators that tried to cash in on its popularity with youngsters. Some of the most popular were Mego‚Äôs ‚ÄúElastic Heroes‚Äù that started in 1979 and featured DC Comic heroes Batman, Superman and Plastic Man and from Marvel they had Hulk and Spider-Man. They would later add cartoon characters Casper, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Growing up, I always wanted the Hulk one but never could find one used at one of the antique stores in Waynesville or at a garage sale. In the 1980‚Äôs LJN decided to get into the game and made ‚ÄúWWF Stretch Wrestlers‚Äù that were stretchable pro wrestlers and in the line was Hulk Hogan, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff, Randy Savage, George Steele, Junkyard Dog, Ricky Steamboat and King Kong Bundy. I knew one kid who had one of these and I can remember of the playground a lot of us kids stretching the heck out of Randy Savage! Also released in more modern times is a stretch Scooby-Doo figure that is sure to please fans of this classic cartoon character and collectors of stretchable action figures. And these toy series are just a drop in the hat of figures that were inspired by Stretch Armstrong showing that he was a major player in the world of toys and was pretty innovative in its stretchable feature. Check out the pictures below for a look at some of these inspired toys.
Like I said, as a kid I never did own a Stretch Armstrong and only played with them when my friends brought one to school or over at my cousin‚Äôs house when they had one for a short time‚Ä¶until they decided to cut him open and see what he was made of. Well I am proud to say that in 2018 I finally got myself a Stretch Armstrong, and best of all he is called the World‚Äôs Smallest! And while he is super small and does not stretch as far as the normal larger sized one I would say this that he is single handedly the worst Stretch Armstrong figure ever made! He is made just of rubber and has a hard plastic skeleton and a vey cheap paint job‚Ä¶no joke when opened I was 100% disappointed in this figure and after only stretching him for a few moments I placed him on a shelf and that‚Äôs were he has sat for over a year now. So this is just a warning if you want a Stretch Armstrong don‚Äôt go cheap and just order a normal sized one like I wish I did.
Hasbro, who now owns the rights of Stretch Armstrong, decided that they wanted to develop the toy property into movies, comics and TV shows and for years talk went around Hollywood about a big budget movie when Disney bought the rights and wanted to make a family comedy film that had many different scripts written and even stars casted including Tim Allen and Danny DeVito at one point being cast in the title role. But Disney failed to make the movie and then the rights went to Universal and it has well turned out many scripts. They wanted actor Taylor Lautner to play Stretch, but Universal as well dropped the ball and never made the film Relativity Media picked up the rights and before anything really went too far the film was scrapped once again. And the last rumor going around I have heard is that Paramount is now the ones who have the rights to make a movie and have as well just sat on the property with no movie set for production. But in 2017 Hasbro and Netflix decided to team up and make a kids cartoon based on Stretch Armstrong and called it ‚ÄúStretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters‚Äù that would change the age and nature of Stretch and would has him be a young man and his friends who mutate into stretchable heroes! The series is still going now and is the first of Stretch Armstrong media projects to ever see the light of day.
So while Stretch Armstrong never did get his big screen flick, as you have just read, he did get his streaming show in the forum of a cartoon and because of this cartoon we also got a comic series that made this update possible! And while I wish this comic mini series was based on the original figure or even the 90‚Äôs one and not a kids show with a younger Stretch, but beggars can‚Äôt be choosy and this is was IDW has given us. I want to thank Mavericks Cards And Comics and Lone Star Comics for having these comics in stock and need to also remind you all that I grade these comics on a star scale of 1 to 4 and am looking for how well the comics stay to the source material, it‚Äôs entertainment value and it‚Äôs art and story. So if you‚Äôre ready I am ready to have an adventure with Stretch Armstrong and see if he can bring some fun to this holiday season.
Stretch Armstrong And The Flex Fighters # 1 **
Released in 2018 Cover Price $3.99 IDW # 1 of 3
Jake Armstrong along with his friends Nathan and Ricardo become superheroes Stretch, Wingspan and Omni-Mass respective and go by the team name The Flex Fighters. They are now in the city fighting a massive praying mantis that has emerged from the ground attacking workers for a drilling company. The Rook Company lead by Mr. Rook who is responsible for training The Flex Fighters has ground troops also on the ground being lead by Malcolm Kane who can use force if the super team fails to get the mantis under control. The Mantis is strong and is given the powered teens a run for their money, but they are finally able to use extreme sound to knock out and capture it in order for Mr. Rook to study it‚Ä¶but their giant insect is taken away when The Extreme Hazard Unit a government agency takes it away with plans to burn it to death. But while this is going on Omni-Mass has Stretch and Wingspan follow him into the whole the mantis came from and find that its filled with babies and she was only attacking to protect them, and the team now make a pact to save the mantis mom from death.
This very kid friendly comic captures the silly nature of the NetFlix cartoon series and delivers a pretty good middle of the road read with this first issue. The plot has Stretch Armstrong and the rest of the Flex Fighters taken on a massive insect all the while getting orders to capture it alive and protect all civilians while being heroes, and for Stretch to be dealing with the pressure of time schedules his father gives him. Stretch Armstrong is a teen who has lost his mother and has an over baring dad who pushes his son way to hard, and unknown to his father Stretch is also a super hero who has the same powers as Plastic Man and Mr. Fantastic. Stretch seems like a good kid with lots of stress and just wants to do the right thing as well as not disappoint his father. Mr. Rook and Malcolm Kane are the heads of a private group that do good deeds and try and use what they uncover to help mankind, good guys with good values. The Extreme Hazard Unit I am not sure about as they appear when the danger is neutralized and take the creature away with the promise of killing it‚Ä¶.I think they have other plans. Wingspan is a teen with flying powers and Omni-Mass is a teen with the power to make his limbs grow massive and kind of has a rude attitude. The Mantis is just a giant mantis who fights to protect her babies and really is not bad at all. Over all not much to say about this first issue as I feel it does a great job of capturing also the atmosphere and style of classic superhero books of the 60‚Äôs and we get a little backstory on most of our heroes. The cover is pretty great and eye catching for fans of the cartoon series and the interior art by Nikos Koutsis is really good and has a very modern style of what I would think if Star Comics was still around would look like. To sum it up a pretty good first issue and does make we wonder what is going to happen next in issue two.
Stretch Armstrong And The Flex Fighters # 2 **
Released in 2018 Cover Price $3.99 IDW # 2 of 3
The Flex Fighters are in the tunnel with all the baby mantises and make a call to their boss Malcolm Kane who shoots down their idea and plan to save the giant mantis as he reminds them that their authority runs only through the city. This does not stop them as Stretch and Omni-Mass head to the Extreme Hazard Unit base and Wingspan stays behind the babysit the little ones. Stretch and Omni steal some haze mat suits and enter the lab and set free the giant mantis and as they are about the escape they are stopped by Agent Rathjani who is the one in charge at the Extreme Hazard Unit and uses her tech to capture Stretch, Omni and the Mantis‚Ä¶but to the rescue comes Wingspan and the baby mantises who free their mom and friends and they all try to get away with the Extreme Hazard Unit on their tails.
The second issue the pressure and heat is turned up on the Flex Fighters who want to save a momma creature from being killed and taken away from her babies as well as must disobey their own bosses to do so! In this issue we get more of the backstory of Nathan aka Wingspan as he is from a large family and often feels as if he is over looked and never listened to. And while he is creeped out by the baby Mantises they seem to really like him and is able to lead them to help in their mom‚Äôs rescue. Stretch in very confidante that he and his friends are doing the right thing in saving the giant creature and even does a good job of trying his best to lead his friends on this rescue mission. Omni-Mass does what he does best and that‚Äôs be ready for a fight and have an attitude doing it! The Giant Mantis and her Babies seem to understand when they are being talked to and offer support and help when they can on this breakout. The Extreme Hazard Unit are jerks as is their boss Agent Rathjani as they really don‚Äôt care about leaving babies orphaned and claim they have to kill the mantis for mankind‚Äôs safety. As a reader and the cliffhanger ending of the Flex Fighters as well as the giant Mantis and her babies being stuck in the lab of The Extreme Hazard Unit with armed troopers all around! The issue still captures a real kids comic feel and delivers a simple yet entertaining adventure that helps bring more life to our hero characters. The cover is pretty great and eye catching and Nikos Koutsis interior art is great and is truly a through back to classic kids comics of the late 80‚Äôs and the 90‚Äôs. So with that let‚Äôs see what issue three the final issue has in store for us and let‚Äôs see how they wrap up this tale.
Stretch Armstrong And The Flex Fighters # 3 **
Released in 2018 Cover Price $3.99 IDW # 3 of 3
The Flex Fighters and the giant creatures are making a run for it and Omni-Mass is holding off all the armed guards by smashing the ground around them. Once outside they are faced with tanks and it‚Äôs up to mama mantis and her babies to take them down, but while this is going on Agent Rathjani captures Stretch and informs him that he and his team are trespassing on their land and that they are going to be in very big trouble! That is until Mr. Rook shows up and informs everyone that he has bought the land and it now falls under Charter City rule and that the The Extreme Hazard Unit has 30 days to move their base and now the Mantis and her babies fall under their care! Mr. Rook and the Flex Fighters end up taking the creatures to an island Rook owns and allows them to live their life there. But as they good guys are about to leave they are being watched by Monster Man who has plans to experiment on the mantises once they leave and so ends this mini series with a cliffhanger for another that is clearly not ever coming.
Stretch Armstrong And The Flex Fighters is a mini series that has a story that could easily been wrapped up in two issues but they needed three in order to make a graphic novel to make a little extra money on licensing the IP. The story of the Flex Fighters fighting and then saving a massive mantis all the while thinking back on their personal life moments that fit for this mission at hand really does have a Saturday Morning Cartoon vibe mixed with a Star Comic issues from the 80‚Äôs. In this issues we get to learn more about the life of Omni-Mass and find out that his parents move from town to town and its been hard on him to make friends and even trust people as they are never in his life long enough, we also see he fears letting people down. Stretch and Wingspan take a back seat in this issue and just react to the battle going on around them, but they are fighting the best they can in order to save a life. Mr. Rook is the real hero who out smarts the Extreme Hazard Unit by just buying the land from under them and making their jurisdiction smaller and further out! Super smart move and a way to show up Agent Rathjani who is a pretty mean spirited government worker who loves that she has power and has no remorse for her bad actions and behavior. Another cool aspect of this series is that the giant mantis understands English and does her part in the escape and tries to not only protect her babies but as well as her new human friends. Sadly we get very little of Monster Man as he is on the island and has experiments he wants to do, but never once does he fight a Flex Fighter making the cover very misleading, but to be fair comic companies have been doing this for decades. The art for the series done by Nikos Koutsis is great in this issue as well and I would like to see him at sometime take on doing a comic based on the old Nickelodeon show Doug. Over all this kids comic is nothing special but is very well done and I am sure young readers who watch this show would also really enjoy this silly adventure. While I wish this had been a comic based on the classic Stretch Armstrong this is the series we were given and after reading it I am ok with it as I originally thought this was going to be terrible and poorly written and it really did turn out to be not that bad. Below is a look at art from this series so you can see the style of Koutsis.
So while I am sure that Stretch Armstrong will get his chance again in the world of comic books, I do think it will be many years away and will not be based on the Flex Fighters. And will a live action film based on Stretch ever be made‚Ä¶I am going to guess no and if he does ever show up it will be in a crossover film done by Hasbro in something like G.I. Joe or Transformers. But with this update done the next one will be my Christmas Eve update and originally I was going to cover ‚ÄúHe-Man & She-Ra: Secret Of The Sword‚Äù in honor of the live action film that was slated to be released by Warner Brothers this holiday season, but they dropped the ball and did not get the film into production in time so I decided to take a look at something super silly and fun and that‚Äôs video game icon Earthworm Jim! So until next time drink a glass of eggnog or two, spend time with your family and as always support local business this holiday season. See you in space with a mechanical suited worm very soon!Bollywood actress Swara Bhasker has taken the first step towards being a mother.

The two were first linked in March after they were seen holding hands in Vancouver
Things are heating up between John Cena and Shay Shariatzadeh.
In new photos obtained by TMZ, Cena and Shariatzadeh were spotted packing on the PDA outside of the San Diego airport on Wednesday.
Cena was seen giving Shariatzadeh a kiss as he dropped her off for a flight.
The two were first linked in March after they were seen holding hands in Vancouver. Shariatzadeh is a project manager for Avigilon, a Motorola Solutions tech company, and has been employed at the Vancouver-based company since 2015, according to E! News.
She‚Äôs the first woman the pro wrestler has been linked to since his public split from Nikki Bella last summer.
RELATED: John Cena Posts Cryptic Message About Love After Nikki Bella Says She‚Äôs ‚ÄòHappy‚Äô He‚Äôs Moving On
While Cena, 42, has yet to comment on his relationship status, Bella, 35, recently opened up about watching her ex move on. During the April 10 episode of her podcast with twin sister Brie, The Bellas Podcast, Bella confessed that even though she wants the best for her ex, when she first saw a headline about the photos, her ‚Äústomach went into knots.‚Äù
She also admitted she felt bad about how their breakup was portrayed on her reality show Total Bellas.
‚ÄúWhen [I] film the reality shows, you guys only get to see so much. So one thing that I thought was kind of unfair for John was you saw a very small amount on our reality show about our breakup and of course it was pro-me, because it was coming through my eyes,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIt made me sad for John. I felt bad for John. I felt bad because I felt like I embarrassed him, I felt like I disappointed him, and I have to live with a lot of that stuff.‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause of how sad I made him and how much I felt like I hurt him, when I saw the big smile on his face with the paparazzi photos [with Shariatzadeh], I think that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt want to s‚Äî my pants,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI felt happy for him. I am very happy for him.‚Äù
Ultimately, Bella said that she wants both of them to be content.
‚ÄúAs long as John is happy, I‚Äôm happy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut let me tell you, she breaks his heart? I will rack-attack her in a heartbeat. Still protective of that man.‚Äù

Bella has also moved on. PEOPLE confirmed in January that she and her former Dancing with the Stars partner Artem Chigvintsev, 36, were casually dating.
Since then, the two have been spotted packing on the PDA, but Bella has maintained that they‚Äôre not official. Speaking to PEOPLE at a WrestleMania 35 kickoff event earlier this month, Bella said she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot fully taken,‚Äù but that she and Chigvintsev are in a good place.
On this week‚Äôs episode of her podcast, she called Chigvintsev an ‚Äúamazing lover‚Äù but insisted he‚Äôs not her boyfriend, saying she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù for that label.Education

We even spotted a handful of Olaplex dupes, from L'Or√©al Elvive's Dream Lengths 8 Second Wonder Water Treatment, ¬£9.99, to The Inkey List's PCA Bond Repair, ¬£12.99. This month, Olaplex has unveiled the hotly anticipated No.8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask, ¬£26, and it's causing a stir among beauty lovers, hairstylists and colourists alike.

Exclusive to Lookfantastic, the new mask promises to make lacklustre hair appear brand-new in just 10 minutes. With salons fully booked for what looks like the next couple of months, of course I had to give it a go, and the results are nothing short of incredible.
What is in the Olaplex No.8 Intense Bond Moisture Mask and how does it work?
Olaplex No.8 works on all hair types, even go, according to an independent study. It works by repairing damage and relinking hair bonds after they have been broken by things such as bleach or colour, harsh weather, heat styling or general wear and tear. When the hair's bonds are broken, hair often appears split at the ends, frizzy and feels dry or brittle.
The difference between other Olaplex hair products and the new No.8 is that the latter is souped up with a handful of extra ingredients, typically found in skincare but which are shown to have brilliant hair benefits: hyaluronic acid for an extra hit of hydration, ceramides which speed up repair and lock in moisture, and avocado oil, rosehip oil and rice bran oil, all of which nourish dry, brittle strands deeply and provide a glossy finish. Think of it as a more concentrated version of Olaplex No.3.

According to Lavinia Popescu, vice president of research and development at Olaplex, No.8 doesn't contain classical proteins, which can be tricky for some hair types, especially low porosity hair, which typically needs more moisture. This product sulphates, making it a safe option for coloured hair and those with a sensitive or reactive scalp.
How do you use the Olaplex No.8 Intense Bond Moisture Mask?
Suggested to be used once a week, the mask works best on shampooed, towel-dried hair. The brand's experts suggest applying one to three pumps through mid-lengths to ends, depending on your hair length and thickness. The smart pump allows for just the right amount of product to be applied. maximise results.
London-based colourist Samantha Cusick is a huge fan, colour-treated hair, straight hair and even hair extensions. Curly and natural textured hair tends to need more moisture in particular, and this mask really delivers."

Does the Olaplex No.8 Intense Bond Moisture Mask work?
Before
After
Yes, and the before-and-after pictures are proof. In just 10 minutes, the mask breathed new life into my frazzled, split, twice-dyed lockdown hair. After a quick rinse and rough-dry using the ghd Helios, ¬£159, I gasped. My hair felt smooth, soft and so much easier to manage. My hair has one big wave at the back, which often makes it difficult to wear it natural, but my lengths were so glossy and soft, I felt as though I could ditch my straighteners. This is the first hair product that has made me consider ditching the heat, so it's already leagues above the aforementioned dupes.
When I did go to straighten my hair the next day, it took me all of five minutes and my straighteners glided through my hair without snagging. I'm most impressed by how it minimised my broken hairs, frizzy roots and split ends. I'm in desperate need of a trim but, somehow, my hair looks and feels 10 times healthier. While Olaplex No.8 is not a leave-in product, I applied a pea-sized amount to the ends of my hair for extra smoothness and it worked so well, making it a multipurpose all-rounder.
My only complaint is that you have to apply it through towel-dried hair, which means getting out of the shower, waiting 10 minutes for it to work its magic, then jumping back in to rinse it out. For lazy people like me, this is a faff, especially when there are so many brilliant deep conditioners and in-shower hair masks out there. If you'd rather save time, I love Dizziak Deep Conditioner, ¬£22, which uses a handful of oils to nourish parched strands, and BLEACH London Reincarnation Mask, ¬£17, which boasts glycerin to moisturise and strengthen hair. Both products can be used in the shower.
That said, in my honest opinion as a beauty editor, the results of Olaplex No.8 are unrivalled. No wonder it has already racked up five-star reviews. I'll absolutely replace my trusty Olaplex dupes and would suggest stocking up while you can. A product as good as this is bound to sell out soon..Facebook Launches New Lead Ad Features
Since their introduction in 2015 Facebook Lead Ads have proved to be a powerful tool for marketers, allowing the collection of information from potential customers in a way that's quick and easy for them. We‚Äôre pleased to share with you some awesome new improvements Facebook have made to Lead Ads to enable marketers to communicate their intended message to users more clearly.
Custom ‚ÄòThank You‚Äô screen
Arguably the most exciting improvement, Facebook has updated the ‚ÄòThank You‚Äô screen that appears after a user submits a lead form! Previously, once a lead form was submitted, the user was shown a standard ‚ÄòThank You‚Äô screen with a ‚ÄòView Website‚Äô button which directed them to a specific webpage. However, this page was not customisable. With Facebook‚Äôs Custom ‚ÄòThank You‚Äô screen, you are now able to customise this page, allowing you to further engage with the user.
This functionality is especially important for marketers who want to offer downloadable content such as e-books or e-brochures. The user can now be shown a ‚ÄòDownload‚Äô button on the ‚ÄòThank You‚Äô page which directs them to the webpage from which they can download the requested item.
Custom Headline
Facebook have now enabled the editing of the Headline text in a lead form. This allows for a more tailored messaging. Instead of the previous standard ‚ÄòLearn more by providing your info below‚Äô message dictated by the CTA, you are now able to customise this for your target users. In this example we've used 'Request an e-book'.

NEW ORLEANS FAVORITES II
Our original New Orleans Favorites set has been so popular, we now offer New Orleans Favorites II, featuring 10 additional tunes! Like the original collection, they are arranged for traditional ensemble in authentic New Orleans Style. Instrumentation is flexible, allowing for performance by as few as four players on Clarinet, Trumpet, Trombone and Tuba (or optional Bass). Other optional parts include Tenor Sax, Drums, a Piano/Banjo chord book and an Alto Sax book that functions as a replacement for the Tenor book.
The collection is now available in two sizes, as march-sized books (approx. 5"x 7") which will fit a standard music lyre, accommodating almost any indoor or outdoor performance venue, or in a larger, coil-bound B5 size (approx. 7"x 10") that is designed to lay flat on a standard-sized music stand.
The 7" x 10" format also features larger print making it easier to read for "more experienced" musicians.
Each arrangement is presented as two facing pages with the song on the left and written-out solos for the wind players on the right. Ranges and technical requirements are kept at a modest level to allow for success for players of a wide range of abilities.
Typical left page/right page set-up: song arrangement on the left, written-out solo on the right.
Individual books are available in either size. Orders of multiple books are also available. There is a package containing the four essential books (clarinet, trumpet/cornet, trombone and tuba). A complete, specially-priced package is also available which includes all nine books, plus a FREE score book! And now you can save even more if you purchase multiple volumes of the three sets. See the Vol. 1 purchase page for special pricing of multiple volume sets.
Recordings of each of the ten Vol. 2 arrangements are available below for listening. Though each tune has four different solos which can be mixed and matched (and even overlapped!) these recordings present only one or two of the provided solos. Click below to listen!
One young Cochrane kid has recently discovered that there really is strength in numbers.
Five-year-old Jerlena Rittwage, who was born missing her left hand, returned from the 2012 Western War Amps CHAMPS seminar, which was held in Saskatoon, Sask., July 13-15, feeling connected to a network of kids, counsellors and families facing similar obstacles in their lives.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been involved with the War Amps for about three years,‚Äù said her mother, Jessica Rittwage.
‚ÄúShe gets to see kids just like her, which really helps with her self-esteem.‚Äù
Jessica said the three-day seminar was beneficial to both herself and her daughter on many levels, including learning about the various aspects of growing up as an amputee, evolving technology with prosthetic limbs, parenting an amputee child, dealing with teasing and bullying and maintaining an active lifestyle.
Jessica said one of the greatest forms of assistance they received from the organization was receiving a prosthetic hand, so Jerlena could keep active swimming.
‚ÄúThey gave her the opportunity to get a prosthetic made so she could participate in sports and activities like all the other kids,‚Äù said Jessica; the cost of Jerlena‚Äôs artificial limb was $2,700 and insurance only partially covers this.
‚ÄúSeminars are an integral part of the Child Amputee Program, creating lasting bonds of friendship as CHAMPS grow up learning from one another,‚Äù said Danita Chisholm, executive director of CHAMPS.

For the U.N., traditionally came to via starvation and also malnutrition, it is a historic initially, complying with up on an alarm it sounded around obese adults in 1999. ‚ÄòObesity,‚Äô the U.N. proasserted, ‚Äòis the dominant unmet global health and wellness concern, through Westernized nations topping the list.‚Äù
Solid epidemiological data drives the initiative. In Canada, Great Britain, Japan, Australia--even coastal China and also Southeastern Asia--the rate of childhood weight problems has been soaring for even more than a decade. Closer to residence, at leastern 25% of all Americans under age nineteen are overweight or obese, a number that has doubled over the last 30 years and a figure that moved the surgeon general to declare childhood obesity an epidemic. The cost in health and wellness care dollars to treat obesity‚Äôs medical consequences--from diabetes to coronary heart illness to a range of crippling bone conditions--will inevitably make the battle against HIV/AIDS seem inexpensive.
You are watching: Too much of a good thing greg critser
Yet in the UNITED STATE, the many essential foot soldiers against excessive weight are progressively paralyzed by years of media-induced food hysteria, over-generalized and also outdated nutritional wisdom and also, reality be told, an unwillingness to set firm and also occasionally unpopular food parameters. That infantry is the much-strained Amerideserve to family members and also its increasingly harried commandant, Parentis americanus . What it requirements to promulgate is dietary restraint, somepoint our ancestors kbrand-new ssuggest as avoiding gluttony.
This is not to say that parents have to be blamed for the nation‚Äôs thriving dietary permissiveness. They are wary of confronting their children‚Äôs eating habits for a reason: For years, conventional wisdom hosted that food need to never before become a dinner table battleground. ‚ÄòPrescertain causes stress and anxiety,‚Äô create Harvey and also Marilyn Diamond, authors of the classic ‚ÄúFit for Life,‚Äù which has actually marketed more than 3 million copies. ‚ÄòWright here food is involved, tension is always to be avoided.‚Äô The operative idea is that a son restrained from overeating will either rebel by secretly gorging when ameans from the table or, worse, will certainly endure such a loss of self-esteem that a life time of disastrous eating actions will certainly follow.
Of course, no one need to be stigmatized for being overweight. But stigmatizing the unhealthful actions that reason excessive weight would concreate through what we understand around efficient health and wellness messeras. In both the project versus unsafe sex and also the project versus smoking cigarettes, stigmatizing such habits showed highly reliable in reducing threat and harm. It‚Äôs true, smokers--and also homosexuals--may have actually proficient a modicum of stereoinputting in the short run, yet such is the price of every public health and wellness advance: short term pain for lengthy term obtain.
Another inhibition to imposing dietary restraint is the idea, supported in handbook after handbook of parental advice, that ‚Äòyoungsters recognize when they are complete.‚Äô But maybe not. In truth, brand-new research study suggests just the opposite: Kids don‚Äôt recognize as soon as they are complete.
In a current examine, Pennsylvania State University nutritional scholar Barbara Rolls and her associates examined the eating habits of two groups of youngsters, among three-year-olds, another of five-year-olds. The youngsters were presented through a series of plates of macaroni and also cheese. The first plate was a normal serving built around baseline nutritional needs; the second was slightly larger; the 3rd was what could be referred to as ‚Äòsupersized.‚Äù
What the researchers found is that the younger kids consistently ate the same baseline amount, leaving more food on the plates through larger servings. The 5-year-olds, though, altered their eating actions drastically relying on the amount they were offered, devouring whatever before was on the plate. Somepoint had actually occurred. The mere presence of an oversized portion had actually induced exaggerated eating. The authors concluded that ‚Äòthese at an early stage years might carry out a distinct possibility for interventions that alleviate the danger of developing overweight.‚Äô Those interventions ‚Äòmust encompass clear indevelopment on appropriate percentage sizes for youngsters.‚Äù
Theorizing aside, our disinclination to restrain eating flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that, of all age groups, kids seem to be the ones that respond the majority of positively to dietary advice. In 4 randomized studies of obese 6 to 12 year olds, those that were available regular, easy behavioral advice were considerably less overweight 10 years later on than kids who did not get the advice. In fact, 30% of those stupassed away were no much longer obese at all.
The situation for early intervention has been better buttressed by brand-new studies on another age-old medical injunction: never before put a kid on a diet. (The issue was that under-nutrition can cause stunted expansion.) But as the authors of a study of 1,062 children under age 3 concluded in the journal Pediatrics, ‚Äòa oversaw, low-saturated-fat and also low-cholesterol diet has actually no affect on growth throughout the initially 3 years of life.‚Äô Overweight kids who were put on such a diet finished up with much better, even more modeprice eating habits.
Changing the eating actions of youngsters, though, is antithetical to some notions many kind of parents host dear. And to some it appears a relic of an previously, even more religious era of ethical certainties as soon as gluttony was vilified as among the salso deadly sins. Many boomer parental fees believe, as one parent and also nutritionist sassist at a recent summit on childhood weight problems, that ‚Äòkids deserve to make negative nutrition decisions.‚Äô That might be true. But ours is a human being wright here at least a billion dollars a year is spent by simply one fast-food chain to convince family members to visit a crazy-looking clvery own via his own playground and purchase a thousand also superdimension calories for a mere $2.50. McDonald‚Äôs main line now is that 3 meals a week at its restaurants are perfectly acceptable for an average son. That‚Äôs 3 meals a week of grease, refined flour and a jumbo swarm of sugar.
Given today‚Äôs bounty of cheap and also unhealthful food alternatives, and also offered the inconvenience that goes through making good nutritional options, one can wonder if a campaign versus over-usage, a campaign advocating restraint, might occupational. On this suggest, we could take a cue from the French. In the early on 20th century France, in response to its first experiences with widespread son obesity, released the puericulture movement, which focused on excessive weight get in early on childhood and also adolescence. Its prescription: All meals must be adult-supervised; all sections must be modeprice, through ‚Äòseconds‚Äô a rare treat. All but an occasional tiny snack were forbidden. As its historian Peter N. Stearns writes in ‚ÄúFat History,‚Äù puericulture‚Äôs message was simple: Eating as well much food is a bad thing.

Therein lies at least part of the explanation for the legendary leanness of the French: They were taught in childhood not to overeat. And it didn‚Äôt seem to perform a lot injury to their self-esteem.Dick Boland

According to the news agency, the two countries mine 14 million tons of coal per day, and account for 95 per cent of the new coal-fired power plants brought online over the last decade ‚Äî 444.2 gigawatts (GW) in China, and 113.7 GW in India.
The next three countries on the list ‚Äî Indonesia, Vietnam, and South Korea ‚Äî added 54 GW among them, according to data from BloombergNEF.
Bloomberg said that this explains the energy crunch explains why China and India put up a strong defence for coal‚Äôs future during the negotiations in Glasgow. ‚ÄúCoal not only remains crucial to their current energy needs but it looks set to have a role for decades to come. That is even as the two Asian giants install huge volumes of renewables and chase targets to zero out greenhouse gas emissions,‚Äù said Bloomberg.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian explained Beijing‚Äôs stance at a media briefing on Monday. ‚ÄúIn many developing countries, not everyone has access to electricity. Energy supply is not adequate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBefore asking all countries to stop using coal, consideration should be given to the energy shortfall in these countries.‚Äù
‚Äú
We have sadly seen the hand of fossil fuel interests interfering with that text to water it down with weasel words‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve seen it in the G20 for 12 years‚Äî‚Äòinefficient fossil fuel subsidies‚Äô. It means nothing.
Catherine Abreu, executive director, Destination Zero
Zhao said that China attaches ‚Äúhigh importance‚Äù to the shift off fossil fuels and has committed to peak coal consumption in 2025. It has also cut off funding for overseas coal projects, reported Bloomberg.
The pledge to end international coal financing would cut China‚Äôs carbon pollution by the equivalent of Canada‚Äôs total emissions, the news agency said.
Zhao said that the effort to ‚Äúreduce the proportion of coal consumption is an incremental process‚Äù, and,‚Äù said Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator
In the days leading up to COP 26, analysts were pointing to the global energy supply crunch as good reason to speed up the shift off fossil fuels, rather than slowing it down. Developing countries, however, are saying that the transition is not being adequately funded.
The last-minute change in the COP decision was interpreted by some as a new lease on life for coal. News agency Reuters speculated that ‚Äúhow humanity confronts climate change may come down to the intentions behind the two words [that were edited in the final text]‚Äù.
Other observers said that the difference in the nuances of United Nations legal jargon would not change the message to investors and other decision-makers ‚Äî that the Glasgow climate pact is an indicator that coal is being shown its way out and other fossil fuels will soon be phased out too.
According to Reuters, coal stocks in Asia declined on Monday despite the ‚Äúsolid floor‚Äù provided by the energy supply crunch.
The main takeaway for companies and investors is that it is time to ramp up real plans to reach net-zero emissions, Bloomberg and Reuters reported. US climate envoy John Kerry said that COP 26 had ushered in a ‚Äúnew era of accountability‚Äù, after participants arrived at ‚Äúa clear pathway with rules, with transparency requirements‚Äù.
But all of that will depend on net-zero plans that will help countries get past the ‚Äúweasel words‚Äù in the Glasgow Pact that allow for future coal plants.

Background: The increasing prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in the UK and the limitations of the currently available diagnostic and control methods require the development of complementary approaches to assist in the sustainable control of the disease. One potential approach is the identification of animals that are genetically more resistant to bTB, to enable breeding of animals with enhanced resistance. This paper focuses on prediction of resistance to bTB. We explore estimation of direct genomic estimated breeding values (DGVs) for bTB resistance in UK dairy cattle, using dense SNP chip data, and test these genomic predictions for situations when disease phenotypes are not available on selection candidates. Methodology/Principal Findings: We estimated DGVs using genomic best linear unbiased prediction methodology, and assessed their predictive accuracies with a cross validation procedure and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Furthermore, these results were compared with theoretical expectations for prediction accuracy and area-under-the-ROC- curve (AUC). The dataset comprised 1151 Holstein-Friesian cows (bTB cases or controls). All individuals (592 cases and 559 controls) were genotyped for 727,252 loci (Illumina Bead Chip). The estimated observed heritability of bTB resistance was 0.23¬±0.06 (0.34 on the liability scale) and five-fold cross validation, replicated six times, provided a prediction accuracy of 0.33 (95% C.I.: 0.26, 0.40). ROC curves, and the resulting AUC, gave a probability of 0.58, averaged across six replicates, of correctly classifying cows as diseased or as healthy based on SNP chip genotype alone using these data. Conclusions/Significance: These results provide a first step in the investigation of the potential feasibility of genomic selection for bTB resistance using SNP data. Specifically, they demonstrate that genomic selection is possible, even in populations with no pedigree data and on animals lacking bTB phenotypes. However, a larger training population will be required to improve prediction accuracies.Engagement Photography Leicester

Raging fires in Portugal kill at least 62
PENELA, PORTUGAL Raging forest fires in Portugal have killed at least 62 people, most of whom were burnt to death in their cars, the government said yesterday, in one of the worst such disasters in recent history.
The fire broke out on Saturday in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande in central Portugal, before spreading fast across several fronts.
Yesterday afternoon, nearly 900 firefighters and 300 vehicles were still battling the blaze while scenes of devastation could be seen around the town.
"Unfortunately, this seems to be the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires," said a visibly moved Prime Minister Antonio Costa. Portugal has declared three days of mourning.
The flowing expanse of hillskm, as blackened trees leaned listlessly over charred soil.
Burnt-out cars sat outside partly destroyed and abandoned houses, while a few metres away police in face masks surrounded the corpse of a man covered by a white sheet.
Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said 57 people had burnt to death, mostly trapped in their cars engulfed by flames in the Leiria region. - AFP

While you could just lock your ebike to a signpost or rack, wouldn't it be nice to park it someplace where it got recharged, and you could store your gear? HAVN was designed to serve those purposes.
Created by Belgian company Street Waves, each HAVN ebike-parking unit consists of a lidded 55-liter (14.5-gal) stainless steel rectangular box, with one raised horizontal steel bracket at the top, and another extending out from the bottom.
When a bike is leaned against the unit, its top tube rests against the top bracket ‚Äì a strip of wood on the face of the bracket protects the bike's paint from scratches. The lower bracket holds the bike's front wheel in place, so it points forward instead of flopping over to one side.
Before locking their bike up, the user opens the HAVN's lid, then stows their helmet, gloves, jacket and other cycling gear inside. As an added bonus, a mirror on the inside of the lid lets them check if they've got "helmet hair." They then close the lid, and run their lock through holes in both it and the main body of the unit, and around their bike's top tube. In this way, both the bicycle and the lid are secured using the one lock. The unit itself is anchored to the street surface.
Additionally, if the HAVN is wired into the local electrical system, the user can plug their ebike's battery charger into its integrated socket for recharging.
Interested businesses or municipalities can inquire for pricing information via the company website, linked below.

It‚Äôs one thing to lock up my hacker mountain bike at the store, but a $1,000+ ebike is not likely to survive even in our ‚Äúsafe‚Äù small suburban community.
And from feedback, this security issue prevents a fair number of others from using eBikes as an alternative to their vehicles for shorter shopping trips.
Somebody needs to develop a near-bullet-proof way to easily secure expensive eBikes at stores and restaurants.

Studies have shown that people feel significantly more depressed when their credit card debt increases by ten percent or more. However, most people in California and other states do not show clinical depression, but rather experience an increase in household stress, which can manifest in an inability to eat and sleep properly.
Although depressive symptoms were apparent in all ages in a recent study, older adults between the ages of 51 and 64 displayed the most acute symptoms. Unfortunately, statistics show that Americans older than 50 averaged $8,278 in debt owed on credit cards in 2012. This is significantly greater than younger Americans. People younger than 50-years-old reported an average of $6,258 owed on credit card accounts.
A significant portion of the debt accumulated on credit cards by Americans over the age of 50 is a result of spending on basic expenses for living. Thirty-four percent of the older Americans surveyed stated they utilized credit cards to purchase groceries, pay for utilities and even to obtain insurance. Half of the older people surveyed stated they used their credit cards on medical bills. Loss of employment was also reported as a reason for 25 percent of older people using credit cards.
Older Americans with significant credit card debt should be sure to be cautious, since they could eventually find themselves facing overwhelming debt problems. Once a person, no matter what age, falls behind on their monthly payments it may be challenging to catch up with their bills. However, those who do find themselves being buried with credit card debt may wish to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. This type of bankruptcy in California is designed to discharge unsecured debts, which includes debts owed to credit card companies.

We're coming to regard the discovery of each week's dull-witted X Factor theme as the one solid gold highlight of our weekends.
And which film-soundtracking genius did X Factor rope into being the special musical guest? John Williams? Ennio Morricone? Kenny Logginseven? Our breath is literally baited to see what guff-headed theme the X Factor team manage to pull out of the bag next week.
X factor betting odds: macdonald brothers & ben mills
But who'll win X Factor this year? Miles by The Proclaimers ; a Scottish call to Would a white girl date an asian guy Holland michigan escorts, Miles was shit too, but it was a brand new type of shit that featured a call and response section so utterly ludicrous that we fear The MacDonald Brothers may have done the impossible and picked up some new fans through sheer cheek.
Ben Mills ‚Äî Reports this week suggested that Ben Mills spent the week flouncing around like a giant stroppy girl because he thinks Leona is going to win X Factor.
Which she is, but that's beside the point. However, Ben Mills did well to hide any s Best girl fuck like an entire orchestra falling down a lift shaft.
The macdonald brothers Turning pale after smoking weed starring his whole family.

I had an exasperated parent approach me last week desperately wanting to know, WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO ALL THIS SOCIAL MEDIA DRAMA because it‚Äôs not going away!
Even though her daughter is in high school now, the high-high‚Äôs and low-lows continue ‚Äì and it‚Äôs become a constant power struggle.
Her frustration was palpable, and it makes my heart hurt because it‚Äôs a REAL problem for parents right now.
If you‚Äôre like most, the hope that your daughter WILL JUST FIGURE OUT how to deal with her social media accounts may be your only anchor.
Whether your daughter is STABLE or STRUGGLING right now, if she‚Äôs going to develop the resiliency skills she needs to manage her world, she needs to be willing to look at what‚Äôs going on in her mind.
Unfortunately, mindset management isn‚Äôt taught in school.
And, your daughter may be going about this the HARD WAY ‚Äì because constantly looking at images that create uncertainty or emotional unrest is challenging ‚Äì and exhausting.
So, I‚Äôm curious ‚Ä¶
Have you noticed what happens for your daughter when a friend doesn‚Äôt respond the way she would or how she believes they should?
Does your daughter usually BELIEVE the things she hears and see‚Äôs to be true?
Does she know how to effectively work through the process of distilling facts from interpretation?
Whether she‚Äôs sharing her feelings and experiences with you ‚Äì if she‚Äôs like other teens ‚Äì when painful emotions start to pile up, she‚Äôs going to look for ways to block the discomfort.
You may see this in the form of:
- Binging on Netflix, YouTube, or video games
- Using food for comfort, leading to weight gain
- Oversharing on social media, looking for validation
- Turning to substances, like vaping/juuling, marijuana, alcohol
The hard part is, your daughter doesn‚Äôt realize that she‚Äôs chasing a FEELING STATE that‚Äôs not going to come from an external source.
These distraction techniques can lead to harmful, unhealthy neuropathways (patterns) as her brain develops.
So, YES, it gets messy.
Thankfully, there are ways to prevent the highs and lows and strategies to help your daughter FIGURE IT OUT.
Here‚Äôs your challenge ‚Ä¶
Choose one or two resources or strategies that fit your parenting style and put them into practice.
Approach this challenge as if you‚Äôre building a 100-piece puzzle.
Try looking for what‚Äôs works ‚Äì those are your corners pieces.
Then, add on slowly, noticing if your approach fits, or if you‚Äôre just trying to make it work.
If you‚Äôre not sure how to put your ideas or strategies into practice ‚Äì that‚Äôs where I come in.
Are you ready to enjoy the limited time you have right now, while your daughter is home?
Shoot me an email today, shawna@nullcultivatingresilientteens.com or grab a spot on my calendar

Unless you‚Äôve been sleeping under a pile of deerskins, you already know NFL legend Brett Favre has retired. So why...
Unless you‚Äôve been sleeping under a pile of deerskins, you already know NFL legend Brett Favre has retired. So why is this beat-to-death news appearing in Buck Tracker? Because the man is a whitetail freak.
Oh, I loved Favre for the same reasons everyone else did. He was tough, he played with the zeal of a teenager, and he conducted himself like a gentleman. And, of course, he was a Packer. As a Wisconsin native who grew up in the Lombardi era, I didn‚Äôt so much choose to be a Packer fan as I had it bottle-fed to me. So Favre kept the fun in cheering for the Green & Gold‚Ä¶though I‚Äôll have to admit I never missed a Sunday afternoon in the deer woods to do that.
And now Favre won‚Äôt have to, either. While most folks concentrate on Favre‚Äôs on-field stats, Wisconsin‚Äôs 700,000 deer hunters recognized something equally important ‚Äì he was one of them. If there was time after a Sunday home game, or if the team had a Monday off, Brett was in a tree stand with a bow in his hands.
Coincidentally, the central Wisconsin farm Favre hunted lies not far from the Bestul family homestead. In fact, an area game warden was the guy who registered Favre‚Äôs deer when he was successful. It did my heart good to know that one of the NFL‚Äôs biggest guns loved deer hunting in the same woods that taught me to love the whitetail.
So No. 4 will now chase deer in the woods of his native Mississippi. We‚Äôre gonna miss him here up north next fall ‚Äì though probably for different reasons than the rest of the nation. And though I‚Äôm sure Brett will have his share of Sundays when he misses his old job, I‚Äôm betting the deer woods will provide sufficient therapy.: Amazing 'swim' inside the body during biopsies!

Political campaigns have fully-embraced modern marketing principles, leveraging content, social media, email, PPC, and the full suite of digital marketing tools. Simultaneously, they‚Äôre still using classic marketing channels such as direct mail, television, radio, and print advertising.
However, one tactic, which has been around nearly as long as politics, is largely ignored. And that‚Äôs unfortunate because handwritten notes for political campaigns are a powerful way for candidates to build relationships with their current or potential constituents.
SEE ALSO: Gratitude is a Business Strategy
Politics is personal. It deals with issues that deeply affect citizen‚Äôs lives. When voters are considering who to support at the polls, they‚Äôre more likely to favor candidates that they feel understand them ‚Äî those with whom they have a personal relationship.
It‚Äôs challenging to build that sort of rapport using impersonal television ads or generic postcard flyers. Handwritten notes are much more immediate. They‚Äôre an intimate form of communication, sent directly from one person to another. They demonstrate to the recipient that the sender cared enough about them to invest the time in putting pen to paper.
And when a politician feels like they‚Äôre speaking directly to you, you‚Äôre far more likely to listen to what they have to say.

Grassroots Activists Are Bringing Handwritten Notes Back into Politics
Grassroots campaigns frequently don‚Äôt have access to the resources and funding available to major party candidates. They need to be more creative with their communications, making the most of the volunteer labor at their disposal.
Telephone banks are a common tactic for grassroots organizations, allowing volunteers to reach individual voters directly with a minimum investment. Unfortunately, mobile technologies like automatic call blocking are reducing the strategy‚Äôs effectiveness. In many cases, people simply don‚Äôt answer the phone if the number calling them isn‚Äôt already in their address book.
In response, many activist efforts on both sides of the aisle have taken to mailing handwritten postcards and letters. Some target friends and family, while others focus on undecided voters.
The process of sending the cards had positive effects on those who received them and the volunteers that generated them, creating positive feelings of engagement with the process and changing a few minds.
SEE ALSO: 5 Opportunities to Send Business Thank You Cards
Most Importantly, Handwritten Notes for Political Campaigns Get Results
Postcard writing works, and the results are compelling. In one randomized study, 1,000 Alabama voters received handwritten letters urging voter participation. The study compared their turnout to a control group of voters that did not receive the letters. Astoundingly, the group that received handwritten notes reported participation rates three points higher than the control group. The handwritten letters helped motivate voters to get involved.
Another study found that handwritten postcards were more effective at increasing voter participation than one of the mainstays of political organizing, door-to-door canvassing. While this tactic hasn‚Äôt been used in earnest in a presidential election, it has been successful in several local elections.
One notable example involved Illinois Circuit Court candidates Kent Delgado and Lindsay Hug√©. Campaign managers realized that standard mailers weren‚Äôt working. They were expensive to produce and mail, and people were simply ignoring them, overloaded as they were by the glut of political advertising.
Handwritten cards, in handwritten envelopes, by contrast, enjoy significantly higher open rates. Voters that received the letters assumed they contained something important and likely something personalized to them. The campaigns enjoyed significant success with the handwritten tactic, but that‚Äôs not the end of the story.
What was particularly interesting was that the handwritten cards weren‚Äôt actually written by hand. They were created by a machine built to replicate the look and feel of real handwritten cards. But that fact didn‚Äôt render the cards less effective. Because voters believed the cards were handwritten, they had a proportional emotional reaction.
Simply Noted uses similar machines to create handwritten cards for customers worldwide, but we take the process a step further.
Instead of printers, our handwriting machines use real ballpoint pens. This grants our cards an authenticity that‚Äôs peerless in the industry. You can see and feel the impression left in the paper by the pen. It‚Äôs a subtle touch that printers can‚Äôt replicate. Political campaigns and grassroots organizations looking to capitalize on handwritten notes‚Äô power would do well to take advantage of our services.
‚ÄúHandwritten letters helped motivate voters to get involved.‚Äù
Why Handwritten Notes Are So Effective
We mentioned earlier that handwritten notes had never been tried in a meaningful way during a presidential election. That‚Äôs changing in 2020.
A collection of political action groups pooled their resources to create a massive stockpile of handwritten letters that will be mailed in early October, as this post is being written. It‚Äôs too early to gauge the results, but the project‚Äôs organizers are highly optimistic about its chances.
It‚Äôs not necessary to agree with their politics to appreciate the effectiveness of the technique. Swing Left is one of the groups participating. Ethan Todras-Whitehill, the group‚Äôs executive director sums it up this way:
SEE ASLO: Everything You Wanted to Know About Bulk Mailing in 2020
‚ÄúWhat would you do if you got a handwritten letter in the mail? You‚Äôd open it! [We‚Äôll] get world-class open rates. It sort of forces you to engage. There‚Äôs a visceral thing about it.‚Äù
A handwritten, hand-addressed letter virtually leaps out of recipients‚Äô mailboxes in a world dominated by email, text messages, and junk mail. It‚Äôs an unusual luxury that people rarely see anymore. It begs you to open it, and people do. By some estimates, handwritten notes enjoy a 99% open rate!
Pair excellent open rates with a handwritten letter‚Äôs ability to make a personal connection with its reader, and the format is tailormade for political campaigns. Candidates can virtually guarantee recipients will read their messages, giving them a fair chance to sway voters.
If you work with a political action committee or a campaign, give us a call to discuss what automated, handwritten notes can do for you. Simply Noted can create cards in any volume required. Our handwriting machines will hand-address your envelopes, and then we‚Äôll put them in the mail.
You don‚Äôt have to worry about managing hundreds of volunteers. Our machines can work 24-hours a day for you, getting the word out about your candidate or issue. Let us show you the power of handwritten notes for political campaigns.

In Philadelphia, spin the giant dial, find life guidance
PHILADELPHIA (AP) ‚Äî Candy Chang‚Äôs public art pieces more than please the eye. They demand dialogue and encourage conversations. Her best-known project, ‚ÄúBefore I die,‚Äù was duplicated in 1,000 cities in 70 countries as thousands of people chalked their hopes and dreams on walls and fences.
Her latest work, unveiled in Philadelphia on Thursday, is an interactive mural that invites people to think of their biggest challenges and then use the mural to find guidance to move forward.
The work features a 6-foot dial that visitors are encouraged to twirl while thinking of their challenges. The spinner will stop at a number corresponding with one of the stories on either side of the dial that represent lessons from the I Ching, one of the world‚Äôs oldest books of wisdom. A guide to the symbols in another part of the mural allows people to then interpret the wheel‚Äôs message as they desire.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in how public space can provide value to people and help them make sense of the beauty and tragedy of life,‚Äù said Chang, who lives in New Orleans. ‚ÄúCreating emotional spaces where people can be honest and vulnerable can lead to trust and understanding. Making better places can help us become our best selves.‚Äù
James Johnson, 43, out on a lunch break, was one of the first to give the wheel a try. He was directed to story #14, ‚ÄúThe Lucky Ones,‚Äù which says in part, ‚ÄúOur greatest fortune is the virtue of our actions and the depth of our relationships.‚Äù Johnson said the message did apply to his question, which he didn‚Äôt disclose.
‚ÄúThis is like fortune cookies or a fortune teller. It‚Äôs just a good way to get you to think differently,‚Äù said Johnson, who said he would recommend friends try the wheel ‚Äúnot necessarily for the advice. It‚Äôs just cool.‚Äù
Tatiana DiSanti, 24, wanted guidance as she considers buying a house in a neighborhood real estate agents would describe as ‚Äúup and coming.‚Äù Story #5, ‚ÄúThe Rain,‚Äù noted: ‚ÄúWaiting is necessary for reaching any goal, and it is an art . Be present and face your difficulties without wishful thinking.‚Äù
The words gave DiSanti pause: Was that telling her to hold off on her purchase or was it advising her to face her challenges? She decided she‚Äôd bring her father, who was coming to visit to discuss the home purchase, to the wheel when he arrived.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a way to find answers to questions all on your own,‚Äù she said.
The mural, on busy South Street in downtown Philadelphia, is titled ‚ÄúThe Atlas of Tomorrow: A Device for Philosophical Reflections.‚Äù It was completed in conjunction with the Porch Light Program, a partnership between the city‚Äôs Department of Behavioral Health and Disability Services and the Mural Arts Program. Volunteers joined Chang in finger-painting the black and white piece, making one black dot at a time, about 200,000 total.
‚ÄúCandy thinks a lot about emotional well-being and public spaces. The connection between those worlds may seem distant, but they‚Äôre not,‚Äù said Jane Golden, executive director of the Mural Arts Program, which has produced more than 3,000 murals on buildings across the city.
Chang‚Äôs work, Golden said, ‚Äúreimagines what a mural can do.‚Äù
Chang‚Äôs own struggles have inspired her work. After a friend‚Äôs death in 2011, she found herself thinking more about what she wanted to accomplish before her own last breath. ‚ÄúBefore I die‚Äù was a result of Chang deciding to pose the question to others, as well.
Her Philadelphia mural was also in part inspired by the death of someone close to her. As she often does, Chang found comfort after the tragedy from the guidance and practical insight offered in the I Ching. She wondered if others were suffering in silence and could use some help.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve gone through depression and when everything and everyone around you seems so happy, it makes you feel even more alone. I want to help people see they‚Äôre not alone and that suffering is a natural part of being a human being,‚Äù Chang said. ‚ÄúEmotional wellness is often neglected and taboo to discuss. I wanted to improve our public health by embedding it in the city fabric.‚ÄùSearch among our publicly available commercial properties

The operator - which owns sites like Meadowhall in Sheffield - was weighed down by the recent flurry of shop closures and restructurings by major high street retailers in the six months to September.
Other major retail parks its owns includes the Kingston Centre, Milton Keynes, Ealing Broadway in London and Glasgow Fort in Scotland.
The value of British Land's shopping centres, retail parks and shops slid by ¬£599m , or 10.7%, to ¬£4.8bn, significantly widening the company's losses for period.
It saw half-year losses of ¬£440m, compared with a ¬£42m loss in the same six-month period in 2018.
A wave of Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) restructuring deals have resulted in a raft of rent reductions, while cost rises have also contributed to the collapse of a number of high street retailers, such as Mothercare.
British Land said it expects the retail sector to remain challenging but has seen "early signs that some liquidity may be returning" to some parts of the market.
Chris Grigg, chief executive of the company, which is headquartered in London,.
"In London, we expect the market to remain good, with supply relatively constrained and high quality space, in well-connected, vibrant parts of town continuing to attract demand from a range of businesses."
British Land sold ¬£289m of assets, including ¬£194m it secured from the sale of 12 Sainsbury's supermarkets, in a bid to bolsters its accounts.
It added that it plans to reduce the size of its retail portfolio as shoppers continue to turn online for their purchases.Get Print and Digital Ads and Directory Listing

Chat rooms exist across the website for cybersex chat, whether they are specific cybersex sites or other chat sites. For some cybersex is just a release, for others they are more interested in dating a cam girl.
Dating a cam girl is not like a traditional relationship. Want to know what it is like? Take a look at some of these benefits of dating cam girls for cybersex chat.
No Strings Attached
The biggest benefit of dating a cam girl on a cam sex site is to enjoy a no strings attached relationship. Because these are internet online relationships and are partially based on the cam girls enjoying their jobs, there are no strings attached. You can come and go with the relationship at any point. Another benefit to no strings attached is that certain things, like having to schedule date nights and relationship formalities are not always attached if you don't want them to be.
No strings attached relationships also means that you are free to see more than one cam girl if you want. Along the same lines, you can continue to see people in the real world too. You can have dates with women in your area then come home to have a date with your cam girl if that is what pleases you.
Custom Tailored Relationship
Cam girl relationships are quite unique. They are one of both fun and business. Sure many cam girls do what they do for the money but they also choose their profession because it can be enjoyable at the same time it is work. This unique style of work makes them motivated to try new things and be in a relationship that really meets their needs.
When approaching a cam girl about cam girl dating, talk to them about what they like. Trying to find a relationship that both of you like will be the most enjoyable as that way you can both have fun. However, in the end, many cam girls will work with you to get the relationship you want. In other words, a custom-tailored relationship.
A fact that quite often surprises people is that not all cam girls are on the websites just to get naked. Many of them are interested in a variety of different things. Even the ones that are on there for more than just cam sex, will often have cam sex. Be aware though that there are some cam girls that will never get nude on cam and are there for other kinds of fun.
Very Few Limits
Limits in a traditional relationship are activities or actions that you do not want to engage in. There are typically two forms of limits, a soft limit and a hard limit. A hard limit is something that you will not do under any circumstances. A soft limit is an activity you will consider or that has to be approached slowly.
When you are having a cybersex encounter, the person you are with is far more open to exploring different acts for a variety of reasons. For one, they are doing the activities over the internet which makes a lot of people more comfortable. Also cam girls are doing what they do for fun and as a job, which means that they are more motivated to push their limits.
Remember, you also have limits. While in most cases the cam model is more submissive, this is not always the truth. There are a lot of non-submissive or switch cam models out there that you might encounter. Whether the model is going to be submissive or not though, your limits matter, and make sure that you have an idea of what your limits are before going in.
As always, it is a good idea to have a discussion about limits before any kind of play. Better yet, the best idea is to discuss limits before you even start dating or moving further with a cam girl. If a cam girl has a limit on something that you really enjoy, it might be best to look to another model for fun.
Limits don't just refer to the limits of what a person wants to do and what they don't want to do. By interacting on cam, role play and other activities that would normally be limited by the physical world are somewhat laxer. It is much easier to let your imagination go and enjoy the experience. You can also add toys, effects, and more with computers, making the experience unique.
Lots of Fish in the Sea
Just like dating in the physical world, dating cam girls come with a wide variety of options. In fact, there are often more options for you when it comes to cam girls as their job is to be there to provide you with a good time. Since it is their job they are more open to dating those who want to start a relationship. You also have the fact that you aren't limited to people near you, with cam site dating you can interact with cam girls from around the world.
Cam girls are also open to having numerous relationships. If you are interested in a cam girl, her dating someone else is not a deal-breaker. Just like you have no strings attached, they do too. While that may be odd to first-timers but you will quickly learn to enjoy the fun that that fact brings.
Physical Distance
Cam girls are on the internet, meaning that there is a physical separation from you and the model. Having such a distance can greatly benefit a relationship. Everyone needs some time to themselves to decompress. It also means that you don't have to worry about planning your schedule around someone else's. You can do what you want, when you want.
Many people, not just men, want such a relationship as it can be quite relaxing. This kind of relationship can be quite hard to find and dating a cam model on a cybersex website can be one of the best ways to engage in such a relationship.
Cybersex chat on cybersex sites can be quite a fun experience. A wide variety of different activities take place, with some of them being one time encounters and others being more serious or long term fun. We highly recommend that anyone interested in having a cybersex relationship give it a try. There is no harm to it and these relationships are becoming more and more acceptable around the world. You also never know what you will find as you journey into the world of cybersex.
One tip to look to before we leave though. Take a good amount of time to find a cybersex site that is good for you. As we mentioned, there are a lot of options out there but not all of those options are built the same. Some cybersex sites are full of scammers or charge you way more money than you would ever need to pay. A small amount of research can help ensure you find a cam girl that is perfect for you. Or even multiple cam girls.Scientists can make some pretty accurate forecasts about the future. But predicting what the Earth will be like 500 years from now is a difficult task because there are many factors at play. Imagine Christopher Columbus in 1492 trying to predict the Americas of today!
We do know that two main types of processes change our planet: One involves natural cycles, like the way the planet rotates and moves around the Sun, and the other is caused by life forms, especially humans.
The Earth itself is on the move
The Earth is constantly changing.
It wobbles, the angle of its tilt changes and even its orbit changes to bring the Earth closer to or farther from the Sun. These changes happen over tens of thousands of years, and they have been responsible for ice ages.
Five hundred years isn‚Äôt very long in terms of geology.
[embedded content]
How Earth‚Äôs orbit affects life on the surface of the planet.
Humans are changing the planet
The second big influence on the planet is living things. The effects of life on the planet are harder to predict. Disrupting one part of an ecosystem can knock a lot of other things off kilter.
Humans in particular are changing the Earth in many ways.
They cut down forests and break up important wildlife habitats to build cities and grow crops. They move invasive species around the planet, disrupting ecosystems.
They also contribute to global warming. People are causing the climate to change, mostly by burning fossil fuels that release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the planet and atmosphere can handle.
[embedded content]
How humans are contributing to global warming.
Normally, greenhouse gases trap heat from the Sun the way the glass of a greenhouse does, keeping Earth warmer than it would be otherwise. That can be useful ‚Äì until we get too much.
The result of too much carbon dioxide is that temperatures rise, and that can lead to dangerously hot summer days and melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica. Melting ice sheets raise the oceans, causing coastal areas to flood.
That‚Äôs what Earth is facing right now. These changes could lead to a very different planet in 500 years, depending in large part on how willing humans are to change their ways. A warming planet can also contribute to extreme weather like heat waves, storms and droughts that can change the land. All of Earth‚Äôs living forms are at risk.
Learning from the past 500 years
Looking back at the past 500 years, the living part of the Earth, called the biosphere, has changed dramatically.
The number of humans has increased from around 500 million people to over 7.5 billion today. More than 800 plant and animal species have become extinct because of human activities over that period. As the human population grows, other species have less space to roam. Sea level rise means even less land, and rising temperatures will send many species migrating to better climates.
Not all of Earth‚Äôs changes are caused by humans, but humans have worsened some of them. A major challenge today is getting people to stop doing things that create problems, like burning fossil fuels that contribute to climate change. This is one global problem that requires countries worldwide and the people within them to work toward the same goal.
Getting back to Christopher Columbus, he probably couldn‚Äôt have imagined a highway full of cars or a mobile phone. Technology will no doubt improve over the next 500 years, too. But so far, tech solutions haven‚Äôt scaled up fast enough to solve climate change. To keep doing the same things and expect someone else to fix the mess later would be a risky, expensive gamble.
So, the Earth in 500 years may be unrecognizable. Or, if humans are willing to change their behaviors, it may persist with its vibrant forests, oceans, fields, and cities for many more centuries, along with its most successful residents, humankind.

Source: SciTechDailySo here we are again. It‚Äôs another year, and we‚Äôve already knocked over the first quarter. Can you believe it? With barely a thought for the year that was, we‚Äôre back to the 50+ hour work weeks ‚Äì paying bills, fixing things around the house we said we‚Äôd fix over the holidays, and running kids to concerts, parties or after-school activities.
Our New Year‚Äôs resolutions have gasped their last, and we‚Äôre back to questioning our lives and the meaning of it all (if there even is one). We feel that subtle heaviness ‚Äì the fear that things won‚Äôt change even though we want them to.
I‚Äôve been here many times, mostly during my late thirties and early forties. As a much younger man, though, it was very different. The arrival of each year filled me with unassailable optimism. I‚Äôd tell myself that this was my year. This year, I would become the change I sought.
But as I got older, each new year took on a darker hue, like those lugubrious winter days when the sun stays behind a veil of brooding clouds. I‚Äôd tried and failed at so many things ‚Äì sometimes spectacularly ‚Äì that each time I threw out a calendar, it became harder to find a silver lining.
After many years of this cycle, I slowly learned something. I learned that everything has an end, whether that thing is good or bad. Bad relationships end. Winning streaks fizzle. Good economies crash and bad ones recover.
And so a few years ago, I made a deliberate decision to turn things around. You can read about much of it in my other posts on my other site, but suffice to say, once I made the decision that today was ‚ÄòDay One‚Äô, things began to change.
What you Say vs What you Mean
Nowadays, I‚Äôm super intentional about the decisions I make ‚Äì especially about the things I want and don‚Äôt want. And I‚Äôve learned that what I say I want is often just a thin veneer covering something deeper, and much simpler.
I‚Äôve since adopted a simple phrase, ‚ÄúSo that‚Ä¶‚Äù, and it has transformed how I make decisions and with it, my life.
When a decision comes before me, I always carry it through to its conclusion with a series of brutally honest ‚Äòso that‚Äôs‚Äô. can earn more money
- So that‚Ä¶ I can buy a Mercedes
- So that‚Ä¶ I look cool to others
- So that‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôm winning
- So that‚Ä¶ all those years of work are rewarded
- So that‚Ä¶ I fulfill my dream of ‚Äòliving the good life‚Äô
Once I‚Äôve made it to the end, I then ask a simple question: ‚ÄúWill this deliver the final outcome I seek?‚Äù In this case, it‚Äôs item number 6.
If the outcome of the above example is, ‚Äòliving the good life,‚Äô then the answer to the question might actually be ‚ÄòNo‚Äô. I‚Äôll explain why in a minute.
As I‚Äôve said before, the thousands of marketing messages we see every day teach us that the only path to the life we seek is to buy our way there or give up huge chunks of our life. Usually it‚Äôs both.
The sad thing is, few of us question it because we‚Äôre all doing it.
The Six Costs of What You Want
Every decision has multiple costs, and we‚Äôd be wise to consider all of them each time we‚Äôre about to make one.
-.
Sure, I‚Äôve made less money than I might have, but I‚Äôve always been there for my kids (I still am), and that‚Äôs worth a lot more to me than a fancy job with a fancy title and lots of money. It just is.
Like most things, though, I learned this the hard way.
The Lust for Money
The first time was over 20 years ago. I was lured by a fancy guy in a really fancy suit to head up a new franchise at a car dealership.
He took me out to lunch and told me how wonderful my life would be. The money would flow, accolades would tumble from the heavens and supermodels would beg me for my number.
Almost none of that is true, but the offer did come with an immediate 50% pay rise, a new car and a dose of extra status.
There were two problems. The location was an extra hour from home. Also, the owner was a lunatic. I discovered this important fact on day-one when he blasted me for leaning against a desk in the new, as yet unfinished showroom.
Three days later, I realised what a horrible mistake I‚Äôd made and I quit. work arrangements.
What I learned from all this, and through the 10 years that followed (I‚Äôm a slow learner), is that the things I wanted all came with multiple prices.
I also learned that the things I wanted could be acquired through means that didn‚Äôt conform to societal norms. In other words, I didn‚Äôt have to give up as much as everyone said ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have to pay three or four different prices for everything.
This is where you come in. I mightn‚Äôt know exactly what you want, but I reckon I can guess a few of them ‚Äì at least in broad terms. see this as an indulgence. If you can spend weeks planning a holiday but won‚Äôt devote a day (or even half a day) to figuring out what you really want from your life,.

Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria - Nigeria
Prominent Saudi universities would want to build strong collaborations with Ahmadu Bello University because of its considerable standing in teaching and research, the Consul-General, Royal Consulate General of Saudi Arabia, Kano, Khalil Ahmed Admawi, has disclosed.
The Consul-General made the disclosure today when he paid a familiarisation visit to Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, where he had an interaction with the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Kabiru Bala, in his office.
Admawi, who led a three-man delegation to the University from the Saudi Consulate in Kano, said it was a ‚Äúgreat pleasure‚Äù for him to have visited Ahmadu Bello University for the first time.
He said that long before his coming to Nigeria to serve as a diplomat he had been hearing about ABU‚Äôs greatness as clearly manifested in the quality of products produced by the institution over the years.
The Consul-General also explained that his visit to ABU was primarily to acquaint himself with the institution, and to subsequently link many Saudi universities with Ahmadu Bello University for possible collaboration on various academic fields.
Admawi, who expressed immense appreciation to the Vice-Chancellor for the warm reception accorded him and his entourage, further said that the visit would open more doors for different academic linkages between ABU and Saudi academic institutions.
Receiving the Consul-General, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Kabiru Bala, recalled the kind of relationship ABU had with the Gulf countries at its early years of existence.
Prof. Bala further said that such collaboration ceased to exist with the death of Premier of Northern Nigeria, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, who founded the University in 1962.
‚ÄúThereafter, ABU has been trying to resuscitate such collaborations with the Gulf countries. It is my hope that your visit will eventually revive the collaborations not only on Islamic Banking but also on other academic fields‚Äù, he said.
The Consul-General and his entourage were later conducted round some places within the University, including Department of Arabic, where he briefly interacted with the Head of Department, Prof. Jafar Abdulmalik and other staff members of the Department.
A renowned Islamic scholar at the Faculty of Education, Federal University, Dutse, Jigawa State, Dr. Abubakar Mohammed Sani Birnin Kudu, and Malam Ahmad Idris Yunus, a staff at the Consulate, were part of the Consul-General‚Äôs entourage.

Thursday, 18th November, 2021This week, the European Commission presented its new budget proposal of ‚Ç¨1,100 billion, along with a ‚Ç¨750 billion reconstruction programme to help deal with the impact of the coronavirus. The budget also includes ‚Ç¨94.4 billion for Horizon Europe. According to the Commission, this money should be spent primarily on health research, on ‚Äòresilience in Europe‚Äô, and on the digital and green transitions.
Tough talk
At the start of this year, shortly before the coronavirus reached Europe, the European budget was already the subject of some tough talking in Brussels. Back then, the European Commission was already proposing to earmark ‚Ç¨94 billion for Horizon Europe, as well as 1.11 percent of GDP for the entire EU budget.
But the ‚Äòstingy four‚Äô - the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark - opposed spending any more than 1 percent of GDP on the EU. There were already fears that the Horizon Europe budget would be whittled down to a much lower ‚Ç¨75 billion.
So what now?
The question is how the Netherlands will respond to the new budget proposals. Minister of Finance Wopke Hoekstra had previously announced his own recovery programme proposals for member states hit the hardest by the coronavirus. It is not inconceivable that the Netherlands will dig its heels in once again.
Dutch MEP Lara Wolters (Labour Party) believes that in Horizon Europe, the European Commission is correctly prioritising health, the digital transition and the climate crisis. The role of research and innovation will be crucial in these areas, she believes. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm pleased to see the European Commission taking the first step in this area. And when it comes to research and innovation, the Netherlands traditionally benefits more than most from European funding. I hope the government will recognise this and spare the Horizon programme.‚Äô4 days ago Thinking of investing in a conveyor belt for your assembly line?

Spread sheet aided calculation for standard resistor measurement

Spread sheet aided calculation for standard resistor measurement
Precise calculation is required when come to the measurement of standard resistors. The attached spread sheet will help in doing so. It also serves as a documentation for your tests. For the mathematical minded, you can look into the equations to see/verify how they calculated.
Note: when you measure an unknown resistor, you effectively compare it against a standard, whether the standard is explicitly sit there as a stand alone device, or embedded in the instrument you use. When you measure the unknown against the standard, you actually calibrate you unknown, or you transfer to the unknown. The uncertainty of the unknown will be the uncertainty of your standard 'plus' the uncertainty of your transfer/test, thus you cannot get a better uncertainty result than the standard even your transfer is perfect.
Standard resistors on their own are not ideal, there are some changing factors such as long term drift and temperature dependency. We have no ability to control the time, and not many of us have temperature stabilized lab or air bath. Variations resulting from aging and temperature must be taken into account to achieve the best results.
If your equipment is good, you have a good standard(may be borrowed), and the measurement is good, but the calculation is short or incomplete, the result will be ruined. In order to prevent that, here are some of the necessary procedures:
1. The initial calibrated data of the standard resistor must be known. There is a piece of paper inside the cover of any SR104 for instance.
2. A recent calibration is necessary in order to know the average anual drift. This also served as the most updated information for the standard.
3. Your 'measurement' is the comparison of the unknown Rx against the Standard Rs.
For example, by using an 3458A to measure the unknown, you got Rxm=1000.155 Ohm, this is not the result of Rx. You have to measure the Standard as the comparent.
You substitute the unknown with the standard, measure again, you got Rsm=10000.123 Ohm, this is again not the result of Rs. However, the difference(Rxm-Rsm = 0.032 Ohm) is much more important, which will be used to calculate the final result of Rx.
If your standard was calibrated as 10000.002, then the Rx would be Rx=Rs+(Rxm-Rsm) = 10000.002+0.032 = 10000.034, correct?
Well, if there is no aging of the standard, and no temperature variations, it's correct. But if not, you can refer to the spread sheet for the right calculation.
4. Type in the measurement data into the spread sheet in light-green-background cells, the result will come out at yellow-background cells.
Apart from the measurement related calculations, an internal temperature calculation for SR104 is also provided.
Edit: I found out an error in the spread sheet, and upload again. If your download is before the data/time I edited the thread, please re-download. Sorry for the inconvenient.

Thanks for the spreadsheet. It should come in handy this summer.

Hello zlymex,
in your spreadsheet you have different alpha and beta values.
Are these values expected to change?
Or is this because of measurement uncertainty?

I‚Äôm stuck in this weird place where I can‚Äôt get a daily practice going again because I‚Äôve got new social obligations that I‚Äôm not used to having, but all my social obligations are tied to actually practicing.
I‚Äôm reminded of the saying ‚Äúif you have time, you should meditate for half an hour every day. If you don‚Äôt, you should meditate for an hour‚Äù. Easier said than done, but I‚Äôve found truth in it before. It looks like I may have to start losing some sleep in the short term to build long term balance into my life, which I‚Äôve been shying away from, hoping I could juggle everything long enough for life to slow down. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a thing life does, so I guess it‚Äôs time to bite the bullet.What makes one dog collar better than the other? There is more to the decision than you might have thought. To facilitate your purchase, I have distilled all the information you require to make the best choice for your dog.
Best Heavy-Duty Collars for Mastiffs
Walking into an aisle of dog collars or browsing a selection online can leave you confused and overwhelmed with so much to choose from. Skip the search because I have done the work for you.
Black Rhino
Trust that I have my reasons for calling this my most favorite heavy-duty collar of all time.
After my Mastiff broke three collars in a month, out of sheer desperation, I ordered a random few of the most-reviewed dog collars and prayed for better luck. And man, did I get lucky.
We have been using the Black Rhino neoprene collar for three months now and couldn‚Äôt be happier. So far, it has withstood at least a dozen instances of a 200-pound dog bolting at full speed, and the collar and buckle are still going as strong as ever. Need I say more of the durability?
When it comes to big dogs, the strength of the collar is absolutely critical; these dogs are strong, and their collars need to be stronger if you are to avoid the countless loose-dog hazards. Black Rhino has guaranteed that with its impeccable construction (which, I admit, I have closely observed under a lamp) and use of top-quality material.
My dog and I also love the buckle on this collar. I actively avoid metal buckles because they retain heat and make my dog uncomfortable during training on sunny days. However, most of the alternatives to metal that I bought broke down in just a matter of hours ‚Äì or at best, a few days. This one is an exception that offered both comfort and strength.
I did observe that the collar runs a little small, so play safe and order one size up. Adjusting a bigger size to the dog‚Äôs neck is far more comfortable compared to being on the last grommet on a smaller size, anyway.
Yunlep Adjustable Tactical Dog Collar
One of my dogs has been wearing this gorgeous collar for two years now, and she still doesn‚Äôt fail to get compliments for it. The hardware and customizable name patch is just one part of it, though. Yunlep really outdid themselves with this product which both works and looks great.
Even after two years of extensive use, the material has not frayed, and the buckle remains secure. I particularly love how there is no fading or tarnishing even after all the swimming this collar has been through. The collar does not chafe at all, and the handle attached also offers added control during hikes and walks. I would go as far as saying that this is as good as a harness when it comes to control. I wanted to buy this collar for other dogs as well, but it only fit the big ones. And that is the only wish this collar left unfulfilled for me.
Tuff Pupper
I got the red variant of this, and let me just say; it made my 5-year-old Bullmastiff look oh-so-handsome. It isn‚Äôt all about the looks, though.
My dog did not get bothered by it at all, thanks to the soft material and inner padding. The nylon-neoprene collar is extremely comfortable and not just for the dog. It often rains where we live, and my dogs like to play outside. That means hours of scrubbing out stubborn stains on nylon collars, or even worse, worrying about our expensive leather collars getting wet and dirty. No more!
This Tuff Pupper collar dries up so quickly, and I have still not noticed any dampness or odor in my few months of use. It‚Äôs also machine-washable, but because of the metal buckle on it, I opted for handwashing. So, if your dog also gets too dirty too often, go for this collar because it‚Äôs that easy to keep clean!
It‚Äôs an exceptionally well-built product, but the handle could have been a little less elastic to offer more control. However, since I don‚Äôt need that kind of control with my dog, this works just fine for me.
Types of Dog Collars
Everyday Dog Collars
This is the standard dog collar that is worn around the house or on casual walks. Everyday collars are typically manufactured out of nylon, neoprene, or leather and have plastic or metal buckles as fastenings. These collars are designed for dogs that can be kept off leash.
Everyday collars are primarily used to carry dog IDs and for ‚Äòfashion‚Äô purposes. Therefore, the security of the buckle and the design of the collar are often important variables.
Another feature I find extremely valuable in everyday collars is moisture-wicking. These collars, made out of neoprene, are waterproof and quick-drying, which makes them great for dogs living in wet climates or spending a lot of time in the water because the collar will remain dry, odorless, and bacteria-free. Since they are to be worn for long periods of time, everyday collars should also be easy to clean, comfortable to wear, and durable.
Training Dog Collars
Traditional training collars employed inhumane methods of training a dog into obedience and ended up traumatizing the animal. These include shock collars and choke chains, which are now banned across many countries and strongly criticized.
To rectify the situation, modern training collars have been developed to train your dog, but not at the expense of its comfort and safety. These training collars are remote-controlled and send out ‚Äòvibrations‚Äô as a form of discipline.
Sadly enough, even today, some of these training collars come with metal prongs on the inside to prevent the dog from pulling on the collar. This is why critics continue to oppose the use of training collars in any way, and safer alternatives like the Martingale collar have been introduced.
Martingale Dog Collars
Martingale collars are a form of training collars similar to choke chains but more comfortable and relatively safer. The ethicality of these is sometimes debated, but the general opinion is that these are okay to use if used under strict supervision and that too, sparingly.
These collars are half nylon and half chain. The nylon helps protect the dog‚Äôs trachea and esophagus in case the dog pulls by cinching up to an extent. Alternatively, to prevent fur from falling out in long-haired dogs, all-fabric Martingales are also available. These don‚Äôt have a chain section and are therefore softer.
Alternatives
Harness
Dog harnesses go around the dog‚Äôs body instead of the neck, therefore taking the pressure off the neck in case of pulling. They also allow greater control than collars in many cases.
While both harnesses and collars are great tools for walking or managing your dog, they are not exactly ‚Äòperfect alternatives.‚Äô Collars are important for all dogs to be wearing with their IDs at all times and are also inarguably more comfortable than harnesses for that kind of 24/7 wear. On the other hand, harnesses are the better choice for training and controlled walks.
Headcollars
Headcollars control the dog‚Äôs head by limiting its range of motion. If the dog cannot move its head too much, it cannot pull on its leash as well. That might sound like good training, but it‚Äôs, in fact, the opposite: your dog may never learn to walk on a leash by itself if always kept in a head collar. Moreover, head collars are fairly uncomfortable for the animal.
Over my years of experience with dogs, I have come to learn that head collars are just unnecessary. What looks like a benefit (decreased risk of pulling) is actually poor training. If you really are to use one, try phasing it out sooner than later.
Materials
Nylon Dog Collars
Nylon collars are the most common type of dog collars. Available in a myriad of designs, colors, widths, and price points, nylon collars are typically everyday-use collars.
These are inexpensive, easily available, and widely customizable. With newer materials like neoprene on the block, nylon has become an even more popular material for a dog collar. Nylon and neoprene combine to make some of the best dog collars, which are quick-drying, easy to clean, comfortable to wear, low-maintenance, long-lasting, and great-looking!
Leather (PU Leather)
Leather collars don‚Äôt only look great but are also sturdier compared to other materials. Naturally, they are also much pricier.
Some dog owners choose leather collars solely for their visual appeal. While this aesthetic superiority is a perfectly legitimate motive, another reason often pushing us dog owners in the direction of leather collars is a nylon allergy. Albeit uncommon, an allergic reaction to nylon collars is occasionally observed in dogs. Leather collars are your safest, smartest bet in such a scenario.
Do consider that good-quality leather leashes usually come with a heavy price tag. Definitely go for it if you can afford to, but if the price is making you choose between quality or appearance, I strongly advise prioritizing durability over looks.
Neoprene
A soft yet strong rubber material, neoprene is a relatively new medium for dog collars.
Its key selling point is that it is waterproof. This makes it a great choice for dogs that spend time in water; its moisture-wicking feature will keep the collar odor-free and bacteria-free and also keep your dog comfortable. Collars made out of neoprene are soft and limit chafing complaints to a minimum. Neoprene is also good for dogs with skin allergies; however, in case your dog is allergic to nylon, be mindful that neoprene collars are also often reinforced with nylon mesh.
Neoprene collars are priced slightly above regular nylon collars, but with their durability, design, and comfort, they are well worth the premium.
Chains
Some dog owners use chains as leashes, and that is unfortunate, to say the least. People typically resort to the use of chains when the dog develops a pattern of pulling on and breaking off its collar.
However, the solution to that is never a chain: if pulled against enough, the chain can cause irreversible physical damage to the dog, sometimes even causing their eyes to bulge. Common injuries include tracheal damage, cervical damage, muscle injuries, and chafing. This makes chains dangerous, cruel, unethical, and simply a total no-go as a walking or everyday collar. Perhaps the only justifiable use of chains is during supervised training.
Buckles
Dog collars come fitted with either clips or buckles as closure. Buckles are the clear choice for big dogs because they are more secure and hard-wearing. Buckles also permit you to attach your dog‚Äôs ID and leash to the collar and will keep them in place. However, keep in mind that in case of an emergency, buckle collars are not quick-release.
Is a Wide Collar Better?
Wide collars are ideal for everyday use, walking, and training. They offer better control, are more secure, and also prevent your dog from injuries. This is especially true for big dogs with large necks.
Firstly, if a dog has a neck wider than its head, it can conveniently slip out of a regular width collar. If the collar is instead wide, the dog will not be able to easily push it over its head. This will keep your dog‚Äôs ID and collar safely in place and also help the dog feel more secure.
Similarly, if a dog with a large neck pulls on its regular width collar, all the force applied will be centralized into a thin strip and can even start cutting into the animal‚Äôs neck. However, if the collar is wide, the tension will be spread out over a wider area and therefore keep excess pressure off the dog‚Äôs neck. This can help safeguard against potential injuries.
Conclusion
There are many good dog collar options available, depending on the needs of your dog. However, a rule of thumb to follow is, get a wide collar with a secure buckle fastening and make sure it is easy to clean and maintain. Happy shopping!There are options for genuine land agents in Ontario that would permit the agent a complementary to save their license sprightly otherwise of letting it lapse or be terminated.

Ingredients
For the Brine:
1 cup coarse/pickling salt
1/2 cup coarse-chopped onion
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon peppercorns
5 or 6 hot peppers, each cut in half, variety of choice (de arbols suggested)
2 bay leaves
1 pheasant
Mild, low-salt or salt-free poultry rub, optional
Aromatics: Herbs, onions, garlic, apples and/or fresh or dried peppers, optional
Apple juice or apple cider
For the Glaze:
1 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon (about 3 pods) of ground dried red chile
Instructions
For the Brine:
Combine all the brine ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a rolling boil for 5 to10 minutes. Cool the mixture in the refrigerator.
When the brine is cooled to 40 degrees or below, add the pheasant, placing a plate on the top to keep the bird submerged. Allow to brine for 10 to12 hours.
After brining, rinse the bird, pat dry, then place it on a rack over a drip pan in the refrigerator to air-chill for about 3 to 4 hours. Rub with the poultry rub and place the aromatics in the bird‚Äôs cavity, if desired.
For the Bird:
Preheat the barbecue to 250 to 275 degrees and set up for indirect cooking (place firebricks on the cooking grid, then position the drip pan and rack with bird, on top of the bricks). Add a small piece of smoking wood if you wish. Suggested: use a 3" by 3" piece of pecan. Remember that poultry absorbs smoke like a sponge, so use it sparingly.) Add some apple juice or apple cider to the drip pan if you wish.
Cook for about 1 and a half hours or until breast meat registers 155 degrees Use a spray bottle to spritz apple juice onto the bird every 20 to 30 minutes. At this point, begin to glaze the bird with the warmed-up glaze. Baste once or twice until the breast temperature reads 165 degrees. Remove the bird from the barbecue and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Carve the bird and drizzle the remaining glazes over the slices.Hi Friends! I hope your week is off to a good start. It‚Äôs been cold and dreary in DC so I‚Äôm trying not to let that keep me from staying motivated. Anyway, at the end of last week, a package arrived at my door that I was so happy to see ‚Äî it was the winter box from FabFitFun.
I have heard some good things about FabFitFun and all the products you can get in their seasonal boxes. So a couple months ago I decided to order a winter box for myself, as an early Christmas present. I had a 10% off code from their website as well, so I figured it was worth it to see what all the hype was about. Here‚Äôs what was inside my box:
- Candle in Bergamot Woods by D.L. & CO , $45
- Kiernan Double Pendant Necklace by Gorjana, $75
- Thank You Cards by Marie Mae Company , $24
- 2017 Weekly Planner by Moleskin, $21
- Iconoclast Mega Volume Mascara by Butter London, $20
- Mineral Peel Face by O.R.G. Skincare, $44
- Beach Butter Body Cream in Winter in Manhattan Beach by Anderson Lilley, $24
- Star Pin ‚Äì This is a bonus item in honor of their partnership with the Starlight Children‚Äôs Foundation, a nonprofit organization on a mission to brighten the days of seriously ill children.
One particular thing I like about the winter box I got is that it had items that I typically would never get myself.. like a $45 candle! It feels special to get a package of high-end items like these in a package just for you.
I was also originally skeptical about how many items in the box I would end up using, but I am very confident that I will use all of these things. They are all quite practical and the one fashion related thing ‚Äì the Gorjana necklace ‚Äì is totally my style. Of course I‚Äôll keep you updated with a review of the beauty products too!
All in all it was amazing to see what all I got for just $45 (the price of just the D.L. & Co candle!) and also discover some new products and companies. According to FabFitFun, the retail value of this box is $253. So, I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs definitely a great value.
A FabFitFun box would also make a great gift for someone special in your life. Or you can follow in my footsteps and indulge yourself in one! The other great thing about FabFitFun worth mentioning is that there is no subscription fee or process. You can simply buy one box and be done. There are also different types of boxes and add-ons that are worth checking out on their website because those might be more your style.
I‚Äôd love to know if you have gotten a FabFitFun box before and what you think about them. Did you have a favorite product? As of now, I think my favorite thing in the winter box I received is the Gorjana necklace.
Cheers!

Killer release on Uncanny Valley related Shtum label. Their latest offering is none other than Avalon Emerson, who hits hard with her first appearance on the Dresden-based label with a record full of techno beauties. "Constantly My Cure (Vocal Mix)" features vocals by Avalon herself that ride on an unstoppable acid-driven bassline towards a forceful and paradoxically cold yet warm climax. "Constantly My Cure (Plan Around Me Dub)", offers an instrumental redux that's less ambiguous in its intentions -- this one's aimed straight for maximum dancefloor effect. "Sword and Rose Forever" shows once again that she knows how to create relentless club music imbued with beautifully bittersweet atmosphere. The EP closes with the punch of "Hurdy Gurdy DJ Tool," a break-laden machine-piston of a rhythmic workout that's made for those selectors who want to set fire to the floor and jam the energy up to a frenetic peak. Recommended! Once again, the illustration on the B-side label is by Aram Haydeyan.

I asked Louise if I could borrow the words, and she graciously said yes.
Have a wonderful Tuesday friends.

Without the help of a real estate agent you wouldn‚Äôt be able to know which homes are for sale and that is why it is important for you to ensure that your find a well-established real estate company to help you out in this. Such agents are quite useful because they not only you find your dream home, but they also guide you into knowing the worth of the home that you are interested in buying.
You will find that most homeowners usually sell their home at a higher price than its actual worth and most buyers usually do not know this and the end up buying it only to find out in future that they were corned. This is usually something that most buyers end up doing unknowingly, and it is usually a loss on their part.
If you wants to buy a home in order for you to make the search easier for the agent their many things that you need to let them know first. One thing that you need to know is that the main reason as to why people are encouraged to inform the real estate‚Äôs when it comes to the location is because if you are someone who is old, and you have retired your main focus is your peace of mind, and you would want to buy a home in an urban city. If you are someone young you definitely would want to buy a home in a location that is not far away from where you are working in order for you to ease up your journey.
Make sure that you tell the agent when it comes to the number of bedrooms that you prefer in a home so that when you are looking for a house they know exactly what you are looking for. Comfort is the first thing that you should focus on, and it is important for you to ensure that you buy a home that can fit everything properly without the house looking squeezed. By now you know how stressful finding a house is; therefore, it is important for you to ensure that you buy a home that is big enough for everyone so that you don‚Äôt end up repeating the process of looking for a bigger house in future.
The Beginners Guide To Builders (What You Need To Know To Get Started)
The Beginners Guide To Builders (Finding The Starting Point)Walter Vale is a lonely man. With his wife having passed away and son living in London, his love of life is tested by a lack of activities, short of his job as a Connecticut College professor of economics. He attempts to take up piano lessons but ends up going through many instructors before finally giving it up.
He then is asked by his department head to give a presentation at New York University on a article he helped co-author. Walter reluctantly agrees and ends up shacking up in a Manhattan condominium he has owned, but rarely visits, for thirty-five years only to find out it is occupied by Tarek, who hails from Syria, and Zainab, Tarek's Senegalese girlfriend, who thought they were renting it from a friend of theirs.
Walter feels sorry for the couple and allows them to stay in his condo until they can find shelter elsewhere. Tarek and Walter quickly become friends, despite Zainab's reserved demeanor obviously suspicious of Walter's kindness. Since Tarek and Zainab are both undocumented immigrants, she is the more cautious of the two.
Thanks to Tarek (who is a musician) showing Walter how to play his bongo drum and the two playing together in a couple of park venues, Walter's depression and loneliness subsides since he has a new lease on life as well as an appreciation for a new genre of music.
Unfortunately, Tarek ends up getting arrested in a subway station and is then imprisoned in an immigrant detention center in Queens. Tarek's mother, Mouna, shows up shortly after Tarek's arrest concerned for her son's well-being due to her failed attempts at contacting him.
Walter tries to help Tarek further by hiring an immigration attorney and being the courier of notes from his mother and Zainab to him.
While slow at times, this film is well acted and well made. The Visitor makes another important point about the immigration debate going on in this country as well.
As it turns out, Tarek discloses to Walter during a visit to the detention center that his father was arrested and imprisoned for writing a letter published in a Syrian newspaper deemed criminal by the Syrian government.
This obviously is the reason why Mouna left Syria with Tarek since they could be targeted by the Syrian government for arrest and monitoring.
Soon after arriving in the United States, Mouna tried to apply for asylum or immigration documents so she and Tarek could remain in the U.S. legally. According to the attorney Walter hires, the cruxt of Tarek's defense hinged upon a rejection letter U.S. immigration officials had to send them. If Mouna did not recieve it, her son stood a chance of remaining in the U.S. If not, Tarek would be deported.
In the film you see the hypocrisy of U.S. immigration policies. Posters line the wall of the Queens detention center praising immigrants yet they are present in an institution set up by a system hostile to their ability to live legally in the U.S.
Its obvious that Walter benefited from his meeting and befriending Tarek, Dainab and Mouna. Yet, sadly, U.S. immigration policies do not take into account instances like Walter's situation and force people to have to choose between staying in their home country where they face persecution or flee to the United States where they can live but have to look over their shoulders at every opportunity to avoid being caught should they decide to remain here in defiance of U.S. immigration laws.
An individual (like Walter) and immigrants (like Tarek, Zainab and Mouna) have a fundamental, moral right to their lives, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is spelled out in the document that laid the philosophical foundation of the idea of our Republic, The Declaration of Independence which, among other points brought up against King George III, says:
[The present King of Great Britain] has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither...
As The Visitor points out, U.S. immigration laws are a sad joke and a perversion of Thomas Jefferson's libertarian vision for our country.
I certainly hope this movie will contribute to Americans re-asserting Jefferson's vision of the free society America can and should be.
Especially when it comes to immigrants and immigration.Topps' Allen and Ginter Baseball set traditionally appeals to a broad spectrum of collectors with it's vintage design and celebrity infused checklist.

A monitoring mechanism is vital for detecting malicious attacks against cyber systems. Detecting denial of service (DOS) and distributed DOS (DDOS) is one of the most important security challenges facing network technologies. This paper introduces a reliable detection mechanism based on the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) statistical metric and exponentially smoothing (ES) scheme for enabling efficient detection of DOS and DDOS attacks. In this regard, the CRPS is used to quantify the dissimilarity between a new observation and the distribution of normal traffic. The ES scheme, which is sensitive in detecting small changes, is applied to CRPS measurements for anomaly detection. Moreover, in CRPS-ES approach, a nonparametric decision threshold computed via kernel density estimation is used to suitably detect anomalies. Tests on three publically available datasets proclaim the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in detecting cyber-attacks.Get an Earful of Arabic: How to Improve Your Arabic Listening Skills Every Day
Do your ears hang low?
Then it might be due time to perk ‚Äôem up with some authentic Arabic audio.
Your Arabic fluency will be based on the four major skills of reading, speaking, writing and listening.
One the most difficult tasks while learning a foreign language is listening comprehension‚Äîand this is especially true for those who are learning the Arabic language.
To most, listening comes more easily than speaking. However, if we talk specifically about Arabic, most will admit to the fact that it takes a lot of patience and practice to comprehend what‚Äôs being said when they hear someone speaking in the language.
In this article, we‚Äôll give you some handy tips that will help you hone your listening skills.

Before You Start Listening to Anything in Arabic
Before we get started, here are a few before-you-start-listening pieces of advice that will help you get prepared for the application of the next set of tips.
- Accept the fact that you won‚Äôt be able to understand everything for a long time.
- Make listening your utmost priority. Get your listening resources in place and listen to them whenever you can, even if you have to do it while you‚Äôre driving, working out at the gym or doing your regular household chores.
- Listen to something that you enjoy.
- When listening, your complete focus should be on the speaker and not on translating what the speaker is saying into your native language.
- Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. If you fail to understand something, don‚Äôt take the stress. It will only be a hindrance to your learning.
- Give yourself a purpose before you start listening. You should listen to any Arabic audio with a goal in mind. For example, you might switch on a news channel with the goal of finding 10 new Arabic words for building your vocabulary. We‚Äôll explain this in detail in the coming paragraphs.
- Set different purposes for listening each day. For example, spend one day only on understanding the meaning, one day on listening to the sound and one day for understanding different tones.
- If listening is very difficult, get some controlled listening practice. Brainstorm some general words from your native language and listen to their Arabic translations on Google Translate or Forvo.
- One final piece of advice: Don‚Äôt give up! Developing Arabic listening skills takes, above all, time and patience.
If you follow these bits of advice, the way forward will be smoother and you‚Äôll learn faster.
Now, let‚Äôs get on with what should be your next course of action.
Listen Up! How to Improve Your Arabic Listening Skills
Here are our favorite tips to help you listen to Arabic and comprehend meaning better.
1. Improve your vocabulary
It sounds simple because it is simple.
Like we said earlier in this article, one good practice to improve your listening skills is to start building your vocabulary and absorbing as many common, everyday phrases as you can.
It might seem odd to be learning tons of isolated vocabulary words without context or grammar rules to piece them together. But, in my book, this is really the best strategy for getting started.
You‚Äôll start listening to advanced audio‚Äîeven as a newbie‚Äîand notice that you can pick out words here and there. It doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but it‚Äôs a huge, motivational confidence boost!
Go ahead and build a solid foundation of common words and phrases when you‚Äôre at the beginning level of language learning. Adopting this practice alone will make a world of difference in your ability to understand what you listen to.
You‚Äôll have to take this as a personal challenge and strive towards doing it every day.
Set yourself an easily achievable goal‚Äîlike learning 3-5 words per day‚Äîso you never feel overwhelmed or tempted to procrastinate. You‚Äôll find that you‚Äôll easily surpass your goals and expectations on most days.
After a period of time, you‚Äôll know common Arabic words and phrases well enough to understand the context in which they‚Äôre used without feeling the need to translate them in your mind.
2. Patience will take you a long way
Be patient with yourself and your level of uncertainty.
Don‚Äôt be surprised if you don‚Äôt understand a single word even after listening to your Arabic resources for quite some time. That happens with everybody trying to learn a new language. Instead of letting this get the better of you, resolve to strive more than ever.
At the very least, listening without understanding is familiarizing your ears with the sounds and rhythms of native Arabic speakers. This time spent listening will resurface when you‚Äôre speaking, and you‚Äôll notice that you‚Äôre pretty good at recreating an authentic Arabic accent.
Don‚Äôt become obsessed with understanding every little detail, either. If you get stuck on one new word in a sentence, let it go and try to listen to the rest of message. Getting the gist does wonders for understanding.
3. Guess, guess and guess again
Like we just said earlier, it‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll understand everything that‚Äôs said in your Arabic listening resources initially.
So, try to fill the gaps between the parts you do manage to understand and the parts you don‚Äôt with reasonable guesses.
While trying to guess what‚Äôs being said, look for contextual clues such as the tone of voice being used, the body language of the person speaking, facial expressions, background music and anything else you can latch onto.
4. Ask for help
This is very important for those who are learning Arabic from an instructor, and for those learning Arabic while abroad.
Never hesitate to ask for help, even if it means asking for it frequently.
When you face a problem in understanding something, don‚Äôt shy away from asking the speaker or instructor to help you understand a particular word or phrase over and over again. Ask them to repeat something for you, to say it in a different way or to speak more slowly. A good listener always triumphs over his or her fear of asking for help when it‚Äôs really needed.
5. Surf the web
If you‚Äôre using online resources to improve your Arabic listening comprehension skills (like something from this fantastic collection of Arabic audio), here are some additional tips that will help you get further in your daily practice of listening.
First, concentrate on strengthening your understanding of general contexts and themes. Focus on details later. For example, if your online resource has an audio file of a textual passage, spend time acquainting yourself with the background of that passage. Who wrote it? Who published it? What was the purpose of writing this?
Next, listen to the entire audio at least once. Too often, learners get hung up on understanding every line before moving on. After you‚Äôre through with one full listen, divide the resource into smaller segments and listen to each segment individually to understand better.
Both of these measures will help you figure out the big picture. Getting into specific details later will be easier.
6. Find listening resources with exercises
Many Arabic audio resources have accompanying exercises, and these are great for beginner learners.
For example, you might start with Al Jazeera Arabic learning audios and exercises.
With a resource like this, always start by familiarizing yourself with the exercise questions first.
If new words are introduced in a particular exercise of your listening resource, don‚Äôt just read through them. Take your time to learn them first. The best way to go about it is to listen to the new words a few times and say them out loud. Add them to your flashcard decks for additional practice.
Your next step should be to make sentences (if you‚Äôve got the grammar chops) using the words and say these sentences to yourself a few times. If you do this, you‚Äôll find it easier to complete the exercise after listening‚Äîwhich means that you‚Äôre on the right track.
Keep a pen and paper handy before starting with an exercise so that you can write down all the words and phrases that you don‚Äôt know from that particular listening exercise.
7. Chill out
Take breaks but don‚Äôt ever give up.
Remember that you‚Äôre not alone. Everybody who‚Äôs either learning or has already learned the Arabic language has encountered difficult exercises. When you too are faced with such an exercise, take it as a personal challenge.
If you don‚Äôt see success for some time, simply take a break from the exercise and return to it later with a fresh mind.
Arabic is one of most widely used languages around the world, but it‚Äôs also one of the toughest to learn‚Äîparticularly for those who aren‚Äôt natives of any Arab country.
Nevertheless, many people enthusiastically enroll themselves in Arabic language learning courses, both online and offline, to learn the language. Don‚Äôt forget that this is supposed to be a fun experience!
While many people take up learning a new language as a hobby or for travel, there are equally many who do it to maximize their chances of getting a job abroad. The demand for learning Arabic has increased, along with an increase in the employment opportunities in the Arab nations (most notably the UAE). Learning to improve your listening skills can definitely have a great payoff down the road.
Regardless of your language goals and purpose for studying, we sincerely hope that this article has helped you in some way.
Best of luck!

CBRE Cambodia‚Äôs 2021 Mid-Year Review provides insights into the performance in Phnom Penh‚Äôs real estate market across the first half of 2021, and an updated outlook for the rest of the year.
The first half of 2021 has proven itself to be a challenging moment for Cambodia‚Äôs real estate industry. Following an optimistic start to the year, a Covid-19 outbreak on 20th February has since escalated into a significant volume of community transmission cases and led to the first lockdown of Phnom Penh at the start of Q2. Following the end of the lockdown and a slow return to work, the Cambodian Government has rolled out an impressive, geographically targeted vaccination campaign, which in itself offers a glimmer for a return to a ‚Äònew‚Äô normal before the end of the year.
The real estate markets have reach reacted differently to the disruption and uncertainty that Covid-19 has wrought on the country, but by and large, each is facing a period of diminished demand and a slow down in the delivery of new supply. In the retail, condominium and serviced apartment sectors, rents and prices have continued to come under pressure, whilst new launches have dried up.
The office market has largely bucked the trend, seeing an improved level of confidence from occupiers as they explore expansion opportunities in what is now a more competitive market. However, the longer-term threat of over-supply still looms over the office sector, and begs the question, how long will the current upswing in rents last?

Should We Plant or Protect?
The short answer is: both. However, it is good to understand that, in terms extracting climate-changing carbon dioxide from the air, protecting existing mature forests is more effective than planting small seedlings. It will take decades for a seedling equal the carbon storage of a mature conifer. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have decades to head off the disasterous effects of climate change. This video by our friends in Napa County says it better than I can:

Why Sonoma County Needs a Solid Tree Protection Ordinance‚ÄìA White Paper
The Protect Our Working Woodlands group has prepared a white paper (see below) explaining the background and need for strong science based tree protections in Sonoma County.
We, unlike many other areas, still have trees. Many might not be aware, however, that the county approves many proposals that clear our shared woodlands off the landscape under current County rules. The County currently issues over counter permits even for very large clearing proposals without mitigating efforts, environmental review, or public Notice. Now, after many years of public pressure, the County is revisiting its tree policies.
This white paper is meant to be concise and to help prepare the public to weigh in now by writing your Board of Supervisors (bos@sonoma-county.org) before May 18th, and consider making a public comment on May 18th during the Board of Supervisor‚Äôs meeting in support of broad science based tree protection measures necessary to draw down carbon, as well as the other critical benefits for water, shade, soil stability and wildlife.
White Paper (download pdf)
Defending Our Working Woodlands
Although mature trees, woodlands, and forests (trees) are capable of immediately taking huge amounts of carbon out of our atmosphere at a scale‚Äìthat in combination with reduced CO2 emissions‚Äìcan greatly and cheaply mitigate our adverse impacts on the climate in the short time we have left to avoid catastrophic changes to younger generations, thousands of acres of trees are vulnerable and they are being removed, from the landscape under current county land use policies.
The current Sonoma County Tree Ordinance policy (1986) is scientifically outdated and severely undervalues the importance of trees and woodlands to people, to wildlife, and to the critical struggle to reverse the climate crisis.
The Scientific Imperative for Trees
Scientists agree, protecting existing forests is the best low-cost approach for immediately sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, ultimately reducing climate change impact:
‚ÄúWith respect to pulling harmful carbon out of the atmosphere, natural forests are by far the most effective.‚Äù (Lewis et al., 2019 ).
‚ÄúStanding forests are the only proven system that can remove and store vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at the scale necessary to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees celcius this century. It is therefore essential to not only prevent further emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation, forest degradation, bioenergy, but also to expand our forests‚Äô capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and store it long-term.‚Äù (IPCC, Moomaw, Ph. D. et al. Intact Forests in the United States: Proforestation Mitigates Climate Change and Serves Greatest Good. emphasis added).
‚ÄúClimate science shows that we cannot stop a climate catastrophe without scaling up the protection of forests around the world, including in the United States.‚Äù Statement from 200 US based elected officials, organizations, and eminent scientists including 40 mayors, and the Sunrise Movement. (#Stand4Forests)
Drawing Down Carbon ‚Äî Reductions and Emissions
While new technologies may be coming that may take carbon out of the atmosphere, we must also use what we know works now. Time is not on our side. The IPCC estimates we have approximately 10 years to drastically change our activities to avoid critical temperature rise.
‚ÄúTechnologies for direct [Carbon dioxide removal] CDR from the atmosphere, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), are far from being technologically ready or economically viable.‚Äù (IPCC scientist -Moomaw, Masino, et al)
Relying on new tree plantings will not accomplish the task, as new forests pale when compared to a mature forests carbon sequestration value. ‚ÄúNewly planted forests require many decades to a century before they sequester carbon dioxide in substantial quantities.‚Äù (IPCC).
Under Cutting the Future of Fires in Our Communities
The fires blowing through our communities are the result of past development models, and we now need new models.
Continued destruction of the forests occurring here and around the world in combination with vast emissions will continue to make both the climate and fires worse. Removing more trees is not the answer. Fire scientists are telling tell us that the best way to protect communities and homes now from fire is to make the homes themselves ready for these fires by removing all flammable material within five feet of structures and carefully managing the property immediately around the home and out buildings (Jack Cohen, Ph. D.).
The wind driven fires we have seen are not stopped by thinning or clearing trees out in the wildlands. The fuel that is vulnerable to these embers‚Äìdriven by winds across large rivers and freeways, are the flammable materials around homes.
The real work of protecting communities and homes requires fighting climate change as effectively as we know how and leaning into modern fire education and public policy. As the science explains, protecting forests and woodlands in combination with significant reductions of emissions will effectively deliver the balance and security we all seek.
A modern Science Based Model by Sonoma County
The lands within the borders of Sonoma County have the capacity to grow trees that many in less nature-rich areas envy. Tree removal, even on a very large scale, unfortunately, continues to be considered appropriate public policy in Sonoma County.
We seek a comprehensive, fair, open, and scientifically based approach to protecting a resource that provides benefits to the community and that is a shared resource for the community as a whole.
We are asking the County of Sonoma to:
Update the County Tree Protection Ordinance, based on the best climate science incorporating input from the community to that end;
Pass an immediate, temporary moratorium on approvals of significant tree clearing in Sonoma County until such time as our Tree Protection Ordinance is updated and reflects the value of trees in climate mitigation;
Recogize the scientific emphasis on preserving mature trees across the board because mature trees and second growth trees are scientifically shown to be among our best carbon sinks;
Also consider fire safety around homes, defensible community spaces, essential food farming, and very low income housing as important values;
Protect trees as a means to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts of climate change;
In closing, Sonoma County must do all it can to protect future generations from the devasting effects of climate change. It can do so by embracing the science with respect to the important role trees play in our struggle to rein in green house gases in as rapid a manner as possible and thereby respect the younger generation‚Äôs right to a habitable planet.
Letter to Board of Supervisors Supporting a Tree Ordinance
May 5, 2021
Dear Supervisors and Staff:
We are writing on behalf of our approximately 1500 Forest Unlimited supporters. We have worked locally for over 25 years to protect watersheds from irreversible impacts of irresponsible logging and planted over 34,000 redwoods on protected properties with hundreds of volunteers.
Forest Unlimited members are participating and watching the County‚Äôs current effort to update the tree protection policies. In that spirit, while the existing tree policies are reviewed and a new policy adopted, we urge the County of Sonoma to act swiftly and cease issuance of tree removal permits to prevent further destruction of trees, woodlands, and forests. As climate science tells us, existing trees are a large part of the climate saving-equation drawing down large quantities of the harmful carbon we continue to emit in large quantities (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Moomaw, Ph. D. et al. Intact Forests in the United States: Proforestation Mitigates Climate Change and Serves Greatest Good).
Science tells us that we have only ten years for making significant gains. Trees that are 10 years or older translate into time, this is the time we need to make the necessary adjustment to mitigate climate change impacts. Therefore, all trees at least 10 years of age must be preserved across the county‚Äôs landscape. Protected trees will provide substantial services to the community and future generations.
Major Long-term Economic and Community Safety Considerations
* Climate change is adversely affecting our existing community, our farms, and our watersheds;
‚Ä¢ Reversing climate change is of the highest concern and effective measures to contribute to that effort must be implemented;
‚Ä¢ Drastic reductions in emissions and drawing down carbon are critically important in that effort;
‚Ä¢ Existing trees drawdown carbon immediately and on a large scale;
‚Ä¢ Compromising our ability to drawdown carbon should not be an option at this time;
‚Ä¢ Existing woodlands, forests, and trees must be preserved with minor exceptions (e.g. trees close to homes);
The Protection of Trees
Currently, Sonoma County permits large numbers of tree removal proposals on a yearly basis.
This is true despite the many valuable functions trees provide to the community including:
‚Ä¢ Protection of our shared clean water supply insofar as woodlands of all sorts help infiltrate water into the aquifers for well owners and stream flows, reduce soil erosion by protecting soils from runoff of stormwaters, and help moderate soil heating and soil loss from extreme solar exposure deep ripping, etc.;
‚Ä¢ Mature trees are more fire resilient;
‚Ä¢ Trees provide free services to the community and are better than ‚Äúshovel ready‚Äù because they are doing critical work for us already;
‚Ä¢ Mature trees sequester by far more carbon than seedlings and saplings;
‚Ä¢ Woodlands support very high levels of biodiversity which is critical to humans as well as other species;
‚Ä¢ Protecting trees safeguards soil and groundwater through their deep root structure and works in combination with canopy shade that also provides micro-climate enhancement;
‚Ä¢ Trees create wet weather systems that we need on large and small scales; and
‚Ä¢ The upper canopy of woodlands cool the soil below and facilitate absorption of rainfall into the ground for human and other uses.
Actions Required
‚Ä¢ Refrain from issuing tree removal permits until such time as the County has in place a Comprehensive Tree Protection Policy that is based on the latest climate science;
‚Ä¢ Create County policy so that mature trees are of the highest value to the health and safety of our community in the fight to rein in climate change.
‚Ä¢ Ensure that the new policy is fair‚Äìprojects and proposed activities will be treated the same and existing mature trees, woodlands, and forests will be presumptively protected;
‚Ä¢ The County should look at narrow exceptions for creating reasonable defensible space around individual homes for fire protection (see Jack Cohen, Ph. D.);
Forest Unlimited has, and especially now, views all mature trees as highly valuable and urges the County of Sonoma to move forward a comprehensive and climate appropriate protection policy that honors our children and begins the long process of mitigating past and ongoing development activities.
We look forward to a successful update process that is based on the climate science.
Sincerely,
Larry Hanson
President of the Board of Directors
Forest UnlimitedIsn‚Äôt it a little startling to look at US past performances and see how little ‚Äúlive‚Äù information is in them? For example, anyone who has ever played the races knows there‚Äôs frequently a discrepancy between the listed post time for virtually any race and the actual post time. Tracks routinely fall behind for myriad reasons, or sometimes accelerate their schedule (typically due to impending weather)‚Äìand PPs typically do not account for this.
We apologize for not addressing this sooner, but as of now you will see live, accurate Minutes to Post in the Race Header section of TimeformUS PPs‚Äìno need to constantly check the toteboard for how much time you have; it‚Äôs right in your PPs.
A few notes about this new feature:
1) We will list official post times until the betting is open for a track for the day. So as soon as live data is available for the first race or any subsequent race, we‚Äôll switch over to the live feed that race.
2) When betting closes on a given race, our PPs will display ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù for Minutes To Post. Prior to ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù you will often see ‚Äú0 Min‚Äù for a few minutes, meaning that the race is imminent, but you can still get a bet in‚Äìbut hurry. And yes, we have considered showing ‚Äúnegative minutes to post‚Äù for tracks that are chronically behind schedule!
3) Soon we‚Äôll use this new feature to take you directly to the next race in any track‚Äôs PPs, rather than simply defaulting to Race 1. We‚Äôre excited to streamline your raceday even further!
4) Another benefit of this feature is if there are last-minute scratches, they will typically be reflected in our PPs, and if time permits, we‚Äôll even run a fresh Pace Projector accounting for any late scratches.
5) Most tracks have agreed to let us use their live Minutes to Post data, but a few have not. For those tracks we‚Äôll continue to use ‚Äústatic‚Äù Minutes To Post data.
We‚Äôre also pleased to add live Win odds to our Past Performances. You‚Äôll see them appear next to the Morning Line odds in our PPs, and once again it‚Äôll save you the time of having to use multiple sources to look for current Win odds. Please note that live odds typically come in every 30-60 seconds, and when the price on a horse changes, we will have the live odds field blink with the change. That way, you‚Äôll know that we have in fact consumed the most recent odds data, and are displaying it.
A few notes about the live odds feature, quite similar to the notes on Minutes To Post:
1) We will list official Morning Lines until the betting is open for a track for the given day. As soon as live odds data is available for the first race or any subsequent race, we‚Äôll display it next to the Morning Line.
2) The odds you see on the left side navigation under each horse‚Äôs name will be Live Odds, once the data is available on a given race.
3) The ‚ÄúOdds: Mine‚Äù field is placeholder for a tool that will eventually let you set your own line and more easily spot value vs. the live odds.
4) Most tracks have agreed to let us use their live odds data, but a few have not. For those tracks we‚Äôll continue to display only the Morning Line, and display a dash in the PPs where the live odds would otherwise be populated.
Any questions? Please contact us at support@timeformus.com

According to study performed by Beckers, 66% of readmissions happen within the first 15 days after a hospital discharge. This urgency puts a whole new focus on care transitions from hospital to post-acute care providers and their role amongst the broad care team to keep patients at home longer.
Dr. Chris Trotz and his team at South Jersey Family Medicine put together a program to prevent readmissions, improve patient safety, and enhance patient satisfaction. The initiative focused on increasing communication with a team that historically had no close bond or relationship with the patient ‚Äî a challenge for a hyper-fragmented and isolated post-acute care segment. They worked with PreparedHealth to integrate the platform into the workflow across the broad care team. Total health management enabled the team to proactively manage the patient case with real-time connectivity. The program resulted in no readmissions within 30 days for any patients enrolled in the program, along with a 20% reduction of the beneficiary cost of care.
We sat down with Dr. Trotz to get a more in-depth look at how he is creating an expanded care team virtually. The conversation was enlightening and he agreed to let us share his secrets to success that will no doubt help many other Primary Care Physicians, as well as Geriatricians, Nurse Practitioners, Care Managers, and other types of providers who need to better utilize their relationships with post-acute providers.
Step 1: Pick the Right Team
Know how you really want to work with your partners and coach them. Create a care team driven by quality of care and a willingness to rally around the patient. Find other providers who are eager to communicate about the patient in real time and engage with each other. Increase engagement between the primary care office, long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, home care agencies, and hospital case managers coordinating discharges from the hospital.
Step 2: Put the PCP at the center
The person who knows the patient best needs to be included at the center of the dialogue. The PCP has the historical knowledge to help the team make quicker, more efficient decisions on interventions and avoid excessive or repeated testing and care.
Step 3: Create Situational Awareness
As a PCP, coach the new team members on the psycho-social aspects of the individual that may contribute to the urge to transition quickly back to the hospital when unnecessary. Being accessible, especially during the initial care transition period is critical to stabilizing a patient in a new, unfamiliar care setting. Often times the needs are not clinical, but behavioral and social in nature. Go beyond a referral or care transition and continue to communicate especially in that critical first 15-day window where most readmissions take place.
Step 4: Engage the Family
Often times the PCP treats the disease or condition. We need to treat the person, which also includes their environment and family members. Most anxiety for a patient stems from their family. Learn to create a respected, empowered relationship where they become an extension of the care team. Engage, inform and educate them on how to be effective and become an extension of your care team. Doing so can prevent unnecessary utilization, and accelerate recovery in their desired care setting, often their home.
Step 5: Set Communication Expectations
Be clear on the types of communication updates you want and what frequency. Technology is great, but with 1000s of patients to care for, a detailed text chat on all of them is not realistic. Set your escalation parameters and key areas that require heightened and active engagement. For example, sudden changes in behavior, non-compliance with medication or therapy, rapid deterioration of condition, lack of community or home-based support are all critical items that PCPs need relayed to them in order to provide timely intervention.

Interests
My main interests are currently in trust and reputation. Trust is a multi-faceted concept which can (and should) be tackled through multiple disciplines and methodologies; my particular angle is through formalisation. My current work is focusing on formalising attacks against theoretical models of reputation and trying to understand how they may manifest in practice. My background is in theoretical computer science, security and physics with a focus on formal languages, cryptography and statistical mechanics.
I have strong interests in social and psychological phenomena also (still with a leaning towards formal, theoretical work). As such, I enjoy keeping an eye on work in analytical sociology which is a growing area with a lot of potential. More broadly, I am interested in studying the exploitation and defence of sociological phenomena (such as trust) through a formal lens.Episode 89

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt what we don‚Äôt know that gives us trouble, it‚Äôs what we know that ain‚Äôt so.‚Äù ‚Äì Will Rogers
I‚Äôm pretty sure we all carry around head trash ‚Äì things that we believe that aren‚Äôt actually true. Of course since we believe it, it never crosses our mind that it might not be true ‚Äì essentially it‚Äôs a blind spot.
The problem with head trash or a blind spot is that it can make things harder than they need to be‚Ä¶or even potentially make it impossible to succeed. We look at data, analyze options and make decisions ‚Äì all without realizing that we‚Äôre using a filter that‚Äôs keeping us from seeing the real picture.
Let me give you an example ‚Äì I‚Äôve talked to 3 different business owners in the last 2 weeks and although they were in very different businesses and industries, all 3 of them shared a crippling problem that was rooted in head trash.
They all believed that they cannot charge any more for their product / service than what they are currently charging.
Maybe they‚Äôre right ‚Äì they may be priced exactly in line with the marketplace for what they‚Äôre offering.
However ‚Äì even if that‚Äôs true (which I don‚Äôt think it is) ‚Äì that leaves them with at least 2 major problems.
Problem #1 ‚Äì they aren‚Äôt making enough money
If they‚Äôre right and they absolutely can‚Äôt charge anymore than they are today, then their business model is broken. They are struggling, working way too many hours and doing too many things themselves because there isn‚Äôt enough money flowing to the bottom line for them to be able to scale in a healthy way.
When you have a business that can‚Äôt generate enough to cover all of your costs (including a market based wage for you as the owner) plus a healthy profit margin of at least 10%, then you have a business that‚Äôs on life support. You may be able to limp along indefinitely, but it‚Äôs really hard going and any kind of negative surprise will immediately put a lot of pressure on you financially.
The lack of profitability makes it impossible for you to build up reserves and weather downturns.
Problem #2 ‚Äì they aren‚Äôt different enough
If they are priced exactly in line with whatever else is out there, customers will perceive their product or service as being essentially the same as the competition. When customers have choices, and everything looks the same, then they will make their choice based on price. A losing scenario any way you slice it. Either you‚Äôre going to lose out on opportunities because your competition decides to undercut your pricing‚Ä¶or you‚Äôre going to lower your pricing to get the business, which leads us back to problem #1‚Ä¶you aren‚Äôt making enough money as it is.
You‚Äôve got a blind spot putting a cap on pricing with a side effect of selling a product that looks like everything else out there.
How do you break the blind spot?
Unfortunately, blind spots are hard to break. By definition, you don‚Äôt recognize that you have an issue. You have a firm belief in something that isn‚Äôt true ‚Äì and that firm belief will keep you from questioning things that need to be questioned.
That said, there are a couple of things you can do that will help.
1. Get some outside perspective
One of the biggest advantages of an outside advisor‚Ä¶like maybe a business coach?‚Ä¶is that they are less likely to share your blind spots. They don‚Äôt have the emotional attachment and they have worked with other businesses and have a broader view of what‚Äôs possible.
But having an outside advisor only works if you are actually open to their ideas. You don‚Äôt have to agree and act on everything or even anything they say, but you do need to be willing to consider any new ideas they bring up.
2. Think about your business as a Science Project
If you approach your business as a lab experiment, then it‚Äôs perfectly natural to try new things, in a controlled fashion. If you believe that your pricing is as high as it can go, but you need to make more money, then try an experiment and change your business model and your pricing and see what happens. How could you add value, change the perceptions of what you offer‚Ä¶and charge more? Come up with a new variation and try selling that for the next month or two and see what kind of response you get. Maybe raise your price for a specific area or product as a controlled experiment.
Constantly be looking for ways to learn new things and let the data drive where you go next.
Just being aware that you might have some blind spots will help you mitigate the risk ‚Äì but it‚Äôs a constant battle and you‚Äôve got to be always on the lookout for believing things that might not be true.
Are you aware of any blind spots that you‚Äôve got? Or maybe something you‚Äôve overcome in the past? How did you break out of it? We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

10 Afghan children smuggled by Taliban into Pakistan to be sent home
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) in Pakistan on Friday placed 10 Afghan children into the custody of the Afghan consulate after ascertaining the minors had been smuggled into Pakistan.
Abdul Hameed Jalili, from the Afghan consulate, who attended the court hearing told journalists the children hailed from Afghanistan‚Äôs Badakhshan province.
He said the children had been sent to Akora Khattak by the Taliban illegally to be enrolled in a madrassa for religious education.
The high court‚Äôs chief justice Waqar Ahmed Seth, ordered the consulate to ensure the children are reunited with their parents.
In addition, he told authorities to continue the investigation and submit their findings to the court.
The court heard from police, the children were smuggled, without documents, from Badakhshan province in Afghanistan into Pakistan and enrolled in a madrassa in Akora Khattak town in Nowshera.
Dawn News reported that the court heard an application filed by an Afghan refugee cardholder, who said he had brought the children, who are his relatives, to Akora Khattak‚Äôs refugee camp.
According to the applicant, the children had been taken away by a madrassa and the administration had refused to let him see the children.
Police told the court that the children had been brought to Pakistan illegally and had no valid documents, while the applicant in turn could not explain how he managed to get the children into Pakistan.
The court ordered police to arrest the applicant and investigate the matter thoroughly.
When asked why they were brought to Pakistan, the children ‚Äî all of whom are aged 10 or under ‚Äî said they were in the country to get religious education.
The bench was told that the children could not speak Pashto or Urdu and a translator was brought in.
The translator told the court that ‚Äúit seemed as if the children have been brainwashed. They answer each question together.‚Äù
The chief justice asked authorities how the children were smuggled into the country without agencies being alerted.
‚ÄúChildren were brought here from Afghanistan and no one knows about this. What are the agencies doing?‚Äù Justice Seth asked.
The court also ordered police to arrest staff at the madrassa and to find out if there were other Afghan children at that facility and others.Table of Contents

Leading members of the LGBTQ+ community have called on Sadiq Khan to reform Pride in London ahead of its 50th anniversary next year over accusations of racism, bullying and exploitation.
The annual event, which is overseen by a board of voluntary directors, is funded by the Mayor of London and has a contract with his office.
But Peter Tatchell, the LGBTQ+ human rights campaigner who helped organise the UK‚Äôs first Pride march, has said that Pride in London is ‚Äúno longer abiding by its contract‚Äù with the mayor‚Äôs office and ‚Äúhas lost the trust and confidence of much of the LGBTIQ community‚Äù.
Earlier this year, Pride in London‚Äôs entire community advisory board along with its most senior Black member of staff resigned over concerns of racism within the organisation.
Fourteen leading members of the LGBTQ+ community, including Peter Tatchell, have now signed an open letter to Sadiq Khan calling on him to make significant reforms to Pride, including launching an independent investigation into the racism and bullying accusations.
Mr Tatchell said: ‚ÄúWe are urging the Mayor to take action, given that Pride in London is no longer abiding by its contract and has lost the trust and confidence of much of the LGBTIQ community. I hope the Mayor will meet us.
‚ÄúOur nine demands are a bid to fix the problems with Pride in London. They are a compilation of concerns expressed by a wide cross section of the LGBTIQ community.
‚ÄúWe do not claim to have all the answers. We see this letter as a catalyst for change. I hope it will generate a much-needed debate within our community about who runs Pride, how it is run and Pride‚Äôs future character and direction. We welcome others contributing ideas.‚Äù
The letter also outlines concerns that the annual Pride march in London ‚Äì the largest in the UK ‚Äì has become too commercial, with ‚Äúcorporate and commercial interests having undue influence‚Äù over the event.
Companies have been accused of ‚Äúexploiting‚Äù the LGBTQ+ community by using the march as an ‚Äúadvertising and branding opportunity‚Äù, which detracts from its intention of promoting human rights.
With the official Pride march cancelled earlier this year, thousands gathered in London for the ‚ÄúReclaim Pride‚Äù event in July that aimed to see the event return to its roots as a protest.
Peter Tatchell said that the success of the Reclaim Pride march ‚Äúshows that there is a yearning for change‚Äù among the community.
Responding to the letter, a spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: ‚ÄúLondon will always be a beacon of inclusiveness, acceptance and diversity.
‚ÄúThe views and contribution of our city‚Äôs vibrant and diverse LGBTQ+ community are vital to shaping successful Pride in London events.
‚ÄúAs we look ahead to welcoming the 50th anniversary celebration of Pride in London next year, we are fully committed to supporting the community to deliver a safe and inclusive event.‚Äù

Select sizeSince the introduction of the Apple Gatekeeper by MAC OSX, many researchers have focused their attention in trying to find flaws affecting it due to bypass Apple security and gain control of a device.
Patrick Wardle, director of research at Synack has already demonstrated another method called Apple dylib hijacking.
Today at Virus Bulletin in Prague, Patrick Wardle will again do another demonstration in how to bypass Gatekeeper, something that he is being working for some time now.
We don‚Äôt have many details but Patrick Wardle guaranteed that he shared his findings with Apple and the company is working on a patch to fix the issue.
The method that Patrick Wardle will demonstrate can require some ‚Äù re-architecting‚Äù of the OS, in order to fully exploit the Apple Gatekeeper.
As you probably know, Apple Gatekeeper runs a number of checks before allowing a App to run, in fact you will not be able to execute code that wasn‚Äôt signed by an Apple developer, you will not be able to run apps that weren‚Äôt downloaded from Apple‚Äôs store if the device is not jailbreaked of course.
What Patrick Wardle says is that the Apple Gatekeeper is falling to check if the app is running or loading other apps, or libraries. If you are able to convince the user into downloading a signed, but infected app from a third-party source, you could load a malicious library into a directory over an insecure HTTP download.
In the tests that Wardle did, he used signed Apple binaries and crafted them for his attack, in order to look like a DMG file, and tricking the user into downloading it. For the user all will look normal since it will look like a traditional app icon, but when executed, the DMG file will search for a malicious executable and run it.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not super complicated, but it effectively completely bypasses Gatekeeper,‚Äù.‚Äù Said Wardle,
Regarding OS versions affected by the Apple GateKeeper Bypass, Wardle believes that all versions, including the new El Capitan are affected, and he run his tests in an El Capitan beta version.
,‚Äù .‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really a bug, but a limitation of Gatekeeper. I think fixing this requires significant code changes. It‚Äôs not like they can just patch a buffer overflow with an extra check. This will take some significant changes.‚Äù
.‚Äù
We can only wait and see what Apple will do with this, since the problem is related with the Apple Gatekeeper core, the way it was design, so does that mean that Apple will redesigned Gatekeeper? Time will tell.

Size was spot on. These boots were so light and well fitting that I thought they might be not up to the walking job they needed to be for! However - they are so comfortable that i forget I am wearing them, which is exactly what you want. Not heavy on your foot, soft, and haven't rubbed at all. They are the first pair of boots I have bought since a pair of Solomon's about 17 years ago and I am more than pleased with them. Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time.
Very comfortable and look good. Easy to put on and pull off.
A great product - I am so pleased with this purchase. After listening to the advice of Dan (Yeovil store) and trying on different styles in store I ordered these boots as they didn‚Äôt have my size.
I have always been reluctant to spend so much money on walking boots but I‚Äôve paid for quality and comfort - well worth the money. No complaints at all.
These fitted perfectly from the off and I didn't need to 'break them in'.
I tried the Terra 11 as a potentially harder wearing boot but settled on the Cyrus and I'm very happy with them.
Comfortable but very slippery!!!
Mrs Moth is very happy with these ! It was the only pair of walking boots she would consider ! Style and performance etc! Had scarpa's for years they are the best I've ever had and I wear them daily ! Very happy to find these in the sale ! As I'm sure they are worth the price tag but they're always a bit better when they are better value.
+very pretty and temperature comfortable in warm and cold weather. good breathing. stays waterproof for long.
+ comfortable
- rigid sole. zero shock absorbtion, zero insole padding. rough walking. wouldn't take to long several-days walk
- more slippery sole compared to other boots I had
I bought a pair of these thinking they would be the dream boot. Such a trusted brand. I sent the first pair back, after multiple leaks and thought it might just be that pair. They replaced them no problem. The second pair are the same. These are not waterproof.
Fantastic fit and
super waterproof and comfortable
Lovely comfy boots, so excited to wear them today but come home and their wet inside the uppers- and it wasn‚Äôt even raining- just wet grass. No good. Going backglass beads | cotton tassels | gold plated brass earring hooks

Trone joins lawmakers to support fight against synthetic drug trafficking
Credit: The Garrett County Republican
WASHINGTON ‚Äî U.S. Reps. David Trone, D-Md., and Michael McCaul, R-Texas, along with Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, introduced the Fighting Emerging Narcotics Through Additional Nations to Yield Lasting Results Act to increase global cooperation in the fight against synthetic drug trafficking.
The FENTANYL Results Act, introduced Monday, would authorize two programs through the State Department that would build foreign law enforcement capacity to detect synthetic drugs and carry out an international exchange program for drug demand reduction experts.
Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released preliminary data showing a dramatic increase in overdose deaths from 2018 to 2019, which highlighted that synthetic drugs led to the greatest year over year increase in overdose deaths.
‚ÄúMy nephew, Ian Trone, died of a fentanyl overdose at the age of 24 alone in a hotel room, and since his passing, we‚Äôve seen a dramatic and alarming increase in fentanyl and other synthetic opioid deaths across this country,‚Äù said Trone,, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, and Sen. Rob Portman on this bill that will direct new efforts within the State Department to ensure we are taking every possible step to end the flow of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs into the United States.‚Äù
‚ÄúFentanyl continues to fuel the overdose crisis in New Hampshire and take lives from every community in our state,‚Äù.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to join my colleagues Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Representatives Michael McCaul and David Trone on this bipartisan, bicameral bill that will continue our work to reduce the devastating effects of synthetic opioid drug production like fentanyl,‚Äù said.‚Äù.
Grapes & Acne
Acne is one of the most common issues affecting the skin, afflicting more than 17 million adolescents and adults in the United States, according to Henry Ferdowsian, MD, MPH, of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. Like many chronic diseases of the skin, acne is influenced by the foods in your diet. Grapes are one food that might affect acne development.
Diet and Acne
The typical Western diet -- rich in refined carbohydrates and low in antioxidants and healthy fats -- is largely responsible for high rates of acne found in developed countries, reports a review paper published in the December 2002 "Archives of Dermatology." The paper adds that a trio of factors that induce acne -- oxidation, activity of sweat glands and insulin levels -- are largely influenced by dietary factors 1.
Antioxidants

Oxidation is a natural by-product of your body's energy-producing pathways. While low levels of oxidation are benign, high levels of oxidation can increase sweat gland activity and clog pores, notes the book "The Dietary Cure For Acne," penned by nutrition scientist Loren Cordain, PhD 1. Like all fresh fruit, grapes are a rich source of antioxidants -- compounds that can significantly reduce oxidation. Grapes contain a powerful antioxidant known as resveratrol -- the compound in red wine that promotes health. Opt to eat the skin of grapes as this is where most of the fruit's antioxidants are found.

Glycemic Load
Different carbohydrate-rich foods influence your body's insulin levels in different ways. Some foods cause a ripple of insulin release, while others induce a massive spike in blood insulin. How much a given food impacts insulin is known as the glycemic load. High glycemic load foods promote large amounts of insulin release, while low glycemic load foods don't result in a rapid insulin rise. According to Henry Ferdowsian, MD, MPH, a high glycemic load diet promotes acne development. Grapes are a high glycemic load food. Their glycemic load of 8 is significantly higher than that of other fresh fruits, such as apples and pears.

Although not dangerous, acne should be treated under the supervision of a dermatologist. No study has investigated the effects of grapes on acne development. In addition to following a healthy diet, you can reduce acne by washing your face twice daily, reducing stress and limiting your intake of dairy products.

I also didn't know that nonviolent crimes could count as strikes. Now we see Russell Benson get 25 years to life for stealing a carton of cigarettes. That may be allowed by the language of the law, but is that really what the voters had in mind? MIGUEL MUNOZ Los Angeles * * * The court's decision makes it more important than ever to temper our state's three-strikes law with common sense, fairness and humane consideration. I worked for more than 10 years in the L.A. County district attorney's office, so I understand the law enforcement perspective. I have been a victim of crime. But I'm also the father of a young man serving an unduly long prison sentence under our harsh three-strikes law. The pendulum has swung too far on the side of severe penalties. What does this say about a society and a justice system that have become as vicious as the crimes they seek to punish? What will we really gain by raising a generation of young people in prison? I recommend that the third strike must be a serious, violent felony. As in death penalty cases, inform juries that they are dealing with a "strikes" case and the possible consequences. Give judges more discretion to weed out the cases for which the three-strikes law was not intended. Finally, instead of this intense drive to incarcerate more and more young people, let's put more resources into education and rehabilitation.

It‚Äôs only a matter of months since it announced it was quitting for pastures new - across the border into West Yorkshire - so it was a surprise to hear it was making a return.
The vacated Gateway House hasn‚Äôt been completely devoid of people.
We understand part of the site was still being used by Skipton Building Society, but the vast majority of it was left empty.
In recent months it has been used as a Covid vaccination centre and we are still waiting for details if and when this will be moved.
In fact details are still sketchy about when Computershare intends to return.
There is no doubt it is good news though many will say the premises is too far out of town for resident workers to add to the local economy. There is also the possibility that many of the original 484 staff (at the last count) could work from home some of the week. It is also a base for future jobs for local people which is always good news.
But the fact of the matter is it is a large company and may well encourage other firms to set up in the district. It all adds to the feel-good factor of a town which is what everyone.BY ELNUR EMINOGLU, AZERI DAILY AUTHOR
This unusual question after the long-awaited hope for peace after the two bloody Karabakh wars from the early morning is on the lips of the residents of Azerbaijan and Armenia, caught unawares by the new military report from Lachin, Zangezur, Kalbajar. The cherished peace turned out to be just a short pause. The lips of politicians and diplomats fell silent, after which the machine guns began to speak again.
Armenia, like on the eve of the short-term July 2020 war on the contact line in Tovuz, tried to occupy strategic heights in the direction of the Lachin district, a narrow corridor in mountainous terrain connecting Armenia with the upper part of Karabakh. However, as in July 2020, the attack of the Armenian units was drowned out, and the Azerbaijani Army, forced to launch a counteroffensive, threw back the positions of the Armenian troops.
A collision in this section of the non-delimitated border has been brewing for a long time. In the foreground of the post-conflict picture, another Grigoryan, Mher and Shahin Mustafayev, were holding tense negotiations at the round table, divided by the ponderous Overchuk. In the background, near Western Zangezur, near Lachin, there were permanent clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani military personnel, who tried to take more advantageous combat positions. Frequent skirmishes ended with the intervention of formidable Russian peacekeepers, who each time withdrew Armenian troops to their starting positions. Grigoryan and Mustafayev hardly moved with a pencil along the maps of mountain Zangezur. There, where Armenian soldiers, after a humiliating defeat, tried to intercept new positions of the Azerbaijani Army. For a year, Azerbaijan has long and desperately tried to convince Armenia of the need for an early delimitation of the borders. But the Armenian government, pursuing the goal of easy tactical success, tried to go out to the square to the supporters, albeit with lightweight, but joyful news from the front about the victory over 'the enemy who, after Karabakh, cherished the dream of returning historical Zangezur as well.' Pashinyan and his team needed to achieve at least momentary military success at any cost. But each time the wind of a ghostly revolutionary hope ran into a block of a well-armed and well-trained Azerbaijani Army.
Armenian units left the Azerbaijani heights with a drooping head sprinkled with ashes, and the 'square democracy' responsible for new defeats faced accusations of betrayal and accusations of incompetence in the Armenian Parliament that had become habitual.
Pashinyan again found himself drawn into the abyss of an internal political crisis. And to the main accusation within the country of surrender and national defeat, the main Armenian hostage -- the prime minister wanted to respond with a little military success. An imitation of doomed resistance. By and large, over the past year, Pashinyan himself turned into the main revanchist force, who tried to leave in the shadows the last year's historical failure at the expense of an ephemeral minimal military-adventurous success.
Baku has repeatedly warned Pashinyan, urged him in every possible way to return to the negotiating table in the name of building a new system of relations and regional security. Baku offered Pashinyan to start building the future world from scratch, leave in history two centuries of ethnic strife, reconcile with Turkey, support the 3+3 format put forward by Aliyev and Erdogan and adopted by the Kremlin. Pashinyan responded to Aliyev's constructivism with new boycotts and military provocations.
The Armenian PM has become the main hostage of the most complicated, chaotic and insoluble internal political situation. And Pashinyan tried to break the deadlock not with the help of diplomatic success and a peace treaty with Azerbaijan, showing his people a new path of development, but with an illusory confrontation with Baku. And a new confrontation, even an illusory one, promised a new war. It seemed to Pashinyan that Azerbaijan would not resort to new decisive measures and would avoid an open confrontation. To a greater extent, proceeding from the factor of the presence of Russian peacekeeping troops. As before, as in the period of the second Karabakh war, blackmailing Azerbaijan by involving a third force, be it Russia or NATO. But Pashinyan was wrong this time too. Azerbaijan has demonstrated that it is ready to deal the last blow to Armenia. Final. Despite blackmail and threats. After which Yerevan will have no other alternative but to return to the negotiating table to the ponderous Overchuk with a pencil in his hands.

A New Mexico total LGBT Resource Guide from A to Z. Your best way to reach the Gay Market. Yes, we produce the website you are looking at right now!Jim Cuddy couldn‚Äôt hide his enthusiasm when he got his first look at the newly renovated Massey Hall this week.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so amazing. It‚Äôs beautiful,‚Äù he said as he walked out on stage.
The songwriter, singer and guitarist for Blue Rodeo was on a private tour of the iconic Toronto music venue with Massey Hall CEO Jesse Kumagai and the CBC‚Äôs Eli Glasner. It was three days away from the Nov. 25 reopening, and construction workers and sound engineers were still installing seats and setting up equipment to get the hall ready for the first audience since it closed for renovations in June 2018.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to play here,‚Äù said Cuddy, whose band has performed at the legendary hall dozens of times. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see somebody here. It feels like it got an incredible shine, but it doesn‚Äôt feel that different.‚Äù
WATCH | Jim Cuddy gets his first look at the results of the Massey Hall renovation as the project nears completion:
Jim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo gets his first look at Canada‚Äôs legendary Massey Hall, following three years of intensive renovations. The hall is dear to Cuddy‚Äôs heart, as both a musician and a fan. 0:33
From the stage, the feel may be familiar to Cuddy ‚Äî but much has changed.
The brand new floor seats are now retractable, allowing for general admission at some shows. Stained glass windows that had been covered up with plywood since the early 1900s have been carefully restored. And the plaster ceiling, once covered in dusty chicken wire to protect audiences from falling debris, has been precisely repaired.
WATCH | The feature about the Massey Hall renovation project on The National on Nov. 26 at 9 p.m. ET on CBC News Network and 10 p.m. local time on your CBC television station. You can also catch The National online on CBC Gem.
The stage has also been completely rebuilt and the entire ground level has been raised, bringing the stage closer to the balcony and gallery seats. All this had to be done without affecting what many refer to as the magic of Massey Hall.
‚ÄúWe wanted to make sure we weren‚Äôt doing anything that was going to change that for the audience,‚Äù Kumagai said.
The goal of restoring a 127-year-old building, preserving its character while also updating it to suit today‚Äôs needs, was a monumental task ‚Äî one that was not only done under the scrutiny of heritage departments and building inspectors, but also many of Canada‚Äôs top musicians and music historians.
Industrialist Hart Massey commissioned the hall in 1894, as a gift to the city of Toronto. The world-famous building is steeped in history and lore.
It was constructed primarily for musical performances and has held some great and varied ones, from Enrico Caruso to AC/DC to Tanya Tagaq.
It‚Äôs also known for historically significant live recordings, including The Greatest Jazz Concert Ever, Neil Young: Live at Massey Hall and Rush‚Äôs All the World‚Äôs a Stage.
It was home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra for 60 years. Massey Hall also hosted political rallies, and even sporting events such as wrestling and boxing.
There were periods when the hall was seen as outdated and narrowly escaped the chopping block.
However, Massey Hall was designated a National historic site in 1981, protecting its legacy.
The revitalization project‚Äôs chief architect Marianne McKenna was keen to build on all this history.
‚ÄúWe began with clear instructions from the musicians who love this place: Fix everything. Change nothing,‚Äù said McKenna.
‚ÄúThat quickly went by the wayside. We had to improve everything about the place.‚Äù
Anyone who has ever been to Massey Hall knows that one of the worst parts of the experience was the limited number of bathrooms and their location in the basement. This was remedied by building a tower on the back of the original structure, made accessible by outdoor hallways known as passurels that now jutt from the side of the building.
‚ÄúIt was something that was floated in the ‚Äô60s,‚Äù McKenna said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where they thought they were going then because there was nowhere to go.‚Äù
Now with the seven-storey tower attached to the South side of the building, the passurels lead to brand new bathrooms, a (nearly finished) bar, and elevators that make the hall accessible to many who were never previously able to sit in the balcony or gallery levels.
The tower also contains another yet-to-be-completed performance venue, rehearsal spaces and the Deane Cameron Recording Studio named after the previous Massey Hall CEO, who passed away suddenly in 2019.
The bar in the basement of the original structure has been completely refurbished, and will soon also be used as a small performance space.
The ongoing revitalization project has a price tag of $184 million. It is being funded by all three levels of government, as well as corporate and private donors.
When asked what the biggest personal challenge of Massey Hall‚Äôs revitalization project was, McKenna essentially said all of it.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a contemporary architect,‚Äù said McKenna. ‚ÄúYou know, we do things in very contemporary ways, but to acknowledge and respect the history, to try not to change it but to augment the feeling of being here. To make it better. It‚Äôs a big challenge for an architect.‚Äù
Massey Hall will open its doors to the public on Thursday, Nov. 25, with veteran performer Gordon Lightfoot hitting the stage. Lightfoot has played the venue more than 165 times.
Over the coming months it will be up to audience members and musicians to decide whether the crew at Massey has achieved its goals. But for Cuddy, the verdict is already in.
‚ÄúI was prepared to accept it as something new, and just bundle my memories of what it was,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I think this marries beautifully with what I loved about it.‚Äù

‚Äî Manobala Vijayabalan (@ManobalaV) November 1, 2021Congressman Gus Bilirakis has coauthored 8 provisions which were filed earlier today as amendments to this year‚Äôs National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Each provision seeks to remedy an injustice Veterans are facing, enhances care and services available to members of the military, their families or Veterans or enhances U.S. national security through maximization of strategic partnerships.
‚ÄúEach year, through the NDAA, we have an opportunity to work on bipartisan measures that will improve the lives of those who proudly serve or have served our nation,‚Äù said Congressman Bilirakis. ‚ÄúAmong other priorities, the proposed amendments I‚Äôve co-sponsored will help to protect heroes who have been exposed to dangerous toxins during their service, ensure appropriate benefit compensation for combat-wounded Veterans, and extend benefits for disabled benefits and their spouses. Addressing these important issues is long overdue, and I urge my colleagues‚Äô support for these initiatives.‚Äù
Read below to learn more about each of the eight amendments.
- The Major Richard Star amendment would provide concurrent receipt of military retired pay and Veterans‚Äô disability compensation for combat-wounded veterans who were medically retired under Chapter 61 with less than 20 years of service.
- The Ruiz/Bilirakis Burn Pit Alternatives amendment would require the DoD to include a dedicated budget line item for incinerators and other waste disposal alternatives to burn pits. This will help Congress monitor the continued use of burn pits- despite the known risk of exposure for our military personnel.
- The Ruiz/Bilirakis Burn Pit Studies amendment would require the DoD to submit a report to Congress on the status, methodology, & timeline of current research and studies being conducted to assess burn pit health effects. American heroes are already getting sick and some are dying from complications related to exposure. They can‚Äôt afford for federal agencies to continue to waste time on endless studies regarding widely-recognized scientific facts. Additional oversight is certainly warranted.
- The Ruiz/Bilirakis Burn Pit Training amendment would provide mandatory training for all DoD medical providers with respect to potential effects of burn pits. It is important that the doctors treating our heroes know the most current research available and are able to look for possible signs or symptoms, as early detection could save lives.
- The Welch/Bilirakis Burn Pit exposure and COVID-19 amendment would require the Tricare COVID-19 Registry to include any prior respiratory illnesses and information from the burn pit registry for the beneficiary.
- The Blunt-Rochester/Bilirakis SPACE-A for spouses and caregivers amendment would allow spouses and caregivers of 100% permanent-disabled Veterans to have access to the Space-Available program. This was the original intent of the legislation, sponsored by Bilirakis, but has not been implemented by the DoD as originally envisioned.
- The Chiropractic services amendment would require the Defense Health Agency to produce a report on the feasibility, efficacy, and cost of expanding coverage for chiropractic care to military families and retirees under the Tricare program. Chiropractic services can be a cost-effective and preventive tool for treating chronic pain.
- The Greek Diplomatic Engagement amendment would provide a feasibility study on increased rotational deployments to Greece and enhanced United States-Greece diplomatic engagement. Such an enhancement of the United States‚Äô Strategic Partnership with Greece would be a benefit to both nations.Chandigarh is a perfect blend of rural Punjabi authenticity and urban flavours and if you want to treat your taste buds to the delicious Punjabi cuisine Chandigarh should be your go-to destination.

The euro-US dollar (FXE) continued to rise and claimed a new six-month peak above 1.1250 after the FOMC minutes failed to revive the US dollar (UUP) on May 23. The rally in the shared currency started as soon as the French (EWQ) election results were declared‚Äîfears subsided of another European country leaving the Eurozone. The European Union‚Äôs economic data continued to improve. Recently, Germany‚Äôs (HEWG) IFO business climate index data were at 114.6 for May‚Äîcompared to the previous month‚Äôs reading of 113.0, which indicates strong improvement in business conditions.
With economic activity racing ahead, markets have started to speculate about future policy action from the ECB (European Central Bank). With lower risks of a Eurozone breakup, optimistic news from the latest bank lending survey will likely increase pressure on the ECB to change its accommodative stance. European employment improved and April recorded the strongest job growth in the last decade. Investors in Europe (FEZ) are speculating that there could be some hint of a taper in the June meeting. There would be pressure on the ECB to act fast.
Bundesbank President Weidmann remains the most hawkish of all the ECB members. He has been pushing for policy normalization. Currently, the ECB runs a QE (quantitative easing) program. It buys bonds at a rate of 60 billion euro per month. Markets expect the program to end soon. A reduction in QE increases the demand for the euro and could help the currency appreciate against its peers. In a recent speech, ECB executive board member Coeure questioned the effectiveness of gradual normalization. New voices indicate the possibility of a taper discussion.
The timing of the announcements would be important because markets don‚Äôt like to be surprised. In the next part of this series, we‚Äôll analyze the bond market‚Äôs reaction to the FOMC‚Äôs minutes.

Hello everyone,
I have a question about CAN interface PXI-8512. I have two chassis with PXIe 8880 controllers and with PXI-8512 interface modules.
I need to exchange data between those two PXI 8880 controllers and the question is if I can use PXI-8512 modules to send and receive data with CAN protocol? The data is from third part custom device (vehicle simulator). If it is not possible, how can I exchange data between two controllers?
Thank you for answer.
05-10-2017 05:34 AM
Hello krzesniak1,
the direct answer to your question is yes, you can use CAN to share data between your controllers.
In my opinion it is not the best way though. If the controllers are networked, you can use shared variables (network-published) as explained in this white paper:
THis will give you a smoother programming experience and more flexibility than CAN. Obviously, it may be better to use CAN if you want this data to be a part of a bigger system that uses this communication protocol.
As an unrelated tip, it is best to think of PXI controllers as computers, so you can use any way of communication you would normally use between two computers (TCP, ftp, UDP etc.)
Best Regards,
Nick

Thank you for your advice. However I also use VeriStand to deploy a project and I am not sure how to use a shared variables with VeriStand. I also tried with udp communication, however I did not succeed.
Do you know may be an example where communication between two PXIs is well explained?
Best regards,

COLOMBIA, South Carolina
Former graduate assistant coach Zeb Noland is set to start as South Carolina quarterback against No.17 Texas A&M on Saturday.
Gamecocks coach Shane Beamer said Sunday night starter Luke Doty again injured his foot in a 21-20 win over Vanderbilt and that Noland would make his fourth start of the season when Carolina South (4-3, 1-2 Southeastern Conference) will travel to play the Aggies (5-2, 2-2).
Noland came into final possession with South Carolina behind the Commodores 20-14 and led a 75-yard strike that ended with his 9-yard TD pass to Xavier Legette with 37 seconds left.
The victory ended a nine-game losing streak for the Gamecocks against SEC opponents.
Beamer said Doty had another foot injury he injured in August, causing Noland to whistle to put the soccer pads back on.
Beamer described Doty as ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù for this week.
Noland, 24, had played in the states of Iowa and North Dakota before accepting Beamer‚Äôs offer to join the Gamecocks coaching staff.
Noland has been involved in three of South Carolina‚Äôs four wins this season. He started in wins over Eastern Illinois and East Carolina as the Gamecocks opened 2-0. Noland was replaced by Doty in a 40-13 loss to No.1 Georgia in Week 3 and hadn‚Äôt seen the action until his late-game exploits against Vanderbilt.Michael B. Mushlin

I'm going to talk less about the excursions (which was awesome), and more about the ship. The cabin was nice. Super small, even for a single person. I had a balcony which was nice as I was able to sleep with the door open for some nice Alaskan air. Service on the ship was spectacular as well. Big shoutout to Vasile (guest services) and the bartenders at Quill and Compass. The gym was old, and dated - some of that equipment could use some attention. From the outside, the ship appeared to be pretty dated. There were visible signs of rust, age... But that's to be expected with a ship quickly approaching 20 years old
My biggest gripes with the ship are the following:
One - It is impossible to find nutritional information anywhere. I am actively counting calories and macro-nutrients in an effort to lose weight. It is very frustrating not being able to even hazard a guess with some of these meals that were served in the buffet lines. As more and more people are doing specialized diets (paleo, keto, low/high carb, etc), it would be nice to know what we're working with.
The cabin was excellent, a bit small. My only real complaint with my cabin is that there were not enough electrical outlets. I could only find two, which made it impossible to charge many of my devices. I ended up using my laptop as a USB hub to charge most of my stuff.Samsung Electronics has unveiled its 2021 lineup of Micro LED, Neo QLED, lifestyle TVs, monitors and soundbars, that aims to redefine the role of TV in the home and let consumers get the most from their screens work efficiently, communicate effectively, and explore personal passions.

Parents were scrambling Sunday night to either find childcare or notify their employers they wouldn‚Äôt be at work Monday as Alberta‚Äôs Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw announced schools and childcare facilities would be closed as a preventative measure due to COVID-19.
Hinshaw announced last week all large gatherings or international events in the province were to be cancelled and advising Albertans against travel outside of the country, but the Province did not recommend the closure of schools, daycares and post-secondary until Sunday afternoon.
The announcement came after 17 addition cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, bringing the total to 56 in the province..
‚ÄúThe new cases that have emerged today, particularly those demonstrating transmission into communities and school settings, means we need to put in place additional restrictions for schools, day cares, continuing care facilities, and worship gatherings. These decisions are not made lightly, and I know they will have a tremendous impact on Albertans‚Äô day-to-day lives, particularly parents, children, and seniors. But it is crucial we do everything possible to contain and limit the spread of COVID-19.‚Äù
Students will no longer be attending classes in K-12 schools and post-secondary institutions until further notice. Post-secondary campuses will still remain open, but classes are cancelled. School authorities are expected to continue their regular day-to-day operations and ensure the safety of school facilities. Maintenance, capital projects, cleaning of facilities and administrative work will continue..
Teachers and other school staff will still be expected to work, either from home or at their workplace, to ensure these expectations are met. Decisions on how to do this are still to be made, and it may vary depending on the school jurisdiction.
In a letter to parents that went out Sunday, STAR Catholic‚Äôs board said, ‚ÄúThis decision comes after discussions between school leaders and the Province determined the difficulties of enforcing necessary hygiene protocols and respiratory etiquette in schools, and other challenges faced during continued operation, such as staffing shortages. At this time, it is not known how long schools will remain closed to students. Minister of Education Adriana LaGrange has indicated the closures may be in place for the remainder of the school year. Buildings will remain open to teachers and other staff, who will continue to work either from home or at the school site.‚Äù
Terry Pearson, WRPS Superintendent said there will be more information coming to parents and students as regards learning and the retrieval of items from schools.
‚ÄúWe are working with the Provincial Government and Alberta Education to announce decisions so parents, students and staff will know what will be happening and how these things will happen. We will have more information and maybe announcements in the next two weeks.‚Äù
At this time, WRPS is advising parents or students cannot enter the school at this time, which means they will not be able to pick up any of their child‚Äôs items that are in their lockers or desks. If that changes WRPS will advise parents.
WRPS is also working with school staff to plan alternate ways for student‚Äôs learning to continue at home. More information will be available about as the learning continuity plans are developed.
Sacred Heart School parents can contact the school to make arrangements to pick up their students‚Äô belongings. They too are developing learning continuity plans.
This includes: Wetaskiwin Early Learning and Childcare Centre, Wetaskiwin Out of School Care Program, Clubhouse Out of School Care Program and its After School Programs: Friendship Club, Keystone, Raise the Grade, Thrive Youth Development and Torch.
Staff are available by telephone and videoconferencing, to support families and youth in accessing resources to address stressors related to COVID-19, parenting, finances, and other family related issues at 780-361-6574.Checker Red Sterling Ascot Tie active and passive transport comparison essay go to link how to write a personal biography essay levitra southmayd source site click source site are dreams real essay feamal viagra pirate party essay essay on generation y going off crestor caused heart attack or stroke follow url buy cheap cheap essay on hillary clinton academic essay on english as second language enter site employment cover letter templates analytical - essay method follow url how to write a transfer essay ventolin infants example of college application essays $ 50.00

The state has seen a big rise in cases among 18- to 24-year-olds
"What we're seeing here in Dane county is that close to 90 percent of the young people who are getting positive test results are reporting some symptoms and unfortunately a lot of them aren't aware of the long-term consequences that this disease can have," Joe Parisi, county executive of Wisconsin's Dane County, told CNN's Jim Sciutto.
"But as concerning, is the fact that in my community in Dane county, the university is integral to the city of Madison. It is not separated somewhere. So these young people interact with people throughout the community. They have parents and grandparents and go to the store so we're incredibly concerned about the spike that we're seeing," Parisi added..

"God created mankind in his image; in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." (Genesis 1:27)
I'm a momma's boy. Always have been and always will be. I have always been proud of being a momma's boy, and I know with this pride I would protect her at all cost from harm, insult or disgrace. There is a sense of needing to be a protector that I have always felt and that leads me to be very sensitive to the way people treat her.
I think my affection grew deep because she sacrificed her job in order to be a stay-at-home-mom for me and my two brothers. I experienced her love day in and day out through her patience, affection and even through her discipline. My dad made an equal sacrifice by having to provide the income for the whole family by putting in many hours each work week. This meant on a weekly basis he would have to work out of town on business trips.
I will never know the sacrifice my parents endured, but I know that it was a form of sacrificial love offered for each other and my brothers and me. Not a day went by in my life at home without a family prayer and being told by my parents how much they loved us. Love was a foundation within my family.
I learned that love can be expressed in many diverse and beautiful ways. The most profound way in which I saw love in action was in their art of hospitality. My parents enjoy being around people and making everyone feel at home. My mom enjoys preparing an environment of hospitality by putting in hard work to create a welcoming atmosphere in the home. My father can entertain a crowd with his charismatic personality and stories. The way they make others feel like they belong and comfortable in our homemade for many good memories.
This summer I was able to spend time with some of the friends who were a part of my life because of my parents' hospitality. The most common statement directed toward me was about how much I am beginning to resemble my father. They would clarify that they didn't only mean my appearance but in my mannerisms and the way I handle myself in groups. Although I haven't noticed much change in myself, I feel grateful to receive this compliment. I have always respected the way my dad loves others, and I have wanted to love others in the same way.
I now see that the love with which I grew up has formed me into who I am today. I see that the love I share with others has been a consequence of how I was loved by my parents. All those who show me love in life teach me new ways to love and I bring that love to my relationship with God so he can form me in his unique and personal way.
There are two central characteristics to my spirituality that God is beginning to reveal to me in discernment for the priesthood. He wants me to be a momma's boy, and he wants me to resemble my father. He wants me to be a priest that relies on Mother Mary and who protects her because of the love Christ has for her. He also wants me to be a priest who resembles himself as my father in the way I think, act and love.
God has put a desire in my heart to be a glimpse of the infinite love God has for each and every one of his children. This will take knowing him personally through meditative prayer, regular reception of the sacraments, ministry and holy relationships. I pray that my future parishioners can honestly say they have a pastor who is a momma's boy and is a living image of his father in both the worldly and spiritual sense..Have you ever taken your camera for a drive at night? I definitely hadn‚Äôt until the instructor from my Night and Low Light Photography course challenged us to do so. It was an interesting experience as I felt like such a creeper having a camera on a tripod in the car. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt have my big telephoto lens on, so it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it could have been! (Given the long exposure times used, the most you would see of someone is a ghost IF they stayed the same distance from you for the length of the exposure and your camera is facing them, but they don‚Äôt know that.)
Note: All of these photos are SOOC (Straight Out of the Camera). I can‚Äôt make these colours up!
Mr. Bean was driving (thankfully!), which made it easier for me to operate the camera while we travelled around town. No photography caused accidents for us! I couldn‚Äôt imagine trying to operate my camera and driving, especially on some of the bumpy roads we encountered! (Hear that city of Calgary? Some of your roads need to be repaved!)
The best place to do this is in a place with lots of different lights. We drove from the northwest of the city through downtown, then south along one of the main drags and back up north along another main thoroughfare.
The trick with these type of photos is to use the smallest aperture, lowest ISO and longest shutter speed you can while not over exposing. Most of the time I used f/22 or higher, ISO 100 and 20 ‚Äì 30 second exposure time.
It‚Äôs also interesting to take photos when you‚Äôre moving and stopping in the same exposure as you can see what was around you as well as the motion.
It‚Äôs also good to have a frame of reference, like the dash of the car, to show the motion of you driving past the lights. Or are the lights moving past you? I guess it all depends on your frame of reference. üòõ
Another benefit of having Mr. Bean with me while taking the photos was his ideas on how to make lights look cool. I stack it all up to his amazing knowledge about physics and light. üôÇ
The above photo was taken on an S curve. Neat, hey?
If your car isn‚Äôt changing direction enough, you can create that by moving your camera.
Unfortunately, driving your car in circles doesn‚Äôt create the most interesting looking photo‚Ä¶
Have you ever taken your camera for a drive?

The BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells has become the first major sporting event in the U.S. to fall victim of the coronavirus outbreak.
The tournament‚Äîtennis‚Äô second-biggest in the U.S. behind only the U.S. Open‚Äîwas due to begin on Monday in California but tournament organizers have opted to postpone it instead.
‚ÄúWe are prepared to hold the tournament on another date and will explore options,‚Äù tournament director Tommy Haas said in a statement.
The field this year included Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal‚Äîthe world No. 1 and No. 2 in the men‚Äôs tournament‚Äî23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams, former U.S. Open champion Naomi Osaka and teenage sensation Coco Gauff.
Tournament officials said the decision to postpone the tournament had been taken following guidance of medical experts, California health officials and the Centers for Disease Control.
‚ÄúThere is too great a risk, at this time, to the public health of the Riverside County area in holding a large gathering of this size,‚Äù.‚Äù
So sad to hear the news about the postponing of the @BNPPARIBASOPEN . I was so excited to make my debut in IW, but safety is always the no.1 priority. Stay safe √∞√∞¬æ√¢¬§√Ø¬∏
‚Äî Coco Gauff (@CocoGauff) March 9, 2020
The tournament was expected to draw approximately 450,000 spectators and tournament organizers said refunds are already available to fans who have purchased tickets, as is the option to receive credit for next year‚Äôs tournament.
Speaking to The New York Times, WTA Tour chief executive Steve Simon said tournament organizers had not considered playing the tournament without fans a viable option.
‚ÄúWe were supportive of the concept,‚Äù he was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúBut ultimately the tournament didn‚Äôt feel it was in their best interest.‚Äù
California has over 100 suspected cases of coronavirus and Governor Gavin Newsom last week declared a state of emergency as the state works to contain the outbreak of the virus which causes a disease known as COVID-19.
As of Monday morning, at least 557 cases of the disease have been reported across the U.S., with 21 deaths and 8 people recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University which has been tracking the outbreak using combined data sources.
Over 3,800 people have died since the outbreak of coronavirus began in Wuhan, a city located in China‚Äôs central Hubei province, late last year. There are over 110,000 cases globally, with 62,000 recovered.
On Sunday night, officials in Riverside County, which includes Indian Wells, declared a public health emergency after reporting a first case of locally acquired coronavirus.
The patient is being treated at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage and is the second case recorded in the county after a passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who is recovering at a medical facility in Northern California and is yet to return home since testing positive.
‚ÄúWe have always known this was a possibility,‚Äù Dr. Cameron Kaiser, Riverside County public health officer, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe have been planning for weeks and are prepared to take the necessary steps to protect the health of our local community.‚Äù
A number of sporting events across the world have been canceled, postponed or played behind closed doors because of COVID-19.
The Chinese Formula 1 Grand Prix, which was scheduled to be held next month, has been called off, while the GP in Bahrain, which is scheduled for March 22, will go ahead without fans.
In Italy, which is battling the most cases in Europe, Serie A soccer games were played behind closed doors at the weekend after a number of postponements the previous week.
In the U.S., NHL teams have closed their locker rooms to the media and the NFL postponed its annual Consumer Products Summit on Saturday.

Table of Contents
Not Your Typical Car Lockout
Getting locked out of your car isn‚Äôt exactly headliner news. It happens every day, which is of course why autolocks LTD exists: to help vehicle owners who can‚Äôt access their vehicles, whether it‚Äôs because of lost car keys, broken keys, or failed auto lock systems.
But this wasn‚Äôt your typical lockout situation. You see, the driver of this particular Blipper was at a red stoplight. For some unknown reason, he decided he needed to exit his vehicle quickly, in an attempt to either retrieve something from the boot or check something on the exterior of his mini van. He may also have been trying to talk to the driver of the car in front of him.
In any case, he got out of his car at the light.
When he returned to the driver side door, he discovered that he was locked out. The funny thing was, his engine was still running. Imagine a lockout with keys in the ignition, engine running, doors locked. Now picture that same scenario when you‚Äôre at a red light that‚Äôs just turned green‚Ä¶ with drivers piling up behind you. Not fun.
A Smart Key Could Have Saved the Day
Many auto manufacturers are now developing apps that when used, can give car owners access to several features in their vehicles. One is a door locking and unlocking function.
Instead of a key, and instead of a key fob, there‚Äôs an app for the driver‚Äôs phone. It controls unlocking and locking the door, which would have really saved the day in the case of the hapless driver of the Peugeot Blipper.
Some car manufacturers are already rolling out this app. In the case of Volvo, their new cars for 2017 will feature keyless and ‚Äúfob-less‚Äù entry.
As for Peugeot, what do they have in store for owners of their new cars for 2017? Let‚Äôs take a look.
Peugeot‚Äôs 2017 Lineup and Smartphone Apps for Unlocking and Locking Doors
The new Peugeot 308 GTI has some attractive features, but the one we here at AutolLocks LTD are concerned about is the door lock feature. The GTI, which comes in two different models, the 270 and the 250, has keyless entry, which is becoming more prevalent in cars these days.
The cockpit of the Peugeot has a 9.7-inch screen, on which drivers can manage their door lock and unlock functions, among other things.
You‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs no mention of any smartphone app. That‚Äôs because Peugeot doesn‚Äôt actually make one for the 308 GTI. There is a way to use a smartphone app with your Peugeot, however.
Use an NFC Lock to Use Your Smartphone for Your Car Key
While keyless entry is now common in new cars, smartphone apps are not. There is a workaround, however, for those car owners who want the new technology but aren‚Äôt willing to wait around for new models to come out.
Called the ‚ÄúNFC login system‚Äù, this system allows people who are tech-savvy to create a smartphone-based auto door lock system. This system worked on a 407 Peugeot, according to the author, who chronicled his experience using the system on his own vehicle.
Using Your Smartphone to Open Your Peugeot
The tutorial for the process described above is available online, and there‚Äôs also a github for the whole process, too. Proceed at your own risk, however! Even the writer of the tutorial had a few problems.
When he used his normal car key to lock his 407 Peugeot, his central locking system no longer worked. That meant he had to use his NFC system to look his doors.
Interested in trying this yourself? You‚Äôll find the files, the code for the smartphone, and the APK at the github link above.
And if you get stuck (or if your locks get stuck!), remember there‚Äôs always autolocks LTC to call. We‚Äôre on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week for your auto lock needs. Lockouts, lost keys, or key repairs on your Peugeot, no matter what model it might be, are no problem for our professional car key specialist locksmiths.
Were you wondering what happened to the Blipper driver from our story? He finally removed himself and stood on the sidewalk near his inaccessible Peugeot, watching the traffic go around his vehicle. Eventually, he called a specialist auto locksmith like AutoLocks LTD.In this section

In 2008, the City and the Urban Community of Strasbourg began an irreversible program involving a blanket ban on the use of pesticides in the city's public spaces.
This was an important step forward in the effort to improve the city's quality of life and was designed to help protect public health, preserve water resources from pollution and prevent damage to groundwater.
The policy was implemented with the help of the Rhine Meuse water agency.
Banning chemical products means better management of local plant life
The banning of pesticides in 2008 meant a significant upheaval in the way the City maintained its green spaces and involved the introduction of new gardening techniques, which although more natural, also took up more time. Plants previously considered as weeds were encouraged to grow, while more plants were introduced into the city centre and alternative methods of weed control tested. The advantages of these new methods far outweighed the drawbacks and the policy has proved to be a popular success.
Alternatives to chemical weed control
Several techniques are used, including brushing machines, gas burners and steam machines and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Weed control is also reduced to a minimum by other techniques and planting strategies, such as the choice of suitable plants, mulching and allowing meadows to grow.
A tailored approach to the upkeep of open spaces
A large city has many kinds of open spaces, including ornamental gardens, family gardens, squares and riverbanks, all of which need a different kind of upkeep, according to the way they are planted and how they used.
In Strasbourg, 6 types of green spaces have been identified:
- Flowered areas (plant containers, window boxes, hanging baskets),
- Horticultural green spaces (traditional gardens and parks, the areas around monuments, public buildings and churches, etc.),
- Urban green spaces forming district centres (busy squares),
- Interdistrict urban green spaces (promenades, riverbanks, etc),
- Extended green spaces (natural spaces or meadowland),
- Ecological natural spaces (conservation of flora and fauna).
Each space needs a different frequency and type of upkeep, they need watering at different times, the type of fertiliser required is different, they need trimming and cutting at different times and require different techniques, etc. Public flowerbeds, for example, need regular and meticulous weed control, while a dead tree will be left where it lies in an ecological space, to encourage the development of micro-fauna.
Over the Eurometropolis, 3 types of spaces have been defined:
- Roadside trees,
- Community thoroughfares,
- Certain sports facilities.
Brushing machines are now used on thoroughfares, while the bases of trees are covered with bark cuttings or grass is allowed to grow there.
You too, you can help!
If you keep plants on your balcony, on your terrace or in your garden, try to grow and care for them without chemicals. The techniques are perfectly simple and with a bit of common sense you can get nature onto your side.
To learn more, download the "Petit manuel du jardinage au naturel" (manual of natural gardening ‚Äì in French only) and its help sheets.
Below you will find a few tips to help you make the switch over to natural techniques:
- Pour boiling cooking water over unwanted plants on pathways,
- Use a hoe or a knife to dig weeds up from their roots,
- Cover de-weeded areas with natural products such as bark or straw...
- Use material such as gravel or sand to make pathways...
- Make your own compost,
- Grow local plants,
- Grow suitable combinations of plants,
- Attract pollen-gathering insects,
- Use beer and ash to discourage slugs,
- Attract hedgehogs, ladybirds and other creatures to eat greenfly and slugs,
- Place anti-insect nets over carrots and fruit bushes, etc
If you want to dispose of your old pesticides and chemical fertilisers, you can take them to the City's special waste disposal areas (in French). These are dangerous products that need special treatment and must never be thrown away outside, down the sink or in household refuse.GEA Sustainability ESCP - ZOOM Presentation

We have reduced our overheads and worked out more efficient ways of running our business to allow us to make a substantial saving for producers while keeping the quality extremely high. Whether you are looking to get more for your post-production budget or do not have enough for the large VFX companies we can get involved.
Our aim
Det East wants to carve out a niche in the film market for independent / lower budget / non VFX-reliant films, that require high-quality but cost effective post work; (Conform, Grade & VFX). We have handled 676 shots over two films in 8 months, so we know we have the capacity for medium-sized jobs. We can also help with the entire post production process and be involved from an early stage to make sure all the picture-post is as efficient as it can be, saving the producer time and funds that can be spent where they should be: Onscreen!
History
We are an official bedroom facility. For several years, talented artists have been working from their bedrooms to create outstanding work traditionally associated with big visual effects companies. There had to be a time when this bedroom industry broke free from the home and applied its efficient structure into a micro VFX company. We have zero legacy‚Äîthat means we do not have expensive equipment that we are still paying off even though it is redundant. Our data infrastructure is completely solid state‚Äîthis means no traditional hard disks, which makes our workflow faster and a more robust.
Who is behind Det East?
Det East was formed in 2012 by Diego Vazquez & Sam Smith. Diego is Det East VFX supervisor, Lead Artist and all-round film whizkid! Sam an ex VFX artist himself takes a fresh approach to running this company.

With 18 years experience, he has the perfect blend of technical and artistic qualities that award him the most incredible understanding of VFX and the filmmaking process. Having worked on major Hollywood feature films and many high-profile commercials and promos for the leading VFX companies in London & L.A., his experience is second to none. Diego has also directed two feature films, several commercials and pop-promos. Where required, we were able to take care of the entire production, giving us the opportunity to apply our efficiency methods.
Sam Smith
Sam is an entrepreneur with creative ambitions.

If you don‚Äôt adequately strategy and spending plan your gambling vacation, You will probably find yourself standing about the Strip with all your vacant pockets turned within out looking at the fountains at no cost as you cannot pay for to carry out anything. In order to avoid this tragedy, you need to strategy and price range your gambling time. Otherwise, you‚Äôll be broke following the primary evening.
Suppose you happen to be a median Joe (or Jane) who helps make a mean income and you are going to Vegas for a 4-night time gambling family vacation. Program your vacation to acquire an concept of just how long you would like to gamble. Your strategy doesn‚Äôt have to generally be established in stone, but you‚Äôll need some concept of just how much gambling you can expect to do to obtain an concept of the amount funds You‚Äôll have. Such as, suppose you arrive in Vegas at midday on Sunday and depart at 7:00am on Thursday. Excluding pursuits such as ingesting, sleeping, sight-looking at, browsing, obtaining a therapeutic massage, etc., your gambling prepare might seem a little something like the following (your plan may sa gaming be roughly thorough, but the point is you ought to do some degree of setting up).
Sunday two:00pm to four:00pm play craps.
Sunday seven:00pm to ten:00pm Enjoy craps.
Monday two:00pm to four:00pm Engage in craps.
Monday 8:00pm to 10:00pm Perform craps.
Tuesday eleven:00am to one:00pm Enjoy slots.
Tuesday eight:00pm to eleven:00pm Participate in craps.
Wednesday 2:00pm to five:00pm play two-four Holdem poker.
Wednesday eight:00pm to 11:00pm Perform craps.
Your system will transform thanks to quite a few influences, which include whether or not you win or lose for the duration of a specific session. Don‚Äôt forget, this is simply a starting point that permits you to estimate simply how much gambling revenue you must carry. If you don‚Äôt have the self-discipline to generate this kind of plan, then you have a excellent probability of going broke ahead of your getaway ends‚Äìand being broke in Vegas isn‚Äôt any enjoyment.
Using your approach, estimate the amount of gambling revenue you have to carry. This estimate need to be depending on the desk boundaries you intend to Enjoy. I choose to play at craps tables with $5 minimums or a lot less. When you Perform at $ten tables, Then you really will have to double the amount of cash you provide.
Step one to producing your gambling price range is always to divide your gambling time into one-hour classes. The 2nd stage is usually to remind on your own that you are going to play excellent, limited craps and keep away from bets that have large On line casino positive aspects. For those who Participate in loosey-goosey, you are going to deplete your total bankroll in mere minutes. For $five minimal-or-less craps tables, a guideline that I often use will be to price range $100 for every 1-hour session. I have identified that $a hundred is enough to endure a few cold streaks, nonetheless sufficiently small so my complete gambling time with the journey will not Value me a fortune.Prettyhillz Top Coupons & Promo Codes

The saying goes "when you aren't training, someone else is." So when it comes to being the best at anything, it requires consistent dedication and sacrifice to maintain a competitive advantage. That hard work is starting to pay off for one airman.
The 15 best swimmers in the Department of Defense have earned the opportunity to compete in the swimming component of the 2019 World Military Games. The youngest team member is Airman 1st Class Michael Yoo, 366th Maintenance Squadron avionics backshop technician, from Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho.
"I've been swimming since I was a kid and kept swimming competitively through college," Yoo said. "When I heard about the World Military Games, I was immediately interested."
Yoo explained that he talked to his supervisor, 2nd Lt. Brittany Diaz, 366th MXS avionics backshop flight commander, and worked out a plan to reach his goal.
"I'm thankful for my supervisor," Yoo said. "She has supported me throughout this journey and allowed me to make it this far."
With all the support he needed, Yoo dedicated a large portion of his time to training.

"Every day I get up at 3 a.m. each morning and drive 50 minutes to Boise to swim in a regulation-sized pool," Yoo said. "From there I drive back, work, then I'll either swim again or workout in the afternoon."
In June 2019, Yoo received the news that he was selected to be on the U.S. military swim team.
"It was a mix of emotions," Yoo said. "I was excited and nervous at the same time."
Representing the United States is a once in a lifetime opportunity for most people.
"To be selected as one of the 15 service members in the entire DoD to compete at the World Military Games is not only a representation of the determination, confidence and diligence that Airman 1st Class Yoo possesses, but a reminder to all airmen that with these characteristics, there are no boundaries when it comes to your dreams and goals," Diaz said.

The next step for Yoo is to travel to San Diego to meet and train with the rest of the swim team. From there, Yoo and his team will be competing on the world stage in Wuhan, China, October 2019.
Yoo stands as a great example of what all airmen are capable of accomplishing.
"I instilled the lesson into airman Yoo early on that if you work hard and grow wherever you're planted, you will do amazing things and that I'll be cheering him on as it all unfolds," Diaz said. "It has been an honor to be part of airman Yoo's journey and to serve as his commander. Go U.S.A. and go Air Force!"

European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Glasgow, UK (28 April-1 May), abstract CP2.06: Should the soft drinks industry levy (‚Äúthe sugar tax‚Äù) be framed as a childhood obesity intervention? Anabtawi, O.; Townsend, T.; Strathearn, L.; Swift, J. A. School of Biosciences, Nottingham Univ.
Introduction: The Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) came into effect on the 6th of April 2018 and it is designed to tackle Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSBs); the largest contributor of sugar in children‚Äôs diets. It has been mandated as part of the Childhood Obesity Plan and is projected to result in an8.55% reduction in the rates of children and adolescents who are obese (Briggs et al., 2016). To understand more about the potential impacts of action on SSBs, this study aimed to consider the characteristics of children in the UK who drink, and do not drink, SSBs and the impact of overall energy intake.
Methodology: Data from 4-day estimated food diaries of 1298 children aged 4-10 years from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling program from 2008 to 2016 were analysed using SPSS version 24. Based upon their consumption or not, children were categorised as ‚Äúdrinkers‚Äùand ‚Äúnon-drinkers‚Äù of SSBs. Other variables included child age, gender, weight classification (IOTF cut-offs calculated from weight (kgs) and height (cm) (Cole et al. 2007)), total energy requirements for age, total energy intake (<90% of energy requirement met by intake taken as lower than recommended energy intake, 90-100% as met recommended energy intake, >110% above recommended energy intake), and Non-Milk Extrinsic Sugar (NMES) intake (<5% of total energy requirement as low NMES intake, 5‚Äì10% as medium NMES intake, >10% as high NMES intakes) (WHO, 2015).
Results: The consumption of NMES from food and drink within the total population was higher than recommended in 78.4% (n = 1017) children and significantly higher among the 790 (60.86%) of children classified as drinkers of SSBs (67.6%, n = 688) compared to non-drinkers(32.2%, n = 329). However, 78.1% (n = 617) children who were drinkers of SSBs did note xceed their total energy requirements and there was no significant difference between the two groups of drinkers and non-drinkers in terms of age, gender or body weight classification.
Conclusion: In this representative sample of UK children, high intake of NMEs was not directly correlated with high energy consumption, therefore, depending on a single-nutrient approach in tackling childhood obesity might not be the most effective. Furthermore, SSB drinking is not a behaviour particular to children with a higher body weight, on the contrary, framing sugar reduction in tackling obesity might reinforce negative stereotypes around ‚Äúunhealthy dieting‚Äù. More equitably, policies should focus on those children whose consumption of SSBs significantly increases their total NMEs.

Sex researchers often feel sympathy for marginalized groups, especially when the groups have been marginalized due to irrational intolerance of sexuality. I have sympathized with various marginalized groups throughout my career, starting with homosexual people (back when they were marginalized), then transsexuals, and recently pedophiles, among others.1
Members of sexually marginalized groups are human. This means that they will sometimes be tempted to make unreasonable demands on scientists and accusations against scientists who resist those demands. I have occasionally angered members of sexually marginalized groups. For example, during the 1990s some gay men disliked the idea that there is an association between homosexuality and gender nonconformity. I have devoted considerable effort to studying this association, which I now consider beyond reasonable doubt. I have written about autogynephilia‚Äîalso beyond reasonable doubt and a common reason why Western natal males become transsexual (Lawrence, 2012)‚Äîdespite the livid reactions of some transsexuals. I have angered bisexual men by publishing research suggesting that some do not have bisexual arousal patterns (Rieger, Chivers, & Bailey, 2005), while conceding bisexual identity and behavior clearly exist.
I have offended sexually marginalized group by prioritizing the goals of sex research‚Äîputting forward plausible hypotheses, collecting and publishing data, drawing conclusions from data rather than my preferences, and making clear and correct arguments to the best of my abilities‚Äîover advocating for anyone, including marginalized groups. I have done so even when some groups insisted that my sex research harmed them. If I had prioritized advocacy, I likely would have refrained from conducting, or at least publishing, the offending research. That would have harmed sex research and would not have benefited the offended groups in any defensible way.
Thinking about groups can mislead one into ignoring important variation within groups. Many gay men embrace gender nonconformity‚Äîwitness the success (twice) of the U.S. television show ‚ÄúQueer Eye for the Straight Guy.‚Äù And some‚Äîwe do not know what proportion‚Äîof males who fantasize about being female not only admit their autogynephilia, they embrace it and express relief that they are not alone (Lawrence, 2012; Saotome-Westlake, 2016). Supporting transgender persons who oppose autogynephilia theory is failing to support (or more accurately silencing) those who support the theory. What to do? An advocate would go with the majority, I suppose, although it would be difficult to get an accurate survey count. A scientific sex researcher would open discussion, weigh in with knowledge and data, and feel no compunction. To the extent that some members of a marginalized group require that plausible or even factual ideas not be discussed, they need therapy more than advocacy.
---‚ÄúWriter‚Äôs block‚Äù is a widely embraced ideology, not just in writing circles, but in time-honored narratives around the writing process. We don‚Äôt hear about painter‚Äôs block or composer‚Äôs block or dancer‚Äôs block. While painters, composers, and dancers may, indeed, experience periods of time when the flow of their work is more challenging than usual or when it comes to a halt, writers are the only creative demographic that get a name for this struggle.
Writer‚Äôs block, I acknowledge, may be a legitimate experience for some writers (Psychologist Edmund Bergler said it has something to do with blocked emotions, but more about that in a future post). Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking that writer‚Äôs fear is a more appropriate word for the thing that stops many writers from writing. Or from writing freely and honestly.
Fear of what they don‚Äôt yet know‚Äîthe subconscious can be a scary place until we make friends with it, and rooting around in one‚Äôs own darkness can unveil all kinds of startling discoveries.
Fear of what they already know‚Äîwe‚Äôre indoctrinated at a very young age to fall in line with cultural norms. When we don‚Äôt shame is a significant detractor in being true to ourselves.
Fear of what others will think‚Äîour need to be accepted and not abandoned is an inherent human need.
I had a conversation with a group of writers the other day about feeling that tug of holding back when writing, thinking about what other people‚Äîfamily members, in particular‚Äîwill think.
Not wanting to make waves and jeopardize our connection with our Tribe‚Äîour connection with the people who gave us life and shaped us: parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins‚Äîis understandable. Our history can feel like a lifeline, and our culture tells us these blood ties should be maintained at all costs.
But I disagree.
Virginia Woolf wrote about the angel in the house in her paper, ‚ÄúProfessions For Women.‚Äù According to Woolf, the angel was the voice of society that sits on the shoulder of every female writer with its great white wings and whispers in her ear about what was acceptable and not acceptable for a woman to express on paper. She wrote about killing her angel by clocking it in the head with her ink well.
One of the first things I do when I work with clients and students is ask them to write a letter to their angel‚Äîor angels (some of us have many). The purpose of this letter is to create a story that allows for the killing of the angels so the writer is free to move forward with her writing project, unfettered of the ignorant, uninformed, narcissistic yammerings of the voices inside her head, which usually belong to the writer‚Äôs culture and/or family.
I can tell you from experience that doing this exercise will piss you off and getting pissed is essential to not caring, a skill all creative people, and maybe especially writers, must acquire.
‚ÄúWhy get pissed?‚Äù you might ask.
Every time someone reacts to your words, every time someone whines or shames or cries or yells at you for what you‚Äôve written or what you‚Äôre in the process of writing, it is an attempt to silence you. They may not see it that way, but it is.
And if that doesn‚Äôt royally piss you off, it should. It should offend you. It should rile you. It should make you want to come out punching and jabbing, metaphorically, of course. And what better way to punch and jab at the world and its attempts to keep you in its tidy little box‚Äîso no one has to feel uncomfortable, so no one has to encounter a truth other than their own‚Äîthan to use your exquisite voice?
This isn‚Äôt easy, especially when we love the people who react to our work. If a stranger calls me out on my content, I really don‚Äôt care. If someone I love calls me out on my content, I still don‚Äôt care (which is different from not caring about the person), but there‚Äôs the complicated tug of knowing someone I care about isn‚Äôt able to take in my work, isn‚Äôt able to celebrate the thing that means the most to me. Ultimately, it means that they aren‚Äôt able to see me.
It‚Äôs a shame, to be sure. But hear me now, dear writer. We are not here to pet the boo boos of others. We are not here to hide ourselves so other people can maintain the comfy little personal world they‚Äôve created for themselves. We are here to utilize the gift we were born with‚Äîto use words to make meaning of life, and in doing so, to make the world a little bit better.
A family member once accused me of ‚Äúmaking fun‚Äù of our family. The piece they referred to was actually doing the opposite‚Äîhonoring what I come from and realizing that, despite my attempts to ‚Äúrise up‚Äù and out of the blue-collar existence, I had, in that moment, come full circle and found myself square in it: cleaning houses for a living with four college degrees. Oh, the irony.
A friend once wrote to me and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about you,‚Äù when she read a blog post I wrote that discussed the certainty of death. How gauche of me.
And I‚Äôve had family members experience anxiety when they believed my stories hit too close to home, when they believed they recognized themselves or other family members in the writing.
As Ann Lamott once wrote, ‚ÄúIf people wanted you to write warmly of them, they should have behaved better.‚Äù AMEN.
Part of this problem comes from non-writers not understanding how a writer‚Äôs mind works, how the creative process‚Äîspecific to writing‚Äîworks. They don‚Äôt understand the spark that may, in fact, come from a lived experience can morph into a fictional story about a fictional character who is not the writer or the writer‚Äôs child or partner or ex-partner or parent or whomever the hell. They don‚Äôt understand that while we may‚Äîoftentimes, subconsciously‚Äîmodel characters after real-life people, we‚Äôre not writing about the actual people. We‚Äôre likely making sense of our lived experience that could, possibly, include someone else‚Äôs stupid bullshit behavior.
A friend, also a writer, once told me a story about a writer friend of hers who published her first novel. She was nervous about her mother seeing herself in the shrewish mother in the story. When her mother read the novel, she did see herself‚Ä¶ but not in the mother. She saw herself in the kind and loving aunt. So, it seems that people will see themselves in our work the way they see‚Äîor what to see‚Äîthemselves in life. They will feel exposed by our work no matter what we do. Bottom line: We‚Äôre all narcissists to some degree. Some people want to put themselves at the center of our world. They can‚Äôt imagine this not being so.
Not all resistance is to our writing is about perceived exposure, though. Sometimes, it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre touting beliefs that run counter to what we were taught. In my mind, this is very simply, a phase of growing up. Of individuating.
When I teach my Writing Through the Body‚Ñ¢ workshops and we discuss the traits and expressions of the Root Chakra, we talk about how sometimes the Tribe doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to allow the individuals within it to transform into their own unique persona. Sometimes, this requires breaking from the Tribe in some way.
In the workshops, we‚Äôre applying these traits and expressions to characters, but they apply to us as well. (In fact, they applied to us first.)
The truth is: people will do what they do, and they‚Äôll think what they think. Our job is to mine the narratives of our lived experience to make meaning of the human condition. Nobody said it would always be pretty. Nobody said it would always be fun. But one guarantee is that when we have the courage to step out of the tiny, suffocating box our culture and our family has constructed for us, when we have the courage to set our bizarre, ghastly, taboo, crazy, kinky, beautiful thoughts free, they have a chance to find connection with other people who have the same bizarre, ghastly, taboo, crazy, kinky, beautiful thoughts, we find our people. Because it‚Äôs very possible that the people who brought us up, who shaped our identities are not, in the end, our people.
If you‚Äôre faced with the fear of offending family, making someone mad, or hurting someone‚Äôs feelings, try this letter writing exercise.
- Write a letter (BY HAND) to each voice.

Nickelodeon all-star brawl combines all possible characters that have ever appeared in the channel‚Äôs cartoons. The main idea is fighting.
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl Review
You should smash one another, use diverse techniques in different locations. There is always a chance to win, even if things go sideways. You can download Nickeloden all-star brawl on your PC, ps4, ps5, or Xbox.
Graphics
Developers focused mostly on the idea of the game, so graphics are quite usual for 2D animation. They are vibrant and dynamic but lack details. Characters are drawn in the same style, so even if they are from different cartoons, they will look quite similar. However, the colors are bright and pleasant. The movements change really quickly what makes the whole process fun and enjoyable.
Replayability
Nickelodeon all-star brawl has various characters, and you may play it for hours. It‚Äôs great for several minutes breaks and kids will like it too. However, it doesn‚Äôt have any level progression, and locations are generic, which lowers the replayability rating. This is a type of game which you can play for a long time, forget about it abruptly, and return to it several months later. It has an avarage replayability level among other free games of this genre.
Gameplay
As written above, this game is based on combats between diverse Nickelodeon characters. It has various locations where you can play face to face or together with many players. There are no levels. You may get some items as gifts but they don‚Äôt play a big role in your fighting development. Playing Nickeloden all-star brawl is not very convenient on Xbox. You should use diverse buttons combinations, which is easier to do with a joystick. So, Nickelodeon all-star brawl for Xbox is a better choice. It‚Äôs quite easy to control characters, and they move extremely fast for a 2D game like this.
Some players note that even though the game was created with Nickeloden in mind, the atmosphere there is not like cartoons have. There is a lack of music and some characters look a little differently than in movies. But some fans are all steamed up about the game. Overall, you may install Nickelodeon all-star brawl because it‚Äôs very funny and allows you to try various characters in combats.
Conclusion
The game is nice and perfect for those who like Nickelodeon cartoons. Even if you have never watched any of them, you can enjoy this game because of the high-level motion gameplay and variety of characters. This is not the game where you can develop your character and gain some levels. Here you can just download Nickelodeon all-star brawl relax and get fun.
Pros:
- Dynamic and vibrant
- A lot of characters
- Has many locations.
Cons:
- No level progression
- Low-level graphics.

LiNCHigher are an Office for Students (OfS) funded partnership between nine education providers and organisations across Lincolnshire and they required a purpose-built platform where they could share learning resources with young people during the COVID-19 crisis and long into the future.
To ensure the platform was as simple for everyone to use as possible, they wanted a single platform creating where the students could access the learning material securely, which came from from several different providers, and LiNCHigher could easily track the activity of the young people engaging with the courses.
Also, as the ‚ÄòUni Connect‚Äô partnership for Greater Lincolnshire established in January 2017, LiNCHigher were also targeted by the OfS to develop an ‚Äòoutreach hub‚Äô by Summer 2021 that promotes careers, pathways and opportunities available to young people and engages with the key stakeholders in the county.
Our solution was to use the existing framework of our award-winning eProspectus software and create additional functionality so it could also become a platform for their online learning materials. The team worked quickly to develop the functionality and now the thousands of young people who are associated to the education providers and organisations who make up LiNCHigher can benefit from the vital training resources.
Equally though, LiNCHigher have been able to fast-track the development of their ‚Äòoutreach hub‚Äô because the eProspectus already has an ecosystem in place to engage with learners, advisors, schools, colleges, training providers and local authorities across Lincolnshire. It also promotes careers, pathways and opportunities available to young people, including a way for Year 11 students of applying for a place at college. This fed directly into their idea of creating a sustainable platform that was more than just somewhere for students to access online material.
Speaking ahead of the launch of LiNCHigher Learning, Jonathan Lidster, Project Manager for LiNCHigher said, ‚ÄúWe are delighted to be able to offer such a fantastic variety of online resources for thousands of students across Lincolnshire during these testing times.‚Äù He also added, ‚ÄúWe are also thrilled to be working with the Lincolnshire-based digital agency, First Media on this project. They have built the online platform and it will allow us to track and monitor how many students are using these excellent resources. It's wonderful to have such a great independent company on our doorstep."
Ian Hargreaves, Education Solutions Director for First Media added, ‚ÄúWe have really enjoyed working on this project with Jonathan and his team. We were able to quickly mobilise our team to produce a sophisticated and expandable solution that grows our existing platform to provide a complete solution for them in an incredibly quick timeframe.‚Äù
Our eProspectus software is being used by ten Local Authorities around the UK to make people aware of local opportunities, provide important information and support the transition to post 16 learning. If you‚Äôd like to find out more about the eProspectus, click here,

The library hosted the educational program ‚ÄúLiving off the Land- Producing Organic Food, Honey, and Maple Syrup.‚Äù Area farmers and hobbyists John Naple, Bill Germann, and Bill Blance were guest presenters.
‚ÄúOne of the greatest joys of my life was when we bought our first family cow,‚Äù said Germann, who for the past 38 years has been growing his own vegetables, raising animals and producing maple syrup.
He spoke to the audience about his experience living off the land.
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt like the taste of raw milk,‚Äù said Germann. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt cool fast enough. The quicker it cools the better it tastes.‚Äù
German told the people in attendance (some of them farmers and some who were taking notes) that he only bought Jersey cows and would milk them only in the morning and only three days a week.
‚ÄúLet the calf take care of the rest,‚Äù he said.
Germann went on to discuss how to make butter and yogurt from the cows milk, and continued with an informative discussion on growing tomatoes and keeping the seeds to get ‚Äútrue plants‚Äù and not hybrids every year.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no cross pollination for true plants,‚Äù he told the audience, letting them in on his secrets for keeping the seeds of true heirloom tomato plants. Germann went on to talk about the maple syrup process and how he started with only wooden spiels in the trees and coffee cans to catch the sap.
According to Germann this was a poor year for maple syrup mostly because of he persistent cold temperatures. Germann began tapping trees on March 26, and tapped 38 trees this year producing five and a half gallons of syrup. When boiling the sap he said the most important tool you have is the thermometer.
‚ÄúBring it to seven degrees above the boiling point of water,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe further into the season the darker the syrup.‚Äù
Germann indicated that because the season is short this year, the syrup will be darker than many will like. The cost of maple syrup will also go up to what he estimated would be $55 to $65 per gallon.
‚ÄúI love the lifestyle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI love the simple things in life.‚Äù
After a brief intermission, John Naple spoke about his hobby of honey making.
‚ÄúWhen I ordered the bees and they arrived at the post office, I got a phone call telling me they were here and to pick them up,‚Äù said Naple describing how the bees were shipped. ‚ÄúThey were a little scared.‚Äù
Naple used a video presentation as he took the audience through a brief history of raising bees in North America. Settlers from Europe originally used straw hives before wooden bee boxes started being used in the 1850‚Äôs. Naple displayed the frames from one of his boxes and showed how the bees had created beeswax and honey in the frames. He also talked about the different layers of the box. He explained how the young are raised in the lower level and the queen bee can be kept in the lower box laying eggs by using an ‚Äúexcluder.‚Äù
Naple talked about the three types of bees: workers (females), drones (males) and the queen, who mates only once and is fertile for life, and can lay up too 2000 eggs in a day. Worker bees live only four to six weeks and spend much of that time taking care of the hive and producing wax and honey. Naple described how he he burns burlap and straw to create smoke to make the bees less aggressive as he opens the boxes. He also described cutting the wax out of the frames and boiling it to separate the wax to make honey. Naple said that he harvests honey in first week of September and that one box can produce up to 30 pounds of honey.
‚ÄúA friend of mine got me started,‚Äù said Naple on his hobby. ‚ÄúI like to eat honey. It‚Äôs cool to make your own.‚Äù

The Osprey is the only raptor whose front
talons turn backward.
Osprey
The Osprey - Pandion haliaetus ‚Äì also known as the sea
hawk, fish eagle or fish hawk, is a fish eating bird of prey.
It is the second most widely distributed raptor species, after the Peregrine
Falcon. They occur in a wide variety of habitats such as lakes, rivers, wooded
swamps with open water, and shorelines, from cliffs to salt-flats. In Africa it is partly resident in the tropics
but is a non-breeding visitor pretty much everywhere else, including southern Africa.
Description
The plumage of
the osprey is generally brown above and white below, with a whitish head and a
dark stripe through each eye. The wings are long and pointed and the legs are
stout and heavily scaled. The irises of the eyes are golden to brown, and the
transparent nictitating membrane is pale blue. The bill is black, with a blue
cere, and the feet are white with black talons. A short tail and long, narrow
wings which in flight are arched with drooping "hands", giving it a
gull-like appearance. The juvenile is fairly similar to the adult but the head
is more darkly-streaked and the upperparts appear scaled with cream and pale
rufous.
Call
The call is a
series of sharp whistles, described as cheep, cheep or yewk, yewk.
If disturbed by activity near the nest, the call is a frenzied cheereek!
Food
Fish make up 99%
of the Osprey's diet. They occasionally, may prey on rodents, rabbits, hares,
amphibians and other birds. These raptors are particularly well adapted to this
diet, with reversible outer toes, sharp spicules on the underside of the toes, closable
nostrils to keep out water during dives, and backwards-facing scales on the
talons which act as barbs to help hold its catch.
Breeding
The Osprey breeds
near freshwater lakes, and sometimes on coastal brackish waters. The large
stick nest is built near the ground or high up in a tree, or on a cliff, rocky
outcrop, telephone pole, dilapidated building, or even just on the ground. The
clutch size is usually around two to four eggs, which are incubated largely by
the female over 35 to 38 days. Once hatched, the female broods and feeds the
chicks, whilst the male forages for food to bring back to the nest. The young
fledge at around a month and a half to two months old, but remain dependent on
the parents birds for another two to three months, after which they disperse
widely.
Conservation Status ‚Äì Least Concern. The recovery of osprey populations in Europe and North America has been attributed to protection measures,
public education, the creation of artificial nest sites, and bans on pesticide
usage. Its conservation status in southern Africa
is uncertain, but it is not understood why it is so uncommon in the region.

In the midst of developing a business plan around my brand Iron Butterflies, I got caught in a ‚Äúdust storm.‚Äù I was online researching websites of women, who like myself are hearing the call for women to gather, to take their place as leaders, to drop all false selves, and to embrace their feminine power and skills. It is stunning how many retreats, tele-seminars, newsletters, support programs and the like there are out there for this very purpose. That in itself is a revolution happening: women supporting women like they have never done before.
As I perused their offerings and accomplishments wondering what I had to offer that wasn‚Äôt already being offered I got caught up in a ‚Äúdust storm‚Äù even though outside it was perfectly still in that heavy August heat kind of way.
Image via Wikipedia
I call them ‚Äúdust storms‚Äù because, like a dust storm where you feel disoriented because vision is limited and direction uncertain, you lose your way off the path of the heart, of your true purpose. I got derailed when I began to question if I had anything to offer at all. Critical thinking is important for taking on a new venture, but there can be a thin line between critical thinking and self-criticism. I felt myself becoming smaller and smaller, going into what I call bumpkindom state. Before I knew it I was that little girl from Norwood, the daughter of immigrant parents who barely spoke English.
As I wandered in the familiar haze of a dust storm, mired in my self-doubts, I became frustrated with myself, yelling at myself, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you over this yet?!‚Äù Of course, that doesn‚Äôt make things any better, but worse because now I‚Äôm swimming in that internal conversation of self-denigration.
I think whenever you put yourself way out there, whether at a job, or project, or entrepreneurial effort, or relationship, there comes a time for dust storms. Being a perpetual student of life as I am has its pluses‚Äîlife is a big learning adventure. But it also has its challenges, like dust storms. I‚Äôve been through enough of these that I now can get my bearings pretty quickly.
If you find yourself in a dust storm, here are five markers for finding your way through these times of vulnerability and back on the path of your true purpose.
Wait it out. You can‚Äôt find your way out of the dust storm by toughing it out, muscling out, or denying it. Instead it requires attentive patience. You can‚Äôt force clarity; it emerges in its own time expedited by paying attention.
Hold onto the winning post When all around you is uncertain, the last thing you need to do is doubt yourself. Believe in yourself especially when you don‚Äôt have the answers. In my case, that little Norwood girl may have felt unsure of herself going to kindergarten not speaking English, but she was also a courageous little girl who kept going back every day and soon mastered the language. Remember a time you were courageously vulnerable and let that be your guide.
Pursue your personal truth. Be earnest in finding your way to your unique contribution in the world. Diligence will lead you there. We all have something unique to offer, and given the state of affairs in the world, the world more than ever needs people to be connected to their passion, acting on behalf of their biggest dreams.
Exercise self-compassion. When you‚Äôre in a dust storm, the last thing you need to be doing is to beat yourself up. When you are vulnerable like this, you need to love yourself even more. So bop that monkey mind of self-doubt off your back and be kind to yourself as you would be to others in a dust storm. There is little time for self-doubt: your energy is needed else where, like taking the helm to pilot the ship of change through all the troubled waters ahead.
Talk to a friend who is a good listener, or find a coach. The very act of describing what is going on to someone else, of telling your story and being heard, helps to clear some of the dust away.
Allowing, accepting and addressing those vulnerable feelings that come with dust storms is challenging work. But as difficult as it may be, it‚Äôs worse to deny them. Vulnerability is our growing edge, it can guide us to learning and growing and evolving. The alternative is clinging to what we know, limiting our focus on what is controllable, and denying the unknown. This is the path to hardening of the spirit and becoming rigid and narrow-minded.
As the sun always rises, so do dust storms slowly disperse and surrender to blue skies. Having moved through a dust storm, we discover that we can see even more clearly than before.Ivory Coast striker praises international team-mate.

The Toulouse right-back, a rumoured target for Premier League giants Arsenal, was in fine form for his country as he claimed two assists from right-back to help the African nation get off to a winning start against Japan in their opening game of this summer‚Äôs World Cup.
The 21-year-old was outstanding for his club in Ligue 1 this season, showing great potential as an attacking full-back with six goals and six assists from defence, and it is thought that a deal for him to move to the Emirates Stadium could be close to completion.
The Gunners are in need of a new signing on the right-hand side of their defence following the recent departure of Bacary Sagna to rivals Manchester City, and Drogba believes Aurier will be a great addition, as he looks ready to make the step up to a more competitive league.
In a glowing tribute to his young colleague, the 36-year-old said: ‚ÄúSerge brought us energy and balance and he had a fantastic game.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the best right-back in all of France. I think he‚Äôll do well at the next level too, in the Premier League.‚Äù
Drogba‚Äôs words suggest that Aurier‚Äôs rumoured move to Arsenal could well be in place for next season, in what looks like a great piece of business by the north London side.'A Rose For is unique to the possessor, signifying the personal attachment to scent.

The winners of Singapore Food Masters 2020 make a diverse list.
From traditional favourites such as bak chor mee and fish head steamboat, to imported thrills like mookata and Indonesian, to cafe finds including chicken chop - there seems to be a favourite for most taste buds.
These local food heroes were feted after more than 104,000 votes from Singapore Press Holdings readers (to pick the top 10 in each area) and a month of unannounced tastings from a panel of food experts to pick the winning three outlets.
Eventually, 12 eateries were selected based on these judging criteria: Taste, presentation, services, value for money and cleanliness.
The judges included Maureen Ow of Miss Tam Chiak fame, producer-presenter and music director of One FM 91.3 Charmaine Phua and Anna Lim, senior producer-presenter of 96.3 Hao FM.
There are three winners in each zone.
From the North, Thai Hao Chi Mookata (908 Upper Thomson Road), Woody Family Cafe (12F Andrews Avenue) and Yang Ming Seafood (Bishan Branch) (Blk 150, Bishan St 11) reigned supreme.
In the Central zone, Jia Wang Cafe (Blk 4 Jalan Bukit Ho Swee), Pin Sheng Teochew Bak Chor Mee (56 Eng Hoon Street) and Shrimp Prawn Seafood (53 Boat Quay) prevailed.
From the East, the champs are Ah Orh Teochew Fish Head Steamboat (739 Bedok Reservoir Road), Lazy Lizard The Promenade (#01-20 The Promenade) and Tan Ser Seng Herbs Restaurant (29 Lorong Bachok), which clinched a winner‚Äôs spot for three consecutive years.
And finally in the West, Bara Food (#01-10 Icon Village), EagleWings Loft (9 King Albert Park) and Kim Eng Chicken Rice (#01-72 NEWest) came up tops.
Mr Alvin Tai, 37, owner-chef of Shrimp Prawn Seafood which serves SteelPot Prawn Vermicelli, said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely astonished, yet grateful to all my supporters and judges especially when I am the first to start this speciality dish in Singapore during the Covid-19 pandemic period.
‚ÄúParticipating in Singapore Food Masters 2020 helped me tremendously to share to the public the kind of food Shrimp Prawn Seafood serves. I promise to uphold the quality and standard of all dishes.‚Äù
Mr Allan Tan, 29, owner of Tan Ser Seng Herbs Restaurant, added: ‚ÄúCovid-19 has been hard on us, so the assurance by the food critics definitely reminds us that we are on the right track.
‚ÄúAfter being part of Singapore Food Masters, we have seen an increase in the number of new customers trying out our soups.
‚ÄúIt has helped us to show our supporters online and offline that even after 74 years in this industry, we continue to uphold our food quality and service standards. Hopefully we will win with another dish next year.‚Äù

The Opportunity to Build A Successful Life
I was still in school when I signed up as a Distributor in 1992. Back then I was not interested in the direct selling business. The way some of my classmates promoted their direct selling businesses also turned me off. The only thing I cared about was to do well in my studies, get a good job after graduation and realise my dreams. Thanks to my classmate, Jeremy Tan, who first introduced me to the AMWAY‚Ñ¢ business. He shared this business opportunity with me after our reunion gathering. Apart from clearing my doubts about the direct selling business, he also impressed upon me the true value of AMWAY in comparison with other direct selling companies. I signed up without a moment‚Äôs hesitation.
It‚Äôs now been more than 20 years since I first became a Distributor. In all these years that I concentrated on building my business many people had asked me, ‚ÄúIs it really worth your effort?‚Äù I signed up in 1992 and just one year later, AMWAY invited me to my first overseas seminar and I bought my first house. Then more of my dreams came true. Hence, my answer to the above question is a firm, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù My sole income comes from AMWAY and yet this business is able give me financial independence and absolute freedom to pursue a successful life in all aspects.
Besides the various opportunities to travel to overseas seminars that widened my perspective, I also managed to fulfil one of my big dreams ‚Äì I went back to my alma mater and pursued further studies purely for interest‚Äôs sake.
Furthermore, knowing that my organisation in Malaysia is on solid ground and having a reliable network of associates whom I can delegate work to also free me to grow my business internationally. Venturing out into the international market is truly an enriching experience.
Is it easy to succeed in AMWAY? I would recommend that you look at it from another point of view. Instead of measuring how easy or difficult the business-building process is, ask yourself this: Is it worth your effort? To me, regardless of which line of business you choose, the most challenging aspects are the production-related costs, management, logistics human resource, shop rental, furnishing, and storage. All these will take a chunk out of your investment. On the contrary, as a business partner of AMWAY, your responsibility is to focus on sales and marketing. This is many times easier than what you will need to deal with in a conventional business set-up. As long as you put in enough effort, your AMWAY business will grow and living an all-round successful life will no longer be a distant dream. It is in this respect that I find the AMWAY business most valuable.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my upline leaders Emerald Directs Yew Eng Hin John & Tan Huey Yi, Ng Soo Fatt, Founders Emerald Directs Wong Seow Kong & Yong Sooi Fong, Emerald Directs Lee Teck Lim & Sandy, and Crown Ambassadors Steven Lim & Angeline Lee. My heartfelt gratitude to them for their mentorship, guidance and love.
I couldn‚Äôt have achieved what I have today without them. Thank you from the bottom of my heart once again. Believe in yourself! I am confident you can make it too. My best wishes to you.

Last week I was visiting The Netherlands for 3 days and did take 160 photos! The reason I was there was for holding a lecture. It is amazing that what ever I did take a picture anybody watching it could tell that it is from The Netherlands. How many other locations in the world do have that unique look and feeling? It is, like my photos are becoming a link back to the place it was taken. Did put al the 160 photos down to my favorites in a PDF, take a look here and see if you see the link in them.

I sometimes think I missed my calling as a drama teacher, because when it comes time to put together the church Christmas program, I go all out.
I want fancy lights and fancy costumes, the perfect music and volunteers that all aspire to put on the best community church program that they can.
Being three hours away from my home church put a stretch on my participation this year. I helped another lady as she ran the majority of practices. While she made sure lines were given out and practice times were kept, I made sure the music was in place, the props were precise and small, little areas of the play were tweaked to my satisfaction.
I know I drove everyone crazy, especially the newcomers to church who had no idea who I was barking out orders to pick up costumes and remain quiet during practice. I'm sure I even drove my Mary crazy, reminding her to put emphasis into her actions as she sang "Breath of Heaven."
Yes, it's the little things that I work hardest on. Like explaining to the three Wisemen that they must bow to Herod before speaking to him, and that Mary needs to act like she's going into labor as she's singing, or that the inn keeper needs to take a few minutes to answer Joseph at the front door.
This year we were fortunate enough to have a real baby Jesus ‚Äî little Jacob who is barely a week old.
At the end of the play, Jacob's mother handed him to Joseph who cradled him in his arms, before handing him to Mary.
As Joseph began calling everyone that would to come and see the precious gift from God, he began crying, later telling me that, "At that moment looking at Jacob, he wasn't Jacob. He was baby Jesus. He was the entire world. I just couldn't help myself."
The little things ‚Äî that's how you can best understand the importance of Jesus' birth. The wisemen bowing to the king symbolized the control Herrod had. Joseph supporting Mary as she sang was a sign of not only affection but comfort and understanding. Everything, it seems, about the Christmas story is all about the timing, the listening, the obedience.
What if Mary didn't listen to Gabriel and accept the plans God had for her? What if Joseph didn't realize that his dream was a sign from God to take care of Mary? What if the wisemen had chosen to report to Herod their findings of Jesus?
What if we, in our own lives, choose not to pay attention to the little things God is saying ‚Äî how will we end up?
It's in focusing on the small pieces of our faith that God can truly speak to us the loudest.
I may get carried away during a church production, but what dedicated worker doesn't? I just want it to look good and be filled with an anointing that can minister to others. I am, after all, a story teller at heart. And I've already started on Eas.Please visit our Open House at 2201 938 SMITHE ST in Vancouver.

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said global oil markets remain undersupplied and to expect oil-price volatility to rise in coming weeks amid an open disagreement between OPEC+ and the U.S. around crude production.
‚ÄúNet, our bullish view remains unchanged: the oil deficit remains unresolved, the current strength in oil demand remains a near-term tailwind and the increasingly structural nature of the deficits will require much higher long-dated oil prices,‚Äù Goldman analysts including Damien Courvalin wrote in a note on Thursday.
OPEC and its allies on Thursday approved a 400,000 barrel-a-day output hike for December, despite pressure from major oil-consuming countries to boost supply even more. Now, the U.S. is expected to release supplies from its emergency reserves as it attempts to curb the surge in crude and gasoline prices.
UBS Expects Brent to Reach $90 With Market Undersupplied
Goldman said a potential release may only be a temporary help and could even backfire next year. If crude prices weaken dramatically, shale producers will not be so willing to increase drilling, leading to an even bigger supply shortage. The threat of more U.S. crude and the potential resumption of Iran nuclear talks are also factors to upcoming higher price volatility.

But very first If you‚Äôre new to online selling or have never constructed a sales funnel previously, beginning can be overwhelming. One year ago I was a complete newbie to sales funnels.

They were very simple to create (as a non-techie with few design abilities). I was able to establish my pages without squandering any energy on style, optimization or coding. Most notably, I was finally able to present what I needed: a sales funnel. As a result, my conversions increased and average order worth increased from $11 to $19.
I settled on a variation of the 2-Step TripWire. The secret to this funnel is to offer an irresistible upsell. The concept of a 2-Step TripWire is pretty easy. It involves a low priced initial product being bought, and after that immediately providing them a costly 1-click upsell. If the upsell is rejected then your contingency offer is a lower priced 1-click downsell.
What do I suggest by 1-click? The upsell and downsell are provided instantly after the client purchases the single eBook.

Live New
What God did on Easter cannot be explained, dissected, formulized, or ignored. Virgin birth should have prepared us. God came to inhabit flesh by pulse and respiration. But Jesus was God squeezed into a box that could not hold him here forever. No one expected God-made-flesh to burst through every verifiable fact of death and walk out of a three-day entombment.
Like you, I have taken a slow, thoughtful, heart-examining journey to the cross. But it is only half the truth. Easter should wake us up to possibilities we dare to believe. We live without a finality picture. We live by the Creator‚Äôs Word of power and unfathomable good. Though we live in a broken world where cancer invades, divorce separates, children go hungry and too many people die from guns and drugs and disease; as resurrection believers, we live with the breath of God that breathes resurrection life into us. We live new-made, new-loved, and new-prepared for Eden life. This is life of intimate walks with God. Life that spans the chasm between earth and heaven. Life that changes every why and empowers every how.
It is time for Easter to wake us up to how we live below resurrected life. Where drudgery takes away joy. Where the heart has lost hope or lives with an anemic replica. Where God‚Äôs all-new cannot penetrate our perspectives.
Remember, Jesus did not leave Mary crying at the tomb and he won‚Äôt leave us there
either.
We need to tell our stories as Easter stories, how tombs shut out life, how God broke in, how we are resurrected in our hearts and minds, passion and hope by a love so great that we will burst unless we live it to its fullest.
Easter should take our breath away, catch us off guard, set us on a different path, and reorient us toward the new that God wants us to live. Easter re-presents us with the choice to live new.
We‚Äôve rehearsed the story all we need to; now it‚Äôs time to live it. Whatever God helped you clean away through Lent opened more places to receive God‚Äôs empowering new. It‚Äôs time to live a new Hallelujah with all joy and full abandon.

It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not just Americans√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ weight that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s increasing their health risks, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s their sedentary lifestyle. Or more simply put, inactivity.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website indicates that approximately two-thirds of Americans are overweight. That factor increases their risk of developing heart disease and diabetes ‚Äî and skyrockets their healthcare costs by 80%.
But what‚Äôs important to note is that it‚Äôs not just Americans‚Äô weight that‚Äôs increasing their health risks, it‚Äôs their sedentary lifestyle. Or more simply put, inactivity..‚Äù
And ‚Äòsitting‚Äô is a huge factor.
Don‚Äôt just sit there
There‚Äôs fairly solid evidence that exercise is beneficial for good health in many respects. But exercise is only part of the equation. Hensrud references his colleague, James Levine, MD, PhD, and his work in the area of non-exercise activity thermogenesis, or NEAT. It stands for all the activities we do throughout the day separate from exercise.
‚ÄúIf you think about the time that we spend exercising, it‚Äôs not that much,‚Äù Hensrud says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a much greater opportunity to move throughout the day, albeit at a lower level. But the aggregate effect on burning calories and health can be quite large. People underestimate that.‚Äù
So just because someone exercises, or doctors recommend exercise as part of an overall healthy lifestyle, doesn‚Äôt mean people are immune to the effects of sitting. That has spawned some interesting trends, including the treadmill desk and standing desks.
‚ÄúMy secretary has a little pedal machine under her desk to keep moving even when she‚Äôs sitting,‚Äù Hensrud says. ‚ÄúSeparate from exercise and the activities we do throughout the day is the independent effect of sitting.‚Äù
Limited recognition
Hensrud says there is increasing recognition on the part of physicians of the financial impact of patients‚Äô sedentary lifestyles‚Äîespecially as the industry moves to more value-based reimbursement. But he adds that the increasing recognition often depends on the physician‚Äôs specialty, individual characteristics, and interests.
‚ÄúIf a physician is practicing in an area related to conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, conditions related to physical activity, they‚Äôre probably aware,‚Äù Hensrud says. ‚ÄúAnd physicians who themselves are more active tend to counsel patients to be more active. But we‚Äôve still got some work to do to influence the aggregate of medical care.‚Äù
And while it might seem that broaching the subject of lifestyle and inactivity with patients is a huge barrier to overcome, Hensrud says that‚Äôs not the case. Rather, it has more to do with time.
‚ÄúPhysicians have less time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd counseling patients in lifestyle areas, such as physical activity, takes time. That‚Äôs a big one for physicians.‚Äù
Education support
It was about two years ago when the Mayo Clinic started its Healthy Living Program, and it goes well beyond spa-type programs where patients go on ‚Äòhealthy vacations‚Äô to learn how to eat better and be more active.
‚ÄúThe challenge there is they go home and it‚Äôs hard to keep up these habits,‚Äù Hensrud says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also individualizing it. Our program isn‚Äôt one size fits all. Everybody has different health goals and different challenges to meet those goals. So we‚Äôre working with people individually. We have wellness coaches who work with people to help them develop their own wellness plan‚Äîwhat are you going to do, when are you going to do it, and when life gets in the way, then what are you going to do?‚Äù
But of particular interest is Mayo‚Äôs Healthy Living Program for Physicians. It‚Äôs a two-and-one-half day, continuing medical education (CME) program centered on wellness, healthy living, and physical activity. Through the program, physicians change their own health behavior, and learn about wellness and activities they can pass on to patients.
‚ÄúPhysicians have to get CME credits anyway,‚Äù Hensrud says. ‚ÄúThey have to go to programs. So here‚Äôs an opportunity to improve their own health and the health of their patients.‚Äù
It‚Äôs a place to start, Hensrud explains, especially since physicians are not taught a great deal about wellness and health behavior change in medical school.
‚ÄúWe all grew up in a disease treatment model, but that‚Äôs starting to change a little bit,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúPrimary care physicians should be aware of this. We believe there‚Äôs value there.‚ÄùCbyM

Shifting the conversation from finances to cybersecurity, the presentation borrowed from real-world incidents to demonstrate just how effectively hackers can exploit vulnerabilities.
First, some data to set the stage: A malicious hacker now attacks computers and networks every 39 seconds, the University of Maryland found. Of breaches this year, 85 percent have been human-related, and 75 percent were financially motivated, according to Experian. Specifically focusing on the Financial Sector, 44 percent of incidents had an internal component.
The presenters explained how hackers often gain an initial toehold through phishing attacks. Through an innocuous-appearing email, text or phone call, the hacker tries to fool a person into revealing confidential information. Signs of a phishing email often include a link to a fake website, prompts to reveal passwords or other information, or requests for personal data ‚Äî a birthday, social security number, or credit card number.
A common strategy that particularly pertains to Mortgage Bankers: phishing attempts using a fraudulent DocuSign email or similar electronic signing services. The emails look convincing and may blend in among similar, legitimate ones. However, watch for several red flags: if you weren‚Äôt expecting any documents to sign, if there are misspellings, if the email is generic instead of addressing you by name, if there are URLs that don‚Äôt go to DocuSign (hover your mouse over to see the link without clicking on it), or if there are downloads. Typically, a DocuSign email clearly states the person who sent it, and it never includes an attachment until all parties have signed the document.
We could go on, but given that the overwhelming majority of data breaches have human components, it‚Äôs vital for organizations from all industries ‚Äî and especially those like mortgage bankers who handle sensitive personal and financial data ‚Äî to train their people so they‚Äôre on guard against such attacks. Education is a vital part of the battle against malicious actors, particularly as data breaches rise.Bringing you Savings #FLEXCAR

- Published
A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man's body was found at a plant nursery near Chichester.
Sussex Police said the body was found at the nursery, off Almodington Lane in Batchmere, early on Sunday.
A police spokesman said a 53-year-old man was arrested in connection with the death and is being held in custody.
Police said the Romanian victim, thought to be 45, had several stab wounds. Searches of the nursery and the surrounding rural area are under way.
A statement issued by police said: "It is believed that the man had been staying at the site and died shortly before the alarm was raised, but we are not prepared to be more specific at this time."
Officers said the clothed body of the man was found on the ground at the nursery in Second Avenue at about 0020 GMT.

Eva operates more than 990 stores across the country, employing more than 11,000 people. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, EVA has bullish expansion plans. It was looking to open 150 new stores and increase its distribution centres from four to six, increasing available space by 25%. It also looked to expand its eCommerce SKUs to 150,000 and 40,000 for its stores. Each day it estimates it would pick 350,000 orders in 2020 within each distribution centre.
D√©j√† vu on the challenge
Founded in 2002, by 2011 Eva had 144 stores. By then IT systems in the distribution centre were running slowly, causing a delay in supplying its stores. It had been using EXXceed WMS since 2007 and looked around for a consultancy firm that might help with its review. It worked with LT Management and they helped to improve business processes as well as upgrading both systems and software. As a result of the improvements, LT Management became its partner of choice and it signed a support agreement in late 2011.
Roll forward to 2016 and with more distribution centres in place and more retail stores the systems were starting to creak again. Eva was a victim of its own success. Its processes, once efficient in a smaller operation, were no longer fit for purpose and caused an issue with processing times. An example of this was the picking process itself. The process used would check stock availability, reserving stock for each order. A second stage would then issue picking lists for each worker to physically pick the stock.
The latest challenge
It became clear that Eva needed to improve the solution. It wanted to implement modern picking technology and integrate the solution both to its existing EEP and the Qlever Intralogistics conveyor and equipment management system and the control module it uses.
Enterprise Times asked Konstantin Tverdokhlib, Director Of Sales Marketing at LT Management about the challenges faced by Eva. Eva decided to review the WMS market and looked at several solutions including:
It chose to deploy the latest generation of Infor WMS, version 11 and worked with LT Management to deploy the new solution. Enterprise Times asked Tverdokhlib why Infor own the contract. He replied: ‚ÄúPerformance, easy integration, vendor-independent (zero coding) adjustment ability (user interfaces, reports, business process etc.)‚Äù
The solution
Eva chose to deploy a WMS solution within each distribution centre. There are several reasons for this. Infor does not offer a cloud solution yet to the CIS region. According to Tverdokhlib, there is little demand for this outside the major cities as connectivity often fails. Tverdokhlib noted: ‚ÄúThere are still some connectivity issues in our region, and warehouses are obviously located outside of major cities. In the case where connection fails, a warehouse becomes inoperable and no shipments can be done. That is unacceptable.‚Äù
This meant that Eva implemented five different WMS solutions, each connecting back to their central ERP in a hub and spoke architecture. This also means that the workload is distributed and only processes the local requirement. The WMS solutions do not interact with each other, only via the central ERP solution. This increases resiliency and ensures that should one system fail, then the other distribution centres continue to function.
As for the modern warehouse technology that the WMS integrates to, Tverdokhlib commented: ‚Äúmainly they use Honeywell Dolphin 70+ ring scanner HW86xx for the picking. There are some Intermec RF Guns.‚Äù
The system is used by 450 staff already and will expand this year to 680. Dmitry Martynov, Infor‚Äôs official representative in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) commented: ‚ÄúThe architecture of Infor‚Äôs warehouse management solutions helps companies seamlessly grow and scale their capacity. In any situation (increasing order volume, product range expansion, increasing number of stores, etc.), the solutions will work stably and reliably, meeting all the requirements of the business.‚Äù
The results
Now implemented, Eva has tracked improvements to its operation between 2018 and 2019. Some of the statistics are impressive.
- A four-fold reduction in the number of errors in order picking.
- A reduction in the number of complaints from 0.14% to 0.04% of the total volume of orders.
- A 20% productivity increase in order picking.
- Elimination of paper-based processes.
These results coupled with changes to business processes have yet again improved the efficiency of the Eva operations. It is now prepared for its next leap in growth. That growth continued in 2020 with the opening of five stores in Marchin Karkov, Nikolaev, Khmelnitsky, Bolgrad and Novgorod-Seversky. The stores continue to operate as Eva sells Hygiene products. It has undertaken to conduct temperature checks for all staff at the beginning of each day in every store and distribution centre. A measure designed to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Denis Zakora, EVA‚Äôs warehouse logistics manager commented: ‚ÄúThanks to the capabilities of Infor WMS and the experience of LT-Management, we were able to implement all the best business practices used in modern distribution centres. We transitioned seamlessly to modern working methods and technologies, and now we can maintain high-growth rates that are not limited by the capabilities of the warehouse system. Despite the industrial status of Infor WMS, this system allows our company to introduce new processes and independently open new warehouses.‚Äù
Enterprise Times: What does this mean
The importance of expert partners is the key message of this story. LT Management has worked with and clearly understand the Eva business deeply. Its expertise with the Infor platform and the ability to implement the solution in a way that was not disruptive. It also improved business practices simultaneously, which is impressive.
Oleg Landyshev, project manager of LT-Management commented: ‚ÄúDuring the implementation of Infor WMS in the distribution centres of the EVA chain, the LT-Management team addressed all the needs of the customer. The company expertly performed the implementation process and integration with corporate systems. As a result, the Infor WMS solution has provided the distribution centres with the all-new technical capabilities necessary for their growth.‚Äù
In some countries, the cloud is not yet the answer for all organisations. Infor has proven that its ability to deploy its solutions, both in the cloud and on-premises, benefits many of these customers. Eva can also upgrade the software easily, assuming few customisation‚Äôs were deployed. Eva is one of the few non-food retail companies that may weather the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. However, until the economic impact is uncovered there may still be a downturn in business. Key though is the increase in efficiency it has realised from the Infor WMS. This will stand it in good stead for further growth in the future.1. 8-sided mesh panel design for maximum comfort and ventilation.

In 2011, this is an intensely vibrant wine with a bouquet of violets and roses, with notes of balsamic, liquorice and leather. With an elegant structure, the wine is beautifully balanced with pristine fruit and excellent length.This is our 4th bake for The Home Bakers! The chosen cake this time is originally a Pear Pinwheel and Hazelnut Cake by Zoe from Bake for Happy Kids ‚Äì I know I know‚Ä¶ my cake looks nothing like a pinwheel at all and the name of my cake is apple instead of pear‚Ä¶
Well, I tried hunting down this Anjou / Bosc pears that was originally stated in the recipe, but I couldn‚Äôt find them at all. On the other hand, there were so many other types of pears to choose from that made me so lost and confused, so I decided to just use Granny Smith apples instead.
As for the pinwheel part, I baked only 1/2 of the recipe and though I could have baked it in a very tiny pan, I saw my heart-shaped silicon mould lying in the back of my cupboard‚Ä¶ (the last time I used it was like‚Ä¶ probably a year or more ago?!) So heart-shape cakes they became!
Making this cake is definitely not difficult, just that extra time is needed to toast and grind the nuts and peel, core and slice the apples. I decided to mix in huge chunks of apples into the cake, hoping to give it a more apple taste.
The resulting cake is sweet, sour, nutty and cinnamon-y at the same time. The hazelnut taste really came through very strongly in the cake and the apples lend the cake a nice sweet and sour taste. The cinnamon‚Äôs a bit too strong for my mom but I quite liked the overall taste. The apples that are mixed inside are very soft and mushy, while the ones on top are slightly firmer. The cakes are also very, very moist, probably a bit too moist for me.
Overall, I like the cake base because it‚Äôs easy and very nutty (I would try substituting with other nuts in the future), but I would probably swap out the apples for berries or chocolate (imagine hazelnut and nutella!) the next time I bake them.
And now for the step-by-step photos!
Toast the hazelnuts in a 180 degrees Celsius oven for 10 minutes.
Let the toasted nuts cool completely and combine it with some flour in a food processor.
Pulse the nuts until they are powdery.
(One trick that I‚Äôve found out when grinding nuts is to not grind them for too long at one time in the food processor. Pulse them several times, resting for a while between pulses. This will greatly help in preventing the ground nuts from clumping together. I suspect this is because continuous grinding heat up the blades which in turn heat up the nuts, causing them to release more oil, making them clumpy.)
In a mixing bowl, combine brown sugar and some room temperature unsalted butter.
Beat with an electric mixer and add in 1 egg.
Beat again until the egg has been fully incorporated then dump in the nut-flour mixture.
Fold until fully incorporated ‚Äì the mixture will be slightly lumpy if your nuts are not fine enough, but no worries!
Refrigerate the batter while you prepare the apples.
Peel the apple and cut it into half‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ then into quarters.
Remove both ends.
Place the knife at a diagonal at the core of the apple and gently slice it in halfway.
Turn the apple 180 degrees and do the same thing, then twist the knife upwards and the core should come out easily.
Something like this!
Slice the apple into half‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ Then turn it 90 degrees and dice it.
Repeat for all the apples, except for 1/2 apple, which I sliced it for the topping
Place the diced apples in a small bowl.
Add in flour and cinnamon and toss to coat.
Add into the batter and mix it in.
Divide the batter among the muffin-lined pans (or any cute pans you may have).
Top with the reserved slices of apple (I ended up with 6 mini-cakes but I only had 10 slices‚Ä¶ so one was without the topping.)
Bake for 25 ‚Äì 30 minutes until golden brown on top and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
Yum!

Thank you for the compliment Lena. Haha lucky I have my food processor to grind it for me, I‚Äôm always in awe as to how the people in olden days grind their own flour and nuts!
Thank you Bobbi, I‚Äôll make sure I send you more than two‚Ä¶ you will need some to feed your hungry teenager üòâ
Aww thank you Janine! I‚Äôm already brainstorming of what next to bake with this mould üòâ
Thank you for the compliments Mich!
That cake looks really moist! I want one
I think your cake looks so wonderful, love that mould of yours! I too couldn‚Äôt find pears and did thought of using apples instead, but that is out of the theme so I decided not to bake for this round.
These are so cute!!!
I love the heart mini muffin pan. I need to find me one of those!
Love mini cakes and you have inspired me to try some sometime soon as I love the fact these are heart shaped!
i always like to see you baking into minis..you always make them look so cute and pretty! i;m glad that i hv ground hazelnut in my fridge otherwise i would hv to grind them myself ..something that i dont always look forward to do! haha!
Because they are mini cakes I can have two, right? These look so moist and I love your silicone pan. BAM
i‚Äôm jealous of your heart shaped mould too! uber cute, and it just elevates your simple coffee cake to something so much more!
I love your heart shaped baking tin! The mini cakes are so beautiful!
Thank you Uru! I hope you make these soon üòâ
Thank you Anuja! I really should make more heart-shape desserts with this mould!
Hey suts! Thanks for the note! Giant‚Äôs really far from my house.. but I‚Äôll definitely go check it out when I can! Ahh I really should get shux to make the crumble for us next time!

Thank you! I agree.. I still have so many bakes on my to-bake list! If only I have 48 hours a day instead of 24‚Ä¶
Thank you Joyce! yea it‚Äôs a bit too moist but I really liked the hazelnut taste. I think the moistness probably comes from the apples.. will try with other substitutions next time üôÇ Have a great week ahead!
OMG your heart shaped mould is super cute. Love the idea of making mini cakes.
hey jas check out giant for bosc or anjour pear(if really want it). it maybe seasonal‚Ä¶saw them early this yr in giant n they were fm USA. i prefer bosc cos they r sweeter n crunchier‚Ä¶nice for making pear crumble(e only thing that shux knows how to make).
I have fallen in love with those molds. They make adorable little cakes. When I made this, I also thought apples but fortunately, my husband had brought back a large number of pears which were too ripe. I had to use them so I made the pear cake and then I made another pear cake and a pear crumble. We will be eating baked pear dishes, for a while.
Thanks for teaching me the proper way to core an apple.
A charming mini-cake. I‚Äôm sure it was just as tasty with apples instead of pears.
Your photography just makes me want to dive in and take a bite üòÄ
Cheers

Alpine Lakes Overlook
This image is looking out to some of my favorite lakes and peaks of Washington's Alpine Lakes Wilderness area-Kulla Kulla and Mason Lakes, and Bandera, Pratt, and Granite Mountains. For me this is where my journey into Washington's wilderness began at an early age hiking with my family and often neighborhood friends to the various lakes of this Wilderness Area.

The funeral of a well-known rank marshal turned into a strip show when male and female mourners took off their clothes, apparently mimicking the deceased.
According to myzimbabwe.co.zw, the man from Dangamvura, Zimbabwe, was well known for hiring prostitutes.
As the relatives tried to give him a decent send-off, condoms were thrown into the grave, while the crowd said that was what the deceased did and would have wanted.
The funeral only came to order after disturbed mourners intervened.
"I have never seen anything like this. It is unacceptable because it denigrates the very process of burying a deceased person," said an elderly woman in attendance.
In July 2011, police arrested and fined four people who danced naked in full view of mourners at a funeral.
Fifteen people were also arrested a week later after attempting to do the same at another funeral.Novel mutations in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene of 13 patients with Smith--Lemli--Opitz syndrome.

Dinklage may be the big name guest star here, but his job is really all about just reacting to Jones, who is a force of nature. Jones is fierce and deranged and completely irresponsible, proving once again that she is one of SNL‚Äôs strongest assets and most consistently reliable actors. Like the best comedic performers, there‚Äôs not a scrap of shame to be found on her. She‚Äôs fearless. Watching her spoon a terrified Dinklage is a real treat.
Although SNL has a history of running great jokes into the ground, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to see more guest stars being forced to join Leslie Jones on Naked & Afraid: Celebrity Edition. Make it happen.Australia Stocks Fall to Seven-Week Low
MELBOURNE, Australia--A broad sell-off led by another drop in the banks dragged Australian shares to their lowest finish in seven weeks Wednesday.
Equities across the region faltered as concerns continue to build over the ability of the White House to make progress on economic policy. Local sentiment was further dampened by weak wage data, which casts doubt on forecasts included in the federal government's budget of last week.
Ending near its weakest levels of the day, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 64.5 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5786.0. It was the sharpest one-day drop since March 22.
While stocks fell, the local currency firmed against the U.S. dollar as investors weigh the latest in a series of controversies to hit the Trump administration, adding to worries that the president's agenda will be derailed.
Meanwhile, data on the day showed wage growth remained at record-low levels in the first quarter, adding to concerns around high levels of underemployment in the economy. S&P Global Ratings affirmed Australia's AAA sovereign credit rating but warned a downgrade was possible if progress toward achieving budget surpluses slowed.
Moody's Investors Service weighed in on the four biggest banks, warning that measures introduced in Canberra's budget could further pressure earnings growth already set to moderate due to low interest rates and competition.
The five largest banks collectively knocked almost 29 points off the ASX 200.%.
The materials sector bucked the trend as miners were.

The Case: News reports give the following account: In January, a dead goat and bag of chickens were found in South Sacramento. Since then, there have been at least nine cases involving mutilated chickens, rabbits, goats, a lamb and a tortoise throughout the Sacramento area. Officials aren‚Äôt certain if the animals were beheaded before or after they were killed. The cuts appear to have been made with a saw and do not appear to be precise.: ‚ÄúThese animals were mutilated and killed for no apparent reason and discarded as though they were trash. We are hopeful that this reward will bring forward anyone with information about these disturbing crimes."

The sun was just starting to rise as I began my run.
It has been a dreary winter in southeastern Wisconsin this year. We‚Äôve had twice as much rain as snow, so everything is brown. We‚Äôve only had five sunny days this month, and most of those didn‚Äôt last the entire day. If you live here and wonder why you‚Äôve been feeling down, now you know why. Even as I write this, the sun has already gone away today as we prepare for a winter storm.
I‚Äôve realized in recent years what an influence the sun (and warm weather) have on my mood and well-being. We all like sunny days, but they are like a miracle drug for me. The exercise felt good since I‚Äôve been sick for most of this month. The sunrise was beautiful pinks and blues. Whatever it is that makes contrails was in place today, they were crisscrossing the sky (thank you everyone who is going to work without pay so that everyone else‚Äôs life can go on as normal).
It was beautiful, and I felt good. Those 50 minutes will positively influence the rest of my day.
What influences your mood and well-being? Are your influencers positive or do they impact you negatively?
In many ways, we are in a season of dreariness, wondering when we will next see the sun. I can choose to focus on the dreary or I can look for the sun ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs only a glimpse before the clouds return. In the same way, we can choose to be the dead, frozen ground or the shining sun to others. How will use your influence?We can choose to be the dead, frozen ground or the shining sun to others.

The sun shall no longer be

2 Thoughts to ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù
I‚Äôm with you in needing to exercise first thing. I won‚Äôt do it otherwise. And that changes my entire day, usually for the worse. This year, I am working on ensuring that I am dwelling on truth and positivity. For too long, I have ruled by the negative.

But a trio of young trick-or-treaters in Rhode Island who came upon an empty candy bowl on a neighborhood porch this year surprised the woman who‚Äôd left it there in the best possible way.
Kristen Wells, of Westerly, R.I., decided to leave a bowl of treats on her front step as she took her own children out to trick or treat. She left a note on the front door with instructions on how much candy to take. ‚ÄúPlease take 2. Leave the rest for another guest. Happy Halloween!‚Äù the note read.
The bowl was filled to the top with chocolate bars, which is shown in a photo Wells shared on Facebook.
Upon coming home, though, Wells found something unexpected in her nearly empty candy bowl.
‚ÄúWhen we came home, it was dark,‚Äù Wells told Providence-based WJAR-TV. ‚ÄúWe were going in the house, I looked in the bowl [and] there were a few pieces. It wasn‚Äôt any of the type of candy that we have, so I‚Äôm like confused like, ‚ÄòHow did this get here?'‚Äù
Luckily, Wells has a security camera above her door, which she used to solve the mystery of this unexplained candy. After seeing a number of children take too many pieces from the bowl, Wells noticed three kids do something unexpected on her porch. When the costumed trio came upon the empty bowl, they took candy out of their own stashes and dropped them in for other trick-or-treaters to enjoy!
You can even hear them banter as they decide what to do.
After at first deciding to turn the bowl upside down so that other trick-or-treaters know it‚Äôs empty, one of the kids comes up with the generous solution.
‚ÄúGuys, we should put some candy there ‚Ä¶ for other trick-or-treaters,‚Äù one of them says. Although one of his friends balks at that suggestion, the other one agrees and two of them deposit some sweets from their own bags.
After being pleasantly surprised by the unexpected moment, Wells was disappointed she had no idea who the generous children were. She wanted to recognize their good deed, so she first posted the story without the video so the neighborhood would know what happened. Then, she added a screenshot of the trick-or-treaters to see if anyone could identify them by their costumes.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to send the video to their parents and maybe get permission to share the video,‚Äù Wells wrote in her initial post. ‚ÄúAfter all the posts I‚Äôve seen about kids taking entire bowls, I think even more that this story needs to be shared.‚Äù
Fortunately, the kids‚Äô parents did see the post and gave permission to Wells to share the video on Facebook.
The clip caught the attention of the local news channel who asked to talk to the boys.
Jack Binger and Jackson Panciera, both age 10, and their friend, 11-year-old Andrew Kitchen, chatted with WJAR about the generous moment that was caught on camera.
‚ÄúWe walk up, none of us looked down at the bowl yet, we all just standing there reading the sign to ourselves and then we all looked down at the exact same time and we‚Äôre like ‚Äî ‚ÄòThere was nothing‚Äô,‚Äù Andrew told the station. ‚ÄúWe started to walk away and then [Jack] says, ‚ÄòYou know, we should put some candy in there for other trick-or-treaters‚Äô.‚Äù
What made the boys decide to do it?
‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòGuys, we should put in candy because there could be other trick-or-treaters that could come by,‚Äù said Jack. ‚ÄúHonestly, we‚Äôre all done with COVID and candy is the best thing we could do to help everyone.‚Äù
Not only did these boys help make other kids‚Äô Halloween night a little sweeter, their actions also brightened up a world that can use a little happiness.

Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs side destroyed the Old Lady in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday (November 23) night at Stamford Bridge.
The Blues were utterly dominant against Massimiliano Allegri‚Äôs side and took the lead thanks to young sensation Trevoh Chalobah in the 25th minute. England right-back Reece James continued his stunning form as he scored his fifth goal of the season and Chelsea‚Äôs second of the night in the 55th minute.
Callum Hudson-Odoi scored Chelsea‚Äôs third goal just three minutes later. German forward Timo Werner, who made his return from injury as a second-half substitute, scored Chelsea‚Äôs fourth goal deep into second-half stoppage time.
Joe Cole and Steve McMananman were left in awe after Chelsea‚Äôs stunning display against Juventus. Cole told BT Sport:
‚ÄúChampagne football. It was a beautiful performance. Unbelievable. It was an absolutely outstanding performance to put Chelsea in the driving seat in this group in the Champions League.‚Äù
Former Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman said:
‚ÄúIt was another really dominant performance from Chelsea. We said it at the beginning of the whole tournament how the English teams look really strong, and this was another marker down.‚Äù
He added that Tuchel‚Äôs side displayed confidence and that they could have scored more goals on the night.
‚ÄúChelsea had to come here and get a result against a resilient, experienced Juventus team and they‚Äôve absolutely wiped them aside. It was a really comfortable, confident performance. They could have scored many goals and they‚Äôve won the game early on.‚Äù
Chelsea are currently at the top of Group H in the Champions League after winning four of their five group games this season. The Blues are level on points with Juventus and will be eager to win their final group game against Zenit St. Petersburg on Dec 8 to finish top of the group.
Thomas Tuchel could be on the verge of building a dynasty at Chelsea
Chelsea‚Äôs recent performances in the Premier League and Champions League have made them one of the most feared teams in Europe. They are the favorites to win the league title this season and could potentially retain their Champions League crown as well.
The Blues are currently at the top of the Premier League table, three points ahead of second-placed Manchester City. Chelsea have conceded just four goals in twelve league games this season and have been lauded for their defensive solidity and stability.
In recent games, their attacking quality has also come to the fore. Chelsea have scored 30 goals in 12 Premier League matches and 10 in five Champions League outings.
The Blues currently possess a number of young talents within their squad. This includes the likes of Mason Mount, Reece James, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Trevoh Chalobah. The Blues are likely to build a squad around the aforementioned players in the future.

Two pipes can fill a tank in 10 hours and 12 hours resp. while third pipe empties the full tank in 20 hours. If all the three pipes operate simultaneously, in how much time the tank will be filled?
(A) 7 hr. 30 min.
(B) 7 hr. 25 min
(C) 7 hr. 40 min
(D) 7 hr. 50 min
Answer: (A)
Explanation: Pipe A can fill a tank in x hours and pipe B can fill a tank in y hours and pipe C can empty it in z hours. If all the pipes are operate simultaneously, 1 hours of work of each of the three pipes = 1/x +1/y ‚Äì 1/z
1 minutes work of each of the three pipes = 1/10 + 1/12 ‚Äì 1/20 = 15/2 hours
= 7 ¬Ω hour = 7 hours 30 minutes.

Because of this we wanted to bake our own bread, which is something nether me nor Amy have done much of. With this in mind we hit the internet to find a easy bread recipe to start us off with. After being side tracked for far to long we found this great easy bread recipe from The New York Times ‚Äì No Knead bread. It is a video and quite easy to follow and as it turns out it is a famous recipe and has had a few alterations and adaptions since this first video all within a quick search on NYTimes.
With only 4 ingredients this is a very easy bread recipe which you cant stuff up. And because you allow the dough and yeast to raise and grow slowly the flavors have time to develop and are delicious. It has a thick crunchy crust and a dense yeasty flesh.
Ingredients
- 3 cups Flour
- 1 1/4 tsp Salt
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- 1 2/3 cups of water
- Rye, flour or cornmeal to cover (optional)
Instructions
- In a large bowl mix together all the dry ingredients.
- Create a well and add in the water.
- Mix them all together to form a dough.
- Cover the bowl and set aside for 12 - 20 hours.The dough should rise to be 2 or 3 times the size and of a sticky constancy.
- Preheat the oven with a dutch oven or Pyrex pot inside to 210c / 410f
- Scoop out the dough onto a floured bench top and lightly flatten.
- Fold in the sides to form a ball that will fit in to your preheated pot.
- Roll or dust your dough ball with rye or what ever topping you want. (I didn't use anything)
- Carefully put the dough in to your piping hot pot, put back on the lid and replace in the oven for 30 minutes.
- Remove the lid and cook for a further 15 - 25 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and allow to cool or tuck into you hot fresh bread.
The bread was amazing but I did say that this is a tale of woe, later that day after cooking this easy bread recipe Amy went to cook some chocolate cookies only to find our poor oven had given up the ghost. Lights on but no heat. Not that I can blame this recipe for killing our oven but be careful this bread is so dam good you may only get the chance to cook it once in your life time.
Easy bread Recipe Tips
- Get creative ‚Äì add sunflower seeds, cranberries into the dough or fold last nights dinner into the middle.
- This is best eaten within 24hours of cooking as it will become quite dense and hard.

Our Growing Edge is aimed at connecting food bloggers everywhere and inspiring us to challenge ourselves and try new things. It‚Äôs a great idea and absolutely everyone is welcome to join in, so come on over and take a look for yourselves.
Your photo looks great! I‚Äôve never had any success with bread making. I suspect I just don‚Äôt have the right touch. Shame about your oven. Hope you can get a new one soon. I‚Äôve been living with a temperamental oven since January of this year. Basically it fluctuates from cold to burning with no real regard to what it says on the dial. Fine for melting cheese, but impossible to bake with. Our landlord can‚Äôt give us a date for when this will be fixed or replaced :(
Thanks for submitting to Our Growing Edge. Bread making is one of those classic examples of foods we all eat but only a very special (and smug few) actually make from scratch.
Thanks Genie; Thanks for starting ‚Äòour growing edge‚Äô it is fun to post and be part of this monthly event. Sounds like your oven is on its last legs too; ours was also going from hot to cold in the few weeks before carking it. Hope your landlord can sort you out so you can see how easy this recipe is.
This is my kind of bread. My hubby‚Äôs just seen the photo and said ‚ÄúOh look, can you make me one of those please?‚Äù He yearns for a proper home made loaf, but has to suffer the breadmaker instead, mostly‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs tried making bread himself but doesn‚Äôt have the patience. I‚Äôm going to give this a shot :)
Hey Abbe, This bread is great a really easy mix and forget. I think that this bread would be a really nice side with your Moroccan Lamb Tagine . Good luck.
You‚Äôre totally right :) The recipe is so damn good! I‚Äôve been making it for years now and it‚Äôs very difficult to find another recipe that will make such a nice bread. And that crust‚Ä¶ Think I could live on that :)
