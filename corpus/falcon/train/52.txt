MEDITERANIA MARINA RESIDENCE
The challenge of the Mediterania Marina Residence project is the insufficient land space and unattractive surrounding area. In the North side, is an unfinished project and high voltage electric lines, while in the South side, there are existing roadways, which includes a fly over.
Both, the North-side and South-side of the project has an attractive view. There is a sea view on the North of the project, and a city view on the South of the project. With this condition, it is hard to obtain optimum view for the whole building. We solved this problem by designing v-shaped towers, that will allow each room to face either North or South. This design also allows us to build a swimming pool facilities with different themes between each towers.

[content_toggle style=‚Äù1‚Ä≥ label=‚ÄùClick%20to%20see%20transcript‚Äù hide_label=‚ÄùHide‚Äù]Ari Whitten: Everyone, this is Ari and I‚Äôm back with another interview for you. This time with Joe Cohen. So, to give you a little bit of background about Joe, he is the owner of a couple websites, one is called Selfhacked, which is a website about biohacking. The other one is called Selfdecode which is a really cool website. The concept is basically to take people‚Äôs genetic information from 23andme and then give them a breakdown about their genes and how that relates to different potential health outcomes and different lifestyle strategies that can be used to enhance basically their genetic profile.
So, let me read Joe‚Äôs bio here on his website.
At the age of 25, Joe was sick broke and unemployable. Since biohacking himself from sickness in mid-2013, Joe has become an investor and entrepreneur, founding Selfhacked and Selfdecode. Selfdecode is your personal digital health coach that combines data from genetics, blood tests, and symptoms, to render personalized health recommendations.
Joe is the owner and main writer at Selfhacked.
Joe also consults with high-profile executives, self-hackers, and companies, and is writing a book about optimizing health.
So, with that said. Joe is there anything that I missed that you would like to add to that?
Joe Cohen: No. You pretty much got it.
Ari Whitten: Okay, cool.
Joe Cohen: You‚Äôve got it all there.
Ari Whitten: Cool. So, you biohacked yourself in 2013, and you were sick, broke, and unemployed. Talk to me a little bit about that.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, basically, when in 2013 mean, I made a big breakthrough in mid-2013. But before that, I just had this a myriad of health issues starting from adolescence. So, as long as I can remember, at 13 already I was like, I‚Äôd eat something I‚Äôd get tired or I was just tired in the day. And then, as I got older, it started getting worse. But I was eating healthier, being healthier, I was mitigating a lot of it. And at the age of 24 and 25, it‚Äôs just it just caught up with me.
It was ‚Ä¶ I was trying some different diets, and I was actually trying high-fat diet and I did horrible. It caused, I had a meltdown from it.
Now‚Ä¶
Ari Whitten: Was this high fat Keto?
Joe Cohen: No, it wasn‚Äôt keto and I don‚Äôt want to necessarily dis high fat, guys because I do have a higher fat diet now. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs as high as my experiment throughout, it‚Äôs just trying to add fat to everything.
But, in and I do think you need a‚Ä¶ It depends on the person‚Äôs genes and things that. But, and there are states. I wasn‚Äôt in the state where I was ready for that.
And so, basically, I was also eating foods that were ‚Äì at the time I didn‚Äôt even know it ‚Äì but they were causing inflammation for me. And that combination of inflammation from food and just a mismatch in my lifestyle and diet and when I was supposed to be doing, it just caused‚Ä¶
And I was doing a lot of other things, I was going to school it, basically, caused me to flunk out of that semester. I just failed all my courses. I was‚Ä¶ And then I was just, ‚ÄùDamn, I need to fix myself here, this is, I can‚Äôt let this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got to get to the root cause of everything.‚Äù
I was already reading on blogs and different things back then, trying to understand what was happening. But the issue is, that nobody was really telling you what the root causes. They would talk about the root cause and then maybe you‚Äôll say toxins, mold, or whatever it is‚Ä¶
If you don‚Äôt understand the biological mechanisms, you‚Äôre not going to understand what suits what person. Because one guy would be talking about mold, I won‚Äôt say his name. But we all know who it is.
Ari Whitten: At least those of us familiar with biohacking.
Joe Cohen: Yeah. One guy‚Äôs talking about mold, and I‚Äôm looking at him and I‚Äôm saying, ‚ÄùI really believe that mold is his issue. But how do I know it‚Äôs my issue?‚Äù
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: The only way you can know‚Ä¶ The only way you can know, okay who‚Äôs the issue is what? Is to understand the nuts and bolts of the body, and then understand what‚Äôs happening.
And so, I came to the realization that I‚Äôm not going to fix these problems by listening necessarily to broad recommendations. One guy will say, this one guy will say that. You need to have some mechanisms as well to know, ‚Äùokay you‚Äôre sensitive to mold, and now I know why you‚Äôre sensitive to mold. But I don‚Äôt have these genes, or I don‚Äôt have these symptoms that show that I have the same problems as you. What would help me?‚Äù
And that‚Äôs when I started embarking on really understanding the differences between what the difference between me and let‚Äôs say Dave Asprey. And now, actually, I could say after three and a half years of really being engrossed ‚Äì I can tell you exactly what the biological differences are between me and Dave Asprey.
My system is built in XYZ way and I can go through the nuts and bolts, and I can, based on his symptoms and based on what I know about him, I can tell you what his system is. And then it is going to be different recommendations based on his system in my system.
Ari Whitten: Got ya. And so, through this process, you figured out what was going wrong with you and then you figured out how to fix it.
Joe Cohen: Yes, through this process I figured out the nuts and both of my system. Now I understand exactly from receptors, from the brain parts, from the physical parts, what is going on.
And I also tied it back into the lifestyle and dietary agents that may be problematic for these factors.
And once you understand the factors, or if you understand first what the agents are, you can also infer what the factors are, the nuts and bolts that are causing the issues.
Ari Whitten: Cool.
Joe Cohen: And also obviously your genes are able to help you once if you have an idea. Especially, if you have an idea. You can go both ways.
Number one is if you have an idea what the problem is you can start to look at your genes and say, ‚ÄùAre any of these genes a problem?‚Äù
Number two is, you could look at your genes and say ‚ÄùHuh, let‚Äôs make sense maybe because I‚Äôm having all these symptoms.‚Äù
Ari Whitten: Got ya.
Joe Cohen: I was phase two. Phase one was Selfhacked‚Ä¶ I first need to figure this out. And I would research something and I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄùWhat, I might as well put this online!‚Äù
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: I did research and writing and then what I realized was, there‚Äôs this whole genetic world exploding and we have all this information, but these tools that I was using were just beyond bad .it wasn‚Äôt even bad, it was beyond bad. They weren‚Äôt giving you information, it was a very tiny subset of genes, there‚Äôs here‚Äôs ten genes and absolutely no information, no references, and anything that they did give you‚Ä¶
I was just‚Ä¶ This is complex the studies are actually less complex than what they‚Äôre telling me because the studies at least give you a broad picture. They‚Äôre giving you a slight snapshot, and this is just gibberish.
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: That‚Äôs when I started to think about doing genetics. And so, I started‚Ä¶ First, my idea was to build a program, to at least give people content that they can understand. Give them contents that they can understand. I kept on, okay, well we‚Äôre only giving a thousand genes. I want to give all the genes. And then it got more complex, and then I‚Äôm, ‚ÄùOkay, we need to simplify it, and then give it to people in different ways.‚Äù
So we‚Äôve been working on this for about a year and a half, and we‚Äôre building out a whole variety of tools that people can biohack fatigue and themselves in all manners.
More comprehensive, more curated content people understand it better, and also combine it with recommendations people know what to do with that information.
And also, you need to combine it with blood tests, symptoms, and another the health data like a symptom checklist, I can know what pathways in your body are not working. And based on that it‚Äôs, ‚Äùokay, this pathway is not working we can compare it to your genes, there is a whole list of supplements for that pathway, if we want to make it this complete biohacking suite, where either biohackers, or other individuals, or functional medicine doctors can come and really understand what‚Äôs going on, and also have targeted recommendations for individuals.
Ari Whitten: Beautiful. So, I want to get into that more the nuts and bolts around how genes interact with different lifestyle interventions, how that influences on specifically energy levels and fatigue, how it all ties in.
But real quick, just as a quick side point you have mentioned biohacking a couple of times. Obviously, you and I both know what that is, but not everybody knows what that is. Some people get scared off by that term, and some people think it‚Äôs installing microchips into your body, and stuff like that.
So, can you just do a quick explanation of what biohacking is for people?
Joe Cohen: Well, I guess there‚Äôs no standardized definition but I can give you what my take is on it. It‚Äôs basically, it‚Äôs basically, taking your health into your own hands to a certain extent, and it‚Äôs it‚Äôs using a broader set of tools than you would normally think of as, okay, the normal set of tools; you go to a doctor they either give you a drug or they don‚Äôt. So, it‚Äôs using a broader set of tools which includes lifestyle, diet supplements, or and for some people drugs as well, and testing it out on yourself and seeing how it works for you.
In my definition, I think there are smarter biohackers who will try to understand the issue first, and then unless they do this as a profession, like myself, where I just I feel I need to try everything. I don‚Äôt necessarily recommend that to other people because you will get side effects. Especially if‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try high doses sometimes I‚Äôll do reckless things.
But, if you‚Äôre just a consumer or someone who wants to just live a normal life, it makes sense you have a more targeted biohacking approach where you try things that have a higher probability of getting the results you want.
And the results of biohacking is to perform better and either the end results are you‚Äôre happier your mood is better, you have more energy, you just can you let you get more out of life.
Ari Whitten: Yeah, for anyone that was scared off by the term biohacker, I just want to point out that if you are interested in using lifestyle strategies to improve your health, or your energy level, or your lifespan, you are a biohacker by this definition.
Joe Cohen: Exactly.
Ari Whitten: so, don‚Äôt be scared off by that term. With that said and understanding your background, your frame of reference, and the approach paradigm that you take to this talk to me a little bit about the main causes of fatigue, and why somebody would be lacking energy.
Joe Cohen: Ok, yeah. So, with any issue that I come across, you want to look at a bigger picture first. Because if someone has fatigue and then they have eight other symptoms, then it‚Äôs going to completely change the game, rather than if someone just has fatigue. I can tell you in my clients, I have a questionnaire and I give them a list of symptoms, and that allows me to see if a certain system is broken, and that I call the limbic system.
The limbic system is a group of organs in the brain. The hypothalamus, the thalamus, the amygdala, the cingulate, and the hippocampus. These are these are parts of the the limbic system.
The limbic system basically is your emotional system and it‚Äôs also it‚Äôs also very involved with wakefulness. You want to see if someone‚Äôs limbic system is just off. If their limbic system is off then it‚Äôs going to be a different set of reasons why they‚Äôre fatigued.
I‚Äôll just give you a quick list of things how someone would know they have a limbic system problem.
So are they getting fatigued after meals number one and or chronic fatigue? Both of them can be a problem. Brain fog, how is their processing speed?
Do they also have anxiety?
Do they have OCD, or problems letting those thoughts, or thinking about the future too much?
Are they getting hypoglycemic?
Do they have gut problems?
Do they procrastinate a lot?
Do they have problems with motivation?
Do they have cold hands or feet?
And do they have poor deteriorating memory?
Inability to tolerate stress?
Depressed mood?
Insomnia?
Low blood pressure?
And a lot of these people also feel tired but wired at night.
Those are some of the main clusters of symptoms that you see with people who have a deranged limbic system.
Now, the interesting thing is, actually, that‚Ä¶
So as part of the limbic system is very, the reason why it is a system is because it is very intertwined. And if one thing is not working the whole system can be out of whack.
The hypothalamus is going to connect to the hippocampus and everything is very interconnected. The center central part of the limbic system, I would say, are is in the hypothalamus ‚Äì that‚Äôs the central part ‚Äì and in the hypothalamus, there‚Äôs another central part it‚Äôs called the lateral hypothalamus.
The whole hypothalamus is important. But I say it‚Äôs a relatively recent discovery that I haven‚Äôt mentioned this anywhere is the lateral hypothalamus was actually the most important, and I knew about it for a while because I had a post on orexin.
You type in orexin, it‚Äôs going to be a top, one of the top results on google. I wrote that post in 2014, actually, and the orexin system is based on a lot lateral hypothalamus. I realized orexin was matching up to all these symptoms.
Now, it turns out those at the lateral hypothalamus, which is the base for orexin, it basically interacts with all of these symptoms. Even cold hands or feet, gut problems. There‚Äôs a connection there‚Äôs a pretty direct connection between the lateral hypothalamus and all of these problems.
The answer is that to understand the mechanism fatigue, it‚Äôs orexin is this peptide that is, basically, a neurotransmitter where you have this set of neuron in the lateral hypothalamus and the neurotransmitter is just a chemical that transmits signals from one neuron to another, in order to communicate. It‚Äôs just an interneuron communication messenger.
If the lateral hypothalamus which is causing the communication, and the lateral hypothalamus is in case you have fatigue is not working and often there‚Äôs a cluster of symptoms because it happens to me. The lateral hypothalamus is responsible for everything.
Now, if somebody just has fatigue, without all the rest of these issues, it means that it might not be a lateral hypothalamic issue it might just be that the person has a general mitochondrial issue.
They just don‚Äôt have the energy.
It could just be there‚Äôs a hormonal issue, they just have really low testosterone or really low pregnenolone or there could be something more specific going on. But if these cluster of symptoms that I spoke about, then it means that the lateral hypothalamus and the limbic system general is going to be impacted.
Then the question becomes for what causes of those issues?
Shall I go into that now?
Ari Whitten: Yeah, by all means. Unless you want to, I guess there‚Äôs a point of divergence here. You can either go down more specifics on the limbic system or give more of an overview of the other potential causes. Wherever you want to go.
Joe Cohen: Well if I first wanted to go with just the neural structure and the neurotransmitters of fatigue. Just so people get a general understanding and how to contrast that maybe with other types of fatigue, that again if you just sent me an energy problem, or for example if the circadian rhythm.
If your if your circadian rhythm is completely messed up, and it might not be a problem necessarily in your lateral hypothalamus.
By the way, the circadian rhythm as it‚Äôs a is based in the hypothalamus, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Those areas are very close together. The hypothalamus is a tiny part of the brain, and there‚Äôs obviously communication there. But if someone‚Äôs circadian rhythm is terrible, or if they‚Äôre just not sleeping. Their sleep quality is terrible. It‚Äôs obviously going to be a different problem.
They usually won‚Äôt get necessarily the full cluster of other symptoms.
I think now the question is, ‚Äùwell, what causes these limbic system problems?‚Äù And if I have to choose one area, one receptor or one system, it‚Äôs more of a system instead of one particular receptor.
I would say, and this is I actually haven‚Äôt told any non-clients this yet. I haven‚Äôt really I haven‚Äôt put it out that much. It is the cannabinoid system.
(If you want to know more about the cannabinoid system and how that causes fatigue, go read the article How Stress Causes Fatigue (Hint: It‚Äôs Not Just ‚ÄúAdrenal Fatigue‚Äù) and How To Eliminate Stress)
Ari Whitten: Ah, cool. I‚Äôm glad you brought that up because I saw your recent posts on that. I was going to ask you‚Ä¶
Joe Cohen: Exactly. My recent post. But it‚Äôs hard to communicate everything in writing, I think this podcast is or webinars. If you get to talk about this, the interesting thing is nobody has ever mentioned really the cannabinoid system in any meaningful way and dealing with in these issues in general.
I mean, maybe they talk about pot or something, or pot can help you live in this way‚Ä¶ Or CBD becomes big‚Ä¶
Ari Whitten: yeah, it is usually talked about in the context of just CBD‚Ä¶ And what is cool about your recent article is you‚Äôre talking about it there‚Äôs this whole system, and there are lots of things that affect it. It‚Äôs not just‚Ä¶ It can be a CBD deficiency
Joe Cohen: Yeah exactly. You‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs not a CBD deficiency, although CBD can help the system in a variety of ways.
People don‚Äôt even know exactly why CBD is working for people, they just say, ‚ÄùOh, it‚Äôs good.‚Äù They see correlations. CBD‚Ä¶ And it‚Äôs interesting, but when you don‚Äôt understand that the cannabinoid system is the root cause, CBD just becomes another supplement.
And also, I‚Äôm actually experimenting with the substance that I don‚Äôt see anyone else taking because I understand the mechanisms, and I have only taken it one and it has a very interesting effect.
Ari Whitten: What‚Äôs that?
Joe Cohen: and I don‚Äôt want to recommend, I could mention it here but I don‚Äôt want to recommend it yet.
Ari Whitten: Well, It is too much of a teaser what you just said, all that without telling us what it is.
Joe Cohen: Okay. Beta-caryophyllene.
Ari Whitten: Never heard of it.
Joe Cohen: yeah it‚Äôs the most, it‚Äôs the only full agonist for the cb2 receptor. And the cb2 receptors is mainly non-psychoactive. It doesn‚Äôt give you all those cannabinoid effects, but it‚Äôs a very potent anti-inflammatory. And it‚Äôs something that gave me very, very unique effects that were generally positive. And the question is, how dosing, sourcing the product, who should take this product?
And I don‚Äôt want to give advice on that now.
Ari Whitten: Sure‚Ä¶
Joe Cohen: But I think that the interesting thing is in the research, there is only a few full agonist for the cb2 receptor the cannabinoid 2 receptor, and that‚Äôs one of them. When they test it on the study this one is actually way more effective.
Talking about they‚Äôll use research chemicals and in order to see the full effect of things, but usually the research chemical is not something that [inaudible]. They usually have some synthetic chemical or some weird chemical that often caused a lot of side effects. That is the thing with Beta-caryophyllene.
I haven‚Äôt researched a full side effect profile or anything like that. But what I do know is that it is found in a lot of plans and all spices pretty much. I know it‚Äôs not necessarily going to kill me or anything like that.
Ari Whitten: Let me let me just interrupt you real quick if I can. I know that some people who maybe don‚Äôt have a strong background in science probably feel overwhelmed right now with talk of CB receptors and cb1 cb2 and the endocannabinoid system. Can you zoom out for a minute and talk a little overview of what that system is all about? How can you use that to biohack fatigue?
Joe Cohen: Yeah, when I realized, you cannot compare‚Ä¶ Once I was doing research on the cannabinoid system and the interesting thing is before I get into that, the reason I focused on the cannabinoid system is a few things; number one is, I was just reading passively about cannabinoid system here and there, there‚Äôs this thing in my brain passing by, and one of the genes I found that was that one of my bad genes happens to be a cannabinoid one receptor gene.
For me, it was only two percent of the population has that variety. I said, ‚ÄùOkay, this is relatively uncommon‚Äù and again, I knew what the cannabinoid system did and then I started looking at clients with that gene I realized most clients have that gene too and it you wouldn‚Äôt predict it from just chance for anything, because it‚Äôs not that common in the population.
Now, most clients would have one copy and that could cause some problem. I had two copies, so for me, it was way worse. That feeds into a call leptin sensitivity or just sensitivity to a lot of different agents.
Going into the cannabinoid system, one thing that I was researching was, ‚ÄùOk, where are these cannabinoid receptors most concentrated. Turns out, they‚Äôre most concentrated in the limbic system, and the hypothalamus, even more in a lateral hypothalamus.
And the cannabinoid system and the orexin system are so intertwined, actually, which is something that again It‚Äôs more of a relatively recent finding I haven‚Äôt really discussed it too in-depth on the blog.
Basically, this whole paper does, I reckon that‚Äôs the paper in the post, it‚Äôs just talking about the interconnection between the cannabinoid and orexin system, and this [Inaudible] references and things like that.
Ari Whitten: okay
Joe Cohen: It is very, very intertwined and pretty much everything orexin does has an effect on, in some way on the cannabinoid system too. They‚Äôre very closely it related. In the research, they will say there is a co-localization of these receptors, which means that these two receptors are found in the same neurons often. If you look at these functions of orexin, if you look at the functions of the cannabinoid, they happen to be very similar.
I‚Äôm giving one example of the Beta-caryophyllene that I noticed ‚Äì and again I think it‚Äôs a matter of dosing ‚Äì the time that I took it‚Ä¶ That night I was extremely awake and the interesting thing is‚Ä¶ Normally, if I‚Äôm awake, and I don‚Äôt get that much sleep the next day I feel crap. It‚Äôs well, I‚Äôm not getting enough sleep I understand I‚Äôm not feeling great.
This time I got six hours of sleep, I didn‚Äôt even notice at all. Zero. And that was a very interesting effect that I found. But it‚Äôs something that, again, I have to experiment more with, I have to verify and see if, just to make sure.
The cb1 receptor is more psycho-activist cb2 receptors means the function is a potent anti-inflammatory.
Here‚Äôs another thing was very interesting, the way the body works is a chain, is one connection goes to another connection. And we discuss orexin, is very intertwined with the cannabinoid system, and the cannabinoid system is very intertwined with the immune system, and the gut.
The people are also having immune system issues, and they‚Äôre also having gut problems and things like that.
For example, something that I noticed is that I‚Äôm th1 th-17 dominant. What that means is there are T cells, there are kinds of lymphocytes, it‚Äôs white blood cells, lymphocytes T-cells, T-helper-cells and certain subsets of T helper cells. [Inaudible] th1 and th17 is what I noticed is that I am th1 and th17 dominant, from which means that have high levels of these cells. And the most potent ways to suppress these cells is actually through the cannabinoid system. That‚Äôs where the immune system meets the cannabinoid system, meets orexin, and they‚Äôre all closely intertwined because as you know, inflammation inhibits orexin.
Ari Whitten: Right.
Joe Cohen: and again, orexin is closely tied with the cannabinoid system. Interestingly, actually, inflammation increases the cannabinoid receptors in order to counteract the inflammation.
That‚Äôs how the body works. You have inflammation, the body says ‚Äùwe need to take this down, let‚Äôs increase the cannabinoid receptors‚Äù that they‚Äôre more sensitive and that we can decrease inflammation. Which is interesting also, because for example, if I‚Äôve been pretty strict with my diet for six months or something. Pretty decent I have breaks here and there, but what was interesting is, I kept it for six months.
That wasn‚Äôt being healthy, I wasn‚Äôt doing things that were with support my cannabinoid system.
And then I just said, ‚Äùlet me just try, whatever, this thing that I know I will react to.‚Äù
I got such a strong reaction that I realized it was because my cannabinoid your system was not increased, where is let‚Äôs say three and a half years ago, I would have eaten it, I had more problems, but I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed it as much. Because, again, the body can compensate.
[Inaudible] is inflammation it‚Äôs going to increase the cannabinoid system, and my cannabinoid system, I just let the ball go and it wasn‚Äôt and‚Ä¶
I‚Äôll give you one example of how I let the ball go. One thing that increases the cannabinoid system ‚Äì there‚Äôs actually a bunch of chemicals that or natural ways to increase it ‚Äì one is butyrate. I stopped taking hi-maize or those kinds of things and those actually increase the cannabinoid system, the cb1 receptors. And a variety of other things that I was doing then was not increasing my receptors.
At the same time, I didn‚Äôt have inflammation for a long time my cannabinoid receptors were low, Plus genetic susceptibilities, boom just complete chaos.
I was, ‚ÄùWhoa! I‚Äôve never felt this, I‚Äôve never felt this tired, or it wasn‚Äôt it was‚Ä¶ I never felt so little motivation in the last year, or in the past three and a half years. That‚Äôs something very interesting.
Okay, but getting back to it‚Ä¶
Ari Whitten: Real quick. The relationship of that the cannabinoid system to orexin, is is there is there a fairly simple relationship that can be summarized? Is there a direct effect of stimulating the cannabinoid system does so and so to the orexin? And can that help you biohack fatiue, directly?
Joe Cohen: Stimulating the cannabinoid system does stimulate orexin.
Ari Whitten: OK.
Joe Cohen: There is no simple‚Ä¶ The other thing is, you might‚Ä¶ It might be a little tricky because if you smoke pot you get tired. That‚Äôs because of other reasons though, not because of orexin.
And I actually think that‚Ä¶I suspect that for example, you smoke pot at night you will go to sleep, generally speaking, most people go to sleep. You‚Äôll wake up feeling tired the next day. It‚Äôs not improving the sleep quality in some ways, and some of that might be because orexin is being activated, it‚Äôs having a very significant impact in your circadian rhythm. It‚Äôs causing phase delays in your circadian rhythm, and yeah‚Ä¶ I think‚Ä¶ But it does stimulate orexin.
Ari Whitten: OK. Got ya. Okay to zoom out‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre talking about causes of fatigue. First one limbic system issues, and then the second one I guess somewhat related to this still is the cannabinoid system.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, okay. That‚Äôs also where‚Ä¶ One day it feeds into one of the root cause of fatigue which would be anxiety or stress. If you‚Äôre stressed out for a while, either acutely or chronically, it actually decreases the cannabinoid receptors.
Ari Whitten: Okay. So, stress and anxiety directly impact on the cannabinoid‚Ä¶
Joe Cohen: It directly decreases the cannabinoid receptors. It makes you less sensitive to the natural cannabinoids within your system.
Ari Whitten: How is that going to impact on energy levels and fatigue?
Joe Cohen: First of all, stress can kind of‚Ä¶ If you have lower levels of orexin, again, orexin is going to is going to be responsible for motivation, cognitive function, memory, just all these things, or just energy.
The orexin, basically, impacts all these energy systems. If your orexin system is not functioning, if the lateral hypothalamus is not functioning, if the limbic system, in general, is not functioning, it will cause fatigue.
If you have excess anxiety or lots of stress it will feed into the orexin system, and it‚Äôll cause the reduction in your orexin system overall. And this is probably other‚Ä¶ Other‚Ä¶ For example, it‚Äôs probably other mechanisms by which it can cause fatigue.
Another thing is I would say with stress is the impact on the serotonin receptors.r though there‚Äôs 5-HT1A 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C.
Selfdecode has these genes actually. And the interesting thing is, again, I piece information from multiple threads. One day I‚Äôm reading something about the HTR2A gene ‚Äì which is a serotonin receptor gene ‚Äì and I‚Äôm reading‚Ä¶
‚ÄùWow, this has to do with chronic fatigue syndrome.‚Äù People with chronic fatigue syndrome more likely to have fatigue, more likely to have chronic fatigue syndrome. And actually, there is a connection between serotonin receptors and anxiety as well, and wakefulness as well.
I would say, I‚Äôm still looking into all the exact connections there, but there‚Äôs definitely some effects when it comes to anxiety on the cannabinoid system, on the serotonin system. And yeah, I say that‚Äôs what anxiety has to do with it.
Then inflammation is going to be another very significant cause. Inflammation is known in the research to just suppress orexin straight out.
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: Especially when the inflammation is combined with carbohydrates. I‚Äôm a believer that if you just take in carbohydrates you shouldn‚Äôt be getting tired.
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: If you have some inflammation, or if you have mitochondrial issues, then you will get tired, you might get tired with inflammation.
I would say I‚Äôm a test case for that. We get extremely tired from small amounts of carbohydrates.
Ari Whitten: Still?
Joe Cohen: Even without any immune stimulants. Again for example‚Ä¶
Ari Whitten: Is that still the case, Joe? Or‚Ä¶
Joe Cohen: No. Not at all. No, I can have as many carbohydrates as I wanna, I don‚Äôt get tires.
Ari Whitten: Okay good.
Joe Cohen: I mean, the point I‚Ä¶ I have to be careful in the sense that I can‚Äôt take carbohydrates that will cause inflammation for me. Because it happens to be that most of the foods of carbohydrates also have many immune stimulants. They‚Äôre basically‚Ä¶
Carbohydrates are found in plants and plants contain the immune stimulants. So it‚Äôs hard for people to differentiate, ‚ÄùAm I getting tired from carbohydrates? Am I getting tired from the lectins and other immune stimulants in these foods?
I do fine with unlimited carbohydrates. I mean, there‚Äôs a limit though because there is a very limited amount of carbohydrates I can eat. Basically, raw honey the only, and certain varieties of it, are the only type of carbohydrate that I don‚Äôt get fatigued from.
Ari Whitten: Wow.
Joe Cohen: Meaning that‚Äôs the only one that doesn‚Äôt have the immune stimulants that interact negatively with my body. If I want to eat a hundred grams of honey I can, but again, you don‚Äôt want to eat 200 grams of honey. This doesn‚Äôt work. I haven‚Äôt tried higher limits, but I know, if I ate 50 grams of carbs when I was getting inflammation, I would be floored.
I even tried‚Äî I‚Äôll tell you it was one point where I just tried five grams of glucose and I was well I‚Äôm really tired.
Ari Whitten: Wow.
Joe Cohen: That‚Äôs nothing. So, yeah definitely‚Ä¶ Carbohydrates, you have to look at again first principles, nuts, and bolts, what is going to call us with suppression of orexin. Carbohydrates, inflammation, and what‚Äôs called, energy-related molecules in the hypothalamus ‚Äì no, lateral hypothalamus.
They have done studies on this too with ATP. When there is ATP if you have enough energy in the lateral hypothalamus your brain‚Ä¶ You will your orexin system will not shut down, even with when there is glucose present.
Now, if you don‚Äôt have energy or there‚Äôs inflammation, which will deplete the energy there, glucose will make you tired. That‚Äôs why you have to look at the whole system. You have to see‚Ä¶ Okay, somebody‚Äôs getting tired, are they also getting inflammation? Do they have mitochondrial issues? Things like that.
And, something that you speak about and it‚Äôs really important, exercise. If you‚Äôre not exercising, you will have mitochondrial issues.
Ari Whitten: Yeah. Pretty much guaranteed.
Joe Cohen: Yeah. Exercise will stimulate all these genes that are important for energy production, things like that. And through that mechanism, that will, it‚Äôll help with your hormones, and things like that, it will reduce inflammation, and through these indirect mechanisms ‚Äì many of them ‚Äì exercise will help with energy production and being more awake for most people.
Now, there are some people who have exercise intolerance, different ball game, though.
Ari Whitten: Yeah. Okay, main causes give me give me the overview of the main causes that we‚Äôve talked about so far. The limbic system, cannabinoid system, inflammation.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, let me break it up in letting me [Inaudible] it in different ways. One is, here in the brain is this fatigue happening, or within your neurotransmitters and that‚Äôs the lateral hypothalamus, the general limbic system, and orexin. That is the main system, and histamine is another system within the brain but it feeds in very closely with an orexin.
Just to simplify, it is basically, orexin is the most important thing. And then the question is, what receptors or what pathways in the body are interacting with the system? By far the cannabinoid system is the most important and then you have other things as well Serotonin receptors, some things like that.
Then it‚Äôs going to the general health, we‚Äôre having a less inflammation but that gets into, what are‚Ä¶ What would I say are the biggest causes of the orexin system and limbic system not working, or these receptors not working. And that is sleep a lot of people have sleep problems either they‚Äôre not sleeping enough or their sleep quality is not great.
[Inaudible] and the other one was going to be inflammation, and an overactive nervous system, a lot of stress. Those are the root factors that are causing these biological factors to not work and I discussed inflammation why that causes fatigue.
Anxiety really destroys the cannabinoid system, and it can affect the serotonin receptors, and the circadian rhythm is very close to the lateral hypothalamus and that, again, linked very closely with wakefulness, and then sleep.
Now, there‚Äôre other things, of course, that are very important. For example, you discussed light ‚Äì the importance of light. Obviously, for example, light will increase orexin. It‚Äôll go through the suprachiasmatic nucleus from your eyes to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and again it will affect the whole hypothalamus, increase dopamine receptors, there‚Äôs a drd2 receptor that your dopamine can help with wakefulness, modafinil increases dopamine, things like that. Amphetamines, dopaminergic, and on Selfdecode we have the drd2 receptor‚Ä¶ Some people‚Äôs receptors are not working that well, that feeds into fatigue and especially light aspect.
I hadn‚Äôt seen‚Ä¶ The thing is actually, something that‚Äôs very interesting, is what how the sun interacts with the cannabinoid system in an indirect way‚Ä¶ So when somebody is getting outside in the sun, getting light, the sun potently increases nitric oxide. And you can feel it if you haven‚Äôt gotten sun in a long time. You go in the sun you get this burst of nitric oxide, and it is very relaxing.
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: That‚Äôs what a burst of nitric oxide feels like, it has this sedating effect, and it increases blood flow throughout your body. Nitric oxide actually increases the cannabinoid receptors in a sense. Again, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Everything in the body is really interconnected.
In that sense, the sun can increase the cannabinoid receptors. I‚Äôm not sure if light directly can increase the cannabinoid receptors, but I know it increases the dopamine d2 receptors. And that again that will interact with wakefulness systems as well. No question at all.
Ari Whitten: The thing is that it‚Äôs not all about mold.
Joe Cohen: No, that‚Äôs exactly‚Ä¶ But we do know that light does increase orexin so that would be how light would increase wakefulness. But if you‚Äôre out in the light and you‚Äôre getting sun, you‚Äôre going to increase your dopamine d2 receptors, you‚Äôre going to increase orexin, there‚Äôs the nitric oxide, you‚Äôre going to help your cannabinoid system. That‚Äôs going to be really important.
I could put lack of light or lack of sun in causing these kinds of issues because of those pathways.
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: You talk about exercise. I would say exercise is just extremely diverse in what it can do. It‚Äôs just doing a lot of little things that are helping, again.
Ari Whitten: Also stimulates the nitric oxide element.
Joe Cohen: It also stimulates, exactly. Increases blood flow, nitric oxide, all these things. And just a bunch of these mechanisms are going to help you in different ways.
Then nutrition as far as that it‚Äôs going to be carbs. If your mitochondria are not working as well as they should, if you are having inflammation or stuff like that, or if you just keep tons of carbs.
Everybody‚Äôs going to have a different carb tolerance for different reasons.
Ari Whitten: Right. Okay, I want to get into‚Ä¶ More directly your wheelhouse around genetics. And I want people to really get this concept of how a gene analysis tool such as Selfdecode can actually translate into them doing certain things in their life, which positively impacts their life, or enhance their health or energy.
Talk to me a little bit about what are some of the most important genes. I know you‚Äôve already mentioned a bunch of them, but can you just give me an overview of, maybe the top five, or ten genes along with what information they will get from analyzing them? And then how does that translate into maybe different interventions that can be used to benefit their life?
Joe Cohen: Yeah definitely. Basically, there‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ When it comes to fatigue there could be a variety of genes doing different things. But as far as the cannabinoids we have we have individual pages and different ways to view the information that an individual can look at.
You can also see if you have less common varieties of certain genes they‚Äôll pop up as red, and then you can click an information button and see what that means for you. It‚Äôll give you a real specific information for you.
For example, when I found the cannabinoid receptor one gene, there was one snp that was. We also give importance levels. One snp was, had a lot of research on it. And we‚Äôll give it a higher importance. CNR one it is called and then the CNT2 for the cannabinoid receptor two.
You want to see‚Ä¶ Would be looking at‚Ä¶ You can either look at individual genes or you can look at we combine genes or snps together in certain packs you can look at. It‚Äôll be circadian rhythm, sleep, things that.
I discussed the drd2. There‚Äôs also nicotinic receptors that can interact wakefulness. For example, and also cognitive function as well. The nicotinic receptors also increase wakefulness as nicotine does. Nicotine increases orexin, it also increases the cannabinoid system through a variety of means which is very interesting.
I actually do well with nicotine, and I do well with it, obviously, increase wakefulness but we very interesting to see that it increases the cannabinoid system too.
Ari Whitten: Yeah, that is interesting. I‚Äôve actually, as far as stimulants go, I‚Äôm much preferring nicotine to caffeine.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, for sure. Same here.
Ari Whitten: Just to clarify for people. I‚Äôm not talking about smoking cigarettes I‚Äôm talking about nicotine gum.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, yeah.
Ari Whitten: [Crosstalk] I just picturing me smoking cigarettes to get a stimulant effect from it.
Joe Cohen: Exactly. Yeah, I don‚Äôt eat‚Ä¶ Yeah, I don‚Äôt need to smoke cigarettes. I mean, the harmful effects of cigarettes are, obviously, the toxins released from burning the tobacco.
Ari Whitten: Yeah.
Joe Cohen: That‚Äôs almost all of it. Nicotine is not a pure saint. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Any drug, there is going to be some side effects. But pretty much, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ There is way more benefits and drawbacks. But I do have a comprehensive post on that.
Nicotine and galantamine if you wanted to go that route, there are the alpha 7 and alpha 4 nicotinic receptors. And these are‚Ä¶ These heavily influence wakefulness and working memory. And these.
There‚Äôs a whole bunch of genes that I look at. There‚Äôs, they are called CHRNA. And then there are three, five, seven.
You‚Äôd want to look at those genes in terms of, they might have‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre having some working memory issues or wakefulness issues, some of those might have some effect.
Another one is a very interesting one is the ADA gene. The adenosine deaminase gene. It basically it‚Äôs an enzyme that takes [Inaudible] and creates adenosine. Sorry, it takes adenosine and creates inosine. And when that‚Ä¶ If it‚Äôs not working that well, you‚Äôre going to have a buildup of adenosine.
Ari Whitten: Yeah. Which is going to lead to fatigue.
Joe Cohen: Which is going to lead to fatigue, yeah. The way that the what another aspect of the fatigue system is when adenosine‚Ä¶ Basically, as you burn energy throughout the day, adenosine builds up. And for a guy like me, adenosine is going to build up quicker because I‚Äôm not converting that adenosine to inosine.
Ari Whitten: Because of the activity of your ADA.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, it‚Äôs lower activity, the end result of that and the studies are if people sleep less they‚Äôre going to be more tired the next day. Because, again, they just have more adenosine in their system, they‚Äôre probably going to be more tired in general, I mean.
But if your system is working, you‚Äôre not going to be tired. We can‚Äôt just blame fatigue on a gene, but it does have, it definitely is associated with cognitive performance and fatigue the next day, if you don‚Äôt sleep well.
That was a very interesting gene that I found, and it‚Äôs not that common. Five percent of the population will have one of those variations or five to ten percent. You might want to check that one, the ADA gene.
There are different fixes. For each gene that we have, we have fixes. How can you increase this gene? How can you decrease it? And what are natural ways? We have a variety different tools to see how you can modulate these genes.
Another one would be‚Ä¶ This is actually a very popular one as far as athletic performance, is P-Delta. P- is actually one of the critical systems that differentiate between people. And in general, if we want to walk back a little, the nuclear receptors and the transcription factors ‚Äì as they call them ‚Äì it‚Äôs just, transcription factors a gene that reads that causes the expression of a lot of other genes.
And these systems are going to have broad effects on the body, and this is one of the ways I categorize people as well. Different P-‚Äôs people will have either low or high levels and me to look at P-Alpha, P-Delta and P-Gamma those are the three main ones.
Then there‚Äôs PGC 1 alpha or the genes called [inaudible]
Ari Whitten: And all of this tie into to mitochondrial health and mitochondrial biogenesis.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, exactly. Fat-burning, mitochondrial health, things like that, and just energy production in general. P-Gamma it‚Äôs more anti-inflammatory and I have low levels. Bulletproof is going to have high levels of P-Gamma which means that if he takes in omega-6 he‚Äôs going to gain weight because of Omega 6‚Ä¶
Ari Whitten: By the way, did you just refer to Dave Asprey as bulletproof?
Joe Cohen: Yeah, bulletproof.
Ari Whitten: Is that his name?
Joe Cohen: That‚Äôs what I call him.
Ari Whitten: Cool! Ok, sorry go ahead.
Joe Cohen: he is a good guy to talk about because a lot of people know him, and he‚Äôs very vocal about is his health history. You can, if you listen if you read about him, or whatever, you can see ‚Äùokay what is this guy talking about?‚Äù He has a lot of very specific recommendations, which I think are very suited for his biology.
For example, he will say our omega-6 is bad. The answer is, omega-6 actually can help activate the cannabinoid system and it also help activate P-Gamma, And I was thinking, I don‚Äôt do that badly with omega-6, I actually think I do pretty well.
Ari Whitten: Yeah, I think the same. I mean, I went through‚Ä¶ Many years ago I went through a phase where I was avoiding them like the plague and I thought that omega-6s were the devil. But now I actually eat quite a lot of nuts and seeds and I find that I react very well to them.
Joe Cohen: Yeah, exactly. And for me, I mean I I react to most plant-based foods. I don‚Äôt do well with nuts and seeds, but if I just take the oils, I mean, I generally don‚Äôt I don‚Äôt react negatively to them. And in general more positive. The reason for me is because I have lower P-Gamma, lower cannabinoid system ‚Äì and by the way part of the cannabinoid system, again they‚Äôre also very interconnected ‚Äì the cannabinoid system actually activates P-Gamma. It‚Äôs this whole web and to both the cannabinoid and the P-Gamma cause increased waking.
When they give people something to block the cannabinoid receptors, they lose weight, and again that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs part of it a lot of my clients tells me, ‚ÄùI can‚Äôt gain weight.‚Äù And the answer, ‚ÄùYou‚Äôre never going to gain weight if your cannabinoid system is not working.‚Äù And they don‚Äôt understand, they don‚Äôt understand the in-depth mechanism.
What I could say is it, obviously, if you can‚Äôt gain weight and you‚Äôre having these limbic system problems, I can tell you for sure your cannabinoid system broken. Whereas somebody‚Ä¶ Then you have these people who say I can‚Äôt lose weight and that‚Äôs obviously also a very large section of people the question is, why are these people different? How are they different? One person is saying I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt gain weight, one person is saying I can‚Äôt lose weight.
It has to do with the P-Gamma and the cannabinoid system.
Yeah‚Ä¶ Basically‚Ä¶ Yeah‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs see where are we going‚Ä¶ As far as people in‚Ä¶ And these are also anti-inflammatory systems. What I noticed is when people are‚Ä¶ When it‚Äôs easy for people to gain weight, those people generally have less issues with inflammation in a lot of ways, which was a very interesting thing that I realized early on. I just didn‚Äôt understand why.
That has to do with P-Gamma, a lot of it has to do with P-Gamma. Again, the cannabinoid system and you can check for routines with P-Gamma, you can check for genes for P-Delta, P-Alpha, and a lot of these transcription factors actually compete with one another. If you have high levels of P-Delta and it will compete with the other one, the other P-s in general.
What will increase generally in all of them, is the PGC-1-Alpha and that will help mitochondrial function. That‚Äôs something that generally everybody does well with, but there are genes for that, there are genes for the other P-s as I said. Now, P-Delta is that‚Ä¶ Those they found that some P-Delta genes, you‚Äôre eight times more likely to be an extreme athlete, or perform better at athletics, and things like that.
That‚Äôs because it helps with energy production and stuff like that.
Ari Whitten: By the way, on that note, there was a compound that I was interested in called [Inaudible] [crosstalk].
Joe Cohen: I have a post on that, actually, I think.
Ari Whitten: Yeah I saw it‚Ä¶ It looks to me it has some really fascinating effects and I do see quite a lot of people taking it.
Joe Cohen: But there are risks.
Ari Whitten: Yeah, but then there‚Äôs the cancer issue and that‚Äôs what has stopped me from taking it. But I‚Äôm very curious about how somebody with fatigue due to mitochondrial dysfunction would do with something like that.
Joe Cohen: That‚Äôs, I mean, that‚Äôs an interesting question. I think with fatigue for mitochondrial function they‚Äôll want to focus on the PGC1Alpha. Really going selective with the P-Delta is going to crowd out some other things, that again gets to P-‚Ä¶ For example, if your P-Delta dominant you‚Äôre going to crowd out the P-gamma, P-Alpha and those are also really beneficial.
What happens with P-Delta is more specific for athletic performance and things like that. And I can‚Äôt imagine that some negative side effects will occur.
Kind of the same with the cannabinoid system, it‚Äôs not, there‚Äôs no such thing as one thing that‚Äôs just great all around generally speaking. The fact that I had lower cannabinoid system allowed me to be very muscular without really working out. And also, again, it also interacts with AMPK. P-Gamma is going to interact with AMPK and SIRT1 which is the energy production pathways and mitochondrial enhancement pathways.
For example, people won‚Äôt know it, but with SIRT1 and the AMPK can actually give it to P-Gamma.
Ari Whitten: Oh, interesting.
Joe Cohen: And some people can have higher levels of that‚Ä¶ And that was interesting too because I noticed that had some genes that were associated with higher sirt1, which was very interesting because I‚Äôm ‚ÄùWell, SIRT1 is great. Why am I still having‚Ä¶ Why am I genetically not able to, whatever eat, normal food ?‚Äù And the answer is that that pathway can actually inhibit the anti-inflammatory P-Gamma pathway.
Ari Whitten: Interesting.
Joe Cohen: So, yeah.
Ari Whitten: Give me maybe three more genes
Joe Cohen: Again, there are the sirts. The SIRT1, SIRT3. Those are going to have to do with energy production and PSR1, actually, is a gene that has to‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs associated with high-orexin. Again, you want to see, what your snps are there.
There is PDE4D gene. Which is, again, if you have high levels of that it can cause decreased cyclic AMP and that can cause decreased energy and fatigue. They found that PDE4 inhibitors can increase wakefulness after fatigue‚Ä¶ Yes, there‚Äôs something‚Ä¶ Whether it is sleeping less. So, that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs going to have to do with wakefulness.
The adrenergic receptors, the beta and alpha adrenergic receptors, are going to have to do with fatigue and also keen to related to athletic performance as well. It is kind of, how your adrenaline system is working, and that‚Äôs also going to feed into a fat burning system. But might not be good in some other ways. It‚Äôs going to contribute to activation of your nervous system. But that‚Äôs ADRA2A and ADRB1.
Then there are circadian genes. Again, the circadian rhythm really interacts with the wakefulness system, it has to‚Ä¶ Actually, in the sleep research, the researchers believe there are two systems. There is the circadian system and there‚Äôs a one is a build-up system where adenosine is building up. And you‚Äôre getting more and more tired, but then there‚Äôs this circadian wakefulness system that‚Äôs stopping you from going to sleep. And but then all of a sudden that drops off at a certain time if your circadian rhythm‚Ä¶ And then you get really tired.
Ari Whitten: It allows adenosine to hit you.
Joe Cohen: Exactly, exactly. It allows the adenosine to hit you. It‚Äôs this wakefulness system.. The circadian rhythm definitely interacts with the whole orexin and wakefulness system it has to. Looking at your circadian rhythm genes, sometimes you‚Äôll see different genes for that, different people will do well‚Ä¶ Will do poorly with circadian rhythm stuff because of those genes. Those genes‚Ä¶
We have in our snp analyzer we have packs. You can look at whole packs and it‚Äôll give you genes associated with different issues. We also have a search feature, now, we have in the database you can do disease‚Ä¶ You can pick a disease and if you do all the genes and snps related to that disease.
But if you want me to just name you a couple it would be pers PER3, PER2, PER1, which stands for period which is part of the circadian system, as well as clock genes. These are going to be important for the circadian system as well. Something that I think is really important also for sleep quality is BDNF gene. BDNF is actually part of the reason why exercise helps you sleep better, and with wakefulness in general.
Again, exercise kind of that indirect thing often has all these indirect actions. It‚Äôll increase metabolism, increased energy buildup during the day which will help increase your sleep quality, exercise will also‚Ä¶ Yeah like you said, with some nitric oxide. So, all these indirect pathways. But the most important for sleep is that it increases BDNF
Ari Whitten: And tell people what BDNF is just they know.
Joe Cohen: BDNF is this neurotrophic, it‚Äôs just basically steroids‚Ä¶ Neurotransmitter steroids for the brain. A neuropeptide that increases the growth of neurons and it does a lot of other the things in the body as well. It increases metabolism, it‚Äôs associated with weight loss and things like that. That‚Äôs why through the BDNF pathway you‚Äôre going to have a lot of different effects. For example, people with certain genes, certain variations they have less‚Ä¶ I actually have one of those‚Ä¶ My sleep quality is not going to be as good. So, that may seem more‚Ä¶ That and the ADAA gene is definitely contributing to my need for more sleep, or just seven and a half ‚Äì eight hours, which is people these days don‚Äôt want to get.
Ari Whitten: Yeah, sure. Cool I mean, you just gave it a ton of different stuff. But just to recap and summarize so people can grasp all of this stuff that you just went over. Basically, there are these different genes that they will have, kind of varying degrees of. They may have good variations of that particular gene, or not good variations when it comes to circadian rhythm genes, or genes associated with AMPK and the P-s and pgc-1 alpha and mitochondrial function, and the ability of mitochondria to produce energy, BDNF, the sirts, all of these different layers, and if you go into Selfdecode, what happens from there?
Joe Cohen: Okay. There are a few ways you can find stuff from Selfdecode. Number one is, if there‚Äôs any gene you want to look at, you can go to‚Ä¶ Once you have your stuff uploaded you can just go to, selfdecode.com/gene/ you just put the gene name in.
Now, for some of them it‚Äôll be you know clock it‚Äôll be pretty it‚Äôll be fine but genes actually have different names and not always will it click, but it‚Äôs stuff ADA, P-D, BDNF will actually work. PRD2 will work. So. A lot of them will work ‚Äì not all of them will work ‚Äì but we do have a search feature that you can search for the genes.
You could also you can search for them in this reporting system. Which‚Ä¶ There are a few different ways of few different search features you can do in the system. But beyond that, there‚Äôs a snp analyzer. What we call a snp analyzer that groups the snps together in different ways. In addition, there‚Äôs different gene packs that we put together that, for example, I‚Äôll have my ‚ÄùJoe‚Äôs favorite genes‚Äù if you click on ‚ÄùJoe‚Äôs favorite genes‚Äù, it will have a lot of‚Ä¶ It will have the genes that I mentioned here, for example.
But we have different categories of genes. Let‚Äôs say for neurotransmitters, that‚Äôs a different way you can look at it. The other way is‚Ä¶ Yeah, and then, within the system, you can look at there‚Äôs a feature that will give you a list of your bad snps. And then while you‚Äôre looking around, you can bookmark the snps.
We also have a recommendation system which we, basically, scan through all the potentially problematic genes and then we say ‚ÄùOkay, these are the potential problematic genes.‚Äù We have a massive database of chemicals, and we categorize them as whether it‚Äôs beneficial, natural, and you can see the beneficial, natural, substances that interact with your genes. And then, if you look at that you could say, ‚ÄùOh, this is interesting I should do more research on this chemical and see does it make sense for my biology?‚Äù
And you can also click on the ‚Äùsee interactions‚Äù and they‚Äôll show you all the genes that it‚Äôs interacting with, and you can just click on the gene. We‚Äôre implementing a whole bunch of new systems that constantly make it simpler. For example, once one small thing is‚Ä¶ Right now, you could click on the genes but something that relatively simple to do is show you show you whether each chemical is increasing a certain gene, or decreasing a certain gene, within the picture. Then you have this broad picture you see ‚Äùsod2 increasing.‚Äù
That‚Äôs something that we‚Äôre constantly making it more simple for somebody to upload their genes. And then just, and also we‚Äôre making it, we‚Äôre making the recommendation system way more accurate by including symptoms. Now, we‚Äôre working on systems that include other things; symptoms, blood tests, and pathways.
Basically, I give you a checklist, you check out, you check things off, and then will I can figure out which pathways are not working and we can weigh that into the recommendations. Same with genes, and we can‚Ä¶ Another thing is, we can we‚Ä¶ Have to once we weigh a lot of more a lot more factors, it‚Äôs going to, basically, keep on getting more accurate. Now, it‚Äôs still good in the sense that you can look at it and say, ‚Äùah that‚Äôs an interesting, let me explore this a lot more.‚Äù And it‚Äôs gonna‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs that substance to interact with most of your genes the most number of genes that might be problematic. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Looking at the recommendation system.
It also gives you toxins to stay away from. You can also‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs also a recommendation system for if you‚Äôre concerned about a certain disease, let‚Äôs say whatever it is, you can type it in we have a whole disease database and they‚Äôll give you all the snps related to that disease all the genes. You can click on all the snps, all the genes, it‚Äôll show you which one‚Ä¶ Which variations are risky, which ones are less common.

Returns an estimated search result size for a node,
or of the context node if no node is provided.
The search result size for a node is the number of fragments remaining
(including the current node) in the result sequence containing the node.
This is useful to quickly estimate the size of a search result sequence,
without using
fn:count() or
xdmp:estimate().
This function makes it efficient to estimate the size of a search result
and execute that search in the same query. If you only need an estimate of
the size of a search but do not need to run the search, then
xdmp:estimate
is more efficient.
To return the estimated size of a search with
cts:remainder
,
use the first item of a
cts:search
result sequence as the
parameter to
cts:remainder. For example, the following
query returns the estimated number of fragments that contain the word
"dog":
cts:remainder(cts:search(collection(), "dog")[1])
When you put the position predicate on the
cts:search result sequence,
MarkLogic Server will filter all of the false-positive results
up to the specified position, but not the false-positive results beyond
the specified
position. Because of this, when you
increase the position number in the parameter, the
result from
cts:remainder
might decrease
by a larger number than the increase in position number, or it might not
decrease at all. For example, if
the query above returned 10, then the following query might return 9, it
might return 10, or it might return less than 9, depending on how the
results are dispersed throughout different fragments:
cts:remainder(cts:search(collection(), "dog")[2])
If you run
cts:remainder
on a constructed node, it always
returns 0; it is primarily intended to run on nodes that are the retrieved
from the database (an item from a search result or an
item from the result of an XPath expression that searches through the
database).
let $x := cts:search(collection(), "dog") return (cts:remainder($x[1]), $x) => Returns the estimated number of items in the search for "dog" followed by the results of the search.
xdmp:document-insert("/test.xml", <a>my test</a>); for $x in cts:search(collection(),"my test") return cts:remainder($x) => 1
for $a in cts:search(collection(),"my test") where $a[cts:remainder() eq 1] return xdmp:node-uri($a) => /test.xml

New Buildings In Use
We are pleased to tell you that the school building project that Congo Action and Working Together ‚Äì Congo started in July 2018, has been completed on time for September, for the start of the academic year. This summer, we added another 3 new classrooms to the 3 already built last year: This constitutes 6 classrooms all together, representing a complete rebuilt of ourKavumba primary school, a very much needed operation due to the degradation of the original wooden school, built in 2006.
Start writing or type / to choose a block
The school has gained in popularity over the years, due to the genuine interest and support of the village chief, the dedication of the teachers, and the supervision done by the Catholic academic board.
In September, we had 360 children registered, as opposed to 220 children in 2017. The head teacher said they were inundated with demands that they could not meet! The demand for education in remote villages continue to be high, but also the school has been working so well, and the academic results are excellent:85% success in exams results, enabling children to move to secondary education. What a formidable encouragement for all concerned!
This is not an ordinary school: it is more than that: it is a dream that came about after a visit to the area, where Congo Action was working to establish rural cooperatives and sewing workshops. This was in 2005, a meeting with the village chief, a kind offer of a plot of land that could be used as a building plot, a suggestion that a school was very much needed‚Ä¶.. they saw our visit as the foundation of hope and opportunities for the children of the village. From then on, we felt we had to carry on the responsibility of such a precious and well meaning ‚ÄúGift‚Äù from people who had so little, when we had so much in comparison.
It took much determination and fund raising efforts to achieve what the villagers expected us to achieve for their children: years of work and chance meetings often with people who are generous of their time and money to give, not to forget our long standing supporters who have stayed with us after the individual sponsorship programme terminated. We are so grateful to all of you who have contributed!
The construction of such a building is never easy in an area where there are no roads, but muddy tracks spoiled by heavy rains. There are very serious transport issues, because trucks get damaged or stuck in the process, and this often proves to be the most costly part of the project. There was also the question of water needed for building work: the villagers rallied around to go and get from the springs some distance away the 1000 litres of water requested every day. The children also joined in with the carrying of materials, bricks, wood, etc.‚Ä¶ The teachers volunteered at week-ends to assume the supervision of the building materials stored on the premises‚Ä¶ It was all achieved in a spirit of goodwill , hard work and good humour. To summarise it all, these are the words used by Vital Kulimushi, our Congolese co-worker who supervised the project:
‚ÄúThe success of the project is due to the following factors: we had a motivated team of skilled workers, good understanding and collaboration between the village chief, the parents‚Äô committee, the teaching body, and the support of the Congolese authorities to see the project coming to fruition. We are also grateful to Congo Action and Working Together ‚Äì Congo for their trust and understanding when faced with real difficulties in trying to achieve the project on time.‚Äù
And here we are to day, we have given the Kavumba village the legacy of a primary school

To compare hearing aids, it is important to begin by understanding the two basic types of hearing aids: analog and digital. You will find that many dealers sell mostly digital aids. While both analog and digital hearing aids will help a person to hear better, there are some fundamental differences between the two that should be addressed. Analog hearing aids simply amplify sound. In contrast, digital hearing aids have built-in computer chips that effectively adjust sound. Digital hearing aids can be customized, while analog aids usually cannot be adjusted.
Cost-wise, analog aids are far less expensive than digital aids, but hearing aids should not be purchased based upon cost alone. Most people who wear hearing aids find that digital aids are more comfortable than analog aids. Regarding the placement of an aid, there are a couple of different types to consider before you can effectively compare hearing aids.
Completely in the canal hearing aids are placed directly into the ear. These aids are the smallest kind available, and they are also the most expensive. While high undetectable, canal hearing aids do not have a long battery life. Thus, these are best for those people with mild hearing loss.
In the ear aids are larger than canal aids. These aids are best for those people with severe hearing loss, since they are largely customizable. In addition to being detectable to the naked eye, in the ear aids also have a tendency to pick up feedback, which can be a nuisance. Still, these aids are highly recommended by most medical professionals.
Behind the ear aids are the largest type of hearing aid that you can purchase. While behind the ear aids are great for all kinds of hearing loss, these aids are highly detectable. The best way to compare hearing aids is to gather all of the information listed above, shop around for the best price, and try a few different types of aids.
Hearing aids have come a long way from their humble beginnings. Today's aids come with all kind of features that may appeal to some people. When it comes time to compare hearing aids, take a look at all the newest features on the market. While some people may find various gadgets helpful and useful, others may not need these add-ons at all.

Hamas has not yet given its official consent to the Palestinian Authority‚Äôs (PA) forthcoming elections, although a month and a half has passed since the secretaries‚Äô summit in which Fatah and Hamas leaders met.
Fatah is still waiting for Hamas‚Äô response. A source in Fatah told TPS that it is the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas‚Äô military wing in the Gaza Strip, which is delaying the final answer following its fear that the PA elections and reconciliation with Fatah will hinder its actions.
The source added that the guideline in Hamas‚Äô military wing is to let PA head Mahmoud Abbas drown and not lend a hand with a move of reconciliation.
‚ÄúAbu Mazen is a dead horse in their eyes and should not be revived,‚Äù said a Fatah official about the contacts between the organizations.
He said Iran was pressuring Hamas not to agree to reconciliation and conditions that would harm the armed struggle against Israel, and in the meantime, it appears that Hamas is raising additional demands as a step to delay its response to its agreement to elections in the PA.
Among other things, Hamas is demanding that the conditions of PA officials operating in the Gaza Strip be equal to those working in Ramallah.
In light of these Hamas positions, the Palestinians are also finding it difficult to hold the next leadership summit that was supposed to take place in Gaza a few weeks ago. It is now reported that Egypt also does not approve of hosting the conference unless Hamas gives its clear consent in advance to reconciliation and new elections in the PA.
Fatah is also examining whether it will be possible to hold the conference in Algeria to circumvent the sensitivity involved in holding the conference in Egypt, which is angry at Abbas for choosing to convene the factions in Turkey, it‚Äôs rival.
Fatah officials are angry at Hamas and Ruchi Fatuch, a Fatah official who met for talks with Hamas while on the delegation led by Jibril Rajoub. He said that the delay in presenting Palestinian reconciliation harms the national interest. Fatuch also hinted at Hamas‚Äô responsibility and said that while Fatah agrees with what was agreed in the ‚ÄúIstanbul document‚Äù, it is other factors that are holding back Palestinian unity.
It was agreed at a meeting of Fatah and Hamas leaders in Istanbul that elections would be held for the Palestinian Legislative Council and then for the presidency and the Palestinian National Council of the PLO.
Fatuch added in an interview with Palestinian television that the election is expected to take place using the proportional representation method and that the electoral threshold is only one and a half percent, which is intended to encourage all Palestinian factions.
On the other hand, Fatah also claims that senior officials, including Colonel Majed Faraj, the head of intelligence, fear a decline in their status in light of Rajoub‚Äôs rise to power if he succeeds in this move with Hamas.
Along with the contacts for the elections, Fatah is also working on the establishment of joint committees for all factions that will operate under a unified national headquarters to expand the popular struggle against Israel. These contacts on behalf of Fatah and Abu Mazen, are being conducted by Fatah‚Äôs number two, Mahmoud El Alul. In recent months, he has convened a number of meetings to formulate the popular struggle, which he promised that it would concentrate on the settlers‚Äô movement on the main routes and in clashes with IDF soldiers.
However, a senior Fatah official says that Abu Mazen is not pushing his people, since in any case, his tendency is not to take irreversible steps before the election results in the United States become clear. A senior Palestinian officer reinforces this and says that Abu Mazen is taking his time to preserve all available options.
A PA source told TPS that there is a principled agreement with Hamas that only Abu Mazen will run for the presidency.
Nevertheless, Hani al-Masri, a researcher at the Masarat Institute, recommended not to go to elections under a new US administration led by Joe Biden, as this is likely to strengthen Hamas‚Äô power, in line with Obama‚Äôs Middle East policy.
Meanwhile, a Palestinian team of researchers published its conclusions on the issue of unity and stated that if elections are held before an agreement is reached on Palestinian reconciliation, it will be a step of suicide for the Palestinian Authority. The team assumes that the most likely scenario is a continuation of the split, but that a scenario of the collapse of the Palestinian Authority is also possible, in light of recent developments.problem of evil

Where I‚Äôm From.
Home for me is more,
than glossy paged brochures,
It‚Äôs Hungry. tired. equally glossy smiles of men.
Dreadlocked hair to back, sitting on hand whittled stool,
the same hands that touch you. They are rough, black.
Hoping that you will spare the almighty, spare salvation
the Dollar.
Home for me is more than the white powder sand
on perfect beach. You captured, safe behind your nikon.
Home for me is rough,
like the hands of women tired of their burden.
It‚Äôs bananas carried like salvation,
carried like the poor carry hope.
bundled close to their breast.
Hope that some day that chariot will swing lo.
Hope that your children won‚Äôt pick
Green gold
from trees
bent like your back,
bent with the burden of their own fruit.
Hope that one day he‚Äôs comin‚Äô for to carry me home.
I come from a place
where sometimes all you have is
grandmothers prayers and mothers tears.
bondye ban mweh kouraj
God give me strength.
sometimes that‚Äôs all you have
Hope.
Home for me is men
who rose from sugar cane to lead a country out of oppression with nothing but hope.
Home for me is proud.
Home for me 100 proof
that burns all the way down.
I come from a place where men drink their paychecks
and themselves into ruin.
where our tongues roll like our
hips to the rhythm
of drums in our chests.
I come from a place of unapologetic enjoyment
where you learn to dance before you walk.
where your waist move independent.
I come from soca calypso and country
It‚Äôs hot and sweet and thick and tastes like home.
Home for me is heads never bowed, mouths always smiling and words that curl and twist.
Home for me is white powder sand on perfect beach, you captured, safe, behind your Nikon.
Home for me is hungry. tired. equally glossy smiles of men.
Dreadlocked hair to back, sitting on hand whittled stool,
the same hands that touch you. They are rough, black.
Hoping that you will spare the almighty, spare salvation
the Dollar.
Home for me may not always be pretty
but it‚Äôs always beautiful.

This article hopes to break down some of the mysteries of the keyboard and allow you to fully appreciate its usage.
The capslock key serves a useful purpose. If you need to type several capital letters at once, it lets you do this. Simply press once to turn on capitals, and press again to turn them off. Off is important. Usually a light will appear on your keyboard to inform you of the status. If you're not sure which one, if your typing LOOKS LIKE THIS, you really should press it again.
If you want only one capital letter, the shift key is what you need. Hold down shift, and without letting go, press the key you want. This also lets you access the funny symbols on the top of some keys.
Now you know how to use a keyboard, there's NO NEED TO SHOUT, and no need to avoid all punctuation and proper capitalisation. Enjoy your newfound freedom behind the keyboard. Write a novel! Complain to a newspaper! Don't look like a total moron in chatrooms!

The state‚Äôs largest city, Des Moines, is spending millions to repair or replace four downtown bridges. Planners also want to broaden the last section of U.S. Highway 20 into four lanes spanning the entire state.
But amid the orange traffic cones and construction signs, something surprising is happening to Iowa‚Äôs transportation system.
It‚Äôs actually getting smaller as state and county agencies quietly give up on maintaining many rural roads and bridges to spend on bigger, more essential projects in busier areas. The same pattern is playing out across the country, provoking growing fears in rural areas and elsewhere that the trade-off could make it even harder to eke out a living in many places where opportunity is already limited.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only so much money, so you need to prioritize,‚Äù David Carroll, engineer for Warren County, just south of Des Moines, said of the roads and bridges built decades ago. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living off our grandparents and great-grandparents right now.‚Äù
Now farmers have to drive miles out of their way to reach their fields, and once-simple errands have become cumbersome cross-country trips. In Louisiana, college students persist in using a closed bridge to get to campus, despite warnings that it could collapse.
Rural Areas
Rural communities complain that they are being shortchanged in favor of cities.
During the last five years, Warren County has permanently closed 20 bridges over small streams, with more likely to come. Current budgets can‚Äôt possibly pay to maintain every road or bridge built over the last six decades, according to transportation officials.
‚ÄúDoes that mean the system is going to shrink? Yes,‚Äù said Paul Trombino, head of the Iowa Department of Transportation and president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
The county of 50,000 relies on farming for much of its economy. If farmers can‚Äôt haul equipment to their fields or harvested crops to market, they can‚Äôt make a living.
Duane Ohnemus and his wife, Mary Jo, raise cattle, corn, and soybeans on 1,500 acres that their family has owned for more than a century. But they are having trouble just getting around their land because of the closure of one small bridge and load limits on others.
Ohnemus must take a 4-mile detour to check on cattle or take equipment to his crops. And since the bridge closed, the remaining dirt road has not been maintained. The weight limits mean he‚Äôs tempting fate whenever he rumbles across other bridges in his three-quarter-ton pickup. When moving his tractor or combine, he has to choose routes carefully.
‚ÄúThey need to come up with some sort of alternative,‚Äù Ohnemus said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hardly run a business.‚Äù
Billions for Highways
A similar situation has taken shape in King County, Washington, where more than $3 billion is being spent to replace an elevated highway in Seattle with a tunnel carrying a double-deck roadway..
Mayor Tony Grider said the closure has pushed more bicyclists onto the highway, cut off homes on the other side of the bridge, and blocked the entire town for up to a half hour when one of the 20 daily trains needs to stop.
He acknowledges the need for Seattle‚Äôs massive tunnel project but said residents wonder why money is available for that project and not their bridge.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking for nickels and dimes, and we‚Äôre paying taxes like everyone else,‚Äù he said.
Residents contest the estimate that reconnecting the bridge would cost $19 million. But even if the bill were lower, county officials said, it would be hard to justify spending much money on a road that is typically used by only about 100 vehicles each day.
If a funding solution isn‚Äôt found, more roads will probably close.
Budget and Closures
‚ÄúThe money isn‚Äôt there, and when things become unsafe, we‚Äôll close them,‚Äù said Brenda Bauer, the county‚Äôs road services director.
In Lafayette, Louisiana, Public Works Director Kevin Blanchard said he‚Äôs closed three bridges. Another three are in ‚Äúrough shape‚Äù and might not pass their next inspection.. The bridge is in such poor condition that ‚Äúthe whole thing could come down,‚Äù Blanchard said.
To save money, he said, agencies might consider turning some roads over to private users, no longer taking public ownership of new roads in housing subdivisions or even removing some roads.
Transportation officials have long known that state and local governments could not afford to maintain all the suburban growth that boomed after World War II, said Charles Marohn, a professional engineer who heads a Minnesota-based group called Strong Towns.
Today they must make tough choices about what to repair and what to abandon, he said. The key question is: What are they willing to pay for?
‚ÄúWe built the road network because that‚Äôs what we needed at the time, and it cost a whole lot of money,‚Äù said John Harvey, chairman of a transportation technology organization at the University of California‚ÄìDavis. ‚ÄúNow we need to all be in agreement about what the future road network should do.‚ÄùWatch Online Tera Yaar Hoon Main 25th October 2021 Full Episode 296 Live by SonyLiv Video, Sab Tv Serial Tera Yaar Hoon Main Latest Today Full Episodes Complete Show in Hd, Desi Serial Tera Yaar Hoon Main 25th October 2021 is Presented by Indian Hindi Drama Channel Apne Tv in High Quality.

After a major renovation, this former dairy farm was converted from 2005 to 2007 into a farmhouse with a six spacious, tastefully decorated guest rooms at the rear on the ground floor and on the first floor. In the morning we serve a tasty, vegetarian breakfast buffet.
The comfortable beds (2.20 m. long, of high quality!) guarantee a perfect night‚Äôs sleep. Sleeping in a, so called, ‚Äòbedstee‚Äô? That‚Äôs also possible! Two rooms, in addition to the regular beds, also have a ‚Äòbedstee‚Äô, which means a bed behind doors, like in old times.
For disabled people, a spacious room on the ground floor has been realized. The farm is located by the water. It is wonderful to stay on the terrace for hours on beautiful summer evenings.
Our accommodation is also very suitable for friends or family groups (max. 12-15 persons).
Guests who arrive by boat can moor their boat at our own quay. This possibility also exists for canoeists and rowers thanks to a low-lying rowing deck. In the vicinity, several restaurants (e.g. by boat) are easy to reach, for example in Warten itself, Eernewoude or Leeuwarden.
For more than ten years we have been a familiar address for people who long to have a short holiday!

This afternoon‚Äôs Apple event offered further hints that the much-hyped product has disappointed.
No one outside Apple knows how many Apple Watches the company has sold since the product was released this past April, but in recent months there have been signs that sales have been disappointing.
On Apple‚Äôs August earnings call, Tim Cook was cagey about reporting concrete sales numbers for the Apple Watch, opting instead to include them in the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category that includes Beats headphones, the iPod, and other accessories. And in July, a key Taiwanese parts supplier for the Apple Watch reported lower-than-expected volume for the third quarter, and low expectations for the fourth.
This afternoon‚Äôs Apple event offered further hints that the much-hyped watch has disappointed. The first has to do with sequencing. As the first product discussed, the Apple Watch was the undercard, the warm-up act for Apple‚Äôs more popular offerings. More notable, though, was the substantively fuzzy, but otherwise extravagant language Apple executives used when discussing the watch. ‚ÄúFor many people, the Apple Watch has been life-changing!‚Äù Cook said at one point. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on an incredible pace of innovation!‚Äù
Apple usually likes to point to tangible successes when introducing its products. When Cook started in on his iPhone pitch, he led with its swelling international market share, bragging about growth in emerging markets, especially China. ‚ÄúThese are the most popular phones in the world!‚Äù he said.
We didn't hear numbers like that during the Apple Watch presentation, although Cook did say that customer satisfaction with the watch was ‚Äúan incredible 97 percent.‚Äù That figure comes from a survey conducted by Wristly back in July that found 66 percent of Apple Watch owners ‚Äúvery satisfied‚Äù with their purchase, and 31 percent ‚Äúsomewhat satisfied.‚Äù
The worst moment came after Cook brought Jeff Williams onstage to explain Apple‚Äôs forthcoming updates to the watch. Williams seemed nervous throughout his presentation. After a guest demo'd a new medical feature, he asked twice, and with more than a hint of desperation, ‚ÄúIsn't that great?!‚Äù
Maybe that‚Äôs unfair. It‚Äôs tough to pitch any product in front of the entire tech press, and a decent portion of its high-end consumers. But remember, the Apple Watch is the first flagship product released during Tim Cook‚Äôs reign at Apple. If the sales are weak, you have to wonder what the internal meetings are like. Especially since, compared with today‚Äôs iPad, Apple TV, and iPhone presentations, the Apple Watch segment just seemed thirsty.Hours of Operation

678-505-3906The human race is an interesting assortment of creatures. While we are all basically identical in our core fundamentals- especially when discussing our physical attributes- we also differ greatly in virtually every aspect of our psychological build.
There are, however, certain instances where the entire human race mirrors the same psychological tendencies. There is one tendency in particular that I have in mind- one that I was only able to truly grasp after the world‚Äôs most recent literary phenomenon: 50 Shades Of Grey. Here it is, my great epiphany: At the innermost core of every person on this planet lies a slumbering, insatiable nymphomaniac.
Not so surprised? That‚Äôs probably because your inner nymphomaniac has been awoken some time ago and has been running rampant ever since. Not everyone is so lucky. For the rest of those that have yet to meet their better, more exciting half- I promise you, that little devil is in there. We have all heard the male stereotype that every man is after one thing and one thing only, sex.
Well, that‚Äôs true. But I realized something after several weeks of riding the 6 train and watching women of all shapes and ages reading, rather living, E. L. James‚Äô literary pornography; women- all women- are just as sexual as men. And what‚Äôs even better, because most of them have been keeping their inner-freak tame, now that many of them have let lose, they are all starving.
But I digress. I‚Äôm not writing this article to share with you my joy from realizing that I now have an endless variety of kinky females to play with. I‚Äôm writing this article in hopes that those of you that have yet to unleash your bad side will come to realize that you will be better off doing so; it‚Äôs only natural.
Let‚Äôs look at this from a biological standpoint. Human beings are the most evolved living things on this planet. We surpass each and every other living thing in terms of intellect- but nevertheless, we are, and will always remain, just animals.
Our survival depends on one thing and one thing alone: procreation. In order to keep the race going we must reproduce. That‚Äôs what animals do. They mate, and they mate often. We are biologically structured in a way where we feel a naturally need to, pardon my French, fuck.
So why in the world are we suppressing this urge? I‚Äôm not necessarily speaking of going around and sleeping with anything that walks on two legs; but if you are already going to get down and dirty, why not really get down and dirty? Why not bring out the chains, whips, and oils and play dungeon?
Why wait until you get home and comfortable? Find a somewhat hidden corner and let loose. Get together with some of your closest friends (or maybe not so close friends) and skip the Wednesday night movie- have an orgy instead.
This is the 21st century and for all we know the world really may end in two weeks. There‚Äôs no time to waste behaving yourself. Be the sexual monster that you were born to be. We are coming to an age where judgment and ridicule is slowly starting to dissipate- for both sexes.
Granted, the progress is slower for one sex in particular- but since when is it right for other peoples‚Äô judgmental bullshit to prevent you from reaching the best you that you can be? Like it or not, the true you isn‚Äôt the good little schoolgirl; it‚Äôs the naughty teacher that has her students spank her with her own ruler.
We are all sexual predators- nymphomaniacs. The sooner the world comes to accept this, the sooner we can let go of all the false beliefs we associate with each individual sex. Don‚Äôt judge. Just fuck.

Going into this project, I wanted to DIY everything possible because it give me so much joy to do so. This girl loves a good challenge.
I was able to do just that with the exception of the hardware and fixtures gifted to me by Pfister.
I reached out to Pfister for a collaboration on this project after falling madly in love with the sleek and modern design of their Contempra series.
This wasn‚Äôt my first experience using Pfister. At the beginning of this year, we updated the faucet in our kitchen and went with their brushed gold Stellen faucet. Check it out!!!
Performance is everything when it come to plumbing fixtures but I am also a sucker for style and that‚Äôs why I love everything about my Pfister faucet!
Now back to the bathroom:
I decided to start small by transforming the tile work using nothing but tile grout renew I found through Home Depot.
Painting the grout from white to black majorly updated this space and, the best
From there, my next area of focus went to the chrome shower frame. I had always wanted a black shower frame. For the longest time, I thought I‚Äôd have to save up an enormous amount of money before I could even think about getting a new shower surround.
I decided to do some research and see if it was possible to paint the frame myself. Come to find out, spray painting shower frames is a thing so I had to give it a go.
Little did I know how much prep work was involved but, gosh, it turned out amazing. By the way, it has been holding up great so far!
Check out my Instagram highlight covering all the details on the shower frame makeover here.
Once the shower frame was finished, I gave the walls a fresh coat of paint. Doing so made the biggest difference in giving this room a fresh feel.
The gray vanity wasn‚Äôt doing it for me so I gave it a pop of color. I decided to go crazy and paint it ‚ÄúBarberry‚Äù by Benjamin Moore. No regrets!!!
I also wanted a new look for the cabinet doors so I made and attached new panels to cover the previous design. The knobs were a bit of a splurge for me but I am obsessed with the style it contributes to this vanity.
Next, I swapped out the mirror, lights, and faucets. Still can‚Äôt get over the difference it made!
I struggled finding a way fill the wall space above the toilet for MONTHS. It was maddening for me! I didn‚Äôt want to do shelves above the toilet because I preferred them over the bathtub.
Thankfully, I came across some great tutorials for DIY propagation planters on Pinterest. I knew it would be the perfect solution for this odd corner. They were also quick and easy to make‚Ä¶even better!
This bathroom use to irk the fire out of me every time I entered. Today, it gives me a sense of peace and calm.
I‚Äôve never enjoyed my bath time more!!!
What is your favorite feature? Comment and let me know!

When I started to work at LiveChat, teamwork became a part of my life for good. Although my writing job forces me to work alone most of the time and I always look for a quiet place in the office, I can still appreciate good teamwork.
I believe people can only achieve big things by having a great team to work with. I guess my opinion is shared by all the companies I‚Äôd like to present to you today. Otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt show off all of their employees, especially when in some cases there are 100 of them.
Once I saw these creative team pages, I knew I have to let you know about them. So here they are. The most creative and fun to watch "meet the team pages" I found online.
RJMetrics team page - simple but effective
RJMetrics builds data infrastructure and analytics software to help businesses make smarter decisions with their data. Their team page is simple but effective.
They are also funny, try moving your cursor over a picture. I did - can you see who stands out?
Once you click on them, you can read more of their responsibilities and what they like to do in their free time.
Kickstarter ‚Äì I like the look of it
I like the look of Kickstarter‚Äôs team page. Especially when you scroll it down through all the employees ‚Äì it just looks cool!
What‚Äôs nice is that you can group employees by their interests. For example we have: Artists, Bicyclists, Gamers, Hackers, Poets and Writers. The one category that stole my heart is Dogs: There are 12 dogs with names, pictures and the description like: "Basil commutes to work with Miguel.‚Äù
Lateral - what a compatibility
Team members have different opinions sometimes, but there‚Äôs one thing they always agree on ‚Äì the direction of their company‚Äôs growth. Well maybe that‚Äôs too big of a metaphor. Anyway, Lateral doesn‚Äôt look like they have a problem with it, I mean looking at the same direction. They seem super agreed.
I put my cursor on ‚ÄúA Passionate Team‚Äù caption, check out their faces.
If you want to see their full potential, go to their website and play a little with the cursor. Then, try some keys on your keyboard ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äús‚Äù, ‚Äúd‚Äù, ‚Äúf‚Äù and so on.
Also, I like how one person stands out from the crowd when you hover the cursor over them. What I miss though is some sort of information about employees.
Etch - glorify each teammember
I like the description and the design of this team page. The team at Etch is small so I believe that‚Äôs what allowed them to glorify each team member. First you have a short description: 3 developers, 2 designers, and 1 person counting the pennies.
When you click on a person, you go to a nicely designed website with personal photographs, private pictures and favourite quotes. That‚Äôs how we know that Anna likes Gerberas. I don‚Äôt know about you but I already think that I know her a little more.
Cloud Horizon - who you wanted to be as a child?
This is one nostalgic team page. First, we have a short history of a company and right beneath we have something that seems normal at first: grey pictures of employees and their positions. But when you hover the cursor over a picture, you can see the pictures reveal the past ‚Äì and suddenly everything is clear.
We see a person's image as a child and who they wanted to be as grown ups! For example we have a Creative Director who wanted to be a Ghostbuster. Or a Chief Technology Officer who wanted to be a cowboy. Ihaa!
Etsy ‚Äì show yourself
It takes a lot of people to build such a resilient platform like Etsy. But the company didn‚Äôt think that they have too many employees to not show their faces on a team page. That‚Äôs usually what corporations do. They make you feel anonymous. But being on a team page is good for employee motivation and for the brand itself.
LiveChat ‚Äì share the passion
I can‚Äôt help myself and I need to mention our team page here as well. In my opinion it's one of the most creative team pages out there. Yes I could be lacking objectivity. But check it out for yourself.
On our team page we show the people behind LiveChat and their passions. There‚Äôs a lot of scrolling down, since we are constantly building our team, but everyone has their place, which is nice.
You may also wonder why our CEO?. It‚Äôs an animation where can see the people moving. So it‚Äôs a quick insight into their lives.
For example we can see Regan Starr playing a guitar like an actual rock star, or Jess Byrne riding a skateboard while watching something on his laptop ‚Äì what a multitasking. Impressive!
ABZ Creative Partners ‚Äì what quote describes you?
It‚Äôs one of the nicest team pages to read. Each employee has their own photo with added drawings on it. Besides that, they have a short description of what they do in a fun and creative way.
Each description starts with the quote that I suppose a person uses a lot and which describes them well: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a typo in this brochure, I can feel it‚Äù ‚Äì Accountant or ‚ÄúSo I was thinking about our SEO in the shower this morning‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì Digital Strategist.
Team page vs teamwork
Sometimes people put a lot of money, work and time into creating great meet the team page. But does it mean they will automatically have great teamwork? Not really. Great teamwork is hard to achieve and requires a lot of compromises. But whoever managed to achieve it knows it was worth the effort. And the team page? It‚Äôs just a great addition.
If you know any other team pages worth mentioning, spread the word in the comment section. Let‚Äôs inspire each other.

Oh, cool! Love the pocket idea with the article. What a momento!With the continuous threat of the far-right to peace and security in our society and the increase of Islamophobic hate crimes against the British Muslim community, an Islamophobia conference was organised in Wakefield.
The conference began with short speeches by Kauser Jan, assistant headteacher at a primary school in Leeds, Cllr Denise Jeffery, leader of Wakefield Council, Imran Hussain, Member of Parliament for Bradford East, Qari Asim, Imam at Makkah Mosque in Leeds and Dr Ajmal Hussain, assistant professor of sociology at the university of Warwick.
Attendees at the conference then had an opportunity to join one of four workshops to share their thoughts and discuss the issue of Islamophobia as a group. The four workshops were:
‚Äì Trade Union Movement and Islamophobia
‚Äì Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
‚Äì Dissent, Resistance and Participation
‚Äì Youth and Islamophobia
Finally, the conference ended with closing speeches by Damien Miller, temporary assistant chief constable for West Yorkshire Police and Richard Burgon, Member of Parliament for Leeds East.
There were also numerous stalls at the conference by supporting organisations such as Unite the Union, West Yorkshire Police, Stop the War Coalition, National Education Union and MEND. The stalls gave an opportunity to the attendees to learn more about the organisations and also benefit from the numerous resources offered by them to assist in the tackling of Islamophobia.
A huge well done to the organisers.Sponsored Listings

Congressman Jared Polis, one of several Democrats running for governor, released an education plan for the state Wednesday that includes new details on tackling teacher shortages and better preparing high school students for work.
The Boulder Democrat wants to help school districts build affordable housing for teachers, increase teacher pay and make sure that ‚Äú100 percent of Colorado‚Äôs school districts are able to offer dual and concurrent enrollment programs through an associate‚Äôs degree or professional certification, and work to boost enrollment in them.‚Äù
The education plan includes the congressman‚Äôs initial campaign promise to deliver free and universal preschool and kindergarten.
‚ÄúPart of my frustration is that politicians have been talking about preschool and kindergarten for decades,‚Äù Polis said in an interview with Chalkbeat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to stop talking ‚Ä¶ and actually do it.‚Äù
Big questions remain, however, about how Colorado would pay for Polis‚Äôs plans.
Free universal preschool and kindergarten would cost hundreds of millions of tax dollars the state does not have. Polis has acknowledged that voters will need to approve a tax increase to secure the funding necessary ‚Äî and voters rejected Colorado‚Äôs last big statewide ask to fund education initiatives.
His additional promises, especially providing schools with more money to pay teachers, only adds to the price tag for his education plan. The campaign did not release any projections of how much his teacher pay raise proposal would cost.
‚ÄúIf a teacher can‚Äôt afford to live in the community they work in, that is not going to be an attractive profession,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to do a better job in Colorado making sure teachers are rewarded for their hard work.‚Äù
Other components to Polis‚Äôs plan includes providing student loan relief for teachers who commit to serving in high-need and rural areas, increasing teacher training and building and renovating more.
Polis is the latest Democrat to roll out an education platform.
Former state Sen. Michael Johnston released more details earlier this week about his campaign promise for tuition-free community college and job training.
Johnston‚Äôs campaign estimates that the initiative would cost about $47 million annually. The campaign provided specifics on how the state would pay for it: by combining existing federal grants and state scholarships, revenue from online sales tax, and state workforce development funding. Savings from volunteer hours put in by tuition recipients also are factored in.
Former state Treasurer Cary Kennedy released her education plan last month.
Like Polis, Kennedy is calling for teacher raises. She wants the state‚Äôs average salary to be closer to the national average. The former state treasurer also wants to expand preschool and job training for high school students. A key piece of Kennedy‚Äôs proposal to pay for her initiatives: reforming the state‚Äôs tax laws to generate more revenue.
Other Democrats running to replace Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is term-limited, include Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne and businessman Noel Ginsburg.
The Republican field to replace Hickenlooper, a Democrat, is also crowded. Attorney General Cynthia Coffman announced earlier this month that she‚Äôs running. Other leading Republican candidates include former Congressman Tom Tancredo, state Treasurer Walker Stapleton, and businessmen Doug Robinson and Victor Mitchell. George Brauchler, district attorney for the 18th Judicial District, dropped out of the race to instead run for attorney general.

understand and get it. He was a legend both in and out of the
ring.
"When I saw Buddy Roberts take the mark by the arm out of the
Polo Park Inn (Winnipeg), I knew it was trouble." remembered Dan
Denton, then a youngster in the AWA. "I kept telling him to just
apologize to Roberts, because things could get ugly. He kept saying
f-u.I could see Gordy coming out of the bar towards us, but the
guy couldn't. If he had, he might have decided to apologize. Once
Terry got to him, that option was removed."
Here are 5 favorite TV moments and why Gordy was so great. I hope
I get the years correct.
1)World Class 1983- Gordy was to face NWA Champ Ric Flair at the
Sportatorium. That night a new wrestler had debuted straight out
of the Florida territory (where the Aptermags had given him a
monster push) with a new name. WCCW was going to do elevate Billy
Jack (with the Haynes now added in honor of his sick father) to
the top of the program.
(Trivia note- he defeated a very young and skinny Sean Michaels,
who was introduced as Sean Nickels, in a very funny 2 minute match).
As Marc Lowrence introduced them, Haynes came into the ring accompanied
by his manager, Sunshine. He asked to challenge the winner for
the NWA title. Gordy shook his hand. Flair waved him off and beckened
for Sunshine. In a hilarious speech, Flair said he'd always gotten
what he wanted - fly in jet planes,drive fast cars, beat the Von
Erichs (thunderous boos), but the one thing he always wanted and
never had was Sunshine." Just one kiss..." Meanwhile, Gordy watched
from the corner.
She agreed to kiss Flair, and when he asked how was it, she slapped
him. Flair sold it, the match started with Gordy afire and the
people really thought that the angle was going to lead to a Gordy
upset. In this bout, though too short, Gordy matwrestled with
Flair and did not look out of his league at all.
Gordy's frustration after being small-packaged while going for
the Figure Four on Flair told the story of a guy who had his chance
and got out-smarted by a rattled Flair. This was a wasted opportunity
because Haynes blew the territory after 2 weeks and thus the match
served as a backdrop to nothing.
2) Fall 1984 WWF Maple Leaf Wrestling The Freebirds vs Moondog
Spot Moondog Rex and Silent Brain Macnee.
This was also a big deal, the Freebirds were viewed as a major
signing with Dave Woolf in their corner music deals, New York,
New York... booked as babyfaces, the Moondogs were recent former
WWF champs and tried to keep from being eaten up, abandoning Macnee
to be pinned after a triple drop kick- yep,Hayes and Gordy and
Roberts too- knocked all 3 down like bowling pins. This WWF experience
lasted, I think, 1 week.
3)AWA TV Tapings 1985- The Freebirds had finally come to the AWA
and with babyfaces like Greg Gagne being shoved down the people's
throats who needs heels? Certainly not the fans of Winnipeg, who
were not unlike the Baltimore crowds in that they would reject
the booker very vocally, and did so in this case. When 3 jobbers,
one of whom was a well liked older rookie named Drew Tossel(who
looked like a skinny Mr. Clean), waited in the ring, the buzz
started in the school gym.
There was only 1 real 3 man team in the AWA, they had just gotten
to the AWA and YESSS the music came up and it was the Freebirds,
cheered like babyfaces despite being booked as heels. The crowd
was especially into the huge Gordy. The marks started screaming
for Tossel to "Abandon your team!Leave!Save yourself!". His partners
were not amused.
Roberts and Gordy were cracking up in the corner. Sure enough
Gordy got tagged in and the fans went nuts, turning it into a
hot tag. Gordy began beating on Tossel,and the fans chanted "not
him, not him."
Suddenly Baldy got tossed from the ring. The fans cheered Gordy
for not pinning Tossel but one of the other jobbers. The fans
saw the Freebirds as true superstars, and refused to boo them.
This was a sign the AWA was in serious trouble, as the fans wanted
tweeners and the AWA reserved that role for Mad Dog Vachon.
4) UWF Fall 1986- I think it was from Lake Charles, LA, in a prime
example of why UWF/Bill Watts was the best TV of the time. Scandor
Akbar called out Gordy, and with Michael Hayes screaming " Terry.
No" from the color spot beside Jim Ross, Bam Bam came down the
aisle and tore into One Man Gang. In this fued, the Freebirds
were in a promotion that understood tweeners, so when Jeff Gaylord
and Terry Taylor and the other babyfaces came out to quell the
brawl, the Birds could prolong it by punching everybody. Which,
of course, the fans loved.
5) June 1992 TBS CLASH - NWA Tag Team Tournament. Gordy and partner
Steve Williams were booked against Australian promoter Larry O'Day
and his son Jeff, in what was his maybe 10th match. The Australians
got in the tourney as a reward for voting with Bill Watts in his
NWA takeover.
This was not a good idea, if your name was O'Day. They actually
tried a double team move but it was not to be. Gordy and Williams
beat on the old man, who looked like 60, and beat the snot out
of the clearly scared second generation also-ran. It was the best
2 minutes of the nite, we laughed hysterically.
Truth be told, any WCW TV squash match from that era with Williams
and Gordy is a good lesson for all those young guys who don't
know how lucky they are to even be in a ring. They made everyone
believe. That is what made Gordy great.
I recommend Gordy vs. Raven in ECW 1996,it had a good backstory
and unreal crowd heat. It was booked to conceal Gordy's health
problems and Raven's broken foot. They had a million run-ins and
Gordy looked like Superman while still doing the job.We understand that this time can be especially difficult for those of us that are in recovery or suffer from anxiety or depression, as being isolated exacerbates these issues.

Paul‚Äôs letter to the Ephesians pictures this relationship in two different ways.
First, every believer is a member of the Body of Christ. His Body has many members, each of which is essential. Paul says that every member of the Body must grow up and work)
Second, the people of God are growing into a temple for the habitation of God.
)
If the Body of Christ is to become mature and the temple is to be built as a dwelling place for God, every individual Christian must be committed to building up each other. Edification is the biblical term for this process (Eph. 4:12), which.
- ‚ÄúLet no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.‚Äù (Eph. 4:29)
We so easily speak to one another words that hurt, criticize, or tear down, or that are just plain useless. Rather, we ought to build each other up with words of grace‚Äîthe right choice of words spoken at the right time with the right spirit. Words of grace minister to others and meet their needs. These words express love, encouragement, acceptance, and affirmation. Which of us is not built up in our spirit when we hear genuine words like these?
- ‚ÄúI appreciate you.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúGod has used you to minister to me.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThank you for your selfless ministry.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI have noticed the way God is changing this area of your life and I am rejoicing with you about it.‚Äù
- Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave. ‚ÄúLove one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor‚Äù (Rom. 12:10). ‚ÄúLet each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others‚Äù (Phil. 2:4). This kind of love demonstrates the spirit of Christ by seeking for ways to serve others and being willing to be inconvenienced in order to meet the needs of others. ‚ÄúThrough love serve one another‚Äù (Gal. 5:13).
- And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works . . . encourage others to be effective for Christ.
- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. (Col. 3:16)
Every believer needs to personally know the Word of God, not only for his own growth, but that he might minister to others as well. Each of us needs the teaching and admonishing ministry of Spirit-filled believers. And each of us must be actively engaged in building the lives of others with biblical truth that has been ‚Äúput to work‚Äù and validated in our own lives.
Sometimes this means we must be willing to confront a brother or sister about an area of his or her life that doesn‚Äôt conform to Scripture (Rom. 15:14; Gal. 6:1; Matt. 18:15). Such admonition must always be gentle, loving, and humble, as we recognize love for me. We must learn how to be sensitive to those who are carrying burdens. We need to practice expressing care and concern through listening, praying, encouraging, and shouldering the burden ourselves whenever possible.
There are many more ‚Äúone anothers‚Äù in Scripture.
- ‚ÄúDo not speak evil against one another.‚Äù (James 4:11)
- ‚ÄúDo not grumble against one another.‚Äù (James 5:9)
- ‚ÄúConfess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed.‚Äù (James 5:16)
None of us can become spiritually mature if we are not committed to let others build our lives and to build the lives of others.
God gave Jonathan a special ministry of edification in David‚Äôs life. Jonathan loved David as his own life. They exchanged a lifetime commitment to meet the needs of each other‚Äôs families. When King Saul was searching for David in order to take his life, Jonathan came to David and helped him find strength in God (1 Sam. 23:16). Years later, in the absence of Jonathan, David once again faced a very difficult situation. This time, ‚ÄúDavid strengthened himself in the LORD his God‚Äù(1 Sam. 30:6). You see, Jonathan was a life-builder. God used him to develop David to spiritual maturity.
Whose life are you committed to build up with the ‚Äúone anothers‚Äù of Scripture?

One of the best places where you can speak to is the Maldives. The Maldives is really a collection of 7,000 islands and is stretched over 1,200 distance. It is located just below India and the actual it is that it is very sparsely populated.

First on my best island pursuit. Hawaii. I think it‚Äôs a relatively safe bet that everyone has heard of the particular one. Beautiful volcanic Maldives islands situated on pacific sea. With amazing surf, diving, beaches, unique culture. What is there not to enjoy here. Perhaps having to make this wonderful island cloud nine. I love the stunning background of super steep hills running in order to the coastline. Amazing beauty. As a popular tourist destination accommodation for many budget ranges can definitely be found.
There are several places to discover when you come to Maldives. Realizing what‚Äôs good find many museums and attracting features while you visit. Primary reason attraction of this island is the unique beaches and the underwater caverns. The beaches are really filled with stunning beauty and crystal like pond. All the beaches really are part belonging to the Indian Ocean but when you‚Äôre visit them separately you will have the other experience every time. It is lovely to see the sunset and sunrise symptomatic beaches.
Next day, my friend ‚Äòprepared‚Äô lunch for both of us. Though has been awful, I have done not drone.

Of course, everyone‚Äôs favourite duo are back, because at this point it wouldn‚Äôt be a proper Stokie Christmas without them. For this years‚Äô Cinderella performance, Jonathan Wilkes will star as Buttons in his 15th Regent Theatre panto, joined by the ‚Äòbest dame in the business‚Äô, honourary Potteries panto star Christian Patterson, who finds himself in the city for the 11th year running as Baroness Hardup.
Jonny Wilkes said: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to return to my hometown for Cinderella, and to bring panto back to Stoke after such a long time. It‚Äôs been a long wait, but we‚Äôre thrilled we‚Äôre able to go ahead this year and have been busy thinking up all sorts of hilarious plans to make this panto our best one yet.‚Äù
Welsh-born Christian and Stoke‚Äôs very own Jonny will star alongside Kai Owen and Naomi Slights in the laugh-out-loud comedy ‚Äì produced by Crossroads Pantomimes ‚Äì from Friday, December 10 to Sunday, January 2.

Cinderella will feature all of the madcap mayhem the Potteries‚Äô pair have become best known for, with spectacular special effects, stunning song and dance and plenty of audience participation.
Frazer Hoyle, Theatre Director of the Regent Theatre and Victoria Hall said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ecstatic to be able to invite Jonny and Christian back this year. After missing out on panto last year, it hasn‚Äôt been the same without them and we can‚Äôt wait to see what they have in store for us all in Cinderella!‚Äù
And if you still need convincing, here are eight reasons you should watch Cinderella at The Regent Theatre this Christmas.
The cast
I‚Äôve said year after year that the chemistry between the cast on stage is unbeatable, making for an effortlessly funny show built on friendship and trust. Christian and Kai have known each other for 20 years, alongside Jonny, the three of them just bounce off each other.
Kai said: ‚ÄúWe have the best dame in the business with Christian Patterson and the best frontman in Jonny Wilkes. They know what they‚Äôre doing and the panto is in the hands of masters.
‚ÄúI get to work with my best friend, Christian, and Jonny who I‚Äôve known for seven years, so we‚Äôre all really big best mates. Jonny knows what Christian is going to say, Christian knows what Jonny is going to say and visa versa with me and them two ‚Äì and I trust them, and that‚Äôs a huge thing on stage. All the ingredients are there.‚Äù
Cinderella is Burton-born Naomi‚Äôs second time in The Regent Theatre panto, following the success of her role in Sleeping Beauty, in 2019. One of her favourite things about the show is ‚Äòthe guys‚Äô.
She said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre incredible and we‚Äôve had an absolute riot again for the launch, so that is number one top of the list of my favourite things about the panto. Hilarious banter, it‚Äôs going to be a party on stage.‚Äù
The laughs
Jonny and Christian always manage to ‚ÄòStokie‚Äô up the script for the annual panto, and for Cinderella, they‚Äôve had two years to write their gags ‚Äì so expect nothing but side splitting puns and punchlines for two hours straight.
Jonny said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been away for two years so more than ever we are raring to go. We‚Äôve got two years worth of gags, humour and everything going on. It‚Äôs going to be a big Stoke-on-Trent night in and we just cant wait to see people come along with a massive smile on their face. We will make sure we‚Äôve got the best show for you guys.‚Äù
Christian promised double trouble as Baroness Hardup, adding: ‚ÄúWe are going double hard to bring double the enjoyment, double the fun and we want double the laughs from the audience because it‚Äôs two years condensed into two hours.‚Äù
The surprises
From the Fanny Cam to 3D effects ‚Äì the sleeves of The Regent Theatre panto productions are always full to the armpit with tricks. Whilst the guys wouldn‚Äôt give much away, I‚Äôve been told that someone will be dressing up as a superhero, and that you ought to bring a brolly.
Kai warned: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be two hours of pure escapism, and whatever turmoil you‚Äôve been through over the last two years you‚Äôre going to have belly laughs and going to be soaked to the skin so bring your umbrellas.‚Äù

Jonny hinted at a spectacular costume change for one of the cast members ‚Äì I could take a good guess at who ‚Äì and said: ‚ÄúIf you like Avengers and superheroes, someone who is a good friend of mine is going to be donning a superhero outfit, and that‚Äôs worth the ticket price alone. But, from a magical point of view the end of act one is special.‚Äù
And there has even been surprises for Naomi, who is of course, cast as Cinders. She said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going above and beyond this year. I can not say too much, but what they‚Äôve told me I‚Äôm losing my mind over. There‚Äôs going to be incredible special effects, loads of surprises, surprises even for me ‚Äì I can‚Äôt wait. This Christmas is going to be really special.‚Äù
The old favourites
Stoke City supporters may find some content of the panto distressing, seeing as Jonny makes it no secret he‚Äôs a Valiant ‚Äì I suspect there might even be a quip at The Royal Family thrown in for good measure, too.
And a trip to the panto wouldn‚Äôt be complete without the annual celebration shout outs, particularly Beryl Smith‚Äôs ‚Äì we‚Äôre all waiting to see if she made it this year.
Now, Jonny and Christian simply wouldn‚Äôt crack on whether we would be treated to a rendition of Five Gold Rings with a set of bog rolls, or if they weren‚Äôt able to get their hands on any after pandemic panic buyers continue to wade through their tissue paper castles in the spare room. nearly two years on.
But it‚Äôs these old favourites that fail to get old, like your most-listened to Spotify track or the film you can recite backwards. Roll your eyes as much as you want, but you secretly love it.
The dancers
The ensemble are an incredibly talented bunch from Jonny‚Äôs own Wilkes Academy, and every year their execution of choreography and tricks is mesmerising. And for some of them, it‚Äôll likely be their first big production on stage in front of thousands of people that week.
Naomi said: ‚ÄúThe dancers are incredible. Some of the stuff you will see is world class, and it‚Äôs amazing that they get to have this experience too, through Jonny and his family.‚Äù
The outfits
Baroness Hardup dons a zebra print dress akin to one I have in my own wardrobe, which I adore. Christian‚Äôs outfits are always stellar, and there are usually a few outfit changes too.
And in a Cinderella story, there‚Äôs the iconic outfit change from rags to riches, so I‚Äôll be excited to see that ballgown transformation too.
The audience
A panto would be nothing without the audience shouting ‚ÄòAyup, me ducks‚Äô, and ‚Äòoh no it isn‚Äôt‚Äô, and the cast are just as excited to see bums on seats as they are to be on stage themselves.
Kai said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been an awful time, we wont dwell on that too much because everyone knows. Every year prior to that people would come for their Christmas treat and see the wonderful pantos here at The Regent Theatre. The loyalty that people show to the shows and the pantos is so appreciated and we always do our best to give them the best show possible for their hard earned money that they use.
‚ÄúWe have two years of pent up magic, laughs, mayhem and energy waiting, and if you doubt for one second that this isn‚Äôt going to be bigger and better than ever then you‚Äôre so wrong. This is going to be spectacular. I love Stoke-on-Trent and the people, and the welcome they give us. They‚Äôre the best audience I‚Äôve performed in front of.‚Äù
Christian added: ‚ÄúWe cant wait to see a full house of Stokie faces, and of course pay a visit to Robertos ‚Äì it‚Äôs our favourite place to go.‚Äù
The story
Cinderella is a real Disney classic, and one that can be rewatched and rewatched time and time again, and has been remade more times than I can count.
Kai said: ‚ÄúCinderella is a magical story with heart romance, lots of silliness, classic baddies, brilliant songs and routines and massive special effects,‚Äù which seemed to sum up the show quite nicely.

ABSTRACT
Only 1.5 billion of the estimated 6 billion land parcels world-wide
have land rights formally registered in land administration systems.
Many of the 1.1 billion slum dwellers and further billions living under
social tenure systems wake up every morning to the threat of eviction.
These people are the poor and most vulnerable and have reduced forms of
security of tenure; they are trapped in poverty. Increasing global
population and the rush to urbanisation is only going to turn this gap
into a chasm.
This paper explores one potential solution to the security of tenure gap
through establishing a partnership between land professionals and
citizens that would encourage and support citizens to directly capture
and maintain information about their land rights. The paper presents a
vision of how this might be implemented and investigates how the risks
associated with this collaborative approach could be managed.
1. INTRODUCTION
Land Administration Systems (LAS) provide the formal governance
structures within a nation that define and protect rights in land,
including non-formal or customary institutions. Their benefits range
from guarantee of ownership and security of tenure through support for
environmental monitoring to improved urban planning, infrastructure
development and property tax collection. Successful land markets depend
on them.
Despite this pivotal support of economic development, effective and
comprehensive LAS exist in only 50 mostly western countries and only 25
percent of the world‚Äôs estimated 6 billion land parcels are formally
registered in LAS. This leaves a large section of the world‚Äôs population
with reduced levels of security of tenure, trapping many in poverty.
Missing and dysfunctional LAS can precipitate problems such as conflicts
over ownership, land grabs, environmental degradation, reduced food
security and social unrest. Rapid global urbanisation is exacerbating
these discrepancies.
This security of tenure gap cannot be quickly filled using the current
model for registering properties that is dominated by land
professionals. There are simply not enough land professionals
world-wide, even with access to new technologies. To quickly reduce this
inequality we need new, innovative and scalable approaches to solve this
fundamental problem. This is one of our fundamental global challenges.
This paper explores one potential solution to the security of tenure
gap: ‚Äòcrowdsourcing‚Äô. Crowdsourcing uses the Internet and on-line tools
to get work done by obtaining input and stimulating action from citizen
volunteers (). It is currently used to support
scientific evidence gathering and record events in disaster management,
as witnessed in the recent Haiti and Libya crises, for example. These
applications are emerging because society is increasingly spatially
enabled. Establishing such a partnership between land professionals and
citizens would encourage and support citizens to involve themselves in
directly capturing and maintaining information about their land rights.
Although citizens could use many devices to capture their land rights
information, this paper advocates the use of mobile phone technology.
Due to high ownership levels (5 billion licenses world-wide) and
widespread geographic coverage (90 percent of the world‚Äôs population can
obtain a signal), especially in developing countries, mobile phones are
an excellent channel for obtaining crowdsourced land administration
information. Frugal innovation is making them affordable for all,
especially in developing countries where a new generation of information
services in health and agriculture, for example, is turning the mobile
phone into a global development tool.
Mobile phones are progressively integrating satellite positioning,
digital cameras and video capabilities. They provide citizens with the
opportunity to directly participate in the full range of land
administration processes from videoing property boundaries to secure
payment of land administration fees using ‚Äòmobile‚Äô banking. But even
today‚Äôs simpler phones offer opportunities to participate in
crowdsourcing.
A key challenge in this innovative approach is how to ensure
authenticity of the crowdsourced land rights information. The paper
explores applicability of the approaches adopted by wikis (a piece of
server software that allows users to freely create and edit Web page
content using any Web browser), e-commerce and other mobile information
services and recommends the initial use of trusted intermediaries within
communities, who have been trained and have worked with local land
professionals. This approach has the potential to provide a good level
of authenticity and trust in the crowdsourced information and would
allow a significant network of ‚Äòexperts‚Äô to be built across communities.
To optimise the scarce resources, these intermediaries could be involved
in a range of other information services, such as health, water
management and agriculture.
2. ARE CURRENT LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS DELIVERING THE EXPECTED
BENEFITS?
Despite the clear link between effective LAS and efficient land
markets (Al- Omari, 2011), sustainable development and the other
benefits, their current adoption and effective implementation are
limited to about 50 and found mainly in western countries and in
countries in transition in central Asia (Enemark et al, 2010). A number
of factors limit their scope of implementation:
It is estimated that there are around 6 billion land parcels or
ownership units world-wide. 4.5 billion parcels are not formally
registered and of these 1.1 billion people live in the squalor of slums.
With urbanisation predicted to increase from the current 50% to 60% in
2030 and a further 1 billion being added to the world‚Äôs population in
this timeframe, the security of tenure gap will become a chasm. This
will be impossible to fill in the foreseeable future using the currently
available land administration capacity. The International Federation of
Surveyors (FIG) currently represents 350,000 land professionals
world-wide. The current LAS paradigm cannot be scaled up quickly enough
to meet the demand.
The lack of effective, affordable and scalable LAS solutions conspires
to limit access to land administration services by large sections of
society, especially the most vulnerable, leaving them trapped in
poverty. There is a pressing need to radically rethink LAS: simplify
procedures, reduce the cost of transactions, and open new channels for
participation. Crowdsourcing through ubiquitous mobile phones, for
example, offers the opportunity for land professionals to form a
partnership with citizens to create a far-reaching new collaborative
model and generate a set of LAS services that will reach the world‚Äôs
poor. The rest of this paper explores how citizens can be empowered to
support the delivery of LAS services through crowdsourcing.
3. A NEW CITIZEN COLLABORATION MODEL FOR LAND ADMINISTRATION
This section provided a vision of how citizens armed with mobile
phones, with the help of land professionals, could effectively capture
and manage their land rights.
3.1 The Increasingly Pervasive Mobile Phone
Although citizens can provide their crowdsourced data through a
number of traditional channels, including paper, mobile phones are
progressively proving to be the device of choice. Mobile phones have
made a bigger difference to the lives of more people, more quickly, than
any previous communications technology. They have spread the fastest and
proved the easiest and cheapest to adopt. In the 10 years before 2009,
mobile phone penetration rose from 12 percent of the global population
to nearly 76 percent. It is estimated that around 5 billion people
currently have mobile phones and 6 billion will have them in 2013
()
Recently the fastest growth has been in developing countries, which had
73 percent of the world‚Äôs mobile phones in 2010, according to estimates
from the International Telecommunications Union
(). In 1998, there were fewer
than four million mobiles on the African continent. Today, there are
more than 500 million. In Uganda alone, 10 million people, or about 30
percent of the population, own a mobile phone, and that number is
growing rapidly every year. For Ugandans, these ubiquitous devices are
more than just a handy way of communicating: they are a way of life
(Fox, 2011). Not all phones in the developing world are in individual
use, but are actually used as a communal asset of the household or
village.
Due to their high ownership levels and widespread geographic coverage,
especially in developing countries, mobile phones are therefore an
excellent channel for obtaining crowdsourced land administration
information. But are they affordable and do they have the necessary
functionality?
3.2 The rise of smart phones and tablets
Telecommunications has developed exponentially. Phones have changed:
there is a big shift from holding a phone to your ear to holding it in
your hand. Smart phones have emerged that are able to browse the web,
send and receive email, and run applications - as well as storing
contacts and calendars, sending text messages and (occasionally) making
phone calls. See figure 1 for the range of Cyborg (an organism that has
enhanced capabilities due to technology) functionality provided by smart
phones. Smart phones represented 24 percent of all mobiles sold
worldwide in the first quarter 2011 ‚Äì up from 15 percent a year before.
The tipping point when they make up 50% may only be a year or so away.
Although smart phones may cost around US$600 today, volume of sales and
frugal innovation will drive the cost down to an estimated US$75 in
2015. A US$100 smartphone has already arrived on the streets of Nairobi.
Before the end of the decade, every phone sold will be what we'd now
call a smartphone and cost US$25 (Arthur, 2011).
Although smart phones have combined an array of technologies onto the
mobile phone platform to significantly increase its functionality and
its applicability in a wide range of new applications, regular mobile
phones can still be used to support information services and gather
crowdsourced information, through text messaging services (SMS) for
example.
The emergence of tablets is also providing an opportunity for
effectively supporting crowdsourced information, especially graphical
information. This technology will play a significant role in the future
of crowdsourcing.

Cyborg Functionality
3.3 Vision of an effective crowdsourced Land Administration
solution
This increase in functionality of the mobile phone, its migration to
lower cost devices through frugal innovation, its increasing
pervasiveness across developing countries and its connection to Internet
and information services is opening up significant opportunities for its
use in delivering more effective and accessible land administration
services. The possibilities are explored below:
Accessing Customer Information Services - A whole new generation of
innovative information services, such as agricultural and health, are
being provided to users of mobile phones in developing countries. A good
example is the use of mobile phones to record and transfer water quality
or water source inspection data from the field to a central database
where water sector professionals can then view the data collected and
identify hazardous water sources
(). A similar set
of land administration services for users could provide explanations of
procedures, electronic forms for completion, standard applications and
best practice for land registration and cadastre, for example. This
remote guidance and support will be essential when there is more
significant citizen participation in land administration services and
could be provided by tiers of citizen intermediaries with guidance by
Land Professionals.
Recording Land Rights - The mobile phone will allow citizens to directly
record the boundaries of their land rights. This can be achieved in
several ways:
In all cases the authenticity of the captured information would be
enhance by passively recording the network timestamp at time of capture.
This information is not something that most (99.999%) of users can
tamper with.
The results of this crowdsourced or self-service information could then
be submitted electronically to either the land registration and
cadastral authority or open data initiative for registration. Although
there are limitations in the quality and authenticity of the ownership
rights information provided, it could form the starting point in the
continuum of rights (UN-HABITAT, 2008) being proposed by UN-HABITAT.
This recognises that rights to land and resources can have many
different forms and levels.
To increase the authenticity and quality of the registration
application, the concept of the ‚ÄòCommunity Knowledge Worker‚Äô created by
the Grameen Foundation (Donovan, 2011) could be adopted. The ‚ÄòCommunity
Knowledge Workers‚Äô are trained members of communities supporting
agricultural and health information services who act as trusted
information intermediaries to those who have limited skills and access
to information. A similar model could be used for crowdsourced land
administration services to record or check ownership rights prior to
their submission. In fact, the ‚ÄòCommunity Knowledge Workers‚Äô model could
be extended to also support land administration information services.
This model is similar to the administrative roles of the Patwari in
India and the Lurah in Indonesia.
This engagement of local communities is also being highlighted as a key
success factor by crisis mapping projects. They realise that without
community buy-in, the valuable crisis mapping tools will not be used.
Communities must be engaged at all stages of the project and technical
design to ensure that crisis mapping efforts are in line with local
incentives and capacities. For example, this community led approach
brought fourteen organisations into a network in Liberia contributing
data to a multi-layered map that served as a central nervous system for
early warning signs of conflict in the run up to the national elections
in 2011 (Heinzelman et al, 2010).
When the captured land rights are submitted to the property register
(see section 4 for a discussion on an alternative shadow property
register based on an open data initiative) a variety of quality checks
could be applied to the submitted information, including: random checks
in the field; comparisons with other applications submitted in the same
proximity; checks on ownership of the mobile phone; review evidence for
the location of its owner through the log showing that the phone is
frequently used within a location; network time stamping of captured
information; and contact the client and their neighbours on their mobile
phones to ask for clarification. Further details of approaches to
managing the authenticity risk are contained in section 5 ‚ÄòManaging the
Risks‚Äô.
Obtaining Title - The submission of an application for registration
usually involves the payment of a fee. This is normally paid as cash
over the counter or a financial transaction through a bank or post
office. However, in the context of mobile phones, the payment could be
made by the client through ‚Äòmobile banking‚Äô on the mobile phone.
Mobile phones are currently being used to manage identification
information. In Finland chip ID cards for government employees are being
adopted throughout Finnish central government. It is therefore feasible
that encrypted forms of land title could be incorporated into clients‚Äô
mobile phones and used as proof of ownership.
Accessing Land Information - Effective LAS are supported by Land
Information Systems. These are initially developed to support the
internal operations of the land registration and cadastral authority.
However, the next development stage is to make them outward facing and
accessible by customers either by Extranet or Internet. However, with
mobile phones directly supporting Internet access, these information
services can now be accessed by mobile phones. This new channel, which
will be the only access to the Internet for many countries, creates much
more accessibility for the citizen, bringing land administration
services to a wider range of society, many of whom are currently
excluded.
Paying Mortgage Instalments - Securing a mortgage normally requires the
property owner to have a bank account to support the mortgage payments
transactions. However, the mobile phone offers opportunities to provide
secure payment of land administration fees with the increasing use of
‚ÄòMobile Banking,‚Äô simplifying the procedures and again potentially
opening up the means of wider property ownership.
4. IMPACT OF NEW CITIZEN COLLABORATION MODEL ON THE EXISTING LAND
ADMINISTRATION SECTOR
The introduction of this new LAS model will likely be perceived by
most land professionals working in the land administration sector as
radical and by some as a serious threat. However, the current generation
of mobile phones and other devices are increasing the potential range of
participants in land administration. We are seeing the rise of the
‚Äòproamateur‚Äô, somewhere between the professional and the amateur, caused
by this easy to use and accessible technology. Disruptive technology has
caused professional realignments in the past: total stations allowed
surveying technicians to perform more tasks, more accurately than
before. Crowdsourcing by ‚Äòproamateurs‚Äô is not a risk to land
professionals, but allows a wider range of participants to be involved
in land administration and more quickly address and solve our global
challenges.
Land professionals‚Äô attitudes towards this new model will determine how
land administration is shaped in the future. Here are two scenarios of
the potential impact of the new model on the land administration sector.
Rejection by Land Professionals: Shadow Property Register - In countries
where there is little citizen trust in poorly performing or corrupt land
administration services provided by the government, an alternative
property register may be created through crowdsourcing. This ‚Äòshadow‚Äô
property register would be similar to the OpenStreetMap crowdsourced
model that has successfully provided an alternative source of mapping
for many countries. An ‚ÄòOpenCadastralMap‚Äô (Laarakkar and de Vries, 2010)
or ‚ÄòOpenLandOwnership‚Äô open data initiative would emerge. Despite not
having the usual endorsement and guarantee from government, its
legitimacy may progress over time as quality and trust evolve. It may
even be embraced by the informal market as a trusted repository to
support transactions more affordably and effectively than the formal
property register. The real test will be if financial services use it to
judge risk in the mortgage market. Ultimately, it may either replace the
government land administration service, reinforcing the informal land
market, or be adopted by government once it has reached a critical mass
and quality.
Acceptance by Land Professionals: Supplement to the Formal Property
Register - Other countries may embrace this new model as an opportunity
to accelerate the number of properties being registered across the
country and support a much more inclusive solution to land
administration. If land professionals work in partnership with citizens
and communities and grow a network of trusted citizens to record and
register land rights then this source of land information could be
managed directly by the formal property registers. Initially these
crowdsourced records could have a provisional status that would be
formalised following checks on authenticity. This could be performed
directly by land administration staff or accepted directly from trusted
community experts or quality checks achieved through crowdsourcing. The
approach to and judgement of authenticity would evolve and improve over
time, just as has happened with the maintenance of all wikis. This would
involve a changing role for land professionals, working with citizens
rather than for citizens.
In emerging nations where there are insufficient land surveyors or land
surveyors do not wish to embrace a crowdsourced approach, the lawyers,
assessors or even bankers may eventually try to remove or at least
reduce the need for land surveyors in the property transaction by either
resorting to direct crowdsourcing or identifying another type of
intermediary to facilitate crowdsourcing in different communities in
exchange for some cash or in-kind consideration.
5. MANAGING THE RISKS
As with all radical changes to long standing approaches, vested
interests will be jeopardised and entrenched opposition will inevitably
be encountered. Here are some of the risks that will most likely be
raised to attempt to keep the status quo.
5.1 Can crowdsourced land rights information be sufficiently
authenticated?
One of the most contentious issues surrounding crowdsourced
information is the authenticity or validity of the information provided.
Without the rigors and safeguards associated with formal professional
and legal based processes, crowdsourced information is of variable
quality and open to potential abuse. Crowdsourced information has
provided input to wikis, feedback of quality of services and counting
birds, for example, but is not normally used to capture information as
critical and legally binding as property rights in an authoritative
register. So what techniques could be used to quality assure the
authenticity of the information to a level that would be acceptable for
inclusion in a property register? Some alternatives, including lessons
learned from leading wikis and e-commerce, are discussed below. However,
the most appropriate crowdsourcing approaches to authenticity assessment
will only be identified through testing in the field.
Grameen Community Knowledge Workers as Intermediaries
This approach would avoid open, direct crowdsourcing at the outset and
only allow information to be provided by trusted intermediaries within
communities who have been trained and have worked with local land
professionals. Initially, there would be comprehensive quality assurance
of the crowdsourced information, but over time as trust is established
with the intermediaries the level of quality assurance sampling could
significantly decrease. These initial intermediaries could then train
further experts to build a significant network of ‚Äòexperts‚Äô across
communities. Each expert would be continually checked and appraised to
determine the level of expertise and trust in the associated
crowdsourced information. To optimise the scarce resources, the
intermediaries could be shared with a range of information services,
such as health and agriculture.
Community based Quality Assurance
Quality assurance could be directly provided by members of the local
communities who take direct responsibility for authenticity. The
crowdsourced land right claims could be posted for communities to review
and comment on. Some form of local or regional land tribunal could be
established to arbitrate on conflicting claims. Once a critical mass of
land rights information is obtained it is then easier to identify
anomalies and conflicting claims. Levels of trust and accuracy of the
land rights would be upgraded over time as more evidence and cross
checking validates the claims.
Wiki and e-Commerce Solutions
Beyond local involvement in quality assurance, a centralised user
reputation system based on feedback from crowdsourced registrations,
similar to the buyers‚Äô ratings of the sellers used in eBay, could be
used to assess the credibility of contributors and the reliability of
their contributions (Coleman, 2010). Leading wikis, such as
Wikipedia.org, originally relied solely upon the "wisdom of the crowds"
to evaluate, assess and, if necessary, improve upon entries from
individual contributors, usually with great success. However, recent
contributions of deliberate misinformation to specific entries have
caused Wikipedia to re-assess its approach. Beginning in December 2009,
it has relied on teams of editors to adjudicate certain "flagged
entries" before deciding whether or not to incorporate a volunteered
revision (Beaumont, 2009).
Although the data that are contributed to VGI projects do not comply
with standard spatial data quality assurance procedures and the
contributors operate without central co-ordination and strict data
collection frameworks, research of VGI is starting to provide methods
and techniques to validate quality and also the needed evidence to show
that this data can be of high quality. Recent research (Haklay et al,
2010) supports the assumption that as the number of contributors
increases so does the quality; this is known as ‚ÄòLinus‚Äô Law‚Äô within the
Open Source community. Studies were carried out using the OpenStreetMap
dataset showing that this rule indeed applies in the case of positional
accuracy.
Crowdsourcing Quality Assurance
Some elements of the quality assurance process do not require local
knowledge of the land rights claim and could be crowdsourced to a
network of informed consumers and world-wide professionals or could even
be automated.
Passive Crowdsourcing Quality Assurance
Mobile phones can also be used passively to collect evidence that
supports validation of user entered information. For example, the use of
a mobile phone is continually logged and this log can be analysed to
show where the phone is frequently used, inferring the location of the
owner. The network timestamp is another robust piece of evidence that
could be associated with collected land rights data, such as images or
videos. This is not something that most (99.999%) of users can tamper
with.
The extent to which control is held by the contributor, by the
institution, or by "the crowd" of contributors assessing each other's
contributions may be different across different implementations of
crowdsourcing.
5.2 Will openness lead to more corruption in
the land sector?
Land administration is often perceived as one of the most corrupt
sectors in government. Although individual amounts may be small, petty
corruption on a wide scale can add up to large sums. In India the total
amount of bribes paid annually by users of land administration services
is estimated at US$ 700 million (Transparency International India,
2005), equivalent to three-quarters of India‚Äôs total public spending on
science, technology, and the environment. However, one of the best means
of reducing corruption within a good governance framework is through
transparency of information and the ability to have two-way interaction
with clients.
Data collected by the public must be validated in some way, otherwise
the crowdsourced information is open to abuse, and in the case of land
rights, corruption through false claims. However, transparency, which is
at the heart of the crowdsourced philosophy and the increasing use of
the mobile phone to check authentication, should support a fight against
corruption.
5.3 Will Land Professionals form a new
partnership with citizens?
This new partnership model implies that Land Professionals will have
a different relationship with citizens or ‚Äòproamateurs‚Äô. The increased
collaboration with citizens opens up the opportunity for new services to
train citizens and community intermediaries and to quality assure their
crowdsourced information. It should therefore not be perceived as a
threat to their livelihoods and profession. But will Land Professionals
accept this new role and will sufficient citizen entrepreneurs provide
land rights capture services and become trusted intermediaries?
Disruptive technologies have and will continue to challenge the
relationship between ‚Äòproamateurs‚Äô and land professionals, but these
drivers of change also present significant opportunities for all
stakeholders.
5.4 Will crowdsourcing just reinforce the informal land market?
There is a danger that the emergence and acceptance of crowdsourced
land rights information by citizens will just reinforce the informal
land markets in countries where there is ineffective land governance,
poorly performing land administration systems and weak formal land
markets. Lack of trust in the formal land administration system will
persuade citizens to try crowdsourcing alternatives that are attractive
due to their transparency and citizen involvement. The final outcome of
the informal or formal market will depend on the Land Administration
agencies‚Äô reaction to crowdsourcing and whether they reject or embrace
it.
5.5 Who will provide the ICT infrastructure to support this
initiative?
The implementation of crowdsourcing in land administration requires
technical infrastructure to support the uploading, management and
maintenance of the land rights information. The implementation could
mirror the voluntary support model of OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap's
hosting, for example, is supported by University College London‚Äôs VR
Centre for the Built Environment, Imperial College London and Bytemark
Hosting, and a wide range of supporters
() provide finance, open
source tools or time to support the initiative.
6. CONCLUSIONS
Crowdsourcing within the emerging spatially enabled society is
opening up opportunities to fundamentally rethink how professionals and
citizens collaborate to solve today‚Äôs global challenges. This paper has
identified land administration as an area where this crowdsourced
supported partnership could make a significant difference to levels of
security of tenure around the world. Mobile phone and personal
positioning technologies, satellite imagery, the open data movement, web
mapping and wikis are all converging to provide the ‚Äòperfect storm‚Äô of
change for land professionals. The challenge for land professionals is
not just to replicate elements of their current services using
crowdsourcing, but to radically rethink how land administration services
are managed and delivered in partnership with citizens. Land
administration by the people can become a distinctly 21st century
phenomenon.

Weekend Wellness: Tips for Starting the Second Half of 2021 Mindfully
Updated: Jun 30
Here in Connecticut, we have a weekend of warm weather and sunshine ahead of us as we close out the month of June. With July approaching and the first six months of 2021 behind us, this weekend provides an opportunity to reflect and reset as we move forward into the second half of the year. But any time can be ripe for reflection if one chooses to take it! With that in mind, if you are looking for ways to approach the next couple of days with purpose, here are several things you can do this weekend‚Äîor any time you like‚Äîto set the tone for a mindful rest of the year.
Take a Mindful Hike or Walk
Research has established that spending time outdoors provides a multitude of benefits for one‚Äôs mental health. In a 2020 feature from the APA‚Äôs Monitor on Psychology, Kristen Weir summarizes several key points about the impact of nature on our wellbeing:
Spending time in nature is linked to both cognitive benefits and improvements in mood, mental health and emotional well-being.
Feeling connected to nature can produce similar benefits to well-being, regardless of how much time one spends outdoors.
Both green spaces and blue spaces (aquatic environments) produce well-being benefits. More remote and biodiverse spaces may be particularly helpful, though even urban parks and trees can lead to positive outcomes.
One simple way to harness the power of these benefits is to get outside on a hike or walk. Visiting a local city or state park can be a meaningfully immersive experience, but even taking a walk through your neighborhood can help connect you with nature.
To take your outdoor excursion to the next level, consider going on a mindful hike. This piece from Mindful.org provides a helpful guide hiking mindfully, but don‚Äôt be intimidated‚Äîtaking a mindful hike doesn‚Äôt involve any special skills or practices. Instead, it simply requires some additional intentionality about things you are likely already doing: engaging your senses of sight, hearing, touch, and taste; pausing; moving in silence; and noticing the experiences that draw you in along the way.
Do Some Gratitude Journaling
Whether you are a journaling pro or have never journaled before, gratitude journaling can be a wonderful practice to add to your routine. Greater Good in Action, a project of the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley and HopeLab, offers many simple, research-based practices to promote a ‚Äúhappier, more meaningful life‚Äù‚Äîand gratitude journaling is one of them. Their guide to gratitude journaling is clear and concise, and they recommend only taking 10-15 minutes once a week to enjoy the benefits of this practice. While I highly recommend clicking through the link above to read their nine tips and explore some of the other resources included alongside them, the following ‚ÄúHow-to‚Äù from the page highlights how simple this practice can.
Start your day with a Coffee/Tea Meditation
If adding a new activity or practice to your weekend feels like too much, consider using something that‚Äôs already a part of your routine as a jumping-off point. For those of us who start our mornings with a cup of coffee (or tea), this could be as simple as taking some special time with our morning beverage. In her thoughtful blog post on the topic, writer Beth Bruno remarks, "Most of us start our mornings rushing around, caught up in our thoughts about all we have to do and feeling frazzled trying to get out the door. What if you could change that pattern simply by paying attention to your morning brew?"
Bruno walks through some simple steps to set aside external distractions and be attentive to the taste, smell, and feel of sitting and drinking your cup of coffee, ending the practice with an intention, wish, prayer, or positive affirmation.
Pick Up a New Book
In a previous post for The Consortium Speaks, I wrote about bibliotherapy and my experience of the connection between reading and mental health. Blogger Katie Martinez shares her perspective on mental health and reading in a post at Step Up for Mental Health, a peer-to-peer advocacy group providing support, assistance, and education. In her piece, she highlights the role reading can play in stress-reduction, improving sleep quality, and lowering heart rate and blood pressure, among other effects. ‚ÄúMany people shy away from reading or fail to see it as a form of self-care,‚Äù she writes. The key is to find books, magazines, or other texts that interest you, whatever they may be, and to not be daunted by a particular time commitment. A 2009 study from the University of Sussex demonstrated that reading silently for only six minutes lowered stress levels by up to 68%.
Consider visiting your local library or bookstore and browsing the shelves for a new book this weekend!
Add Some Music to Your Routine
The same University of Sussex study that considered reading‚Äôs role in stress-relief found that listening to music lowers stress levels by up to 61%. If your weekend plans include running errands or other household chores, adding music to the mix may help you encounter those responsibilities from a calmer mental state.
Not sure what to listen to? Any music you enjoy can provide a welcome distraction from otherwise monotonous or unpleasant activities! Premade playlists can be helpful resources when you are stuck on a choice or do not have the energy to put together your own list of tunes. You can find these on YouTube, Pandora, Spotify, and other music websites. I‚Äôve included a handful of Spotify‚Äôs happy and calm playlists below as options:
Whether you take advantage of the activities listed above this weekend or another time, I hope you find them helpful resources along your mental wellness journey. From all of us at the Consortium, we wish you a happy Friday and a wonderful weekend!New York Weather Highlights of 2007
JANUARY
1 - A very rainy day, with 1.52" measured. Interestingly, the previous time it rained on New Year's Day, in 2003, the same amount of rain fell. Today was also very mild, with a high of 56¬∞/low of 45¬∞ (eighteen degrees above average).
6 - Today's high of 72¬∞ tied Jan. 26, 1950 for the warmest reading ever recorded in January. This was 33 degrees warmer than normal and more typical of mid-May. A bonus was that it happened on a Saturday.
8 - Although it was a record for the date, today's rainfall was a relatively modest 1.25". Much of it fell between midnight and 4:00 AM, but it continued through midday. This was also the last day of an eight-day streak with mean temperatures 10 degrees or more above average (including Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, which were 26 and 31 degrees above average, respectively). The last time temperatures were below average was on Dec. 9.
10 - The winter's first trace of snow fell today, the latest date in New York's history for this occurrence. It was also the 32nd day in a row with an above average daily mean temperature - and the first day to have a below-freezing low since Dec. 9). During this span temperatures averaged 12 degrees above normal.
16 - Today was the first day of a seven-week stretch of very cold weather. This entrenched dome of cold air followed a 38-day stretch of above average temperatures, going back to Dec. 10, during which the temperature was 12 degrees above average.
19 - After four consecutive winters with 40+ inches of snow this winter's first measurable accumulation which fell this morning was one of the latest on record. And it wasn't much as just 0.3" fell shortly after sunrise.
29 - Today was the fifth day this month to have 0.01" of precipitation, the most of any month in the 1970-2018 era (later tied in April 2019). Today's precipitation was in the form of snow as the high/low was 30¬∞/21¬∞.
31 - Today was the fourth day in a row in which measurable snow fell. This has happened only one other time in the 1970-2018 period (Jan. 27-30, 1986). However, snowfall during these four days was more of the "nuisance" variety, with 0.6" falling today, one inch yesterday, 0.1" on 1/29 and 0.4" on 1/28.
FEBRUARY
5 - Today's high/low of 18¬∞/8¬∞ made this the coldest day of the winter - and of the past three years.
12 - Today's seasonably cold high of 40¬∞ was the mildest reading in the three-week period between Jan. 29 and Feb. 19. During these days temperatures were nearly nine degrees colder than average.
14 - A nasty sleet storm during the morning and afternoon hampered traffic and snarled air travel. Jet Blue was crippled as its fleet at Kennedy Airport was incapacitated for a number of days. 0.94" of liquid precipitation was measured at Central Park, and two inches of sleet accumulated on the ground. The day's precipitation represented half of February's total. Despite a high of 29¬∞, little of the day's precipitation fell as snow.
19 - Thirteen of the past sixteen days had morning lows in the teens and eleven had highs at freezing or below. Average high/low during these days was 30¬∞/17¬∞, 11 degrees colder than normal.
20 - Today was the 36th day in a row with a low temperature of 32¬∞ or colder, the longest such streak since one of 51 days in the winter of 1976-77. (There would be a streak of 38 days during the winter of 2015.)
21 - At just 49¬∞, today had the mildest reading of a February that was the coldest in 28 years. This reading was colder than the low temperatures on two days in January (53¬∞ on 1/5 and 54¬∞ on 1/6).
28 - This was the coldest February since 1979, 6.3 degrees colder than normal. However, despite the cold conditions just 3.8 inches of snow fell. Today was one of the handful of days with above average temperatures (high/low of 46¬∞/35¬∞).
MARCH
2 - 2.41" of rain poured down in the morning with the last drops over by 11 AM (with 2.03" falling between 1:00 and 8:00). It was a record amount for the date.
6 - Bitterly cold, with a high/low of just 21¬∞/11¬∞, twenty-three degrees colder than average.
9 - Today's low of 13¬∞ was the fourth day in a row with a morning low in the teens. The average low of 14¬∞ during these four days was 21 degrees colder than normal.
16 -" of snow fell, quite a contrast from the previous four winters, all which had at least forty inches of snow.
17 - The morning low of 25¬∞ was the coldest reading on St. Patrick's Day since 1994's 21¬∞.
30 - Today had one of the lowest humidity levels on record as it fell to a Sahara-like 6% at 4 PM (typical humidity level at this time of day is around 47%). Although the temperature rose into the upper 60s (13 degrees above average) the extreme dry air made the air feel chillier, especially when the sun went down.
APRIL
4 - Under rainy skies (0.85" fell) only two degrees separated today's high/low (42¬∞/40¬∞).
8 - With a high of only 41¬∞ and a frosty low of 30¬∞, this was the coldest Easter Sunday since 1940 (based on mean temperature).
9 - The Mets home opener was played under sunny skies but chilly temperatures as the high of 49¬∞ was nine degrees below average.
15 - An intense nor'easter that struck on this Sunday dumped 7.57" of rain, the second greatest 24-hour rainfall in New York history. Three inches fell between noon-4 PM (including 1.19" in one one-hour period); another period of torrential rain dumped an additional 1.70" between 9-11 PM. In between these two periods of torrential rain there was a period of calm, even a bit of clearing, somewhat resembling the eye of a hurricane.
16 - After yesterday's tremendous rainfall an additional 0.84" fell this morning. In total, rain fell for 36 consecutive hours.
19 - Today was the 16th day in a row with colder than average temperatures, the longest such string of days during springtime for the period 1980-2015. During this streak the mean temperature was eight degrees chillier than average. Nine days had lows in the 30s.
21 - After a seasonable low of 45¬∞ the afternoon temperature jumped to a high of 79¬∞ (sixteen degrees above average).
25 - For the sixth year in a row rain fell on this date as mid-afternoon showers amounted to 0.14".
27 - 2.07" of rain, a record for the date, brought April's total to 13.05". This was a morning rainfall with a little more than half of the amount falling between 3:00 and 5:00 AM.
MAY
5 - This was the fifth day in a row in which the morning low was 50¬∞ or 51¬∞.
14 - Today was my 50th birthday and the high/low of 70¬∞/49¬∞ was the same as on my 40th birthday!
16 - It was a muggy day with a high of 85¬∞ before thunderstorms moved in between 3-9 PM, dropping 0.83" of rain.
25 - Today, with a high of 90¬∞, was the first 90-degree day of the year, about a week earlier than the average date for this occurrence. This broke a string of four years that had their first 90-degree temperature in June.
JUNE
2 - This was the tenth day in a row with a high temperature of 80¬∞ or higher. The average high during these days was 86¬∞, twelve degrees warmer than normal.
3 - Rain began in the evening and by midnight 1.62" had fallen. This was the fifth year in a row in which rain fell on this date.
4 - After beginning the night before, nearly four inches of rain was dumped on the City as the remnants of tropical storm Barry moved through. The rain was over by noon. The amount that fell from the storm was twice as much as fell during the entire month of May.
12 - 0.85" of rain poured down in just 15 minutes between 2:07-2:22 PM. (This was even greater than the 15-minute deluge of 0.68" on this date in 1995).
JULY
5 - One year after heavy rain fell in the AM hours (1.05"), 1.15" poured down between midnight and 3 AM. The highs/lows in both years were also very similar (78¬∞/67¬∞ this year, 79¬∞/68¬∞ last year).
9 - Today's high/low of 92¬∞/76¬∞ made this the hottest day of the summer - relatively mild considering how torrid summers can be. (And the high was just 20 degrees above the high of 72¬∞ on Jan. 6.)
11 - A thick haze prevailed during the daylight hours but then a cleansing cold front moved through in the early evening, producing thunderstorms that dropped 1.10" of rain between 5-8 PM. Much of it, 0.78", poured down between 5-6 PM.
18 - 1.44" of rain fell during AM rush hour (6-9 AM) with half of it falling in fifteen minutes (6:03-6:18 AM). The day's total rainfall of 1.59" was a record for the date (broken five years later).
23 - In the past four weeks rainfalls of one-inch+ occurred each week. Today 2.31" of rain fell, with most of it (1.91") falling between 7 AM-noon. Because of the rainy conditions the high only made it to 72¬∞, thirteen degrees cooler than average.
AUGUST
1 - Low temperatures during the past week were between 70¬∞ and 72¬∞.
2 - This was the third year in a row with a high in the 90s on this date. Today's high was 92¬∞, tying July 9 and 10 for the hottest reading of the year.
3 - 1.06" of rain poured down in just fifteen minutes tonight between 10:06-10:21 PM. And during that fifteen minutes 0.46" fell in a five-minute period.
8 - Tremendous thunderstorms moved through the City before daybreak, dumping 2.50" of rain and shutting down much of the City's subway system. Between 4:36-5:36 AM 1.91" of rain came down, the greatest one-hour downpour since July 17, 1995 (when 2.09" fell). Also, a rare tornado wreaked havoc in parts of Brooklyn. Later in the afternoon the temperature rose to 90¬∞, which was the last 90-degree reading of the year, three weeks earlier than usual. In total the year had only ten days in the 90s, well below the average of eighteen. All of the highs were in the 90¬∞ to 92¬∞ range.
21 - On a rainy day (1.27" fell) the high reached just 59¬∞, twenty-two degrees below average - tying Aug. 31, 1911 as the coolest high temperature recorded for any day in August.
22 - Today was the sixth day this month with a low in the 50s, tying August 1989 for the most days with mornings cooler than 60¬∞ during August in the 1970-2019 period.
SEPTEMBER
10 - A couple of showers at daybreak and during lunchtime produced 0.13", breaking a streak of nineteen rain-free days.
11 - Two-thirds of September's rain fell today. Of the day's 1.21" total, 0.75" of it came down in a torrential 15-minute downpour between 12:58-1:13 PM.
15 - Early morning showers between 3-6 AM amounted to 0.08", making this the sixth year in a row in which rain fell on this date (and in eight of the past nine years).
26 - Today's high was a sultry 87¬∞, fourteen degrees warmer than average.
OCTOBER
8 - Today's sultry high of 87¬∞ was a record for the date and the fifth day in a row of 80-degree weather, the longest such streak in October since 1990. Normal highs for the first week of October are typically in the mid-to-upper 60s.
11 - Today was the 22nd consecutive day with above-average temperatures, the longest such stretch during the autumn in the period 1980-2019. During these days temperatures were nine degrees milder than average. A cold front moving through during the afternoon triggered storms that dumped nearly an inch-and-a-half of rain, with an inch of it falling in a two-hour period ending at 6:30 PM.
23 - Today's low was a balmy 66¬∞, nineteen degrees above average and five degrees warmer than the typical high for the date. The afternoon high got up to 78¬∞. The past three weeks were nearly ten degrees warmer than normal with fourteen days having temperatures 10 degrees or more above average. No big surprise, this would be the mildest October on record. Today was the 12th day this month with a low in the 60s, the most in October since Oct. 1879's 13 (Oct. 2017 would also have 12 such lows).
25 - Today's high was 57¬∞, the first day this autumn with a high temperature below 60¬∞ - the latest date for this occurrence in the 1970-2021 period (average date is 10/7). This balanced the high of 59¬∞ on 8/21, which was only the second time a high cooler than 60¬∞ occurred in the month of August.
31 - This October tied 1947's as the mildest on record, a whopping seven degrees above average. And today was one of the twenty-five days this month with above-average temps (high/low of 64¬∞/49¬∞, five degrees above normal).
NOVEMBER
22 - Today's high of 66¬∞ was the second mildest reading on Thanksgiving Day, behind 1933's high of 69¬∞. (For more Thanksgiving weather highlights double click here.)
24 - This morning's low of 26¬∞ was the coldest reading of the month and came two days after the month's mildest reading.
DECEMBER
2 - The first snow of the winter fell this morning, the earliest date in eleven years (when it occurred on Nov. 28). This morning's low of 20¬∞ was the coldest reading of the entire month. Today's 1.4" accumulation was washed away when rain moved in at around 10 PM.
10 - There was only a three degree variation between today's high and low of 40¬∞/37¬∞.
16 - An overnight lashing of sleet and rain produced 0.84" of precipitation and an inch of frozen precipitation. Then a cold front moved through after dark, producing 40-60 mph wind gusts.
21 - Just like Dec. 10, just three degrees separated today's high (39¬∞) and low (36¬∞).

Our youth have emotions to express - many live in fear, are angry, hurt or confused; many are hopeful and determined. And many have stories to tell.

CRIME:
Black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be arrested. Once arrested, they are more likely to be convicted, and once convicted, they are more likely to experience lengthy prison sentences.[6]
EDUCATION: (More data to come)
EMPLOYMENT, EARNINGS:
In the US, Black workers are less likely than white workers to be employed in a job that is consistent with their level of education.[11]
HEALTHCARE:
From 2013 to 2017, white patients in the US received better quality health care than about 34% of Hispanic patients, 40% of Black patients, and 40% of Native American patients.[4]
Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to experience a pregnancy-related death than white women, even at similar levels of income and education.[5]
‚ÄúThe recent wave of worldwide protests are about George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery. Tony McDade. James Scurlock. And so many unnamed individuals ... They‚Äôre also about institutional racism in education and healthcare. They‚Äôre about police brutality. Mass incarceration. The income gap. Media bias. The justice system. The fact that COVID-19 is killing Black Americans at a higher rate than any other group. They‚Äôre about the injustices, fear, and violence that Black Americans and other people of color face on a daily basis. And they‚Äôre not just about the last week or about recent decades, but instead about centuries-long oppression and the equally long fight against it.‚Äù DoSomething.org

George Floyd
George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin as he kneeled on Mr. Floyd's neck - while he laid with his hands cuffed behind his back, face down - choking him for nearly NINE minutes.
THE MAIN ISSUES:
Mr. Floyd likely would not have even been suspected by the store clerk, nor would he have been handcuffed by the police for an alleged fake $20 bill, if he were a white man. That, very simply, is racism.
He certainly would not have been killed for allegedly trying to use a fake $20 bill, and the other three officers probably would have intervened, if Mr. Floyd were a white man. And that, in a nutshell, is what Black Lives Matter is all about.
Onlookers were helpless. If you are a person of color and you attempt to intervene in a police action, you will likely be tased and arrested at the least, and probably worse. There was nothing they could do except plead, film and pray.
While Chauvin was finally arrested and charged with 3rd degree murder (now upgraded to 2nd degree), the remaining three officers -- who CHOSE not to protect Mr. Floyd, even though they had a legal duty to do so -- were not arrested until June 3rd.
This, combined with numerous additional cases of black lives lost such as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery at the hands of corrupt police officers, necessitates changes to the criminal justice system
PEACEFUL PROTESTS are called for and dominate the day, but some infiltrate them to steal and light fires, to cause chaos, frame the Black Lives Matter movement, get people to turn on each other and distract us from the lawful and largely police supported protests.
That's right - the vast majority of police officers, police chiefs, state police, mayors and governors across the country agree that what was done to George Floyd was unwarranted and unlawful. They have the courage to speak out against corrupt police, and they kneel with the protestors in their right to demand justice.
And, as the image of protesters shows, this is a battle for all to fight. We must be in this together.
Breonna Taylor
Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old unarmed black EMT was fatally shot March 13 by police in Louisville, Ky while they carried out a search warrant on the wrong apartment.
Breonna was asleep when three plain-clothed officers barged into her and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker's home around midnight, using a "no-knock warrant" that didn't name either of them. In fact, the suspects they sought were already in police custody.
Kenneth thought they were intruders and fired a warning shot with his licensed gun. At least 20 bullets were fired by police with eight hitting Breonna and killing her.
Kenneth was charged with attempted murder, but that charge was finally dropped only after his 911 call was released telling the dispatcher, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened ‚Ä¶ somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend.‚Äù
The officers who killed Breonna were not wearing body cameras. Two of them had a documented history of violence and brutality.
As of June 8, the three officers involved in her shooting are still on administrative leave, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. But they have not been charged with any crimes.Happy New Year, everyone!

Up to 10% of stomach cancer cases are ‚Äù familial ‚Äù in origin, meaning that in about 1 in 10 cases, other family members are affected or have an increased risk. However, the exact cause for familial stomach cancer is not always known..Abstract
The accurate determination of shale matrix permeability is a crucial factor in simulating shale gas flow from matrix to fractures, evaluating reservoir potential and forecasting gas production. Current methods for measuring permeability with helium using small pressure gradients (SPG) may lead to erroneous results when applied to actual field production with significant and variable pressure gradients (VPG). This paper establishes a method that measures shale matrix permeability using real gas as close to the actual gas production conditions (PVT) as possible. The mathematical model accommodates desorption and uses both pseudo-pressure and normalized time to accommodate the effect of variations of pressure-dependent gas PVT propeties. Approximate analytical solutions allow the matrix permeability to be estimated by nonlinear fitting to match the approximate solution with the experimental data. Dynamic gas production tests are performed on powdered shale samples of 100~120 mesh with constant external pressure for each production stage with a designated pressure gradient. Both the normalized and actual time solutions are used to eatimate the shale matrix permeability. The results indicate that the normalized and actual time solutions are almost equivalent when external pressure is relatively high, and a deviation occurs between the two solutions at relatively low pressures. For the particular samples, the permeability is estimated of the order of magnitude of 10-7md and decreases with a decrease in external pressure. Permeability errors are reduced by using the normalized time solution for parameter estimation at relatively low pressures. The normalized time transformation yields results obtained from the VPG method closer to actuality and may be directly used for gas production project design and production capacity prediction.

If I had any idea how much of a joy it would be to transform a fluffy yellow sheet cake into a patriotic Fourth of July dessert, I would have written Flag Cake at the top of my summer bucket list. If you are looking for further evidence that we are never ever too old to have fun with our food, this would be it.
Now, before I go on and tell you why of all the fruit flag cake recipes in the universe you should make this particular flag cake, let me clear up one tiny point: I did not invent flag cake. While I aspire to that level of culinary adorableness, I‚Äôve never been particularly adept at fancy desserts or anything bordering on ‚Äútheme‚Äù food.
Dear future parents of my hypothetical children‚Äôs classmates: please do not judge my children for their mother‚Äôs pitiful lack of d√©cor at their birthday parties. The party may not have a theme, a cake in the shape of a dinosaur or Disney princess, or any semblance of order, but we will have sangria. I trust you can forgive.
Or maybe we‚Äôll have Flag Cake, because SO CUTE. And so delicious. And so, so easy.
‚ÄúFourth of July‚Äù is an acceptable party theme for ages 1 to 17, is it not?
Or, here is an even better idea: let‚Äôs all make Flag Cake for the actual Fourth of July!
Although I‚Äôve seen dozens of different recipes for Flag Cake‚ÄîJello, poke, and Cool Whip being three of the most common descriptors‚Äîevery one of them seemed too heavy or even artificial to be a worthy sweet finale to a special summer barbecue.
Maybe I walked by this shirt too many times at Target, or maybe I have some culinary cuteness buried inside of me after all, but I became fixated on the idea of coming up with a healthier Flag Cake recipe. I craved a better cake than what Pinterest promised. I wanted it to be made from wholesome ingredients, and I wanted it to taste rich and indulgent enough to be a true crowd pleaser no matter where I served it.
About This Flag Cake
After a few recipe attempts, this Flag Cake recipe is where I landed. The fluffy yellow sheet cake base is made with whole wheat flour and sweetened with honey, and part of the butter has been swapped for Greek yogurt.
The cream cheese frosting includes Greek yogurt also and isn‚Äôt overpoweringly sweet so that the flavor of the fresh berries can shine.
The Flag Cake is still on decadent side (I kept enough butter and sugar to make it taste like a real cake and not a flag muffin), but in comparison to most other flag cake recipes you‚Äôll find, it leaves you the most wiggle room to serve yourself an extra-large slice, thank goodness. Extra large is the size you are going to want!
With its no-fuss sheet cake style, this Flag Cake is ideal for transporting to parties and slicing to serve a crowd. After diving into a piece of the cake myself, I gave a generous serving to our painter. I thought he‚Äôd take it home, but he stood in my kitchen and quietly inhaled the entire thing in approximately 30 seconds.
The rest of the Flag Cake was gifted to friends who had company in town to enjoy it and who are accustomed enough to my blog leftovers not to mind a missing slice or two. They immediately texted to say the cake had been a hit and could I please send them the recipe early.
No one suspected this Flag Cake had been lightened up, and I guaranteed your party won‚Äôt either!

Flag Cake
Ingredients
For the flag cake:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature (1 stick)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup honey
- 2 large eggs at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt at room temperature
- 1 1/4 cups white whole wheat flour*
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3/4 cup milk plus 2 tablespoons‚Äîany kind you like‚ÄîI used 2%, at room temperature
For the frosting and decoration:
- 12 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese Neufchatel, at room temperature
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature
- 1 1/3 cups powdered sugar
- 1/4 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup fresh blueberries
- 2-3 cups sliced fresh strawberries
Instructions
- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large bowl with a hand mixer or spoon, cream the butter for 1 minute on medium speed, until it is smooth and creamy. Add the sugar on medium speed and beat until fluffy and light in color. Beat in the honey, then the eggs and vanilla until smooth and nicely combined, stopping to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl a few times. The mixture may look curdled. Beat in the yogurt on medium-high speed until blended.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Pour one-third of the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Beat on low speed for 5 seconds, then pour in half of the milk. Beat on low speed for 5 seconds. Repeat with the next third of the flour, then the remaining half of the milk. Add the last third of the flour and beat just until combined and the batter is smooth. Do not overmix.
- Spread the cake batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it into a thin, even layer with a rubber spatula or offset spatula. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, rotating the pan 180 degrees once halfway through.
- Place the baked cake on a wire rack and let cool in the pan completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting.
- For the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large bowl with a hand mixer or spoon, beat the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, yogurt, and vanilla on medium speed until smooth and combined.
- Spread the frosting over the cooled cake. Arrange blueberries in rows in top left corner to form the ‚Äústar‚Äù portion of the flag. Line the strawberry slices in 5 rows to form the ‚Äústripes.‚Äù Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Notes
- *You can substitute the same amount of all-purpose flour for the 1 1/4 cups white whole wheat flour. If you make this swap, reduce the amount of milk in the recipe to 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon.
-.
- Store leftovers in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 3 days. You can also remove the fruit and store for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or freeze for up to 3 months.
Yum! I love all things themed, and last year I made flag brownies!! :) This looks PERFECT for 4th of July!
Flag brownies sound equally delicious, Tara!
Hi Erin!
This looks amazing, but I‚Äôm gluten free. Any thoughts on how to go about subbing the flour for either almond or coconut flour? Would that still taste just as good?
Thank you!
Cait
Hi Cait, generally you can never swap almond flour or coconut flour for all-purpose, because they have such different properties. This is definitely something where you‚Äôd want to use a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend instead. I like the Bob‚Äôs Red Mill one! I hope you love it if you give the recipe a try!
This cake is so beautiful! It will be great for me to make on our 4th of July wedding anniversary! Wish I lived nearby and could be a recipient of your blog leftovers! Thanks, Erin!
Thanks so much, Laurie! I hope you enjoy it for your special celebration!
This is adorable, Erin! I‚Äôd say you have some cuteness buried in there somewhere. :) And the strawberry stripes, especially, look beautiful! Yum!
Thanks so much Melissa! :)
It‚Äôs so beautiful and I just loved it. *applause*
Loved the cake. Only disappointment, here in Fl. almost impossible to find boxes of strawberries
to the same size . By July they are huge with a mixture of sizes. However many compliments for the
slices
given. (they didn‚Äôt see the entire cake before being served).
Dee, I‚Äôm so happy to hear you enjoyed the cake! Thanks so much for taking the time to report back!
Can I make this in a 13√ó9‚Ä≥ pan?
Lauren, you could experiment, though it will change the baking time. I‚Äôd fill the pan about 3/4 of the way full, then keep an eye on the cake. If you have extra batter, you can bake it as cupcakes. I hope you love the recipe!
We made this for the Fourth and everyone LOVED it! It looked beautiful and the texture was so light and fluffy. Thanks for the recipe!
Sandra, I am so pleased to hear this! Thank you for letting me know and Happy 4th!
Made this for the fourth and my friends loved it. I was hoping for leftovers but there werent any. Going to be a new tradition for us!
Billie, no leftovers is the best sign! Thanks for trying the recipe and sharing this lovely review!
My sister is turning 80 on the 4th of July! Neither of us can believe that! Until I moved away, every year I was elected to make a patriotic dessert for about 25 people. It‚Äôs been many years since I‚Äôve done it, but your cake brings back such wonderful memories! I live at high altitude now, so will have to try the recipe with a few tweaks. Thank you for always giving me a brilliant idea for something that makes me look good to my husband! I love your post about the cake, it‚Äôs so cute and funny. Have a wonderful Fourth of July!
I hope you enjoy the cake if you try it, Peggy! Thank you for sharing this kind comment!
Hi! This looks great! I don‚Äôt have wheat flour and was wondering if I can use all purpose flour only? Thank you!
Definitely Liz. I hope you love it!
Can I sub sugar for the honey?
Megan, you do need a liquid sweetener for the correct texture. Pure maple syrup would work!
Great and tasty recipe ‚Äì I loved that it has yogurt and honey :)
I am so happy to hear how much you enjoyed it Erin!
How do you keep the juices from the strawberries from getting on the white icing?
Emily, you can pat them dry first if you like!
My family and I loved this recipe! Super easy and fun to make.
I‚Äôm so happy that you enjoyed it, Hannah! Thank you for sharing this kind review!
Erin, this cake is amazing! I will make it again, and again for other occasions and maybe try some different fruits on it. I would not change a thing. I love that it is in a sheet pan and is a thin layer of cake. I also used a bit less frosting since the cake is so delicious I didn‚Äôt want to hide it. Thanks as always! This one is a winner!!!
I‚Äôm so happy that you enjoyed the cake, Donna! Thank you for sharing this kind review!
Made it last weekend and loved it! So yummy! Everyone liked it too :)
I‚Äôm so happy that you enjoyed it, Jane! Thank you for sharing this kind review!
Hi, I don‚Äôt know why this recipe came up when I searched for vegan flag cake, however I like what I see so far‚Ä¶Ever made a eggless version so far? Anyone?
Hi Nikki! I‚Äôve never tried this recipe without eggs, so it would be a complete experiment. If you decide to play around with it, I‚Äôd love to hear how it goes!
I love it !!! Whats recipe for itt?
Hi Lorra, you will find the recipe in the recipe card! Hope that helps!
This cake is delicious! Moist and rich and the frosting is a perfect topping with the berries. Most guests had second servings and raved about how good it was. I made in a 9√ó13‚Äù pan so baking times was 12 minutes longer.
Thank you Erin‚ù£Ô∏è
Hi Marianne! Thank you for the feedback! So glad you enjoyed it! Thank you for this kind review!
The description she gives of this cake recipe is spot on! I found it to be moist, rich and decadent, and everyone in my house thought it was a huge hit! The icing is phenomenal also. I believe it‚Äôs true no one would suspect it to be a lightened up version. I used entirely AP flour and reduced the amount of milk as is indicated in her notes. If you try this, you will be making this many times for years to come!
Hi Rebecca! So glad you enjoy the recipe!

Washington -- Remember the days when --pre-presidency! -- Joe Biden used to be given to uttering gaffes? He would utter a lot of them. I remember him in debate with the pulchritudinous Sarah Palin. In fact, he made so many gaffes we began calling him the gaffable Joe Biden. We may look back on those days and call them the "Good Old Days." Now he garbles whole press conferences. As the Wall Street Journal said of his interview with Anderson Cooper last week, "Mr. Biden often doesn't seem to know what he's talking about." The president was talking about nothing in particular when he moved on to the high price of oil in the here and now. He blamed the high price of oil on OPEC and not the Democrats' war against fossil fuels produced in America. Then he said that "ultimately ... investing in renewable energy" is the answer. Yet that might take 20 years or more. Who knows?
I thought about Joe's claim that the answer to our energy problem is "renewable energy" as I drove north along I-95 headed to a meeting in New Jersey. As I crossed Delaware -- Joe's home state -- and into New Jersey, I noticed an enormous number of semitrucks and tankers and pickup trucks along the way. For that matter, I noticed hundreds of SUVs here on I-95 and thousands of other gas guzzlers. There must be millions of internal combustion engines on the roads of America. How are we going to dispose of them in a decade or two, according to Joe's plan? Will we all buy Teslas? Can Americans afford our sudden obsession with ending our reliance on fossil fuels? I am not so sure.
I do not doubt that our reliance on fossil fuels in, at least, a minor way contributes to global warming. Perhaps in a major way our reliance on fossil fuels contributes to global warming, though there is no evidence of it. My trouble is that we do not have the solution to the problems created by fossil fuels. The president's plan to impose renewable energy on the nation is not feasible. It is another left-wing, pie-in-the-sky solution to a problem that is much greater than the left-winger will admit to. It is like gun control. Just gather up the nation's guns. That means gathering up over 300 million guns from private citizens. Will no one complain. And how about knives? Or possibly forks?
The problem -- and it is a problem that is only beginning to be addressed -- is that we do not have any way to eliminate fossil fuels that will not wreck the economy. This economy depends on growth. Any slowdown means trouble. Any major slowdown means major trouble. All the reports that I am aware of predict a major slowdown for our economy if we continue on the path we are going. Imagine Joe's plan of "ultimately ... investing in renewable energy." That would mean shutting down roughly 8% of our economy. It would not work, and frankly I cannot imagine that Joe thinks it will work. His only hope is that he will be dead by the time his plan is completed.
There is a way to treat the problem of fossil fuels. The free market might just be able to develop alternatives to fossil fuels, which it has yet to do. Yet it is not out of the question. The free market did develop a vaccine to treat COVID-19 recently in record time, and it did so despite the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry. Of course, the man who pushed for the development process was Donald Trump. He pushed for speeding up the development of the vaccine. He pushed for speeding up the testing of the vaccine's safety. And he pushed for speeding up the distribution of the final product. Moreover, what was learned through this speeded up process may speed up the process of development and distribution of other vaccines in the future. Donald may be on the path to a Nobel Prize!
Would it not be an irony that Trump's work with the COVID-19 vaccine helps with solving the problems associated with fossil fuels? He would find a way to get research and development rolling. While Biden's work with fossil fuel may bankrupt the economy, Trump's work with vaccines many win him the Nobel Prize.
You cannot run modern civilization on wind and solar. It cannot be done.
AMEN! Besides, the Earth creates an enormous amount of natural gas (NG is NOT a ‚Äúfossil fuel‚Äù in the definition of the word, ie it is not created (in my view) from decaying organic matter, and we know now that we have a gigantic supply, plus it burns clean. So what is the ‚ÄúGreen Nazi‚Äù view of it? Why, just Alinsky it! That way the Elite Snobs can control, and freeze us out if they want to. Why? Simple, they want us DEAD.
We are not headed for a recession, we are going to scoot right on past that. This is a full-blown, global DEPRESSION, on a scale that dwarfs the ‚ÄúGreat Depression‚Äù of 1930-1940, and it will likely last more than a decade this time.
Only because the ‚ÄúBrain Trust‚Äù will try every means but the right one to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it.
Cheap, reliable energy is one of the main building block to economic recovery. But some folks just cannot stand prosperity, so they got to go out and invent adversity.
No problem disposing of them - we have landfills enough.
Oh, excuse me: Did you mean "How are we going to replace them?"
That is, of course, another matter entirely.
Regards,
Can the electrical grid support charging all of those coal cars?
Maybe, just maybe, they‚Äôre planning ahead for a mass reduction in population? Is a sarcastic tag required?
No. We have neither sufficient generation nor transmission and distribution infrastructure for that. Elon Musk, Mr. Tesla, even said so recently.
Reduction of the human population to perhaps 5% of the current level, or less, may be the objective, but then, moving goal posts is not unknown, and it will come down to just two people, each trying to throw the other into the volcano.
There can be only one. Talk about a Pyrrhic victory.
Wrecking the economy is Clueless Joe‚Äôs objective. Why do Americans tolerate a doddering, senile old pervert to be the front man for obviously evil manipulators to destroy our country? They wanted to remove Trump from office for the way he picked up a glass of water. What will it take with Clueless Joe?
More like 80% of the economy.
Personally I don't think internal combustion engines are going to be replaced because billions of people that would normally have been driving are going to be disposed of.
This Great Reset/6uild 6ack 6etter is the globalist end game. They really do mean it when they say there are too many people, and that you will have nothing and like it. The ones who don't like it will be killed.
Every Freeper is already marked for death. Better have plans to fight to prevent that.
Normalcy Bias will get you killed even faster.
Joe‚Äôs objective? No, no, no... he‚Äôs just the patsy. The level of catastrophe we‚Äôre witnessing is being well coordinated and strategically implemented at so many levels, well beyond his capabilities.
There are whispers in the ears of many, from the ultimate deceiver. This is a spiritual battle, not that of the flesh.
Cloward-Piven. Google it.
I started a list of items that are made with fossil fuels.
I am already on page 12.
Then-‚Äîthere are the items that CAN NOT be made without fossil fuels:
Glass-‚Äîcannot melt silica at anything but HIGH temps...
Steel-‚Äîsame
Jewelry-‚Äîgold/silver==same.
High temps cannot be created by wind/solar energy to produce glass or steel...
START your own list-‚ÄîSurprise yourself.
Imagine, everyone goes home from work between 5 and 6 every day. They all plug in their E.V.'s to charge for the next days run. Then, to make matters worse they crank up their AC to cool down their houses.
It would collapse the entire grid.

The path of totality arced across the entire United States, resulting in a name of The Great American Eclipse.
While eclipses are fairly routine (a total eclipse happens every couple years on average), it is more rare to be able to see totality. You have to be at the perfect intersection of time and location. Some people could live there whole life and never end up in the path of a total solar eclipse!
Even if you weren‚Äôt watching from along the path, you could still enjoy the eclipse with special solar glasses. However, you missed an absolute wonder if you didn‚Äôt make it into the path of totality. Here‚Äôs why:
It may be a once in a lifetime experience
While there is always the possibility that we will catch another eclipse, being able to only travel a few hours to the path of totality pretty much makes this a once in a lifetime experience. There will be another eclipse over the eastern United States in a few years, but no more that stretch across the U.S. until 2045 (this one actually passes directly over Humboldt County).
I figure that we may be able to catch another eclipse. I‚Äôd sure like to with our kids. But in case we don‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt want to miss this one.
Totality *must* be experience in person
Everything I read leading up to the eclipse said you *must* make it to the path of totality for the best experience. There were a few naysayers who didn‚Äôt really think it was all that interesting, but I took the words of those who had experienced other eclipses to heart.
And we weren‚Äôt disappointed. The eclipse with enjoyable for the hour or so leading up to totality, but it was in the last couple minutes and then totality itself when I finally felt an absolute sense of wonder. We were able to see the ‚Äúdiamond ring‚Äù moments before totality, and then experience the 360 degree ‚Äúsunset‚Äù all around us. It was utterly surreal during the middle of the day.
It made me ponder life
The eclipse is truly a marvel of creation. It is a spectacular event that is orchestrated so perfectly. The fact that the moon fits exactly over the sun a handful of times each decade makes it a unique and amazing sight. If the moon were a bit further from earth, or if the orbital planes were oriented differently, we wouldn‚Äôt even see any eclipses.
But we do. The heavenly bodies are hurtling through space at thousands of miles per hour, yet in perfect harmony, and we get this amazing sight at a few, precious prescribed times. I feel so small and insignificant in this vast universe the Lord has created.
Conclusion
I definitely hope to see another total solar eclipse, and I really hope we can travel so that our kids can see one. If you missed this one, I encourage you to plan for the 2024 eclipse that will cross North America!

Chrissy Cupcake says,
‚ÄòLearning about the food you eat is great fun. Eating good food helps to keep you healthy. When you eat junk food, you can feel sick and awful.
Healthy food allows you to play, have fun, learn your lessons when you are at school, and allows you to help mum and dad if they need a hand.
Natural, healthy food is grown in good, healthy soil. When vegetables and fruit grow in healthy soil, they pass on their goodness to you as you eat and enjoy your food. Animals that live on the land and when they also eat healthy grass and natural herbs that grow on the land, they too, pass on their goodness in the form of the meat you eat.

Recent tests carried out in the Nevada desert show that helium-filled balloons ‚Äì either tethered or free-flying ‚Äì can indeed be used to measure vibrations and quakes happening far below, and if the technology can be transferred to the second planet from the Sun it could give us unprecedented insight into its make-up and history.
The heat and pressure on the surface of Venus mean that any lander probe that tries to monitor Venusquakes would quickly get crushed and melted out of existence. However, the conditions in the upper atmosphere are much more clement.
"We've never made a direct seismic measurement on Venus," Siddharth Krishnamoorthy, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, told Adam Mann at Science Magazine. "There is a lot balloons can offer in terms of unlocking some major questions about the planet."
For the Nevada desert test carried out on the 19th of December, a team from the US Department of Energy created a magnitude 3-4 tremor with the help of a 50-ton chemical explosion that happened around 300 metres (984 feet) underground.
Up in the sky above, two helium-filled balloons were carrying instruments to detect changes in atmospheric pressure and low-frequency infrasound waves beyond our hearing ‚Äì both tell-tale signs of earthquake activity. One balloon was tethered to the ground, while the other was left to float freely.
Add the new experiments to previous tests carried out last year, and it seems this sort of approach might work on Venus. A pair of Russian balloons were used to explore the Venusian atmosphere back in the 1980s, though they only lasted for a couple of days and weren't designed to measure seismic activity.
Getting this tech working on Venus won't be easy though, even with that precedent. While the atmosphere on Venus is thicker ‚Äì and therefore easier to measure infrasound waves through ‚Äì it's also home to supersonic winds that could quickly confuse the balloon's finely tuned instruments.
Nevertheless, the scientists think balloons could measure quakes as slight as magnitude 2, and help confirm a long-running hypothesis that heat is still trying to escape the core of the planet Venus ‚Äì a process that would trigger surface tremors.
While Venus shares a lot of similarities with Earth (including its mass and proximity to the Sun), there are also plenty of questions about why it ended up evolving so differently, with no magnetic field and no water. A fleet of hot air balloons dispatched to measure Venusquakes could help us find some answers to those questions.
Future experiments are planned in Oklahoma as the NASA team works to get the technology more accurate and operating over longer distances. After that, it might be time to start prepping a mission to Venus.
Meanwhile, NASA is also working on a plan to develop drones capable of operating in the Venusian atmosphere ‚Äì which at 96 percent carbon dioxide is rather toxic, though pressures and temperatures away from the planet's surface are similar to those on Earth. These remote workers could teach us more about Venus even from a long way up.
"We know, with a degree of certainty, that Venus has no global plate tectonics like on Earth," Krishnamoorthy told Seeker last year. "Below the surface, there is seismic activity of a different nature, but we don't know exactly what."Talking Heads - Remain In Light (1980)Releases FM / Rock, Metal maestro 0 1 813 24.11.21

It certainly sounds useful to reduce the amount of time it takes a complex and high-tech organization to develop training protocol, especially when the training is necessary to prepare people to operate equipment that can be any combination of powerful, delicate, and expensive, but all of this is only true if the automatically generated curricula are as good as the manually-generated ones. Well, rest assured. They are.
In fact, when it comes to getting content approved, the manual process involved considerably more iterations than Growth Engine‚Äôs automated process. Let‚Äôs pretend for a moment that you know your way around Air Force equipment and its use. Imagine that you now need to take 1,000 pages of technical documentation and turn it into a series of what we might call ‚Äî to simplify the curricula development process ‚Äî ‚Äúquizzes‚Äù. What would be the specific steps involved? Deciding what facts and logic to include in the quizzes would likely be some function of what is important and what is likely to trip up trainees. After all, there are plenty of important topics that are obvious and therefore do not need to be overly stressed, and there are some less important topics that may still be the cause of confusion and require some double checking.
How do you begin to decide between these options? Well, it‚Äôs a lot of work. You might pour through all the documentation enough to develop an intuitive sense of recurring issues and draft those into questions. You might draw on your experience and choose to emphasize certain things you believe would otherwise confuse trainees. You might draft many questions as you go and filter them afterwards. Ok. Say you do all three. Do you think what you create on the first pass will make it into the final curricula? Possibly, but most will likely not. You can already begin to see that, at this point, the quizzes resulting from the manual process are going to require a lot of revision.
But it doesn‚Äôt end there. The questions need to have compelling answer choices and reference documentation, too. It is not enough just to know what content to include; that content has to also be formatted into questions with tricky and believable incorrect answer options (called ‚Äúdistractors‚Äù in the world of education). Think back to the last time you took a multiple choice quiz. One or perhaps more of the answer options were true, but there were some false ones in there, too. That‚Äôs what makes the quiz a quiz. The process of creating compelling distractor options was as iterative as it was time consuming for the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who manually created curricula before Growth Engine got involved. Finally, the SMEs were required to explore the reference material to find the instances covering the material in the questions. Overall, there were a minority (~20%) of ‚ÄúTier 1‚Äù questions requiring only quick and obvious revision or no iteration at all. The majority of questions on the first pass were either ‚ÄúTier 2‚Äù questions (~55%), which required significant additional research and rewriting, or they were ‚ÄúTier 3‚Äù questions (~25%, which were decided against and scrapped completely.
Wherever you have humans attempting to read and compile a lot of data, the situation is ripe for a programmatic approach to contribute. Growth Engine provides just such a solution. Over 90% of the questions generated by Growth Engine were Tier 1 questions. That‚Äôs right: less than 10% of the curricula Growth Engine created for the US Air Force needed to be reworked in any way amounting to more than a quick glance and on-the-spot amendment. Of the 90%, a significant proportion needed no adjustment whatsoever and could be pushed directly to training deployment.
Question relevance and accuracy is extremely important in the creation of any training program, especially when the stakes are high. We do not need to stretch our imaginations far to understand that adequately trained US Air Force personnel is not just a ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù. It is absolutely essential that US Air Force personnel understand their domain. Technically complex and interdependent source documents makes this a harder goal to achieve. Nevertheless, Growth Engine got there, and it got there with flying colors.March 21, 2007 12:00 yesterday.Ge.

Come on folks. We are supposed to respect their cultural diversity here and applaud them for their upholding of the law. It may not be our laws, but they were given a fair trial under the applicable laws of their country. (Tongue firmly in cheek!)
Stoning people to death for adultery.
Torturing a rape victim for "sexual relations" with a man.
Executing homosexuals.
That alone is more than enough information to convince me they are degenerates who should be eradicated like ####roaches.
These people have a completely different set of values compared to civilized people. They are not compatible in any way with civilized society.

in the knowledge of place value, number facts and problem solving skills that they need in order to perform daily mathematics tasks.
Our program focuses on building students' understanding of mathematics vocabulary, language, thinking and reasoning by providing hands-on, engaging activities that link mathematics to real life concepts that make sense to children. Numeracy lessons also include warm up games or activities to help students practise their number facts and times tables.
We use ongoing assessment and data to identify the learning needs of each child and provide intervention and extension programs to students when required. We are committed to teaching a curriculum that provides opportunities for consolidation and enrichment as mathematics becomes more co
mplex through each level of schooling. Students from Years 3 to 6 are encouraged to participate in the Australian Mathematics Competition each year.
Each student has a Mathletics account which they can access from home, to help them continue to practise skills learnt in the classroom and to share their learning with their families.President Biden‚Äôs newest infrastructure proposal ‚Äì known as the American Families Plan ‚Äì features a plan that might set up the nation‚Äôs first everlasting federal paid go away program. Unveiled on April 28, the proposed laws would allow staff to obtain paid go away for their very own well being issues, parental functions, or to take care of sick members of the family, feathering in advantages to finally supply a full 12 weeks of go away by 2031. What do employers have to find out about this groundbreaking proposal?
Abstract of Paid Go away Proposal
The paid go away portion of the American Households Plan would create a federally run program that might pay staff who take day off for quite a lot of causes:
- a employee‚Äôs personal severe well being issues;
- to take care of critically ailing members of the family;
- bond with a new child or newly adopted little one;
- causes associated to a member of the family‚Äôs navy deployment; and
- looking for security from sexual assault, stalking, or home violence.
The proposal additionally calls for 3 days per yr for paid bereavement go away as obligatory.
This system can be phased in over time. The utmost of 12 weeks of paid go away advantages wouldn‚Äôt be absolutely out there till 10 years after passage of the laws.
The proposal wouldn‚Äôt essentially be a dollar-for-dollar alternative for a staff‚Äô typical wage, however as a substitute embody a sliding-scale profit quantity that might be extra beneficiant for lower-wage staff. The paid go away program would pay staff no less than two-thirds of their wages whereas on eligible go away, however the fee of pay would improve to 80% for sure low-income staff. The proposal requires a most profit cap at $4,000 per 30 days.
What‚Äôs Unsure
It‚Äôs essential to notice that draft laws has not but even been launched or launched, so there are a lot of particulars not but recognized. At the moment, we don‚Äôt know whether or not there will likely be employer-size thresholds and hours-worked necessities as exist within the federal Household and Medical Go away Act (FMLA). Additionally unknown: whether or not the proposed statute will embody the kind of job protections offered beneath FMLA allowing staff to deliver claims in the event that they consider they‚Äôve had their rights violated.
Lastly, the proposal comprises no point out of how its necessities would work together with present state paid go away legal guidelines. At the moment, no less than 9 states, the District of Columbia, and varied native governments mandate some type of paid go away, making a patchwork of compliance obligations for multistate employers. It‚Äôs unclear how the American Households Plan paid go away plan would impression these obligations.
Who Would Pay for the Paid Go away?
The important thing query on employers‚Äô minds: who would pay for this go away? The excellent news is that the plan doesn‚Äôt seem to depend on any direct contributions from companies, as a substitute gaining funding by federal funds appropriations raised by tax will increase on rich people. White Home officers have proposed $1.5 trillion in tax hikes aimed primarily at rich Individuals and traders, which might embody a 100% improve on the capital features tax fee for these incomes over $1 million per yr. The White Home additionally believes that an introduced increase in enforcement efforts by the Inner Income Service will elevate vital funds. It seems unlikely, nonetheless, that the administration would search to boost payroll taxes to assist fund the proposal, provided that the Biden White Home has pledged to not elevate taxes on individuals incomes lower than $400,000 per yr.
There are some who consider that the plan would want to boost rather more with a view to absolutely fund the guarantees made within the proposal. Though the White Home launch estimates that it will have a projected value of $225 billion over a decade, no less than one suppose tank ‚Äì the Institute for Girls‚Äôs Coverage Analysis ‚Äì believes it would take $460 billion over 10 years to match the paid leave promises contained in the release, which is greater than double the quantity allotted within the White Home proposal.
Rationale for Paid Go away Program
The Biden administration‚Äôs launch offers detailed coverage causes for the paid go away program. ‚ÄúThe USA has fallen behind our financial rivals within the variety of girls collaborating within the labor drive,‚Äù the Biden launch mentioned. ‚ÄúThe pandemic has exacerbated this drawback, pushing hundreds of thousands of individuals ‚Äî particularly girls ‚Äî out of the workforce, eroding greater than 30 years of progress in girls‚Äôs labor drive participation and leading to a $64 billion loss in wages and financial exercise per yr.‚Äù
The White Home additionally notes that the USA is among the solely industrialized nations on this planet that doesn‚Äôt assure paid go away, with solely 19% of workers throughout the nation eligible for paid go away advantages by state and native necessities.
In the meantime, Biden maintains that the federal go away statute ‚Äì FMLA ‚Äì is woefully quick in a number of respects. Not solely does it fail to supply paid go away, it excludes about 40% of the U.S. workforce as a result of varied eligibility necessities.
What‚Äôs Subsequent?
It‚Äôs best to count on the White Home and political opponents to gear up for a combat over the subsequent a number of months over the American Households Plan. The administration has already handed one large stimulus package deal, and has one other piece of infrastructure laws ‚Äì the American Jobs Plan ‚Äì in movement. It‚Äôs unclear whether or not the White Home and Congress will ask lawmakers to contemplate this newest proposal concurrently the primary infrastructure package deal or whether or not the 2 will likely be separated.

Moontower Just For Laughs Austin launching next April
By Richard Whittaker,
11:00AM, Fri. Sep. 24, 2021
Knock knock. Who's there? Oh, only Austin's Moontower Comedy Festival and the internationally recognized Just For Laughs, announcing that they will be hosting a new joint laugh-a-thon, Moontower Just For Laughs Austin, next year.
Founded in 2012 by the Paramount & Stateside Theatres as the Moontower Comedy and Oddities Festival, Moontower has a long history of great talent and headliners (this week's fest includes Dave Attell and Margaret Cho) but everyone knows that the Montreal-based Just For Laughs, founded in 1983, is the biggest comedy festival in the world. The idea is to fuse the raw star power of Just For Laughs with the intimate feel and growing reputation of Moontower. Planned for next April (so just in time to recover from SXSW), the event will expand the traditional Moontower schedule from four to 10 days, and add venues. Expect more details in the coming months.
Charles D√©carie, CEO of Just For Laughs Group, called the plan ‚Äúan amazing opportunity for two generational comedy organizations, respected by the comedy industry at large, to work together to create an amazing festival for fans and artists."
Moontower cofounder and festival director Lietza Brass added, ‚ÄúIn our early years we looked to the Montreal festival for inspiration as we modeled Moontower. We are beyond excited to partner with Just For Laughs because we know that, with our comedic powers combined, we are building something very special and enduring for. 24, 2021

- If Microsoft IIS is to be used as web server, it must be installed prior to QlikView Server.
- It is not possible to install QlikView Server to a server that acts as a domain controller.
- Internet protocol IPv4 or IPv6 is required for installation of QlikView Server.
- When installing QlikView Server/Publisher, several security groups are created. Several other security groups must be created following the installation. These must be properly configured to ensure that the appropriate services can run, and to ensure that users can access the appropriate functionality. Before you begin the installation, see Security Groups in QlikView Publisher Repository.
- It is recommended not to move folder locations after the QlikView Server installation is complete, since many settings depend on the initial file locations. If the location of QlikView Server has to be changed after the installation, uninstall QlikView Server and then reinstall.
- Any previously defined tasks are deleted when the QlikView Publisher license is activated.
Setup Procedure
- Run the QlikView Server installation executable:
- Microsoft Windows x64 version: QlikViewServer_x64Setup.exe
- Full installation, Single machine with QlikView Webserver: Used to run all components on a single machine with QlikView Web Server as web server.
- Full installation, Single machine with Microsoft IIS: Used to run all components on a single machine with Microsoft IIS as web server. This option is only available if IIS is installed on the target machine.
- Custom installation, select profiles: If this option is selected you select the profiles you want to be included in the installation from the Profiles section in the dialog:
- QlikView Server: Installs QlikView Server, Directory Service Connector, and the QlikView Server example documents.
- Reload/ Distribute Engine: Installs the Reload Engine and the QlikView Distribution Service.
- Management Console: Installs the QlikView Management Service together with the QlikView Management Console (QMC).
- Webserver: Installs the QlikView Web Server.
To make further configuration of features to be installed, click Config. When done, click Next.
To use pre-defined configuration of features, click Next.
Set the account that the QlikView Server and Publisher services are to run under. Click Next to continue.
You can also select I want to specify the account to be used for the services later.
Select the IIS Website from the drop-down list and click Next.
- Use digital certificates: Authenticate communication between QlikView servers using digital certificates and SSL. This alternative is recommended in environments where not all servers have access to a common Windows Active Directory or when the security provided by certificate authentication is required. Note that digital certificates are only supported by Windows Server 2008 R2 and later.
- Use QlikView Administrators Group: Authenticate communication between QlikView services based on membership in the local Windows group QlikViewAdministrators. This alternative can be used in environments where all servers that are part of the QlikView installation can authenticate using a common Windows Active Directory.
Click Next to continue.
Click Install to start the installation.
Click Finish when the installation is complete.
Log off from Windows¬Æ and then log on again, so that group memberships added during the installation are updated.
Logging the Installation
The setup procedure is logged when running the QlikView Server installation executable. The log files are as follows:
- Microsoft Windows x64 version: QlikViewServerx64.wil
The log files are stored in the Temp folder of the user (for example, %UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Temp). Each time an installation is executed, a new file is generated, over-writing the previous log file.
Obtaining the MSI package
If the MSI package is needed for the installation, proceed as follows to extract it from the .exe file:
- Start the installation from the .exe file and wait until the first dialog opens.
- Locate the MSI file (often stored with a random name, for example, ed34g.msi) in the Temp folder in %UserProfile%\AppData\Local.
- Copy the .msi file to another location.
- Exit the .exe installation.
- Install QlikView Server using the .msi file.
Deploying MSI Packages with Group Policies.
Completing the Installation
After successfully installing QlikView Server, a license must be registered in QlikView Management Console (QMC) to activate the installed software.
Running Microsoft IIS
Handling Timeouts
Proceed as follows to handle timeouts:
- Open the %ProgramFiles%\QlikView\Server\QlikViewClients\QlikViewAjax\web.config file in a text editor (for example, Notepad).
- Edit the text so that it becomes:
- Save the file.
<httpRuntime requestValidationMode="2.0" />
<httpRuntime requestValidationMode="2.0" executionTimeout="900"/>
Enabling ASP.NET
If Microsoft IIS is used as web server, enable ASP.NET to ensure proper operation of the QlikView Server sample pages and the extended functions (for example, QlikView Server tunnel).
Optimizing the Performance
To optimize the performance when running Microsoft IIS and AJAX, turn on compression in the web server.
For information on how to configure IIS http compression:
Licensing
The licensing is used to authenticate QlikView Server and allow it to run on a specific machine.
Proceed as follows to enter the license for QlikView Server:
- Go to System>Licenses in the QMC.
- Select a QlikView Server or Publisher.
- Fill in the Serial number and Control fields on the QlikView Server License or QlikView Publisher License tab (depending on whether QlikView Server or Publisher was chosen).
The license is checked every time a document is opened. If the time limit specified by the License Enabler File (LEF) is reached, the QVS automatically enters offline mode, which means that it is reachable from the QMC, but not operational.
The License Enabler File (LEF), lef.txt, for QlikView Server is automatically saved in %ProgramData%\QlikTech.
The PubLef.txt file for QlikView Publisher is saved in %ProgramData%\QlikTech\ManagementService\Publisher LEF.
Click Update License from Server to download a new lef.txt file from the QlikView LEF server. This is primarily used when updating the number of Client Access Licenses (CALs).
If the LEF information cannot be accessed through the Internet, it can be obtained from the local vendor. In that case, copy the entire lef.txt file to the location mentioned above, or paste the LEF data using the corresponding field on the QlikView Server/Publisher License tab in QMC. Contact the local vendor for specific instructions.Frequently Asked Questions about Submissions

FMM: In the Kitchen
1. How often do you cook at home? I cook almost every meal every day at home. This wasn‚Äôt always the case though. I always hated cooking. After having my son I embarked on a quest to learn how to eat healthy. My husband bought us a laptop and I discovered healthy living blogs chock full of delicious easy recipes. With my laptop on the kitchen counter suddenly a whole new world opened to me. I love to cook now and prefer eating home over eating out most of the time. Every now and then I enjoy going out especially for ethnic food.
2. Do you eat more fresh produce, frozen or canned produce? We go through so much fresh produce a week I really should have a garden.
3. What are a few unusual staples that can always be found in your kitchen? Banana peppers, nutritional yeast, chick peas and dates.
4. Look in your fridge, then tell us about the healthiest thing in there. A ginormous Costco bag of spinach
5. Now share the most unhealthy thing in it. I think it‚Äôs a tie between turkey dogs and sugar free Jello. My husband and son eat the turkey dogs and Carlos grabbed the Jello by accident as a snack for camp this week. I didn‚Äôt look at it carefully when he threw it in the cart. I would have bought the regular Jello. I don‚Äôt like him to have the artificial sugar. It will probably make it‚Äôs way to work where someone will eat it.
6. Do you eat leftovers? Yes.
7. Do you use coupons at the supermarket? I try to use coupons, but often times I forget them. I dislike the coupons that offer money off if you buy more than one of a product. I don‚Äôt always want more than one because it might spoil or I‚Äôm not sure if we will use it all.
8. How often do you try new recipes? At least once a week thanks to all the terrific recipes I find on blogs.
9. Do you make grocery lists? Do you stick to them? If I make a list I usually stick to it. I don‚Äôt always make lists despite my never ending attempt to get organized, be more efficient and save money.
10. If you could buy one food item that would magically be calorie-free, which item would you choose? Peanut butter
Now it‚Äôs your turn to answer this week‚Äôs questions. Don‚Äôt forget to visit Kenlie‚Äôs blog and link up in the comments!

Mmm, banana peppers‚Ä¶I usually always have those in my fridge as well. I really dislike coupons for more than one item too, I never need two and it never seems worth it at that point.
dropping in from FMM ‚Äì I also have the hugest bag of spinach I could buy in my fridge this week üôÇ Yum!
I always get the huge Coscto bag of spinach too üôÇ I usually have to freeze some so it doesn‚Äôt go bad! That‚Äôs cool about how you started eating and cooking healthy food .. I was kind of the same way. When I started losing weight, I looked to blogs for inspiration, and never looked back üôÇ
Yep, banana peppers are usually in my shopping cart too! I don‚Äôt use coupons all too much because I don‚Äôt buy much processed food ‚Äì although my grocery coupon next week is going to be amazeballs ‚Äì get $1 back for every $10 you spend ‚Äì so I‚Äôll probably get $8 bucks off my bill next week! üòÄ
Banana peppers, chick peas and dates are a staple around here too. Nutritional yeast intrigues me, never had it but keep seeing it in recipes.
I couldn‚Äôt come up with anything for unusual in mine. I think banana peppers qualify though!
Hi Aimee! I love leftovers. Chick peas have been in many salads lately. I only like coupons that save at least 75 cents, but recently got a $50 coupon off $100 purchase at a department store that was great.

Kevin Smith might be directing a Marvel or Star Wars movie in the very near future. But before Smith became a beloved world-renowned director, he literally put everything he had into making his first movie Clerks. Maxing out his credit cards, selling most of his comic book collection, and borrowing money from family and friends to fund the $27,575 needed to make the black and white movie. In the end, the film about the happenings at the Quick Stop convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey, was a major success, but it didn‚Äôt seem that way for a long time.
Things were looking grim for Smith and Clerks, but the movie finally took off when it was selected to be one of the 34 movies to be screened at the Independence Feature Film Competition at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival.
Kevin posted the 25-year-old letter that changed his life on Twitter with the caption: ‚ÄúThis is the letter that changed my life: an official acceptance notice from @sundancefest.‚Äù
Kevin‚Äôs directorial debut was a critical success and grossed over $3 million for Miramax Films despite never playing in more than 50 movie theaters at the same time. The film was a hit and it opened up the door for him to make Mallrats in 1995, Chasing Amy in 1997, Dogma in 1999, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back in 2001. Now 25 years later, Smith is working on a sequel to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. All you need is that one little break to help you along on your journey.Graphene Themes Forum

Hi, sorry i will move to support
l my site.May was a very busy but also exciting month for me. I started my fitness journey in April and it is hard to imagine I've been working out and eating great for the past two months. Not without some slacking. There were plenty of days and moments when I've felt like giving up. This is not easy. But, I know it is 100% worth it.
I did 2 rounds and 6 weeks of 21 Day Fix. I lost a total of 15 pounds.
May Goals:
Lose 4-5 more pounds:I wanted to lose at least 5 pounds this round and I ended up losing 9 pounds. I'm not quite sure how it happened but it did. That was in the first two weeks. This last third week it stalled a bit. But, I haven't been as good about sticking with the eating plan.
Workout 6 times a week. With one rest day if needed:I ended up working out 4 times during the week the first two weeks of round 2. However, the third week I did 6 days of workouts.
Try to use Heavier weights and push myself in the workouts to do the more advanced version of the workouts:I was so excited some of the workouts I could not do when I first started and I had to do the modified version and now I can do the harder version. I tried to use the heavier weights but unfortunately it killed my shoulders and back. And not in a good way. So to prevent injury I went back to the smaller weights. That disappointed me but I hope to build more strength doing Piyo. I love my weights but it will be nice to use my body weight as resistance for awhile until my shoulders and back gain more strength and are not so tense.
Some days I did not do so well. I had a couple of very stressful weeks and I felt like my depression might be sinking back in. But, I did not keep myself there for long. The days of numbing myself out on TV and ice cream are gone.
Now, I workout, do my yoga and meditation practice, read a spiritual book, and pray a lot.
The other day I was walking to Starbucks and I used to be in a panic about even doing that. The loud noises and all the cars would trigger my anxiety. My anxiety was still there but I was able to realize my fear could not hurt me. My anxiety lessened and I was actually able to enjoy the walk.
It is amazing how far I've come in these last two months and it makes me look forward to the future.
This morning I made a delicious green smoothie to get my day started. I have been drinking these babies every morning for breakfast. This is one of my favorites.
1 cup Romaine Lettuce
1 cup Kale
3 sliced cucumbers
3-4 slices avocado
half a banana
2-4 Dates
1 scoop protein powder
I want to continue to eat healthy. I kind of slacked off my measuring in May so I will still be using my 21 Day Fix containers for measurements. It is so much easier then counting calories in my opinion. I will still be checking my containers off the list. However, I will be following the Piyo meal plan instead. I get more protein and vegetables but less carbs. However, for a carb addict like me that is probably a good thing. I have been doing a lot better at getting my fruits and vegetables in though.
My Goal For June is to start Piyo. I will be starting my first round of Piyo today and doing it for two months. I want to work out at least 6 times a week. The recommended "day off" is Friday but I will be making mine Saturday instead.
I am also excited to be starting the Say it, Sweat it, Get it Challenge. It starts today. The challenge is to do 5 minutes of exercise a day while saying mantras and positive affirmations. To sign up here is the link Say it, Sweat it, Get it Challenge
What are your goals for June?Linking Up With Life of Meg for Mingle Monday
Great goals hun! You can rock this!
15 pounds! YOU GO GIRL! That is a huge accomplishment and you should be so proud of yourself! Definitely keep it up because it seems like it's working for you!
Healthy morning smoothies are the best! I love making them the night before and having them ready the next day!We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôll be joining us for the CLO Symposium. For complete details on the terms that apply to registration and other important disclaimers, please read through the following:
Registration for Chief Learning Officer events is restricted to internal learning & development practitioners and a limited number of sponsors with clearly defined roles. This policy is in place to assure that every live CLO event offers a respectful, relaxed environment where active professionals can network, learn from one another and have frank discussions about what is happening in their industry, organizations and careers. All registrations are subject to review. If it is determined that the registrant does not qualify, the registration will be cancelled and a refund issued to the card supplied.
Simple litmus test:
My primary responsibility is for the development of my company‚Äôs internal workforce = QUALIFIED
I work primarily with organizations other than my own to support their workforce development = NOT QUALIFIED
All vendors, consultants and suppliers interested in participating should should visit our sponsorship page to request more information.
You may review the press release we issued on this policy by clicking here.
Once you complete the purchase of your registration, the purchase and rate is considered final and won‚Äôt be adjusted later. It will be your responsibility to confirm that the price displayed at checkout is the price that you‚Äôre expecting to pay before you complete your purchase.
We may offer a promotional, coupon, discount, or similar code (let‚Äôs just call them ‚Äúpromotional codes‚Äù), for instance as part of a limited time sale. These codes are tied to a specific registration type and their value cannot be applied towards other ticket options. Promotional codes cannot be applied retroactively to a previously completed purchase.
Things happen. We understand. Here‚Äôs how cancellations work:
If you cancel more than 30-days prior to the start of the event, you‚Äôll get a full refund of the amount paid.
If you cancel less than 30 days, but more than 7 days prior to the start of the event, you‚Äôll receive a refund of the amount paid, less a $250 Cancellation Fee. This offsets the processing fees we incur when you cancel and helps us avoid raising registration prices.
Within 7-days of the start of the event, you cannot cancel your registration and we will not provide a refund of the registration fees paid (regardless of whether or not you attend). You may however transfer your registration to a colleague at anytime, at no charge.
To cancel your registration (and get your refund, if applicable), please follow the ‚ÄúRequest a Refund‚Äù link in your confirmation email or submit your request on our contact form.
If you‚Äôre entitled to a refund, the amount refunded will be based on the fees paid for the registration(s) you cancel and will be refunded to your original payment method ‚Äì we don‚Äôt issue checks for refunds.
These cancellation terms apply regardless of the reason that you cancel (even if you unfortunately need to cancel for personal reasons, weather conditions or other work related issues that are out of your control.)
Please remember that canceling your registration does not automatically cancel your hotel and travel arrangements. You are responsible for canceling your own hotel and travel reservations.
If you can‚Äôt attend, but know someone who really wants to be at the CLO Symposium, you can transfer your registration to them for free. To initiate a transfer, simply click on the ‚ÄúEdit Registration Details‚Äù link in your confirmation email or submit your request on our contact form. If you do wish to transfer a registration then you must verify that you either paid for the original registration or that the registration was originally in your name.
If you have used a promotional code to register, your ticket is not transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash, rebate, credit or make good if you are no longer able to attend.

Your privacy is important to us, so please read our full privacy policy here, which is incorporated to these terms by reference.
We might share your registration data with other parties to provide event information, help improve your experience at CLO Symposium or future events. For example, if we offer a mobile app, we might make this data available to the mobile app provider so it‚Äôs accessible through the app. We might also share your registration data with providers related to CLO Symposium, like hotels, registration service providers and housing vendors. By providing your registration data to us, you grant us permission to do these things.
You may have the option of sharing your information (such as name, company, and job title) with other attendees through our mobile app or other online communities. You will have control over which information is shared and you can choose to opt out if you prefer.

You‚Äôre invited‚Äîand indeed, encouraged‚Äîto meet and visit with all of the great companies who will be joining us as official sponsors at CLO Symposium. But keep in mind that ‚Äúsuitcasing‚Äù or ‚Äúoutboarding‚Äù is strictly prohibited at CLO Symposium.
The views or opinions expressed by any event attendee, speaker or sponsor are not necessarily our views or opinions. All event attendees, speakers and sponsors are responsible for their own content (including presentations, marketing collateral, advertising and online Web content). You are not allowed to use any content that infringes another‚Äôs intellectual property rights, is harassing, misleading, or unlawful.

There‚Äôs water damage Glendale being carried out as a result of the massive damage experienced on homes that in Florida, Naples and Marco Island as a result of hurricanes. Whether you choose to stay in your house or leave your property when there‚Äôs a hurricane, there are several things that you should do so you can minimize the damage.
Here are 8 things that you can do, especially if you are planning to stay in your house during a hurricane.
Add Power Surge Protection
You are likely to experience power surges during a storm which can damage your electronic devices. Use a power surge protector to minimize chances of this happening. You can opt to have power strips which have built-in surge protectors installed in your electrical panel.
Cover Your AC Unit
Use a cover that has been approved by the manufacturer of your AC to cover the unit during a storm. This will protect it from damage from flying debris.
Protect Windows and Doors
Make sure that you have enough plywood stock to use during hurricanes to cover up your doors and windows. You can also use shutters.
Since shutters can be expensive, use them in a few strategically located doors or windows. Ensure that the shutters can be easily removed in case you need to leave your house fast in an emergency situation.
Seal Leaky Windows and Doors

Perhaps one of the most anticipated shows of the first day of LFW, Felder Felder was brimming with celebrity attendees, including Molly King (The Saturdays), Mischa Barton and Zara Martin. The show space was completely packed out ‚Äì so much so that some members had to be placed in a separate room to watch the show live on a screen!
The A/W13 collection itself was more of a ‚Äúwearable‚Äù look, featuring a quirky twist on your average trench coat. Quite unlike classic, ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù trench maker brand Burberry, Felder Felder used blush-rose coloured trench coats, made from a thin, fluid rubber. As well as this modern take on a classic, the label introduced various latex pieces, such as legging-style trousers.
The overall colour palette had romantic undertones, as we saw hues of moss greens and rich burgundies. These different shades completed the element of 70s decadence. Once again, as in previous shows from this season‚Äôs LFW and NYFW, we saw a contrast in textures, from knits, to rubber, to suede. The use of contemporary materials to create classics, such as the featured cigarette pants, updated the collection to give a very modern twist on 70s glam.
As the models strutted down the catwalk, a remix of the Velvet Underground‚Äôs Venus in Furs was the main soundtrack ‚Äì all adding to the retro vibe. After winning the NEWGEN sponsorship three times, and with fans including Rihanna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Florence Welch ‚Äì who can often be seen wearing the brand‚Äôs clothes ‚Äì Felder Felder is a design force that evidently still has a lot more to give‚Ä¶ and we can‚Äôt wait.

Doing this simple thing a few times can get you a shot in the arm.
This weekend gave us something to be excited about when news broke that a third COVID vaccine had been approved for emergency use and will soon be available to those who are eligible. However, that excitement may have quickly faded to frustration when you realized how difficult it still is to land a vaccine appointment in many parts of the U.S. Although only select groups of people are eligible, many are still unable to get vaccinated due to various hurdles, including supply shortages and scheduling challenges.
If you're trying to get an appointment, there's one trick that could get you a jab, even if you're not yet in the eligible groups‚Äîand it's completely above board. To see what you can do to get your shot sooner, read on, and for another way to get the vaccine ASAP, check out This Is Who Can Get the Leftover Vaccine at Walgreens, CVS, & Walmart.
You can often get vaccinated if you're a volunteer at a vaccination site.
If you're looking to get vaccinated and do a good deed at the same time, you should look into becoming a volunteer at a local vaccination site. As vaccination efforts continue to expand, the need for volunteers is also growing. Even Anthony Fauci, MD, pointed this out during a Feb. 28 interview with Face the Nation on CBS. "That's the thing I think people are not fully appreciative of. You got to have people to get those vaccines into the arms of individuals," he said. "And we're employing National Guards and others, retired physicians and nurses, et cetera."
But some cities have thousands of positions open, such as Dallas where there are 40,000 volunteer positions to be filled as of Feb. 24. And for more up-to-date COVID news delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.
In some cases, vaccination site volunteers are considered frontline workers.
As is the case with many aspects of COVID response in the U.S., the details of volunteering at a vaccination site vary greatly from state to state. In some states, volunteering at a vaccine site classifies you as a frontline worker, which shoots you to the front of the line, as Fast Company pointed out.
While many sites may vaccinate you during your first shift, that's not a guarantee. "I know of people who helped who didn't get vaccinated during their first shifts, but eventually did when they volunteered for other shifts. I knew going in that it wasn't guaranteed to happen," volunteer Jacqueline Fox, JD, professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law, told Verywell Health.
The vaccination sites tend to ask that volunteers commit to a specific number of shifts, which can be anywhere between three to ten hours long. Whether or not you get vaccinated as a volunteer may depend on how many shifts you take on. And for some behavior to avoid both pre- and post-shot, check out The CDC Says Don't Do This Within 2 Weeks of Your COVID Vaccine.
In others, it doesn't even matter if you're eligible to be vaccinated in your state or not.
The Georgia Department of Health doesn't guarantee volunteers priority access to the vaccine. "Ideally, you want all of your volunteers to be vaccinated," LaKieva Williams of Georgia Responds, the state's COVID-19 volunteer response effort, told CNN. "The intent is there, but it's a matter of supply." But if there is extra vaccine available at the end of the day, volunteers are usually ready to get their jab.
"You can't save those extra doses until tomorrow, you've got to try and get them into people, and they're trying to use that as the funnel for getting the volunteers caught up," Robert Riley, MD, a retired family physician, told CNN.
"No vaccine doses should be wasted," Fox explained to Verywell Health. "Having people right there to be vaccinated if there are extras seems really efficient and sensible." To see how frequently you'll have to head back for another dose, check out The Pfizer CEO Says This Is How Often You'll Need a COVID Vaccine.
You don't have to have medical experience to volunteer.
"Volunteers are often categorized as medical or non-medical, depending on their qualifications," Morgan Philbin, PhD, assistant professor at the Columbia University School of Public Health in New York, told Verywell Health. "Those with a medical background like physicians, nurses, or paramedics can be assigned as a vaccinator or part of the monitoring team for the 15-minute wait post-vaccine."
But you don't have to be a medical professional at all to volunteer; vaccination sites also need a ton of administrative assistance from the general population. According to Fast Company, some common roles include greeting people who arrive and confirming their eligibility, directing people to the correct line, helping people schedule second doses, interpreting for those who don't speak English, helping guide the flow of traffic, and managing the parking situation. To see what you should skip before your shot, check out Dr. Fauci Just Said Don't Take This Medication With the COVID Vaccine.
All you need to do is follow a few simple steps to volunteer at a vaccine site.
As Verywell Health points out, some states organize vaccination site volunteer sign-ups through official state websites, like Georgia, Utah, Arizona, and California. But if you don't see an option on your state's site, try your county's website for local volunteering information.
Some areas already have so much interest in volunteering that they're no longer accepting applications, but more opportunities should open up as more vaccine shipments arrive. If you are able to apply, know that the process can take a couple of weeks because sites often want to perform a background check and may ask you to complete some compliance training.

Now - again - this is all. The blog post makes it explicitly clear that updates for 8.1 apps can still be pushed to Windows 10 Mobile users, but the pool of people still using 8.1 application under Windows 10 Mobile must surely be diminishing fast now and you have to wonder how much enthusiasm remaining developers will have.
This date also ties in with other public statements from popular 8.1 apps. For example Whatsapp, which has said that from today its 8.1 application 'may' be withdrawn in the Store, even for Windows 10 Mobile users. Unable to issue updates to its core Windows Phone 8.1 userbase, security issues may well force Whatsapp to pull out of the ecosystem sooner rather than later.
So - data points welcome. How much do you rely on legacy Windows Phone 8.1 applications on your Windows 10 Mobile phone? Is this update cutoff date a big deal for you?Here are some pictures of our ‚Äúflat‚Äù and the view from it. More to follow

Yes. Trying to contact support today. My charger was not seating well and I realized it was because the coating was split and the metal pieces that hold the magnets on the charger were completely rusted to pieces.
Sucks, as I just got the watch to work well and was beginning to enjoy it. I‚Äôve been wearing it for about a month.
YES! One fell off yesterday and the second fell off today. It looks like it‚Äôs rusty under this now missing silver contracts. I emailed support today and haven‚Äôt heard back yet.
All new 44 watch owners need to be aware of this defect!
PS The watch is only 6 weeks old! WTF
I contacted them May 29 and haven‚Äôt heard back. I tried to send them a picture of my watch but not sure how. Mine is the one on the button side. Good luck
Yes, but I received a replacement quickly! Unfortunately I assume it might happen again, then I will just start wearing my band again.
Yep, just experienced the same thing with rust. Charger wasn‚Äôt connecting easily, then noticed a skin rash on wrist, and then discovered the rusted contacts. I wondered why my other fitness trackers didn‚Äôt cause this issue, but those contacts are plastic coated. Bad design considered I‚Äôve only used this 2 months.
Did you actually find a contact button or was it just the screens of generic questions?
There are a number of Issues with the Wyze Watch. Rusting, Battery explosions‚Ä¶This MUST be reported to The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
First report I‚Äôve ever submitted, but I did. I predict this is going to be a big problem when more people start wearing these. I preordered way back in Dec. 2020. Didn‚Äôt receive until April 2021. Wonder if these rusty contacts were the delay?
I discovered the same way, went to attach charger and it kept shifting so I flipped it over and discovered the rust. At that point it was just split open, now a week later it is just a mound of rust and another terminal is rusted. I got the replacement by going through support in the app but i suspect the same will happen again and now a bit worried to even wear it. Also the alarm feature which is really important doesn‚Äôt really work and I keep my wyze band on nightstand as backup.
Noticed the two outside terminals in my watch rusting tonight. Picked at one lightly, and it just disintegrated. Going to notify support, for what it‚Äôs worth.
Yes, six weeks later the watch can be woken only on the charger plus the touchscreen and button are no longer responsive.
Got a quick replacement from them - will see how this one fares.
Yup. Did a search and found this post. I‚Äôm on my 2nd one and same thing. Contacted support after the first one rusted. Felt it poking at my skin, only wore it for a month. They first asked me to clean it, and were acting like they didn‚Äôt believe me, and then said it‚Äôs past the return window, and I had to threaten to report them and take it to social media. Then suddenly they were willing to send me a replacement.
Almost a month with the new one, and Same issue. I‚Äôm about to file another report.
It‚Äôs sad because I like the watch functions and the price is, well, I guess too good to be true. I‚Äôm figuring this is a mass production manufacturing defect. Curious if it is All watches or just a batch. Hoping they are able to get this fixed. I‚Äôd be willing to wait for a replacement if it actually does get fixed.
I posted this in another related thread but I‚Äôll mention it here with hopes my experience with Wyze customer support helps someone.
I had the same trouble with the battery terminals on the 44. I did online support as follows:
Select ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù from the home screen; then in the ‚ÄúHelp Center‚Äù, I selected ‚ÄúSubmit a Request‚Äù; then when the box at the lower right popped up, I chose ‚ÄúProduct, App, and Account Support.‚Äù
Then select ‚ÄúWyze Watch 44.‚Äù I went through a lot of hoops with questions to apply to the problem that were not helpful. When finally asked if I still needed help, I selected ‚ÄúContact Support.‚Äù Then I selected ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù as a means of contact. Once you select ‚ÄúEmail,‚Äù the support topic is already indicated; type in your email address, a subject, your first and last names, and a description of your problem. The product should already say ‚ÄúWyze Watch 44,‚Äù and you don‚Äôt have to indicate accessories. I also didn‚Äôt indicate a choice of ‚ÄúOption‚Äù although I guess you could say ‚ÄúHardware.‚Äù Then add photo attachments if you wish and click ‚ÄúSubmit.‚Äù
After doing this, I received an email response within a half-hour from a support person. This person requested additional information to process my replacement. I did this and within a couple of hours, I received an an auto-email that my replacement was on order. Shortly after that, I received another email from my support person with a pre-paid shipping label attachment and return instructions. I received my replacement within a week.
(FYI: At the time, I inquired about getting a 47 watch rather than another 44 as my replacement but was told they can‚Äôt process exchanges for a different watch because of limited inventory.)
I hope all this helps‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm including a screenshot from when I submitted my support ticket.
So now I‚Äôve been wearing my replacement 44 for almost a month. After reading other posts about second instances of the same battery terminal problem, I‚Äôve been leery. But on top of that, I now can‚Äôt do a firmware update from 3.90 to 3.91. I‚Äôve been checking everyday for the last week and I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm updated. Huh?!? Others have been having this problem, too, but we haven‚Äôt gotten any answers from Wyze. So, I finally decided to abandon my 44. After checking out my husband‚Äôs 47 and seeing how much more functional it is than the 44, I ordered one. Should receive it next week.
The 44 has been such a disappointment overall. Besides major issues (battery terminals), it has a totally different user interface than the 47. The craftsmanship of the 47 is also far superior to the 44. I‚Äôm looking forward to my 47 as a better user experience. I hope.
UPDATE: I should be receiving my 47 today. So as I was boxing up the 44 I received as a replacement for the first one I had that had battery terminal issues, I noticed that the top of one of the battery terminals on the replacement was already starting to distort. I only had this replacement for a month.
Thanks for posting about Wyze‚Äôs unwillingness to substitute the 47 - that was going to be my next step if my second 44 has the same rusting issue as the first. There‚Äôs no way I will buy the 47 though, just out of principle.
Got my replacement watch 44 about 3 weeks ago and looked this morning and it is already rusting. I wore the 1st one all the time except when taking a shower. This new one I left off at night and it rusted faster than the first. Contacted Support and they will let me know what the next step is. Think they need to get the problem fixed before sending out anymore 44‚Äôs. I guess I would take a 47.
Replaced mine around 3 weeks ago, terminals are already being infiltrated and dissolved by my sweat again. I‚Äôve reached out; Wyze has been fair about replacing my products, but between this and the Bulb Color, I‚Äôm losing faith in Wyze as a company. I‚Äôve got as many RMA‚Äôs with this company as I have orders and none of interacting with me as a consumer could have been anywhere near profitable for them. Imagine making a wearable and not checking beforehand that it‚Äôs chemically compatible with humans. We shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for engineering their products for them, even at this price point.
EDIT: Was offered a Wyze Watch 47 as a replacement straight out of the gate. I‚Äôm taking it.
Did you report this to The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission?Decentralization at team level vs. protocol
Distributed networks and decentralization are concepts much older than Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto proved that it was possible to create decentralized value that people could own, share and transfer without a middleman. In doing so, he laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency industry, or if you prefer, blockchain networks. Every public blockchain network needs native coins to enable decentralization itself. Coins may play a different role in each project, but they have one thing in common. It is necessary to ensure their fair distribution.
Imagine you want to start a new decentralized project. What do you need? First of all, someone has to define the goals or mission of the project and its basic parameters. Then, some research and analysis will take place. This is followed by protocol implementation and launch. For many projects, the launch is just the beginning. No protocol in the world can ever be said to be fully complete. On the contrary, each protocol continues to be worked on and developed by a team or community. That said, the most important thing any protocol has is a team. Maintenance, improvements, and new features are never-ending jobs. If the protocol works well, it will find its users. As the number of users grows, the amount and scope of work on the protocol naturally increase.
The team must be paid for their work on the protocol. Some entity or body manages the work on the project and must secure funding. Thus, if a new decentralized project is created, some of the coins usually stay with a foundation or team for protocol development.
Wait a minute. How come we‚Äôre talking about decentralization and some team is working on a protocol. Is this similar to, say, Microsoft working on the Windows operating system? There‚Äôs no way it should be. Every blockchain project should be open source. The IOG team working on Cardano has all the source code public and also all the scientific studies. Nothing is patented. Everything belongs to the community as much as to the team.
Decentralization at the team level is a difficult, if not impossible, thing. It is difficult to decentralize at this level because only a few people, often programmers, deal with a given protocol on a daily basis. Programming, networking, cryptography, and other things are too complex for ordinary people. There will always be a team behind the protocol. Even Bitcoin has a team. Satoshi Nakamoto abruptly left in silence but handed the project over to another programmer. The source code is on GitHub, people report bugs and the team fixes them and works on improvements. Trying to create governance where people understand the problems from the user side and express their opinion which is then implemented by the team is probably the best that can be achieved.
What is important to us is not control over the source code of the protocol, but control over the network consensus and funding of the development. The team delivers new versions of the protocol and the people are the ones who are motivated to keep the network running. This is where we finally get to the debate about project coins.
Decentralization at the network level is done via native coins. In the case of the Cardano protocol, ADA coins are used for this. This means that everyone who holds ADA coins is a so-called stakeholder. Such a person is actively involved in decentralization and network security. The way it works economically is that if there is demand for the coins, the coins have a market value. If a team or foundation also has coins, it has enough resources to develop the protocol. How does the team get to the coins? Either they keep a portion at the very beginning of the project launch, or they secure some stable income at the protocol level. Or some combination of both.
How to fairly launch a new project?
How to start a new project to make coin distribution fair? Clearly, at the source code level, each team can set up exactly what they need at the beginning. Of course, changes can occur in the protocol at any later time, but this should only be in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the community. This allows the team to decide at the beginning how many coins to keep for themselves, for their advisors, or to sell to seed investors. A part of the coins will then be sold publicly. Of course, not all of the coins that will always exist will be sold. Most protocols release new coins into circulation for a defined period of time, or forever. It depends on the monetary policy of each project.
What is most important for a fair launch is a ratio between the coins that are sold to the public at launch and the coins that the team keeps. The team should strive to decentralize the protocol as much as possible. Thus, it cannot keep most of the coins for itself or for Venture Capital (VC). The team should only keep as much coin as is strictly necessary for the first years of the project‚Äôs development. After that, it should secure funding through the collection of transaction fees and some form of decentralized management. We deliberately do not want to define some precise boundary as to when a launch is fair and when it is not. However, we believe that the team should keep less than half of the coins that will be in circulation. The rest of the coins should be sold publicly. Why? As we said, coin owners have control over the network consensus. If the team keeps most of the coins, it will of course also keep control of the network itself. In that case, it is not a decentralized network.
The network must be trustworthy right from the start. Trust in the network should grow over time. The team must not be able to manipulate either the network or the price of coins on the open market. If the majority of people trust the community and, by extension, the network, they buy the project‚Äôs coins. The team must not be able to sell coins in bulk and thereby harm the community. The team should be transparent and publish the address where they keep the coins. This way the community can keep an eye on what is happening with the coins.
The team can keep the coins not only for development but also for other purposes. For example, as airdrops to get the coins out to the public. Also as rewards for those who do something useful for the ecosystem. The team can fund development from volunteers or third parties. However, everything should always be completely transparent and, most importantly, it must not come at the expense of decentralization.
Is Bitcoin the fairest startup project? It‚Äôs hard to say. Satoshi created Bitcoin before it launched, so he may have funded it himself. In the beginning, not many people knew about the project and Satoshi mined a high number of BTC coins himself. The problem is that today we don‚Äôt know if anyone has access to the coins. The fate of the coins is unclear and shrouded in the belief that Satoshi will not spend his coins.
Unfortunately, neither team probably has access to BTC coins. The funding of the Bitcoin project is not transparent. It would be better for Bitcoin if Satoshi gave the coins to the development team. If funding is not clear, teams may struggle to fund research and development. An organization may come in and subsidize only the development that is useful to them without any guarantee that it will also be useful to users. Bitcoin is said to change only slowly. This narrative can mask the fact that there is no funding for development. Development can only be afforded by developers who themselves own large amounts of BTC coins from the beginning of the era. Decentralization at the source code level is a difficult thing to tackle and the only way out is to strive for maximum transparency.
Bitcoin is fair in the sense that every single coin must be mined. No one could decide at the beginning to keep some of the coins for some use. That‚Äôs certainly a nice thing. However, this approach is not possible today unless the project is to be a copy of an existing project. Today, the financing of the team must be taken into account in advance. This is the only way to fund new developments that move the whole industry forward. So the team is essentially doing the best they can. They offer their vision and then implement it.
Digital coins only ever have the market value that people assign to them. The demand for coins reflects the quality of the project. People can judge the team, the partnership, the quality of decentralization, the security, the network capabilities, and many other things. In the beginning, only the vision may be available. In the cryptocurrency world, the quality of projects does not correspond to market capitalization. Some projects are overvalued, others undervalued. That‚Äôs okay because people can‚Äôt make good estimates of the potential of disruptive technologies.
The demand for coins is what will make it possible to fund development. People buy coins and thus give them value. Thus, the coins that are held by the team themselves also have value. The coin holders can be said to support the development of the project.
As we have already indicated, a rogue team can sell the coins, grab the money and disappear forever. People need to be aware of this risk before they buy coins. The longer a project exists and delivers promised features, the more likely it is to stay relevant. Of course, it‚Äôs not just about creating the technology but seeking its adoption. A plan to create a strong community and real adoption must be part of the project. Neither community nor adoption can be bought. Both have to be worked on for the long term.
Cardano has been around since 2015. ADA coins entered the open market in 2017. The team has delivered a working PoS that has been running for over a year at the time of writing. Cardano also has smart contracts. So the team is gradually delivering on everything they promised and doing everything they can to make the development as transparent as possible. Anyone who is interested can follow the development in detail. Cardano definitely has one of the strongest communities in the cryptocurrency space. This is also a guarantee that the project is relevant and not going anywhere.
So how do you fairly launch a new blockchain project? It is fair to keep a reasonable amount of coins for the development of the project. However, most of the coins should be sold to the community on the open market. Subsequently, the team should be as transparent as possible about the disposition of its coins and development. It can be suspicious if the team does not communicate with the argument that they are trying to decentralize the project. The project should be as decentralized as possible at the network level and transparent at the development level.
Note that team members can buy their own coins at the public sale. But that‚Äôs very different from keeping them when you launch a project and then selling them. If they buy them like everyone else, they have to invest their own money in them. So they have skin in the game.
Cardano project coin distribution
The distribution of ADA coin vouchers took place in Asia in four stages between October 2015 and the start of January 2017. The team wanted to avoid potential future problems, so they followed the Know Your Customer guidelines. It was for the first time in the cryptocurrency space. Moreover, an audit was performed on the distribution process.
25,927,070,538 ADA coins were sold to the public. In addition, the Genesis block distributed coins to 3 entities: Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG (IOHK). Cardano Foundation received 648,176,761 ADA, Emurgo received 2,074,165,644 ADA, and IOG received 2,463,071,701 ADA.
The sale made 108,844.5 BTC. Over 8,000 BTC was donated to the Cardano Foundation.
At project start, a total of 31,112,484,646 ADA was distributed. Since the launch of the PoS, new ADA coins have been gradually released into circulation. A further 13,887,515,354 ADA coins will gradually enter circulation until the maximum of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins is reached.
Was the launch of the Cardano project fair? Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG kept 20% of the ADA coins that were in circulation at launch. So 80% of the ADA coins were sold to the public. The network is 80% controlled by the public. Moreover, IOG does not operate its own staking pools. The team has plenty of funding for research and development.
What is the distribution of coins in other projects?
An interesting review was recently done by the Messari team. Cardano is one of the champions when it comes to fair coin distribution at launch. Many similar projects have publicly sold a relatively small amount of coins and the teams are still the majority owners of the projects.
Each project has its own coin release strategy and its own reasons for retaining control of the network. The reasons can be quite pragmatic. As long as the team has control of the network, it cannot happen that the network is attacked by a 51% attack from the outside. The team can wait to sell the coins until it is sure that the coins will be distributed fairly among the people.
The distribution of coins will be lowest at the beginning and will increase over time. The opposite would be strange. If coins are used to distribute decision-making power, as in PoS networks, it is important that the number of coin holders grows. Ideally, there should not be many influential whales in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, no system can do without entities that hold large numbers of coins. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they got the coins cheaply at the beginning or later. Anyone with enough money can become a whale in any ecosystem.
It is in the interest of the projects to spontaneously increase the number of coin holders. This is easier if the coins are in circulation from the start. It is likely that the whales will gradually sell their coins to newcomers. The value of the coins may fluctuate or even decline if the whales sell and there is no demand for the coins. It is always a good idea to look at the rich list to track the distribution of coins over time.
If a team holds, say, 80% of the coins and decides to sell a larger share, it is clear that the value of the remaining 20% of coins in circulation can drop dramatically. It is important to remember that the decision to sell is made by a single entity and one that knows exactly where the project stands.
In Cardano‚Äôs case, stakeholders hold the coins for the most part, so they directly determine the value of ADA coins with their next purchase or sale. Importantly, the team, by the number of coins they hold, may not materially affect the value of the coins by their eventual sale. Moreover, if the team did so and moved the coins from their publicly available address, others would notice.
Coins and decentralization
Satoshi‚Äôs plan was that anyone could mine BTC coins. In the beginning, all you had to do was let your computer mine and after a while, you received a reward. This is an important principle. The opportunity to earn coins for doing important work for the network should be open to everyone as much as possible. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case with Bitcoin, as the cost of entry has increased and the environment is too competitive for everyone to succeed. PoW mining favors powerful entities more than domestic miners. As a result, interested parties have to buy BTC coins on the open market. Unfortunately, this does not decentralize the network, it only increases the price of coins. This increases the security budget, which is also important.
Cardano uses PoS in such a way that decentralization grows with the distribution of coins. Everyone likes to get rewards from staking, so you can basically earn coins in a very similar way to PoW mining. By holding and delegating coins to a pool for the network you are doing useful work. The coins in the staking are not available on the market, so this stabilizes their market value, which tends to rise. The growth in value of ADA coins sells 51% of the attack. Importantly, there is almost no entry cost. You just have to buy the coins. Anyone can do this according to their financial capabilities and preferences. No one is disadvantaged based on their location.
Almost no one knew about Bitcoin in the beginning, so maybe no one thought to invest in an attack. The network had little economic or social impact. Now it‚Äôs different. Hackers are trying to attack every old and new network and make money from it. So a newly launched project has to be secure and economically hard to attack right from the start. When Cardano switched to PoS consensus, the coin distribution and market value were such that it was a safe move. There was a huge interest in running pools and staking, and that interest continues to this day. So the decentralization and security of the project are growing. This naturally also increases the confidence of newcomers in the project.
PoW networks are not decentralized based on the number of coin holders. The coin distribution is only interesting from the perspective of being able to influence the value through large sales. Furthermore, the meaning of the coins themselves must be taken into account. For some projects, growth in the number of coin holders is more important than for other projects.
The current development of many projects is that coins can serve as a governance tool. This makes sense, as who else but the users themselves should be able to make requests and express their opinion on the team. The team should not be the one doing whatever it wants at a certain stage of the project. On the contrary, it should be an entity that is driven from the outside by the community. Getting to this state is extremely difficult, and fair coin distribution is an essential prerequisite. If the team holds the majority of the coins, it can make decisions on critical issues on its own.
The topic of decentralized project management is still in its infancy and not much is said about it. It is clear that the team needs to deliver some basic protocol functionality at the beginning and there is no point in talking too much about it. However, after some time the will of the community should have more strength. The team or community should propose changes and vote on them. The team will be in the role of executor of the will of the majority. As we said, decentralization at the team level is difficult, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that teams won‚Äôt pursue it. The use of coins seems logical.
Conclusion
In the cryptocurrency space, you sometimes hear the opinion that it is impossible to fairly launch a new decentralized project. Many of these arguments don‚Äôt make sense, and if you want to be critical, you will find problems with any project, including Bitcoin. Satoshi is not the only one who is a BTC whale. There may be more similar entities and their coins will be slow to enter circulation. Every project launch rewards those at the very beginning the most. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not much we can do about that. In the real world, it‚Äôs exactly the same. But let‚Äôs not make an idol of one project and say that something can‚Äôt be done again.
Cardano has had a fair coin distribution from the very beginning. Staking works on the basis of being able to buy ADA coins on the open market. You can‚Äôt earn coins incrementally as you can with PoW networks. First, you have to have coins, then you can earn more as a reward. Buying ADA coins is your skin in the game. The coin distribution is dependent on network consensus, and the IOG team probably did it the best they could at the time.
Cardano‚Äôs network is under stakeholder control and the team has minimal influence on the consensus. This cannot be said of other projects in many cases. Always be interested in how much control the team has over the coins. If it is high, consider well what that means for you. Venture Capital won‚Äôt like Cardano because the community already owns it. Those who want a stake need to buy ADA coins on the open market. Fair enough.

The focus was on procedures to improve the skills needed to maintain laboratory equipment and procure services, supplies and equipment that would optimize administrative, technical and operational efficiency of laboratories.
In addition, there was the objective of enabling cytology laboratories to provide more efficient, high-quality services to support an integrated and programmatic approach to the prevention and control of cervical cancer. Implementation of the strategic plan for cervical cancer prevention and control in the Caribbean, aims to reduce cervical cancer mortality and decrease invasive cancer incidence.
The main outcomes of the laboratory systems section were:
- Production of regional procurement and inventory management guidelines based on guidelines and Acts promulgated in various Caribbean countries. The guidelines incorporate internationally accepted procurement procedures as advocated by procurement professionals and training institutions (CIPS, MIND).
- Persons (176) from laboratories, procurement units, and central medical stores trained in Procurement and Inventory management during workshops of 1 to 5 days duration. 15 participants from one workshop qualified through voluntarily written examination to apply for certification as Certified Purchasing Personnel from American Certification Institute and the American Purchasing Society
- Project report on a comparative study, as a result of collaboration with Aruba of procurement procedures and regulations in six countries chosen for size and language (English, Dutch, Spanish).
- Laboratory analysts and biomedical engineers and technicians trained to advocate that Standard bidding documents and Purchasing contracts specify that the manufacturer provide factory training for biomedical personnel as an integral component for evaluating Bids and awarding contracts. They were trained to establish planned preventive maintenance schedules and monitor implementation of service contracts by suppliers.
Formation of Biomedical Professionals Association of the Caribbean (BiPAC) to facilitate:
- Continuing education of BMs
- Advocacy to regional training institutions for establishment of programmes for biomedical engineering starting at the technician level
- Establishment or deepening of relationships with other engineering and health professionals regionally and internationally

They are lovable, incredibly loyal and can be a joy to be around. However, this can take a little bit of work in the form of training. If you think you‚Äôre going to get a perfect, well-behaved and trained dog from the start, you might be in for a rude awakening.
It can often take weeks, or even months, of work to train your dog to the level you are comfortable with. Also, not all dogs will take well to training and the process can be difficult, especially for new dog owners. In an effort to help those who might be struggling, or who have never trained a dog before, this article is going to go over some helpful dog training basics.
Use Treats, But Don‚Äôt Rely on Them Forever
One of the most powerful tools you have as a dog owner are treats. There are few things dogs love more than treats, and offering treats as a reward (or bribe) is often an easy way to get the dog to exhibit the behaviors you want. This makes treats a great tool to use during training. Rewarding a desirable action by your dog is a great way to encourage them to repeat the behavior.
You can even use treats for training when you are gone from the home. There now exist cameras that not only let you check in on your dog when you‚Äôre out, but they can also dispense treats. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more, be sure to check out this link: Furry Friends Gear / dog camera that dispenses treats.
However, it is important to use the treats more as a reward, than as a bribe. Keep treats hidden until they have completed the desired action, so they aren‚Äôt only completing the action to get the treat. You will eventually want to stop using treats altogether once the dog will complete the action without needing the reward.
Be Patient and Stay Positive
Having patience is always important, but this is especially true when training your dog. It would be nice if dogs learned how to be perfectly behaved in a matter of hours, but that is not the case. It can sometimes take months for dogs to be trained on certain things like where to do their business or how to obey commands.
All dogs learn at their own pace, and it is important to give them time. Trying to rush your dog, getting upset or simply giving up will only extend the time it takes to train them, so it is best to stay calm, patient and positive. If you notice yourself getting frustrated with your dog, it is best to cut the training session short and try a bit later.
Keep Your Dog Focused
Ensuring that your dog can stay focused during the training is also important. Dogs, especially young puppies, are notorious for getting distracted by noises, other pets, moving objects or even their own reflection. If your dog is constantly being distracted during training, they simply won‚Äôt be able to absorb the information you are trying to pass on to them.
Try to train at a time that is quiet, and in a room with minimal distractions. Also, training your dog in short 15-minute sessions is another good way to ensure they stay focused. If the training sessions are too long and drawn out, the dog could become restless or simply begin to be uncooperative.
Training a dog can be a difficult task, but the basic tips covered in this blog post will surely help. By using treats, be patient and making sure your dog stays focused, training your dog doesn‚Äôt have to be difficult.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), self-reported cognitive decline is on the rise as the U.S. population ages. Although subjective cognitive decline (SCD) does not mean an individual has Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease or related dementias, it can be an indicating factor. As the need for health and social services grows with the senior population, the CDC is urging public health officials to proactively mitigate the potential boom in SCD.
The Spectrum of Cognitive Decline
Cognitive decline can range from mild impairment with age to dementia, which interferes with activities of daily living. Minor decline ‚Äî like forgetting a name ‚Äî can be normal with age. But with severe decline, individuals may not be able to perform routine tasks or even care for themselves. Educating older adults at risk for cognitive impairment can help them get ahead of modifiable risk factors and encourage earlier assessment and intervention.
Subjective Cognitive Decline Statistics
With self-confusion being reported more often, the CDC recently collected data from community-dwelling adults 45 years or older across 49 states and Puerto Rico through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
Some of their findings included:
- Approximately 1 in 9 adults experiences subjective cognitive decline
- 24.7% of those with SCD at ages 45‚Äì65 reported living alone, with 36.2% of those 65 or older
- Less than half of adults with SCD had discussed memory loss or confusion with a health care professional
- More than 1 in 4 adults with SCD reported having coronary heart disease or stroke
- 66.2% of adults with SCD reported having two or more chronic diseases
Frequent mental distress, defined as chronic mental stress of having 14 mentally unhealthy days in a 30-day period, was also reported in approximately one-third of surveyed adults with SCD, with 37.6% of women reporting distress compared to 29.4% of men.
Living with Subjective Cognitive Decline
Functional difficulties are also a part of subjective cognitive decline. Things like performing chores, taking medications, maintaining socialization, and giving up household activities are also byproducts of self-reported impairment. Public health education and early intervention can improve the health and wellbeing of people experiencing SCD. That should include raising awareness about dementia and providing regular cognitive assessments as part of routine doctor‚Äôs office visits.

The Latest EdTech News To Your InboxLondon, May 20 (IANS) Time spent by asthma patients soaking up the sun may help in the treatment of the illness, a research has said.
A team of scientists at King‚Äôs College London said vitamin D, which is made by the body in sunlight, calms an ‚Äúover-active‚Äù part of the immune system in asthma, BBC reported.
However, treating patients with vitamin D has not yet been tested.
People with asthma find it hard to breathe when their airways become inflamed, swollen and narrowed.
Most people are treated with steroids, but the drugs do not work for everyone.
‚ÄúWe know people with high levels of vitamin D are better able to control their asthma ‚Äì that connection is quite striking,‚Äù researcher Catherine Hawrylowicz told BBC.
The group investigated the impact of the vitamin on a chemical in the body, interleukin-17.
The chemical is a vital part of the immune system and helps to fight off infections.
However, it can cause problems when levels get too high and has been strongly implicated in asthma.
In.
Catherine Hawrylowicz said a culture of covering up in the sun and using sun cream may have increased asthma rates, but also said that ‚Äútoo much sun is bad for you‚Äù.Time is starting to slow down again.
In the first trimester, it would go SOOOO SLOWLY ‚Äì mostly because every moment is riddled with anxiety and nervousness and fear about if you‚Äôll make it through to the 2nd trimester. 2nd trimester goes by at a normal pace. You‚Äôre worrying WAY less‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve managed to let off some steam by letting people know the good news (and bad because now you can be all sorts of sick and anxious w/o feeling self conscious). But then the ramp up to the big show begins. The 3rd trimester is just out of touch and I feel that I‚Äôve been at this 25 / 26 week mark now for about 3 weeks. LOL It‚Äôs in my nature to rush things along‚Ä¶ I guess ever since I was a little child, plaguing my mom with questions about what it‚Äôs like to be a grown up and what it would be like to have my period and what it would be like to get married and move out and have a job and not be in school anymore. You would think by now that I‚Äôd have the time and patience to just wait for stuff. Trop presse pas fait jour l‚Äôouvrie. I know mommy. I‚Äôm learning to be more patient.
I had a SERIOUS bout of missing her last night. My dear sweet godsend of a hubby decided it was time to ‚Äútackle the office‚Äù ‚Äì he‚Äôs not a pack rat. AT ALL. But I am. And he witnessed how bad it can get by having to help my parents through their packrat-ism. Or at least my mom. Dad wasn‚Äôt so bad with his‚Ä¶ but he also wasn‚Äôt as willing as Earl to help mom dig out. So every month or so, he dedicates a good amount of time to helping me dig out of my own paper grave. The office has been stacked up with stuff for a while. Originally, we were going to clear it out to make room for a nursery. But we cannot, no matter what we do, control the temperature in that half of the apartment. So the nights that it‚Äôs cold‚Ä¶ our little baby would freeze. And summer nights, she would bake to death. So we‚Äôll have her in our bedroom until we move out. But he wanted the office to be clear because as my belly gets bigger ‚Äì it‚Äôs MUCH harder for me to scrunch over and do the freelance work I need to do over my computer. So he dug out the space around my old computer (did a FANTASTIC job) but in the process unearthed some more memories that I wasn‚Äôt quite ready to see yesterday. A small white envelope that has seen it‚Äôs share of wear and tear. On the outside in crude black marker it exclaimed ‚ÄúTo My Mother: The Maker Of ME‚Äù This was obviously one of my many exercises in learning to write‚Ä¶ so I had to be about 5 or 6 years old. In my brief homemade thank you card written on a 3 x 5 piece of index card in blue pen I thanked for all that she‚Äôd done for me: ‚Äúmaking me, giving me life, buying my toys‚Äù and professed that she ‚Äúmade life so satisfying‚Äù and that I loved her. (silly me with my big words). I broke down. This is the reason I don‚Äôt give cards anymore. It seems terrible of me.
When grandma died and we had to go through her apartment, there was a huge envelope ‚Äì you know for those absurdly large greeting cards that they sell at Hallmark. We‚Äôd given her one of those through the years. But inside that envelope was ANY AND EVERY CARD my brother, my mom and I had ever given the woman. And in all the years of writing these cards, I never thought for ONE MINUTE that I‚Äôd be taking them back. It warmed my heart to know that they meant so much that she kept them all (i mean ALL of them). But it hurt too profoundly to have to reclaim them.
So i cried for a good while yesterday, missing mommy with all my heart. Wishing she was here. I had way less lonely moments when she was around because she was always available to just chat about nothing.. or let me listen to her watch tv. But this bottomless feeling is just without resolve. At the end of the tears and the feeling sorry for myself and the wishing I could call her ‚Äì there‚Äôs no resolution. I‚Äôm still without her and always will be, no matter how many tears or breath taking sobs. No amount of pain I‚Äôll feel will revive her ‚Ä¶ or wake me out of this reality where she‚Äôs actually still here with me. And every day, more of her shows up in me that I can‚Äôt control; good things‚Ä¶ bad things. All her.
2 more weeks until the 3rd trimester. Maybe I‚Äôll learn to slow down and document everything happening so that I can regale the little one with tales of her arrival and focus less on the pain and sadness.

8 Item(s)TRYOUTS - The tryouts for the U22 Eagles 2022 season will take place in late April (once we are given the go ahead from the town to play on the fields). If you are interested in trying out, you MUST complete the tryout registration. Registering ensures that all waivers are completed in advance and that I have an accurate list of players that are interested in trying out. I can then reach out and share announcements to that list. If you don't register, you may not get important messages regarding the tryout dates. Note that there is a $20 registration fee for tryouts. Gathering from those coming back, the new crop coming up, and messages from players who didn't play this year, we should have a large number interested in trying out. This means it will be a tough lineup to crack but it may also mean we can field a second U22 team if the numbers are there. Don't let the numbers discourage you from trying out.
FALL WORKOUTS - We will be hosting fall workouts for any players that are around and are interested in trying out for the U22 team. If you are local, please consider attending. You must register for tryouts to be able to attend the fall workouts. There are two dates:
Sunday, September 12, 1pm @ TSP3
Saturday, September 18, 1pm @ TSP3
If you are away and unable to make it, it will NOT IMPACT your ability to try out in April. I just want to get a sense of who wants to play.
Paul Alves of since age 5. Should you stay at university for an Honours year, or should you try to make your mark in the elusive world of full-time employment?
Well, I‚Äôm here to help inform your decision! I recently finished my Honours year at UOW. I wrote my thesis about meme warfare ‚Äì hmu on Twitter if you want to read it (pls). I had an awesome experience and am really glad I chose to do it. But I also know that an Honours year is not for everyone. With this in mind, I‚Äôve listed my top 5 things to consider before undertaking an Honours year.
- Do it for a reason. An Honours year isn‚Äôt something you should do just because it feels easier to stay at uni for longer
and keep getting cenno payments hehe‚Äì trust me, it isn‚Äôt easy. Despite the minimal contact hours, you have to do a huge amount of reading, writing, and generally hard work. This shouldn‚Äôt be too much of an issue if you have genuine passion for your topic though. So before you apply, think seriously about what you want to get out of the experience. My supervisor, Ted, suggested that I use my Honours year either to enter into academia or to position myself for my desired career path. I think this was a great piece of advice and would encourage everyone to take it on board. If you‚Äôre going to invest time and money into an extra year of university, you should be aiming to actually get something out of it.
- Research something that actually matters, both to you and the world. Obviously your thesis topic is totally up to you and your supervisor, but I would strongly advise that you choose something that has relevance and application in the world outside of the university bubble. There‚Äôs not much point working hard on a thesis for a whole year for it to only be read by your markers and your supervisor. If you want to use your thesis to start your desired career path, this point is particularly relevant ‚Äì there‚Äôs definitely more leeway if you‚Äôre wanting to pursue a career in academia. If you struggle to think of a relevant topic that you have an interest in, an Honours year may not be for you.
- You will have to make sacrifices. A lot of people cruise through their undergraduate degrees partying first and studying second, still managing to achieve good grades. Honours isn‚Äôt like that. Before applying, consider the things you might need to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to and whether you have the discipline and self-control to actually follow through. For me, this meant reducing my alcohol consumption significantly, while still maintaining some semblance of a social life. I also took a month off work to finish writing my thesis in April. If you‚Äôre willing to make these kinds of sacrifices, the process of writing your thesis shouldn‚Äôt be the nightmarish hellscape it‚Äôs often made out to be. I can honestly say that because I had discipline and motivation, I never once pulled an all-nighter or had an emotional breakdown while finishing my thesis ‚Äì yes, this is actually possible!
- Don‚Äôt worry about whether or not you are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough. You definitely don‚Äôt need to be a genius to do an Honours year, nor to gain full-time employment. I believe you only need a credit average to be accepted, so don‚Äôt stress! I remember feeling so overwhelmed in the first few weeks of Honours because I was worried that my writing wasn‚Äôt academic enough (what does that word even mean?). I made the mistake of comparing my writing to others, which made me feel inadequate. Avoid this! As long as you work hard and take feedback onboard, you should be fine. I spent the whole year with the concern in the back of my mind that my writing wasn‚Äôt good enough, and I managed to get First Class! So, do not let ‚Äúsmart‚Äù impact your decision whatsoever.
- Prepare for your world view to challenged. Should you choose to do an Honours year, you‚Äôll be exposed to a vast range of different viewpoints on your topic, which you probably think you already know a lot about. This is particularly relevant for our faculty, because you‚Äôll likely be reading about media, people, and society as a whole. My thesis involved a lot of psychology reading, which radically shifted the way I view people‚Äôs interactions with themselves, each other, and the media. At first it was actually kind of scary and isolating, because I knew my perception of reality had become very different from those of the people around me. I eventually realised this was a good thing ‚Äì but that‚Äôs another story entirely. üòâ What I‚Äôm trying to say is, don‚Äôt go into it thinking your thesis is just going to reaffirm your existing beliefs. It‚Äôs going to challenge them, and that‚Äôs a good thing!
That brings us to the end of my list of things to consider before undertaking an Honours year. I‚Äôll end with an important tip: whichever option you choose, just have fun with it and try not to stress too much! One of the
very few benefits of living in the modern world is that you don‚Äôt have to commit to one job or career path for the rest of your life. There‚Äôs a gazillion different jobs out there for us BCM graduates, and you can always return for further study later in life. I hope this list has helped with your decision! Feel free to DM me on Twitter if you have any questions.
Oh, and one last piece of advice‚Ä¶DO YOUR REFERENCES WHILE YOU ARE WRITING THE THESIS! Trust me on this one.
Meg x).: "Jimmy" - light grey watercolor effect, white.The DUP‚Äôs pact with the Conservatives, intended to reinforce their unionist position, has backfired.
WHAT‚ÄôS HAPPENING?
Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland, will step down at a time of heightened tension over the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
KEY INSIGHTS
‚Äì Foster‚Äôs departure comes at a critical time for UK unionism, as increased support for Irish nationalism and the prospect of a united Ireland are working against the DUP‚Äôs political prospects
‚Äì Unionists are upset by the increased trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol
‚Äì Irish reunification is likely in the long-term if the DUP‚Äôs main rival, Sinn F√©in, gains a majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly in next year‚Äôs elections
Arlene Foster will step down in June as leader of the conservative pro-union Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland, a role she has held since 2016. Foster‚Äôs departure comes after recent party infighting over the DUP‚Äôs role in crafting the Northern Ireland Protocol and the subsequent Brexit trade barriers that have angered DUP voters. In announcing her resignation, Foster said the DUP had changed as a party and was moving ‚Äòin a different direction.‚Äô Some 80% of the DUP‚Äôs representatives in the House of Commons and in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Stormont, have signed a letter of no-confidence in Foster and Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has already announced his intention to run for the party‚Äôs leadership.
Foster‚Äôs departure comes amid increasing unrest in Northern Ireland over the terms of Northern Ireland‚Äôs post-Brexit settlement. The unrest has been led by unionists who disagree with the Northern Ireland Protocol and the barriers it has raised between Belfast and the rest of the UK. Increased support for Irish nationalism and growing support for the Irish republican party Sinn F√©in are also working against the DUP. Foster‚Äôs exit comes at a critical juncture for the DUP and unionism, and the upcoming leadership battle is likely to reflect the DUP‚Äôs splintered camps.

Brexit formed many unlikely political alliances and the DUP notably entered a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservative Party in order to resolve a hung parliament after the 2017 UK general election. Just two years later, the 2019 general election gave more seats in Westminster to Irish nationalist parties than unionist parties for the first time in history. While still holding the most seats in Stormont, the DUP‚Äôs appeal began to wane and the Conservatives received a landslide majority in Westminster. This allowed the Conservatives to govern under current Prime Minister Boris Johnson without formal DUP support, and Johnson was willing to tackle some of the thorny Northern Ireland issues that former prime minister Theresa May had avoided.
The DUP‚Äôs support of May‚Äôs government had been criticised by both Labour and Conservative members as threatening the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended the three decades of violence in Northern Ireland known as Troubles. While allied with the Conservatives, the DUP was instrumental in crafting May‚Äôs Brexit policy, which had to address where to establish post-Brexit customs barriers between the EU and the UK in Ireland. To retain the DUP‚Äôs support, May pledged to avoid a customs border in the Irish Sea. However, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement negotiated by May‚Äôs successor Boris Johnson, the Northern Ireland Protocol established a customs border in the Irish Sea rather than create a hard land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. A hard border would have jeopardised the Good Friday Agreement and angered dissident republicans who never accepted the full terms of the Agreement and continue to wage a sporadic low-level insurgency.
Although republicans have been largely satisfied by the absence of a hard border, unionists are becoming increasingly incensed by trade barriers and customs checks with the rest of the UK. The DUP has launched a legal challenge against the Northern Ireland Protocol and is urging the measure be removed by MPs in Westminster. As the legal fight continues, Foster‚Äôs leadership was seen by her critics as harming the unionist cause and unwittingly feeding into the hands of republicans.
CHANGING TIDES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER

Changing demographics and increased support for Irish nationalism post-Brexit suggests an uphill battle for the DUP and unionism in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland‚Äôs nationalist Catholic population is growing at a much faster rate than the Protestant population, leading to calls for increased devolution of political power from London. In the short term, further unrest is likely in unionist areas if a power vacuum occurs, and republicans, led by Sinn F√©in, advocate for more control in Northern Ireland politics. The Northern Ireland Executive, as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, has power sharing allocations for both unionists and nationalist parties. Even if Sinn F√©in gains more seats than the DUP, unionists would still retain leadership posts of several ministries and positions within the Executive. Northern Ireland‚Äôs other nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), as well as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which was Northern Ireland‚Äôs main unionist party prior to the DUP‚Äôs ascent, will also play a critical role in the makeup of the executive. Sinn Fein and the SDLP both favour Irish reunification, while the UUP has a much longer historical relationship with the Conservative Party but has been institutionally separate since 1972. The UUP has lost influence in both Belfast and Westminster, where it has not held any seats since 2017. As such, Northern Ireland‚Äôs future is likely to be guided by Sinn Fein and the DUP, with the SDLP playing a prominent role in support of Sinn Fein‚Äôs agenda.
In the long term, Irish reunification is likely if the unionist cause continues to suffer setbacks, especially if Sinn F√©in gains more seats than the DUP in the Northern Ireland Executive. Irish reunification remains more popular in the Republic of Ireland than in Northern Ireland, where according to a recent poll only 35% of voters are in favour. Should Sinn F√©in grab the first minister‚Äôs post, Irish reunification would likely be on their agenda, and the demographic and ideological swings away from unionism are likely to prove to be powerful driving political forces. The DUP would risk advocating for an unattainable future, surrounded by pro-EU nationalist forces in both Ireland and Scotland, and a voting bloc pressing for change.
In joining with the Conservatives in 2017, the DUP sought to influence Brexit policy and increase its visibility in Westminster. Ironically, the DUP now risks becoming politically inert and unable to enforce its own agenda amidst changing demographic and political tides. Northern Ireland is in a very different place when compared to the height of the Troubles and the unionist cause is now likely to be more virulent and violent than the republican one. Republicans have made material political gains and Sinn F√©in‚Äôs growth reflects cross-border Irish confidence over identity and nationalism that is non-violent and in favour of a European future. In contrast, the DUP‚Äôs cause is in support of a union that is dramatically weakened post-Brexit and unlikely to appeal to younger voters. Younger voters are increasingly turning to Sinn F√©in, are in favour of EU membership, and largely object to the DUP‚Äôs socially conservative policies. As such, the DUP‚Äôs future is more existential, and the unionist identity risks becoming yet another casualty of the raucous and divisive Brexit debate.*Swipe left to view more

How often should men‚Äôs haircuts be perfected at the barber shop? It‚Äôs a common question among men with a short answer: 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your hair grows and the haircut you desire. Yes, some men grow out their hair, but even longer manes need to be shaped and styled. The perfect look [‚Ä¶]Back to school means back to packing lunches, and the last thing you want to hear from your kids is ‚ÄúPB&J/ham and cheese/tuna again?‚Äù But, as annoying as it is, we see their point: These stalwart sandwiches get old after a while.
So, whether you‚Äôre looking for fresh ideas, your family has gone paleo or gluten-free or you‚Äôre simply out of bread right now (happens to the best of us), try one of these no-bread options. The kids won‚Äôt even miss it.
Bits and Kabobs
You may associate kabobs with summer barbecues, and if you‚Äôve still got those going on during back-to-school season, great. If not, rescue extra wood skewers by breaking them in half and spearing the meat of your choice (saut√©ed chicken breasts or thighs, cubed deli meats and beef all work), Applegate Naturals¬Æ American-Style Colby Cheese and kid-friendly raw veggies like cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. Repeat until the skewer is covered and with each skewer thereafter. Pack with a small container of mustard, balsamic vinaigrette or other favorite sauce for dipping.
Turkey-Egg Roll-Ups
Omelets are not only a breakfast food. You can actually use them in lieu of bread to create a lunchtime ‚Äúwrap.‚Äù Start by preparing your omelet in a nonstick pan, adding any grated cheese, chopped veggies and herbs you like. Let cool. Lay non-GMO Applegate Organics¬Æ Oven Roasted Turkey Breast atop the omelet and roll up. Wrap in parchment paper for less-messy eating.
Ants on a Tree Ring
Peanut butter and raisins never go out of style. Instead of serving them as a snack on celery, use these ingredients as the filling for a meal of mini apple ‚Äúsandwiches.‚Äù Core an apple and slice into rounds half an inch thick. Spread peanut butter on one round, sprinkle on raisins and close with a similar-size round. Repeat until you have enough sandwiches ‚Äî you may need another apple.
Avocado Boats
Let creamy, healthy-fat-filled avocados take the place of potatoes as a delicious base for any hearty filling. Slice an avocado in half and carefully remove the pit with a sharp knife. Stuff with beans and chopped tomatoes and drizzle with salsa or sour cream for a taco-like veggie option. For a protein-rich version, fill with chicken salad, tuna salad or egg salad.
Deviled Eggs With Hummus
You don‚Äôt have to wait until Easter for a more wholesome take on deviled eggs. Simply hard-boil eggs, peel and cut in half. Remove yolks and mix them with your favorite ingredients ‚Äî mustard, vinegar, spices ‚Äî to create the filling, swapping in hummus where the recipe calls for mayonnaise. Use a teaspoon to refill the egg whites, and pack them with a side of veggies (sliced peppers, baby carrots, celery, grape tomatoes etc.) and hummus.

The OECD wrote in its annual report on Iceland that targeting households that are in real financial distress would be the most effective way to minimize the risk of default, resulting in the greatest economic benefit, The Economic Times reports. The organisation further warned that broad tax cuts could undermine public finances.
The ruling Progressive Party made household debt relief the cornerstone of their election platform prior to being elected on 27 April. The party has yet to reveal just what their debt relief plan looks like, but will be releasing details later this summer. According to the OECD report 48% of Icelandic homes have difficulty making ends meet each month.

The Federal Government has warned specialized institutions in the country, which have been running programmes that are not in conformity with their mandates, to stop such with immediate effect.
In a statement on Sunday, the government directed that such universities should stick to their core mandates for which they were set up and desist from running programmes which have no bearing to their names and foundation.
It described as unfortunate a situation where universities of agriculture offered programmes in Law and management courses such as Accounting, Banking and Finance, Business Administration, among others, and most of these institution go as far as changing the nomenclature of the courses, a situation where they have now have Banking Engineering, Accounting Technology among others.
The statement by the spokesman for the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, stated that the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, had directed JAMB ‚Äúto delete all such courses on its portal.‚Äù
He added that all candidates desirous of sitting the 2017 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, the statement advised, ‚Äúshould not be hoodwinked into such programmes as they are illegal and are not provided for in JAMB brochure.
He described specialised universities as those set up to pursue specific courses and programmes to generate manpower in particular sectors of the economy.
He said, ‚ÄúSome of these specialised institutions include universities of agriculture, universities of technologies and universities of medicine, amongst others.
The Federal Government has observed that these institutions have derailed from their statutory responsibilities, thereby running programmes that are antithetical to their mandates.
The government notes the unfortunate situation where Universities of Agriculture offer programmes in Law, management courses such as Accounting, Banking and Finance, Business Administration, among others.
It described this as aberration which must stop with immediate effect.The welfare state and the so-called war on poverty has been very bad news for taxpayers.
But it‚Äôs also very bad news for poor people, in part because various redistribution programs can lure them out of the productive economy and into total dependency on government (and this will become an even bigger problem if Biden‚Äôs per-child handouts are approved).
But it‚Äôs also bad news because redistribution programs can result in very high implicit tax rates for low-income people who try to improve their lives by climbing the economic ladder.
I shared an example back in 2012, which showed how a single mother in Pennsylvania would be worse off with $57,000 of income instead of $29,000.
In other words, she would be dealing with a de facto marginal tax rate of more than 100 percent.
If you want to understand how this happens, Professors Craig Richardson and Richard McKenzie wrote about this topic in an article for The Library of Economics and Liberty.
‚Ä¶by expanding public assistance programs, the President‚Äôs plan will unavoidably impose a higher, hidden tax rate‚Äîknown as an ‚Äúimplicit marginal income tax rate‚Äù (which we shorten to implicit tax rate)‚Äîon low-wage workers who receive welfare benefits. Those workers will pay an implicit tax rate because many welfare benefits are reduced as earnings rise. Ironically, the poorest Americans often pay implicit tax rates that are far higher than the IRS‚Äôs explicit marginal income-tax rates imposed on the country‚Äôs highest income earners. ‚Ä¶Consider a household that receives benefits from only two welfare programs, with one tapering off at 20 cents for each added dollar earned and another tapering off at 40 cents for each added dollar earned. Those cuts create an implicit tax rate of 60 percent, which means the worker has only 40 cents in additional spendable income for each added dollar earned. This implicit tax rate can be expected to affect work incentives in much the same way that a federal income tax rate does.
The authors cite a real-world example.
‚Ä¶consider a real-life, low-income single mother of two children in Forsyth County, North Carolina earning $10 an hour in a full-time job, which means she has a monthly earned income of $1,600 (or $19,200 annually). Suppose the single mother receives monthly benefits from five welfare programs: $425 in food stamps, $1,471 in subsidized childcare, $370 in housing subsidies, $180 in WIC benefits, and $493 in an earned income tax credit (EITC). Her monthly welfare benefits will total $2,939 (or $35,271 a year). Now, suppose the single mother takes a new job paying $15 an hour, a 50 percent increase. Her monthly earned income will rise by $800 to $2,400 (with her annual income rising to $28,800 a year, an annual earnings increase of $9,600). However, she will face decreases in four out of her five monthly benefit streams, with each benefit reduction based on the same $800-increase in earnings (a problem known among welfare researchers as the ‚Äúcumulative stacked effect‚Äù). The single mother will lose $231 in food stamps, $80 in childcare benefits, $216 in housing benefits, and $166 in EITC. Her total decrease in monthly benefits will reach $694 (which means her annual benefit total will drop by $8,328).4 Her implicit tax rate on her added monthly earnings of $800 is 87 percent‚Äîmore than two times the highest explicit marginal tax rate proposed for the rich. ‚Ä¶In addition, the single mother will be required to pay an added $185 a month in federal and state income taxes on her added earned monthly income of $800, which is an explicit tax rate of 23 percent. Adding the 87 percent implicit tax rate to the 23 percent explicit tax rate leads to an overall tax rate of 110 percent. Her raise has left her $79 per month poorer in lost wages and benefits‚Äîsurely a strong disincentive for her to take the higher paying job.
Here‚Äôs a table showing those results.

And the same problem exists in other nations as well.
P.S. Obamacare may have lured as many as 2 million people into full dependency.
P.P.S. I already mentioned how Biden‚Äôs per-child handouts could lure many more into full dependency, but ‚Äúbasic income‚Äù could be far worse."No attached devices" for Xiaomi Redmi 4X

Less than a week after Doctor Who fans learned who would be appearing on stage in the immersive West End production Doctor Who: Time Fracture, they can now add two major powerhouse names to that list. David Bradley and John Barrowman are reprising their respective roles as William Hartnell's First Doctor and Captain Jack Harkness in pre-recorded cameo appearances. "This is going to be something really special. Anyone who sees the show who is not a Doctor Who fan when they go in, surely will be when they come out! It's going to be an amazing experience," said Brad design by Rebecca Brower, with James Goss on board as a show lore consultant and script editor. Previews are set to begin on May 26, with the show expected to debut in Summer 2021.
Now here's a look at Bradley and Barrowman discussing their returns to their beloved respective roles and why Time Fracture represents a bold creative direction by the franchise to further connect with the fans: are also set to appear in the production..
"The first day of rehearsals has finally arrived and we're so excited to bring the story of Doctor Who: Time Fracture to life over the coming weeks. The response to our application process has been overwhelming, as was the talent we met at our carefully managed audition process, said director Tom Maller. "We are delighted with our cast who are all ready for an intensive rehearsal period before we finally welcome audiences into Unit HQ from the first preview on 26 May." Now here's a look at the cast and their personal connections to the long-running BBC series:Introduction
The good treats of God ‚Äì Do you desire the good treats that God has for you?
Trick or treat? In last week‚Äôs sermon ‚Äì Not Falling for the Devil‚Äôs Tricks ‚Äì you will recall that I opened my sermon with that familiar Halloween phrase of trick or treat. I then went on to preach about mankind‚Äôs great adversary and how the devil is always playing a game of Halloween with mankind. As we saw, the devil is very cunning and he will do everything he can to deceive you to fall for his tricks. His primary objective is to lure as many as he can away from the Lord and drag them down to the pit to join him in suffering God‚Äôs punishment of sin.
So this week, keeping the idea of the Halloween holiday in mind, I ask you again ‚Äî trick or treat? The devil offers mankind treat after treat, but as we have seen, the devil‚Äôs treats are nothing but tricks. The devil in no way can bless you! To bless or be blessed is to be made spiritually happy or to be spiritually happy. The devil is a bitter and upset being that has no truth and no love in him, so how can he make you spiritually happy?
As children hope to get nothing but the good stuff on Halloween when they knock on doors. Today, I tell you that God has all of the good stuff for you at His house! The Lord desires for you to come to His house and to knock on His door so that He can give you all of His good treats! So, will you go knock on the door of God‚Äôs house to receive these good treats or will you continue to be deceived by the devil and his so-called treats? Let‚Äôs take a look at these treats of the Lord so that you can choose wisely as to which house you will go to ‚Äì God‚Äôs house or the devil‚Äôs house.
Knocking on God‚Äôs Door
In the gospels, Jesus directs the believers to go knock on the door of the Lord if we desire the good things of the Lord. In scripture, we see Jesus specifically state, ‚ÄúAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened (Matt. 7:7-8; Luke 11:9-10).‚Äù
The Lord has no false treats for you at His house ‚Äì He‚Äôs not trying to fool, deceive, or trick you as the devil is always trying to do. God has nothing but good treats at His house that He truly wishes to give away liberally (Jas. 1:5). As Jesus tells us again in the gospels, ‚ÄúIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him (Matt. 7:11; Luke 11:13)!‚Äù
Skipping pass God‚Äôs house
Yet, I tell you today that it does not seem that many people are running to the Lord‚Äôs house. In fact, I would tell you that people are hardly even walking to God‚Äôs house. When I say God‚Äôs house, I want you to know that I am not talking about a church building, but I am talking about where He resides. Are you seeking for the Lord? Are you trying to go and knock on His door?
So, why aren‚Äôt people walking or running to the house of God?
I believe we saw the answer to that question in my sermon last week. There are many people skipping past God‚Äôs house because the devil is doing everything he can to trick people into staying away. The devil will lie about God‚Äôs house and speak of it in a manner to where none would desire to ever pay God a visit.
To those that believe, we saw that the devil will twist the word of God in such a way to hinder the child of God from visiting the Lord. To those of no faith, Satan will tell them that he has all of the good candy while God has nothing but raisins and vegetables. In other words, the devil is enticing those of the world by saying his treats are better than God‚Äôs treats. Let‚Äôs take a look at the main treat that the devil is enticing people with.
The devil‚Äôs bag of worms
Again, in his temptation of Jesus, we are shown that the devil took Jesus up exceedingly high on a mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and said to Him, ‚ÄúAll these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me (Matt 4:8-9).‚Äù The devil was enticing Jesus with the world and its riches as his big treat.
Now, there are some people that believe the world to be the sweetest and best treat that they could ever receive. There are people that thirst, hunger, and lust for the riches of this world. Yet, what I know and what the devil certainly knows as well is that this world is temporary ‚Äì meaning that it‚Äôs not valuable at all. Jesus even tells us plainly not to value this world nor lay up for ourselves treasure in this world because the treasure will either be stolen, rust, or be destroyed (Matt. 6:19).
Jesus was letting us know that this world ‚Äì the devil‚Äôs treasure ‚Äì is going to perish. We see in the book of Revelation that this world will pass away when God brings forth a new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1). Again, the devil knows that the treat that he‚Äôs offering is nothing but a bag of rocks and a bag of worms and does not mind to keep offering it as if it is gold. So, again, I feel I must let all of you know this information so that you don‚Äôt pass by the house that truly has the treats for the other house that has nothing good.
Treats for Enduring the Tricks of the Devil
While Satan lies and deceives about the house of God, Jesus offers the truth of God‚Äôs house.
Jesus tells us to lay up our treasures in heaven because heaven cannot be taken away nor can it be destroyed (Matt. 6:20). While the devil is busy lying and deceiving, and hindering the world from paying God‚Äôs house a visit by saying heaven is a figment of our imagination, Jesus tells us it‚Äôs very real. Jesus said, ‚ÄúIn My Father‚Äôs house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you (John 14:2).‚Äù Jesus then tells us that He knows the way to heaven and that He will take us there to dwell eternally (John 14:3, 6).
I believe the devil knows for certain that the Lord and His house will live on forever and that he will have no part in it, which is why he works so hard to deceive the world. To all of those that desire the treats of God, we must not allow ourselves to be enticed by Satan; we cannot fall for the devil‚Äôs tricks. Why must we endure the devil‚Äôs tricks? What is the benefit to those who resist the devil?
We must endure
We will see the benefit to resisting and withstanding the tricks of the devil in my key verse for today‚Äôs message. In our key verse, James writes that when we endure the temptations of the devil, we are blessed (spiritually happy). There are treats (blessings) for us to receive from the Lord.
12 Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.KEY VERSE ‚Äì JAMES 1:12 NKJV
Now, this statement from James is not a statement of his own, but one that Jesus had taught His closest disciples on the mount as it is recorded in the gospels. Jesus preached, . 5:11-12).‚Äù There are rewards (treats) for enduring the temptation and wiles of the devil.
God‚Äôs love and mercy
The first of the treats that I want to mention here today is told to us throughout scripture, but I want to reference a verse from John‚Äôs first epistle. In his first letter, John writes of this treat from the Lord, ‚ÄúIf we confess our sins, He (God) is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).‚Äù God is faithful and just to forgive and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
When you are not enticed to stay away from the Lord‚Äôs house by the devil, but instead go and knock on His door, one of the treats that you will receive from God is His love and mercy. There is nothing false about the Lord‚Äôs love ‚Äì God is the definition of love. In the Lord‚Äôs love, we see that this treat is God lifting the heavy weight of the guilt of our sins from off of our shoulders! In other words, He takes our sins and burdens away from us!
When David spoke of this treat, he said, ‚ÄúBlessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit (Ps. 32:1-2).‚Äù God‚Äôs treats truly are things that will make you free and happy in your soul.
So many people overlook the truly sweet treat that is forgiveness because many people have been blinded by the devil to the fact that they are in need of God‚Äôs forgiveness and mercy. There are so many who actually feel the weight of the wrongs that they have done but because they have been blinded by the devil, they don‚Äôt take these feelings to the Lord. Many feel they can do nothing about this heavy weight so they try to carry that heavy load by themselves and do nothing but add on more weight and more burdens.
So, while the devil is so busy offering the riches of the world, ask yourself, when has he ever offered to lift the weight of the guilt of sin from off of anybody‚Äôs shoulders? Never. All that the devil has to offer is a world that will do nothing but add more weight and burdens to our shoulders. Are you sure you want to be going to the devil‚Äôs house for a treat of more guilt and more burdens to carry around on your shoulders? That would be a ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù from me.
Highly favored with good and perfect gifts
Again, I tell you, God has treats (blessings) to give to us. When you are not enticed to stay away from the Lord‚Äôs house but go and knock on His door, there is another treat that the Lord wants you to have. James writes of this treat to us and we will see that this treat is God‚Äôs favor in giving good and perfect gifts to those that come knocking at His door. You see, God wants to give you His good gifts at all times ‚Äì liberally.
James wrote that God is a liberal giver and will give to us liberally without reproach (Jas. 1:5). He then said, ‚ÄúEvery good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning (Jas. 1:17).‚Äù Let me make this clear to you ‚Äì every good gift you have ever received came from the Lord!
Just count the ways that the Lord has blessed you today: we got to see the light of another day, whether it is sunny, cloudy, or raining. We have our health, our strength, and are in our right mind. We take these good gifts from God for granted, but I can assure you that the devil couldn‚Äôt care less about you having your health, strength, and seeing the light of another day.
You will recall that last week I said that the devil studies you intently, like a chess master, with the frame of mind on how he can best attack you. Then there‚Äôs God who, on the other hand, knows your downsitting and uprising, just as David said; The Lord knows and understands your thoughts afar off (Ps. 139:2). God has no intentions of attacking you but what He does intend is to give you His perfect and unique gifts that He has crafted just for you. You will know and recognize when the Lord has blessed you with His perfect gifts.
In the book of Isaiah, scripture proclaims of God, ‚ÄúThe Lord will guide you continually, And satisfy your soul in drought, And strengthen your bones; You shall be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail (Is. 58:11).‚Äù One of the greatest treats of God that so many of us do not realize we enjoy is how His good and perfect gifts constantly strengthens and satisfies us in our soul. I want you to understand today that it truly is a treat that God is faithful to us, loves, and that we are favored in His eyes. Our soul is well taken care of and that truly is a special treat.
God‚Äôs Great Treat for Us
James then tells us of the great treat that we will receive when we have endured and overcome the temptations of the devil.
James writes again in my key verse, that when we are approved by God, there is a reward of the crown of life that will be given to all of those that love the Lord. I tell you today that with each treat from the Lord keeps getting better and better. There is no greater treat that you and I can receive than that of the crown of life. This treat is so special that Jesus came teaching, preaching, and inviting people to come to God‚Äôs house to receive it!
And to think, the devil is sitting here offering a temporary world for his big treat and God is offering an eternal life of peace and joy as His big treat. Now, you tell me, which sounds like the better treat? Again, you will never see Satan offer forgiveness to anybody and you will never see the devil promise an eternal life of peace and joy. The reason being is because he is simply incapable of offering peace and joy because peace and joy are not in him.
Strictly focused on the treats of God
I want you to know and understand today that the crown of life is truly a one of a kind treat and that we ought to greatly desire it. We should be like Charlie in the Willy Wonka movie and how he badly desired that golden ticket! Do you wake up in the morning desiring the great treat of God which is heaven? Do you go to sleep at night desiring the good treat? Do you live each and every day craving and desiring the sweet treat of heaven? We should want the crown of life and I feel I must ask today, do you desire the crown of life? Do you desire this treat from the Lord?
In scripture, Paul had a very great desire for the crown of life that he wrote about to the Corinthians. Paul said that athletes compete for a crown that is perishable but he and those of the faith like him out to desire the crown that is imperishable ‚Äì the crown of life. We will see in his first letter to the Corinthians how Paul lived his life to ensure that he would receive the crown of life.
Paul stated that he ran his race of faith in a manner that he was temperate in all things so that he could receive the crown. What Paul meant is that he was strict and disciplined in his run so as not to be distracted or have his eyes taken off of the reward. So, Paul ran his race to the reward in a manner where he would not allow the devil‚Äôs temptations to deter or hinder him from the reward (1 Cor. 9:25-26). We, the true believers, should go to God‚Äôs house to get this great treat in a manner where we do not allow the devil to hinder and keep us away from it.
Trick or treat? Do you desire the false treats of the devil or will you go to God‚Äôs house for the tasty treats that He has for you? Where so many people are being blinded by the devil and the false treats that he offers, let us not fall for his tricks ‚Äì let us not be distracted. Don‚Äôt pay the devil any attention! We have overcome the devil through Christ so let us look beyond him to the prize that is at hand.
Let us be strict (disciplined) in our faith and keep our focus and attention on the Lord. Let us get up and run to God‚Äôs house without being hindered! If you are not yet of the faith, I encourage you to ignore the false signs and whispers from the devil, and go to God‚Äôs house; knock on that door and enjoy the treats of the Lord.Join the Women in Leadership Private Facebook Group.

Reviews
There are no reviews yet.‚ÄúI have always been a very close observer of human silhouette, persona and styles. This has been fundamental in my inclination towards fashion design. Since India is a country of diverse culture, craft and textile, its local artisans and their techniques inspire me the most.‚Äù
Hailing from a small town in upper Assam, folk tribal cultures, traditional North Eastern crafts and textiles have been the core inspiration for designer Manjushree Saikia. ‚ÄúThe core of art & craft really touched me when I was studying Textile Design at the National Institute of Fashion (NIFT), Mumbai.‚Äù
Ura Maku was born from the realisation of the responsibility a designer holds; to be mindful with the resources he/she already has in the form of both nature & craft. After visiting several craft clusters in India, Manjushree was stunned by their humility and grounded value. This is when she understood the importance of not only craftsmanship but also mindfulness towards humanity. The design philosophy of the brand lies in the name itself. Ura means to fly and Maku is the shuttle in weaving. ‚ÄúUra Maku is the story of every person who dares to fly yet is rooted to their cultural values‚Äù.

Growing up in the culturally diverse region of north-eastern India, Manjushree tells us about her inspiration, cultural values and design philosophy in this exclusive conversation.
Tell us a little bit about your design process. From start to end what‚Äôs the process of creating a collection?
Each collection is explored around a theme or rather a state of mind. Every time, we come up with a mind state with of our muse i.e. ‚ÄòBreaking the Cocoon‚Äô or ‚ÄòAcceptance of Transience‚Äô. We imagine that our muse and in turn our client is progressing with society. Once that is narrowed down, we work on the elements of design. Rhythm, unity, embroideries are all explored, however, we try to keep them minimal. Our Hakama pants, etc are tailored with a striking balance of rhythm and structure. That‚Äôs where the inspiration comes from and then we pick up the elements of design and go about designing from there.
You suggest that you are tied to your roots and traditions but yet your pieces are very modern with sleek, contemporary silhouettes. How do you strike the correct balance?
A lot of my silhouettes are inspired by historical evidence from fashion. Whether it is Yves Saint Laurent or Yohji Yamamoto, they have been huge inspirations. While studying Textile Design, we were taught that every piece of fashion historically has a lot of stories within it. Every fabric has a different flow to it, i.e. home furnishings have to me thicker, apparel weaves are different. I was also into styling, creative direction and freelancing as a stylist and so I always had this aesthetic.
When I started Ura Maku, I wanted to use rooted traditional textiles and explore them with modern / unique silhouettes. So whether it is tea dying, power suits or exploration of traditional fabrics to give them a global appeal, this has been the brand‚Äôs DNA and USP. I am working directly with weavers. The traditional motifs are always there in my work but I try to minimize it for the global audience. I feel the minimal aesthetic is the most difficult to design. At Ura Maku, I design a lot of power suits because they define the muse we have. I come from a small town so I have been an aspirant. Someone who is rooted can fly high with confidence.
You talk a lot about your culture and traditions. What influence has your family had on you as a designer and also on the brand at large?
My entire family, village, the entire environment has a big impact on me as a textile designer.
I grew up with my grandmother. She has a very motherly influence on me. She has taught me everything. My first memory is with her. Because she is from a village of Assam, my family has always been surrounded by textiles. My aunt hand spins and weaves textiles. This is a domestic way of life for them and part of our traditions. We would weave mekhela chadors, give it to others, perform Bihu; we would do it at home itself.
I go back to my family to learn traditional techniques. Sometimes they also help me translate when interacting with local weavers (when I don‚Äôt know certain local terms, etc.). They also help me source a lot of fibres such as Eri silk yarn, Moga silk yarn. It is very expensive so it is very difficult to get a pure form of it. They help me source the pure form.
The coronavirus pandemic had disrupted the fashion industry drastically. How have you coped with it and what have been your biggest learnings as an entrepreneur?
Because I am a young designer I was able to cope with it. I started in 2018 so it has just been 2 years. So being small helped me. If I had a big team, I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to sustain. We talk so much about sustainability, however, when we are doing business everyone is working for profit. Its when everything came to a standstill that we had time to reflect on things around us. So for me as a human being, being able to learn that we all equal, regardless of our work / position was a huge realisation. That pause and reflection was important. Also to figure out my goals, short and long term. Because we are so busy in life we sometimes don‚Äôt get time to reflect. So the time has definitely taught me a lot.

Source linkA group of Burmese ethnic rebels currently held in an Indian jail will next week enter into a plea bargain in what could be a momentous final stretch in a marathon 12-year fight for justice.
The group, composed of 10 fighters from the Karen National Union (KNU) and 24 from the now-defunct National Unity Party of Arakan (NUPA), were lured in 1998 to the Indian Andaman Islands by an Indian intelligence officer named Colonel Grewal, who offered them a safe haven. He has since disappeared, and evidence suggests he may have been a double agent working for the Burmese military.
On arriving on Indian soil the group were accused of weapons smuggling; six of the men were murdered by Indian security forces and the rest placed in detention, in what has come to be known as Operation Leech.
Their trial lawyer, Akshay Sharma, speaking exclusively to DVB in Delhi yesterday, said that use of the plea bargain ‚Äì a predominantly western legal concept ‚Äì was exceptionally rare in India, but was beneficial to all parties.
Moreover, human rights lawyer and chief advocate on the case, Nandita Haksar, said that ‚Äúthe Indian intelligence community are on trial here‚Äù. Indeed an intelligence officer, speaking under condition of anonymity, was quoted in the Indian press several months after the incident as saying that defense authorities were ‚Äúdeliberately adopting dilatory tactics‚Äù.
The implications of guilt for the Indian security services appeared in court after a 10-year wait for a single charge sheet to be produced, with evidence that Sharma said was ‚Äúfull of discrepancies‚Äù.
Key evidence such as the serial numbers of the supposedly smuggled weapons did not match, whilst ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù stopped the Indian security services from bringing the explosives that the accused were charged with possessing to the Kolkata trial.
Lawyers have therefore suggested that the 12-year wait for a verdict and the ‚Äúgrey areas‚Äù have likely induced both prosecution and defence to for the plea bargain. One of the most telling of these ‚Äúgrey areas‚Äù was the failure by India‚Äôs own Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to produce key witnesses, such Colonel Grewal, the initial contact person for the freedom fighters. This was despite requests by the Indian state‚Äôs primary investigative bodies to produce this witness.
While the acquittal of the weapons smuggling charges has been ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù, Haksar claimed that they conceal an ugly truth; a ‚Äúhypocrisy‚Äù at the heart of Indian democracy. For whilst the 34 may soon walk free, it is now corroborated that the Indian security services have the blood of at least six Burmese rebels on their hands, while two more who were under custody ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù during the course of the trial.
Their disappearance appears to be a misnomer when one considers the severity of the initial charges the Burmese were accused of. The charge of ‚Äòwaging war against the Indian state‚Äô ‚Äì a similar indictment to one brought on the Mumbai bombers ‚Äì carries the maximum penalty of death, but they still managed to disappear, and no-one seems able to divulge their whereabouts, or indeed whether they are still alive.

The words ‚Äòstuff‚Äô and ‚Äòthere‚Äô are deliberately vague to allow me some leeway. But I aim to keep publishing my work throughout the year, be it individual photographs, reviews, newsletters, articles, or more ambitious projects.
I‚Äôve got off to an uncharacteristically flying start by having a slightly amended form of my Caught by the River article about my ‚ÄòHebden‚Äôs Other Bridges‚Äô photo-project published in the January 2017 edition of Dalesman magazine. And I‚Äôve agreed to put on a small exhibition of my bridges photos for a Caught by the River poetry and prose event in Hebden Bridge on 21st January.
High on my list of priorities for this new year will be (finally) to publish my book On the Moor in both ebook, and more traditional dead-tree-book formats. Then I plan to begin work on my next book.
Of course, I fully appreciate that every year needs to be a Year Of Getting Stuff Out There, but we all have to start somewhere.

Volvo has been an innovator in the automotive field for many years, and today's announcement will set a new standard in safety, as reported in London Business Directory.
From tomorrow, the Swedish branded car manufacturer will pay 24 weeks of parental leave to families, offering further crash protection for it's family of employees around the World.
Who Will Benefit?
Volvo's announcement will benefit 40,000 employees around the World, including countries such as China, and the United States of America.
It may seem that the benefit will be in proportion of local standards, however Volvo has shrugged it's shoulders at that too, announcing Worldwide levels, that will surely crash proof the finances of families during these difficult times.
How Much Will Be Paid
It is worth noting that Volvo's offer will amount to 24 weeks of paid parental leave, at a whopping 80% of the base rate of salary! To put that into perspective, the UK government recommends that a worker is entitled to 18 weeks of 'unpaid' parental leave, that cannot be taken in one hit.
Volvo's announcement will be sure to cause many of us to think about changing jobs, even for a well paid window cleaner such as myself!
But, you might argue, 80% of your salary isn't that much when you only earn a few dollars a week. Well, that's not true in the case with Volvo. The average salary is over $128,000 per year, with even admin staff, the lowest paid on the scale, earning, on average, over $50,000 per year1
Who Owns Volvo?
Volvo is iconically a Swedish brand, however, Sweden is not now the owning country of this global brand. Previously, Volvo was owned by Ford Motor Cars, however now, Volvo is owned by Geely, a Chinese car manufacturer which is the property of billionaire Li Shufu.
Whilst some may have reservations about Chinese ownership, Shufu's generous compensation to staff of Volvo will be appreciated by all and sundry!

You will also explore the parallels between Java objects and database tables.
Let‚Äôs relate what you‚Äôve learned about SQL to interact with a database called
movie-buff that contains two tables‚Äî
movies and
directors.
Just as you did in the exercises create the new
movie-buff schema.
Before we create the
movies and
directors tables, let‚Äôs think about
what kind of columns we want in each one.
For the
movies table, it makes sense to have columns for the
title of
the movie, the
year_released, and the
director. We‚Äôre also going to
want to have a unique
movie_id column as the primary key, since there can
be more than one movie with the same title.
Take the time now to think about what data types you might use for these
columns (
INTEGER,
VARCHAR,
DATE, etc.), then go ahead and write (or
type) the SQL statement to create this table.
As you consider which data types to use for your
movies columns, you might
find yourself thinking, If this were a property of a Java object, what data
type would I use?
For example, if the
movie object has a
title and a
director field,
you would expect both of these data types to be
String. Similarly, the year
the movie was released would be stored as an integer. This conceptual overlap
between databases and Java objects is very useful, and we will explore this
further in the class on Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
Here‚Äôs how our
movies table could be created:
Take a moment to discuss with a partner:
VARCHARparameters differ in lines 3 and 5.
PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENTin line 2. If necessary, review the table setup for the chapter exercises.
Next, let‚Äôs consider the properties we‚Äôd want for a
director object in
Java. These could include a
first_name, a
last_name, and maybe the
country where the director was born.
Once we identify the data types for these properties, we can write the SQL
command to create the
directors table. Also, we should include a
director_id column in order to create a valid primary key.
Before we go further, let‚Äôs take a moment to think about how these two tables
relate to each other, and whether we may want to modify the column
director
in the
movies table. A director can work on multiple movies, but each
movie may only have one director. Rather than store multiple copies of the same
name in the
director column, we can instead reference a single value
stored elsewhere.
Our goal is to keep our table design clean. This means putting data specific
to directors in the
directors table, and placing data specific to each
movie in the
movies table. To follow this structure, we should NOT store
the director‚Äôs name in the
movies table.
Similarly, the director‚Äôs country is NOT an attribute of a movie, so there is
no need to clutter a
movie object or the
movies table with that
information. Instead, a name and country are attributes of the director, which
means the data must be stored in the
directors table.
However, we might want to know that information for a given movie (e.g. we may
want to find all the movies since 2010 that have French directors). So we need
a way to filter the movies based on attributes from
directors. Solving this
challenge is why relational databases exist.
In order to link the two tables to each other, let‚Äôs modify the
director
column in
movies to become
director_id. It should therefore be an
INTEGER instead of the
VARCHAR we used earlier when we thought the
director column would hold the name of a person.
Note that with the new format, both tables contain a
director_id column,
and we will use this match to relate
movies with
directors. The tool to
establish the link is called a foreign key.
Go ahead and use SQL to delete the old
movies table:
DROP TABLE movies;
Now you need to create a new
movies table that relates to data stored in
the
directors table. The code sample below shows how to define the
director_id column in
movies as a
Foreign Key. Doing this links
that column in
movies to the
director_id column in the
directors
table.
Use this SQL command to create a new
movies table.
Line 6 matches every entry in the
movies table to the ONE entry in the
directors table that has the same value for
director_id. Thus, multiple
rows in
movies can reference the same row in
directors, and a single
director can connect to many movies.
Note
If needed, here is a set of helpful articles:
Follow the MySQL syntax instructions when there is a syntax variation between the major databases.
INSERTData From File¬∂
Rather than adding entries line by line, you will use a prepared SQL file to speed up the process.
Follow this link to the movie-buff data repository.
Click the Download Zip button to save a copy of the file to your machine.
Double-click the zip file icon to extract the
movie-buff-data.sql file
(it will be inside a folder).
In MySQL Workbench, click the Open SQL button, and select the
movie-buff-data.sql file.
Double-click the
movie-buff schema, then click the leftmost lightning
bolt icon to run the SQL script. This will populate the
directors and
movies tables.
Confirm that the tables contain data by clicking on the table icon next to each name.
OK! Your model is ready to accept queries.
For this studio, you‚Äôll practice writing SQL queries to perform various data
retrieval and manipulation tasks. You will be using the
movies and
directors tables described above, so if you still
need to
CREATE them, please do so now.
Open up a new Query tab in MySQL Workbench. In that tab, write the SQL commands to carry out each of the queries described below. As you complete each step, compare your SQL code and the output with a partner.
List just the titles of all the movies in the database.
List the title and year of each movie in the database in DESCENDING order
of the year released. (Hint: Combine the
SELECT command with the
ORDER BY keywords).
List all columns for all records of the
directors table in ASCENDING
alphabetical order based on the director‚Äôs country of origin.
ORDER BY can also consider multiple columns. List all columns for all
records of the
directors table in ASCENDING alphabetical order first
by the director‚Äôs country of origin and then by the director‚Äôs last name.
Insert a new record into the
directors table for Rob Reiner, an
American film director.
Note
Recall that the column for
director_id is auto incremented, so you
don‚Äôt need to put in a value for that column.
Combine the
SELECT and
WHERE keywords to list the
last_name and
director_id for Rob Reiner.
Insert a new record into the
movies table for The Princess Bride,
which was released in 1987 and directed by Rob Reiner.
Note
movie_id is also auto incremented, so you don‚Äôt need to put in a
value for that column. However, you will need to provide a value for
the foreign key,
director_id, to link the movie to the proper
director.
If you list all of the data from the
movies table
(
SELECT * FROM movies;), you will see a column of director ID numbers.
This data is not particularly helpful to a user, since they probably want to
see the director names instead. Use an
INNER JOIN in your SQL command to
display a list of movie titles, years released, and director last names.
List all the movies in the database along with the first and last name of the director. Order the list alphabetically by the director‚Äôs last name.
List the first and last name for the director of The Incredibles. You can
do this with either a join or a
WHERE command, but for this step please
use
WHERE.
List the last name and country of origin for the director of Roma. You
can do this with either a join or a
WHERE command, but for this step
please use a join.

I reblogged it in 2014 after the last KP redesign proposal, and I am reblogging it again today. It has a bit on merging Burnside Park and KP.
Architecture Here and There
View of Kennedy Plaza from the ‚ÄúNarragansett Plaza.‚Äù (marriott.com)
Here is the 1992 column mentioned in today‚Äôs post ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ruin Kennedy Plaza‚Äù in which I suggest merging the plaza with Burnside Park to form a Central Park for Providence. I also placed the bus hub under ‚ÄúKennedy Park.‚Äù On the whole this attempt to forecast the success of what was still being planned in 1992 is mawkish and unconvincing from the perspective of 2014. I cannot suppress my belief, however, that if Providence had continued to build revivalist architecture it had built in the 1990s rather than shifting to modernism as it has, the city would have done a much better job reflecting the success predicted in this postcard. And now they‚Äôre destroying Kennedy Plaza, too.

I was fortunate to have lived for some time in France. Not only is it a beautiful country but the food is wonderful and never disappoints. I can honestly say I never had a bad meal in France, whether in Paris or small towns. There will always be a warm spot in my heart for France.
I picked Chicken Marengo because there is some history attached to the recipe. This version is also very easy. It is adapted from a cookbook that is now out of print: European Cooking, Traditional Recipes from 24 Countries copyright 1958.
Supposedly, Chicken Marengo was created by Napoleon‚Äôs Chef Dunand who had very limited supplies to work with after one of Napoleon‚Äôs important battles. Napoleon wanted a festive dinner to celebrate his victory at Marengo, Italy June 14, 1800 against the Austrians. Chef Dunand had to go foraging in the town to find ingredients for a festive dinner. There are a lot of different stories about this recipe but it is thought that the original version may have included crayfish and toast topped with a fried egg. Today most versions of the recipe skip the crayfish, toast and egg.
I found a version of this recipe that appeared in an 1882 cookbook: The 366 Bills of Fare by Baron Brisse, in French and English, translated by Edith Matthew Clark. If you are interested in reading Baron Brisse‚Äôs unique and interesting cookbook, a free EBook is available for download by Google Books.
I thought the recipe would be in Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child but couldn‚Äôt find it in Volume one (the only volume I have). Further research found that Amazon Prime has several seasons of Julia Child‚Äôs cooking shows available for view. To my delight, one of the episodes is Chicken Napoleon (Poulet Saut√© Marengo), Season 6, episode 19. She is funny because after she talks a little about the history of the recipe, she pulls out a huge sword and starts chopping up the chicken for the recipe. In this episode she includes shrimp, French fried eggs and large triangle croutons, following closely to what the original recipe may have included. She notes that crayfish were not available in her area. It is interesting that she includes brandy in her recipe and flamed the chicken. But I‚Äôm sure Napoleon never traveled without his French brandy.
Chicken Marengo (Poulet Saut√© Marengo)
1 chicken, cut in pieces
1/4 cup olive oil, as needed
1-2 cups white wine
2 peeled and quartered Roma tomatoes
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 cup button mushrooms
4 small, white onions
salt and pepper
Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or frying pan.
Brown the chicken in the olive oil on all sides until golden brown. Remove the browned chicken from the pan. Add the onions, mushrooms and garlic. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes. Add the quartered tomatoes and saut√© for an additional minute. Return the chicken to pan with the vegetables. Pour the wine over the chicken and vegetables. Add enough wine to the half-way point of the chicken. Cover and simmer about 45 minutes or until chicken is done. Serve in the wine sauce.
I saw the below quote in an online article from Voice of America News titled Americans in Paris Undeterred by Terrorism and it expresses my sentiments exactly. The article is written by Carol Guensburg and can be found here
‚ÄúParis is the same ‚Äì yesterday, today, tomorrow ‚Äì this beautiful, magnetic City of Light.‚Äù
Serendipity, I was talking about Chicken Marengo to another friend just the other day. Definitely one of those dishes popular in the ‚Äô70s that deserves a revival. Vive la France!

The Washington Post first reported Redfield's action.
Redfield "has been determined to have had a low risk exposure on May 6 to a person at the White House who has Covid-19. He is feeling fine and has no symptoms. He will be teleworking for the next two weeks," the spokesperson said.
The decision comes after the Food and Drug Administration announced that its commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, planned to self-quarantine after coming in contact with an individual who tested positive for coronavirus.
Neither agencies have named the person or people with whom Redfield and Hahn came into contact.
Both men are members of the White House coronavirus task force, which held its most recent meeting on Thursday.
White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere declined to confirm the report that Redfield will self-quarantine, but he said the physician to the President and White House operations officials "continue to work closely to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the President, First Family and the entire White House Complex safe and healthy."Search this site

How we work
Our approach to massage therapy is
outcomes-based
and the most appropriate techniques are applied to achieve this.
Your full participation and feedback during the treatment helps to achieve the desired outcome more quickly which is better for
your pocket as well as your body!
Click here if you would like more information on the advanced techniques we use.
What to expect
Your first appointment will begin with a consultation to find out what the problem is and any aspects of your medical history that may be relevant.
Your posture is observed and range of motion tested where relevant.
If you have booked for a relaxation appointment rather than for clinical reasons, it is still important to discuss your medical history.
When we are ready to start you will be left in private to undress and lie on the treatment couch.
Many techniques can be carried out through clothing so if you prefer to keep your clothing on this is OK.
Throughout the treatment the parts of your body that are not being worked on will be draped with towels to protect your privacy and keep you warm.
Most treatments will require you to lie either face down, face up or on your side and sometimes in a seated position. If you find lying face down difficult all techniques can be adapted and used in the side-lying position.
A massage wax is used to provide lubrication, except for myo-fascial release and some clinical work. Usually no residue remains at the end of a treatment, but you may prefer not to wear your best clothes just in case.
Kate's treatment room
You are in control of your treatment, and the therapist will check in with you throughout to make sure you are comfortable and to get feedback. At any point you can ask her to stop if you are not comfortable.
After the treatment you should feel relaxed and even a little 'spaced out' so it is important to allow your body and mind time to integrate the treatment.
Make sure you do not have to rush off and do something stressful.

The C-MINE reconversion offers a distinct approach for purposefully dealing with large-scale industrial heritage. Between 1901 and 1989 the Winterslag coalmine site acted as a pivotal location within the Carbon Belt, stretching as far as the R√ºhr Area. Since 2001, the Genk Town Council started to actively redevelop its brownfield past, turning the plant‚Äôs Central Turbine Hall into a cultural nerve center within the wider Euregion. The architectural operations performed on the existing infrastructures are voluntarily restricted and extremely direct, accepting the premises as an ‚Äòas found‚Äô condition. By extending the original T-shaped base with two concrete additions, a deep and fascinating ground level comes into being, giving way to a labyrinthine foyer including exhibition and workrooms, extensive flaneur space and the accesses to two new theatre spaces. Similar to the industrial oxygeneous top lit machine rooms, the two theaters are conceived as daylight performing machines.

If you quit having to pay your IRA, it will consume into the money you currently have in your account. And if you pull your cash out, you get penalized for attempting to shield yourself. Nothing could be riskier! With cash, you are by no means penalized, never taxed, and by no means in a risky scenario unless of course you place yourself there.

In a marketplace where there aren‚Äôt many purchasers and sellers it is difficult to establish a proper price. Lack of information also presents a problem with evaluation.

Richard & Bethan went on our tailor-made safari holiday and stayed at Papillon Lagoon Reef in Africa. Here's what they had to say:
Bethan and I travelled to Kenya for her 30th Birthday, we started the trip with a 3 night 4 day Pride of Tsavo Safari through Tsavo West and Tsavo East National Parks.
Before we even landed, we were treated to spectacular views of Kilimanjaro from the plane.
The first night on Safari, we stayed at the Kilaguni Serena Lodge in Tsavo West, this lodge is truly spectacular with fantastic facilities, a great restaurant looking out over the waterhole, and we were also lucky enough to have a room overlooking the water hole and so could watch the animals all night.
From Kilaguni, we went on a game drive to the breath taking Mzima Springs to see hippopotamus and Crocodiles, this is a must for anyone going to Tsavo West.
The next day we had a game drive through the park to the Ziwani Tented camp, close to the border with Tanzania, the camp is situated around a river which is full of crocodiles, it is not recommended to go for a swim. And as it is so close to Tanzania, the majestic Kilimanjaro fills the horizon
During the afternoon at Zwani, we had a walking safari down the river to see the larger crocodiles and 2 groups of hippopotamus, the first group were a bit grumpy, however the second group were relaxed so we could get much closer. There was also lots of other animals around, especially warthogs or ‚ÄòPumba‚Äôs‚Äô as our guide called them. In the evening, we were treated to a night safari, using a spotlight to see the animals. During this we managed to see a hippo out of the water walking for food, lots of elephants, giraffes and zebra, as well as a hyena, jackal and a tinny wild cat.
On the third day on Safari, we had a morning game drive before travelling to the Ngutuni Lodge in Tsavo East. During the morning‚Äôs game drive, we were taken to poacher look out at the top of a mountain, this spot is used by the park rangers to spot poachers. As we travelled through Tsavo West, we saw herds of wildebeest and buffalo as well as a troop of 13 elephants. Then, after the game drive had finished and we travelled to Tsavo East, our guide noticed something, he took the vehicle off road and we saw 2 cheetahs on the hunt.
During the afternoons, game drive we entered Tsavo East through the Vio Gate, as we travelled through the park, we saw where the elephants had dug down and broken the water pipes to create watering holes. We then came across a group of 5 lions sat on hill, basking in the sun. As we drove through the park, we saw 3 lions on the prowl.
We had a final game drive before driving back to the beach hotel, where we spent the next 4 days. It was an unforgettable holiday and I couldn‚Äôt recommend this trip highly enough.
We would like to thank Richard & Bethan for sharing their story with us and hope to welcome you on another holiday soon..

The brief: Full re-vitalization of a traditional chocolate brand key visual.
The context: The Sarotti brand is full of history, dating back to the year 1852. Generations of kids grew up with this brand icon, which changed its appearance various times over the past decades. Over the years, the so called ‚ÄúSarotti negro‚Äù in all its various shapes and sizes became sought after collectors items. Yet, growing concerns about the ethnic insensitivity of such outdated brand icon usage were issued. In order to distancing from any association with the previous ethnic background of the older icon versions, the new racial neutral brand figure was renamed ‚ÄúThe magician‚Äù. Owner and manufacturer company Stollwerk commissioned the overdue brand re-vitalization in 2004, including the optimization of all package designs for a vast range of different chocolate products.
What I did: Challenge for my redraw was to maintain the friendly & open gesture and body posture of the little boy figure, while slightly modernizing the look, maintaining the recognizability of the icon. In order to add a more playful and poetic note, it was decided to get rid of the flag and to add some magic stardust.
Concept & branding: Peter Schmidt Group BBDO/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50424999/2893_77264222235_7166071_n.0.0.jpg)
Recently retired New York Yankees slugger Alex ‚ÄúA-Rod‚Äù Rodriguez has plenty of time on his hands now that he‚Äôs no longer playing baseball. Which is perhaps why he was spotted today hanging out at Ouisie‚Äôs Table.
According to the Houston Chronicle, Rodriguez was spotted at the River Oaks eatery on Wednesday. A manager at the restaurant tells Eater that Rodriguez showed up around 8 a.m. for coffee and a ‚Äúmeeting,‚Äù though the manager didn‚Äôt have further details on why he was in Houston.
When he arrived at the restaurant, Rodriguez and his entourage were quickly whisked away to a private dining room where they would not be disturbed by the plebes in the main dining room. Ever a man of the people, diners at the restaurant were promptly told that they would not be able to ask the baseball star for autographs or photos.
Just days after ending his career with the New York Yankees, there are plenty of reasons to speculate as to why A-Rod would visit Clutch City. Perhaps he‚Äôs plotting his comeback with the Astros? (Doubtful.)Cumberland Mountain State Park
The 1,720 acres of Cumberland Mountain State Park once served as the outdoor recreational center for the massive Cumberland Homesteads project of the Resettlement Administration (RA). From 1935 to 1938 Company 3464 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built a huge stone masonry bridge and dam out of local Crab Orchard stone to create Byrd's Lake as the park's central focus. The 347-foot long dam proved to be the largest masonry structure constructed by the CCC in the entire nation.
In 1938 the RA's successor, the Farm Security Administration, deeded 1,427 acres to the state, and Cumberland Mountain State Park was born. The park superintendent was Alvin C. York, the Tennessee hero of World War I. CCC Company 3464, assisted by Company 1471, continued to work at the park until 1941, building trails, picnic areas, cabins, boathouse, a bathhouse, and other structures. In addition to the dam, the bathhouse, various utility buildings, a stone water tank, pump house, drinking fountains, picnic areas, and a residence remain from the CCC work. The extant historic rustic cabins near the modern restaurant appear to have been a joint WPA and CCC effort.
Today the park features the Bear Trace Golf Course designed by golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, swimming and hiking facilities, extensive playgrounds, 147 campsites, and picnic areas.

To celebrate this anime adaptation, Onigunso also drew a couple of illustrations.
This manga will be centered on tsukumogami which have known to be spirits that possess inhabited aged objects. As for the story, the protagonist Hyouma Kunato despises these spirits since one of them took away something very important to him. Later he moves to Kyoto to live with Botan Nagatsuki, a girl who loves tsukumogami and treats them as a family.
Onigunso launched this manga in April 2014 in Shueisha‚Äôs Miracle Jump magazine and later in 2016, it got switched to Ultra Jump. If you can‚Äôt wait until the anime gets out, you can read the manga on Shueisha‚Äôs Shonen Jump+ website.

Charles Dickens was born in Hampshire on 7 February, 1812,
the second of eight children. His father, John, was a clerk
in the navy pay office. In 1814 the family moved to London
and then to Chatham, Kent.
In 1824, John Dickens got into financial problems and was sent to a debtors‚Äô prison, leaving his son to earn the money to pay his way out; Charles, then 12, went to work in a blacking factory, an experience that was to make a deep impression on him. He also had a formal education, going to school from 1824-1827, when he left to become a law office clerk. Dickens soon turned to writing, however, writing factual articles for several newspapers and magazines throughout the 1830s. He also edited periodical publications, such as Bentley‚Äôs Miscellany and the London Daily News.
Dickens‚Äô career in fiction started in 1833 when some of his short stories were accepted by periodicals. In 1836 he published his first books, Sketches By Boz and The Pickwick Papers, which proved to be popular. Most of Dickens‚Äô books, including Oliver Twist, were published in monthly instalments, leaving readers to wait a month to find out what happened next. You can see how Dickens used cliff-hangers to maintain people‚Äôs interest by looking at the endings of chapters.
Published in 1839-39, Oliver Twist was one of Dickens‚Äô earlier novels, along with Nicholas Nickleby (1837-1839) and The Old Curiosity Shop (1840-1841). Among his later works are David Copperfield, Bleak House (1852-53), A Tale Of Two Cities (1859) and Great Expectations (1860-1861). As well as writing, Dickens spend a lot of time touring the country and abroad, publicising his books and giving lectures. He also founded and edited a magazine called Household Words (later called All The Year Round). Dickens married Catherine Hogarth, the daughter of a friend in 1836 and together they had 10 children, although they separated in 1858. In 1860 he moved to a house near Rochester, Kent, where he died in 1870.Nov 08, ¬∑ SUPPORT LARB. DONATE $50 OR MORE BY MIDNIGHT, DECEMBER 31, The Los Angeles Review of Books is a (c)(3) nonprofit.

A recent study from the University of Bordeaux found that people who eat two or more servings of fish per week have a lower chance of developing vascular brain disease: a condition that damages blood flow and vessels in the brain. Eating a diet rich in fish‚Äîparticularly salmon, tuna, and sardines‚Äî provides protection for people younger than 75.
According to the Knowridge Science Report, the study was conducted on 1,623 elders, 65 years and up. Brain scans were taken to search for vascular disease, indicating cognitive decline and dementia. They found that 31% of the elders who didn‚Äôt eat any fish had underlying vascular brain disease; 23% for those who ate fish three times per week, and 18% for those who ate four or more servings.
The team advised that our diet plays a strong factor in our cognitive decline, so it‚Äôs imperative that we modify it accordingly.
If this is true, then I‚Äôm on the right track.
Until Next Time‚Ä¶

Ask someone in the financial services industry to define financial advice and most will point to wealth management and advisor-led financial planning for high net worth clients. But ask a customer, and they‚Äôll give a more holistic definition that doesn‚Äôt set thresholds based on wealth, nor restrict advice only for long-term needs. This dichotomy presents an opportunity for transformative realignment.
In a 2020 report, Deloitte observes how ‚Äúthe worlds of retail banking and wealth management have started to collapse into each other.‚Äù Though financial institutions have historically offered generalized advice to retail customers through financial literacy seminars, blog posts and other educational tools, few have a vision of individualized advice.
But to win, retain and grow customer relationships, financial institutions must align their organizations around giving high-quality advice to all. Simply put, financial advice must expand beyond wealth to other areas of consumer need ‚Äì decisions about saving, home-buying, automobiles, insurance, education, vacations and many other topics involve some amount of advice.
Digital channels are optimized primarily for simple transactions and tasks, such as opening accounts, viewing balances, depositing checks and making payments. Advice on digital channels are usually static blog posts, generic articles and one-size-fits-all video content. Why aren‚Äôt banks leveraging their now-robust digital channels to discover customer needs and efficiently connect customers with the right bankers and specialists?
Branch traffic has long been declining, a trend accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. As branch visits went down, so did opportunities to engage customers in richer and deeper interactions that might have built stronger relationships and uncovered additional needs.
Even when people come back into branches, most will expect (or at least appreciate) a more efficient experience, with some digital pre-work and asynchronous follow-up to make that 10-minute meeting worth what might be a 30-minute trip to get there. Banks need to better understand their customers outside their branches and deliver advice wherever, however and whenever is best for the customer.
We think the branch will still play a role, but that digital needs discovery will continue to gain in importance. Ultimately, solution delivery will be digitally facilitated using remote human to human interaction. This will be done via specialists in specific events (such as buying a house, setting up an IRA and spousal death) as well as along demographic lines that include recent grads, HENRYs (High Earners, Not Rich Yet), high earning years and retirement decumulation.
All of these specialists can‚Äôt be housed in one branch, except perhaps at flagship locations. So while the specialists might still sit in a branch, they will engage with most customers digitally in some way (video chat/mail/phone) to deliver advice and offer solutions.
Despite historical consumer preferences to get advice outside their banks, three-quarters of American retail bank customers say they want their bank to offer them advice and guidance, with more than half preferring to get advice digitally, according to JD Power. Consumers increasingly demand convenience, which means that they expect to not only deposit a check on the go, but will be looking to get advice instantaneously and effortlessly.
Banks often miss out on the virtuous cycle of needs-driven customer service enabled by needs discovery. For the customer, needs-driven service means better financial products that enable financial success and satisfaction. And for the bank, deepened customer loyalty yields higher long-term value from increased wallet share and decreased attrition.
Enabling advice for all financial decisions across all lines of business is a stepwise process, so it makes sense to start with high-priority areas shared by customers. Looking for patterns in recent customer needs, including the actions of customers similar to them and taking macroeconomic and local trends into consideration, can help identify retail banking areas where advice is most needed.
Delivering advice requires having insights into customers‚Äô needs, so it makes sense to invest in ways to discover needs at scale. Without accurate, real-time customer needs data, bankers are about as effective as radiologists without x-ray images.
Lastly, for bankers to provide consistent, high-quality advice to retail customers, they need to be incentivized to focus on advice, rather than just sales or service. Creating objective metrics to measure the success of advice delivery, as well as incentivizing advice-driven customer satisfaction through compensation, can provide the right behavioral structures to achieve organizational transformation.This product symbolizes the philosophy of furniture ROMP ‚Äì design is at the top of the tree.

Three weeks after the assassination of acclaimed Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, it appears the Turkish authorities have grasped neither the message of Hrant‚Äôs life nor the significance of his death. In the days immediately following Dink‚Äôs shocking death, allegedly at the hands of a fanatic Turkish nationalist, we in Armenia and others around the world wanted to believe that the outpouring of public grief would create a crack in the Turkish wall of denial and rejection, and that efforts would be made to chip away at the conditions that made the assassination possible. We all hoped that the gravity of this slaying and the breadth of the reaction would have compelled Turkey‚Äôs leaders to seize the moment and make a radical shift in the policies that sustain today‚Äôs dead-end situation. However, after those initial hints at conciliation, the message out of Ankara has already changed. Last week, according to the Turkish media, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said there can be no rapprochement with Armenia‚Äôs because Armenia‚Äôs still insist on talking about the genocide. The prime minister is right. Armenia‚Äôs do insist on talking about the genocide. It‚Äôs a history-changing event that ought not, indeed cannot, be forgotten. However, we also advocate a rapprochement. And one is not a precondition for the other. Dia‚Äôsia‚Äôs US Congress to affirm the USia‚Äôs,ia‚Äôsia‚Äôs who share his vision of understanding and harmony among peoples and for Turks who share his dream of living in peace with neighbors and with history.

Criteria Used for Evaluation
Ease of Use
Being that no tools or hardware is required to put these sturdy locks in place, they could not be any easier to put in. Once the locks are in place, the only time you will need to open them is to open the window. If you purchase the locks for security against burglars or to prevent children from opening the windows, then you will probably not be opening them much. To aerate a room, these locks can be released an inch or two to allow in the air but still keep the window from opening any more than that. When you want to remove the locks or open them for temporary releasing, just a turn of the included key will do the trick. The window locks of plastic material that attaches to the window pane can be released and locked again by a simple sliding motion.
Effectiveness
Each of these fantastic locks will keep a child from opening the window they are attached to, provided they fit properly and are the correct size for the window that is needed. It is easy to just buy a lock and not look at the size requirements for it. These measurements are given in the manufacturer‚Äôs details of the product and should be followed precisely. If the lock is not the right size, then it will not work properly to safeguard your windows. You will not be able to trust that it will work because it will be either too loose or too tight to work correctly. Again, we want to mention that it is important that children do not see the installation or mechanics of these locks if they are intended to prevent children access. They can learn the process of opening these locks easily.

Other Factors to Consider
Durability
The majority of these excellent locks are made of strong steel and metal materials, so they will be usable for many years of locking windows. Several comments online were made of how a few of these models were heavy and substantial. The locks may be small, but they are tough to hold a window tight and secure. The few plastic locks we feature are strong also and will last a long time. These cannot be reused once they are in place on a window because they adhere in place with a strong adhesive. They can be removed, but then new ones will have to be purchased again. the metal locks that fit on the track of the window can be used over and over again for many years.
Frequently Asked Questions
q: Do you need hardware or tools to put these locks on the windows?
No, hardware and tools are not needed to put any of these great locks in place on the windows. They use either a strong adhesive to stick to the window glass, or they have their own hex keys to tighten the lock on the window track.
q: How do these attach to the windows?
The majority of these featured window locks clamp onto the window track by tightening a key as a screw. They will keep the window open a few inches or keep them closed to prevent opening. The plastic locks adhere to the window pane to prevent the sliding part of the window from moving up or across if it is a horizontal window. The ones with the hex keys can be used over and over again, but the ones with the strong adhesive to the window cannot be used again.
q: How do these locks work? Do they all have the same mechanics of operation?
Most of the locks featured here are strong clamp-type locks that are fastened tightly with a hex screw. These will allow the window to be completely shut, or it can be partially opened to aerate a room. There are a few locks listed that simply adhere to the window to keep it from opening. These are made of a strong plastic and are manipulated with a sliding motion to lock and unlock them.
q: Can a child learn to manipulate these by watching an adult or do they need strength to open them?
Children can learn how to use these to their advantage. If they watch you install the locks, then they will surely know how they operate. Some of these can be placed at the top of the windows where kids cannot reach them. Strength is not really needed to release these locks unless you tighten the screws on them really tight. This way children will not be able to manipulate them even if they know how to work them.
q: Are these locks for any type of window?
They are mainly for regular sliding windows and doors. They vary in the type of materials that are around the window such as plastic or wood for some of them, but generally, they will fit most windows.
q: Does the window have to be a certain size or build for these to work properly?
No, these will work on any size of sliding window or door that is made of a glass or mirror surface. The locks do vary with type and style, but the majority of them will work with almost any regular window.
q: What is the most common complaint about these window locks online from customers?
The most complained about feature of these locks, in general, is that they do not fit or do not work on the particular window they were intended for. This is understandable because of the vast number of window types and track sizes that are in use in homes. Some people said these were too big, while others said they were too small. A few comments said that several of the models came off easily and were easy for their kids to remove or open. It is important that the child not be shown how these locks operate because they will then be able to open them themselves. As far as the sizing issue, the sizes and accommodations of the locks are given in the manufacturer‚Äôs details of each type. We suggest that you look at those closely before ordering any of these locks. You will save time, aggravation, and money by ensuring that the ones you order are the correct size for the window you want to lock.

LONDON - Defending champion Ding Junhui of China was beaten by Stuart Bingham of England 5-6 in the semifinals of the Welsh Open at Newport on Saturday.
Bingham made brilliant breaks in the last two frames to defeat Ding Junhui in a thrilling semifinal.
The world No 10 went ahead 2-0 and 4-2 but Ding, ranked 9th in the world, pulled back and made it 5-4 in the best-of-11 match.
Bingham, enjoying the best season of his career and chasing his fourth title having won the Premier League and two APTC events, produced a nerveless finish with runs of 93 and 108 as he fought back to book a place in the final at the Newport Center.
He will face Stephen Maguire on Sunday after the Scot defeated world number two Judd Trump 6-4 in the other semifinal.
"I can't believe how well I held myself together in the end," said Bingham. "When I missed the black at 4-2 I thought it was going to cost me but in the end I got the job done."
Ding said: "I didn't play as well as I did in other matches this week and I had some bad shot selection.."

Many farm stead‚Äôs have been converted into housing bringing a greater population into the countryside. There are business parks at: Park Farm, Berwick Hill, Pont Park, and Prestwick Park, all boosting the local economy and bringing local jobs. There are various businesses located in the countryside providing services to the local community, not just for horse riders but dog kennels, catteries, cycle repairs shop and even a gym in a barn.
Local pubs and restaurants are located in the attractive countryside the Civil Parish. Pubs such as the Waggon Inn, the Highlander and the Badger all bring in custom due to their location. Dissington Hall is a prestigious conference and events centre and there is also a successful garden centre at Dobbies. The area is also seeing an increase in tourism and leisure developments, particularly linked to the Reivers Way National Cycle Route.
Medburn
The hamlet of Medburn, a small linear settlement, a mile to the west of the Darras Hall Estate comprises a mixture of original village housing, small farms and some small home based business as well as newer executive homes. Medburn has grown significantly in the last 10 years largely due to back land development; however it has no village facilities or amenities.
Milbourne
A small hamlet centred around East Town Farm, approximately 2 miles north west of Ponteland. It was formerly a ‚Äòpick your own‚Äô soft fruit farm and shop.
Smallburn
The Cottage Homes were established in 1903, designed by Newcastle architects Oliver, Leeson and Wood for the Newcastle Board of Guardians, initially taking in children from the workhouse on Westgate Road to the west of Newcastle. Originally there was a superintendent‚Äôs house which included stores and an office, four blocks of semidetached cottages and a half block, initially intended to be an isolation hospital, arranged around an oval green. Each cottage was supervised by a ‚Äòhouse-father‚Äô or ‚Äòhouse-mother‚Äô and accommodated between thirty and forty children, about 300 in all. The homes, which were extended in 1913, eventually included a school, infirmary and workshops on site. The latter would have been used for general upkeep and maintenance in the homes and also for training the boys in specific skills.
During the early 1960s the whole site was taken over and established as the Northumberland Teacher Training College. This was closed in 1981 and acquired by Northumbria Police for their Headquarters.
Berwick Hill
Located at the edge of the parish boundary, the area has a rifle range and office units. The central point is the farm and several cottages originally for agricultural workers in the area.
Kirkley Hall
The Ogle family owned Kirkley Estates from 1632 until 1922. The Grade II Listed Hall was damaged by fire in 1929 and rebuilt on a smaller scale to designs by Newcastle architects Burns, Dick and MacKellar. It is located approximately 3 miles to the north of Ponteland. In 1946 the estate was acquired by Northumberland County Council and in 1951 Kirkley Hall Farm Institute was established.
In 1999 the estate became the land studies campus of Northumberland College. The campus has specialist resources and continues to diversify and expand. Approximately 90 people are currently employed on the site.
Facilities include:
- An equestrian centre with indoor and outdoor riding arenas, 25 horse stable yard and
- specialist equine facilities;
- Kirkley Hall Zoological Gardens with over 120 species;
- A veterinary centre and grooming parlour;
- An outdoor activity centre with high ropes and zip wire and sailing base at Blyth;

High Callerton
High Callerton is a small community that adjoins Ponteland. The settlement grew up around a range of farm buildings, manor halls and farmhouses. Some of the original traditional farm buildings were converted into residences in mid-1970s and 1980s. These changes have involved alteration, demolition and extension of existing structures. The result is the current built form of the settlement.
Prestwick
Berwick Hill and Prestwick have a variety of units offering professional, retail and cafe outlets. Many of the farm stead‚Äôs have diversified into B&Bs, livery, kennels, catteries, farm shops and holiday lets.
Mining around the Prestwick area has a long history as far back as the 13th century with bell pits at first and deep mining from the 18th century. There were offices, canteens and pithead baths when underground mining finished in 1966. From 1951 until 1990 an area near the railway was used as an explosives depot by ICI. Storage was in soil-covered bunkers on low-lying ground and the railway remained open for the trains carrying explosives. In 1995 Ward Bros took over the site and it is now being used for landfill.Spring 2018

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is now on his way to Washington for a first official visit. He is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden Aug. 26. Iran‚Äôs nuclear ambitions and its involvement in disseminating terrorism throughout the Middle East will undoubtedly form the center of this week‚Äôs White House talks between Bennett and Biden and his team. Sources close to Bennett told the press Aug. 23 that Israel has drawn up a strategic plan to contain Iran, block its nuclear breakout efforts and rein in its regional subversion. They said Bennett intends to try to mobilize Biden‚Äôs support for this road map.
However, in the lead-up to Bennett‚Äôs first White House visit, far less media attention is being paid to another regional actor linked to the Iranian issue who troubles Israel‚Äôs leadership just as much: Hezbollah, which is fast becoming a significant threat equal to the Iranian one. While Iran continues its slow progress toward developing a nuclear weapon, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is moving much faster to amass first hundreds and then thousands of precision missiles. Israel considers this buildup a strategic tie breaker that would enable Hezbollah to harm its military and economic infrastructure and greatly hamper the capabilities of its air force and other means at its disposal.
Intelligence assessments put the number of Nasrallah‚Äôs precision missiles threatening Israeli infrastructure targets at several dozen. Despite concerted Israeli efforts to block the missile project, Hezbollah is moving its infrastructure and production capacities from Syria to Lebanon.
Discussions in Israel regarding the tipping point that will prompt action against this threat started during the administration of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and are ongoing. While Israel focused its past offensive actions on targeting nuclear and nonconventional weapons development, it has never faced a conventional threat of this magnitude.
Hezbollah‚Äôs domestic troubles are the only bright spot on Israel‚Äôs horizon. Officials in Jerusalem believe the organization is experiencing growing difficulties against the backdrop of the crisis in Lebanon and the fact that some Lebanese hold Hezbollah directly responsibility for the state‚Äôs collapse.
Col. (res.) Udi Evental, a former top military intelligence official and intelligence aide to the prime minister, said recently that the domestic arena in Lebanon reacted with harsh criticism to the barrage of rockets fired by the organization at Israel on Aug. 6. According to Evental‚Äôs analysis, following the condemnations, including by Lebanon‚Äôs Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai and former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Nasrallah was forced to deliver an apologetic speech explaining the logic of his organization‚Äôs actions and to use his influence in the media to sell the despairing Lebanese public on the importance of Hezbollah.
Unfortunately for Nasrallah, not all Lebanese are convinced that he will not drag the crumbling state into a violent clash with Israel. According to Evental, Nasrallah fears that Israel will take advantage of the dire domestic situation in Lebanon to change the strategic equation and rules of the game with his organization.
In his talks with Biden and senior administration officials, Bennett is expected to highlight the tremendous importance of beating Iran in the race to ease Lebanon‚Äôs shortage of cash, fuel, power and gas.
Concerning this Iranian race, Israel is closely monitoring two contradicting forces. On one hand, we have an Iranian oil tanker sailing toward Lebanon, with Hezbollah warning Israel and the West against trying to disrupt its passage. In parallel, we have recent comments by US Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea that the United States is trying to help supply Lebanon‚Äôs energy needs with natural gas transported from Egypt to northern Lebanon via Jordan and Syria.
Israel is enthusiastically encouraging this US initiative to ease Lebanon‚Äôs plight, fearing that the alternative of turning Iran into Lebanon‚Äôs savior could greatly strengthen Nasrallah. A sensitive idea being floated is using natural gas from Israel‚Äôs offshore fields. The plentiful deposits discovered off Israel‚Äôs coast in recent years have made it an exporter of natural gas to Egypt and Jordan. Israel is currently connected to a gas pumping network extending from Egypt through the Sinai Desert, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Although Israel only supplies Jordan and Egypt, it is hooked up to the pan-Arab gas pipeline.
Will the United States try to rope Israel into efforts to save Lebanon by supplying it with natural gas? Right now, that option sounds fanciful: a deal whereby Israel increases its gas supply to Egypt offering convenient payment conditions subsidized by the Americans so that Egypt and perhaps Jordan, too, can supply this surplus gas to Lebanon.
In a perfect world, involving Israel in efforts to help Lebanon could work wonders for improving the general climate in the Middle East and cutting Hezbollah down to size. But such an outcome would require diplomatic miracles. While Bennett is thought to be toying with the idea, the question remains how willing the Americans will be willing to entertain it and whether the Egyptians and Jordanians would be willing to go along. And, of course, we have yet to ask Lebanon what it thinks.Psychological counseling

Recent CommentsThe last year has changed our views on holidays. Some people are telling me they are worried about going overseas for some time to come. Others can‚Äôt wait to get on a plane.
However, what happens when you get there may well be different. It may be the case that masks will be worn in public inside spaces for a long time yet and I doubt that anyone will look at you strangely if you wear one.
Amongst other slight changes I‚Äôm expecting to see are fewer open buffets, I would expect a buffet still but one where a server will load your plate for you so that you‚Äôre not sharing utensils. Hand sanitisers have been common on cruises for years, but you‚Äôre likely to see more of them in hotels, restaurants and other public spaces.
Some countries currently have curfews in place, and they may continue in cities, more than seaside resorts. There might also be some restrictions on numbers on public transport ‚Äì so be ready for queues (socially distanced, of course) at bus and tram stops and rail stations. You may also have to prebook a visit to museums as well as theatres and concerts.
This means more planning in advance. If you‚Äôre taking a city break, in particular ‚Äì try and book anything you want to do before you leave the UK.
In terms of destinations, the main European resorts and cities will return and be as popular as always. However, countries on the Red List will obviously take longer to return as destinations for UK travellers. Many of these countries are destinations for the more adventurous traveller ‚Äì such as Botswana, Ecuador, Kenya, Namibia, and Peru. But they will appear on a Green List again one day, but vaccination rates must rise more rapidly.
Once life returns to normal (if you remember what that‚Äôs like!), I‚Äôd expect when hotels do renovation work that they will make more space for their guests. Maybe more space in the restaurants, fewer hotel rooms, fewer storeys in hotels (so you spend less time in a lift). It is likely that because of this, prices will rise.
What changes do you think will happen because of the pandemic? Do you agree with my thoughts?Guest Whorebo Posted November 2, 2005 Report Share Posted November 2, 2005 Oh ffs! The idea of a petition was mentioned once and now that I want on the band wagon noone seems to want to do it. There is obviously no solution to the problem, which means we basically were sold notebooks, with DX9 compatible cards, which cannot do DX9 due to built in driver problems (unless you upgrade to unofficial drivers, from early last year), aside the fact that you cant even use new drivers. So basically, according to Toshibas drivers, we cant use our graphic cards to even half their potential! THis is ridiculous... Why am I the only one that is irritated by this? Do you all have so much money that you can buy a new notebook at your leisure? I chucked in a massive chunk into this notebook, and I dont have that much being a student...

Or do you cringe at the thought of using google keyword planner just like I used to?
Do you ask yourself why does it really have to be complicated or hard?
Give me 15 minutes of your time and I‚Äôll simplify it for you.
Yes that‚Äôs right.
It‚Äôs definitely worth your time to invest 15 minutes, let me show you why. I did a little experiment this week because I knew I was writing this post and I wanted a fresh new example to show you. Here‚Äôs a peek at my traffic this week:
I‚Äôve been averaging only about 35 views a day on average and spiking up higher when I did a post. However I was looking for a bigger more sustainable longer term hit of traffic making sure I get my best content out there with search terms people are really looking for.
When I did this it immediately doubled my traffic.
And I‚Äôve seen this traffic increase for 2 days in a row and it shows no signs of slowing down. And the post I experimented with jumped up into the #1 most popular post on my site.
You can also increase website traffic with this simple SEO strategy.
Let‚Äôs walk through simple step by step process so you can get similar results using on page SEO
I highly recommend that you have these 3 things in place before you get started:
- so once you have both of those in place let‚Äôs dive into the steps‚Ä¶
7 Steps to Increase Website Traffic with A Simple On Page SEO Strategy
You can use this strategy with all of your content and I suggest that you start with your most popular content first
Step 1: Locate your most popular content
You can use this strategy with all of your content and I suggest that you start with your most popular content first because you‚Äôll get the best results doing it this way.
Go into your google analytics account and click on Behavior and then on Site Content then All Pages.
Then you‚Äôll want to change the date range to 90 days like this:
Then look below at your top performing pages and make a list of them. Pick the top performing post and start there. Keep a list of other posts that you‚Äôll want to work on later.
Step 2: Go to the Google Keyword Planner
Open the keyword planner and copy in the url of your post and it will analyze it and come up with a list of suggested keywords for you.
Step 3: Strategize Your Keywords
Here‚Äôs the important part‚Ä¶you want to look for keywords for you page that have between 300 and 700 searches a month. And preferably ones that are not high competition either.
300- 700 with medium or low competition will work best for your purposes.
If you don‚Äôt find one that fits, use the suggested keywords and start drilling down from there using the keyword planner.
The point is to just get this done and don‚Äôt obsess over the perfect keyword!
Step 4: Update your content with your keywords
Go in and change the following:
a. Update your permalink with the new keyword
b. Add it to your title
c. Add it into your content preferably in the first few sentences, in a subtitle and at the end of your blog post. Remember you don‚Äôt want to stuff keywords, rather add them in where they fit naturally.
d. Change the alt text of your featured image to include you new keyword.
Step 5: Set up your redirect
If you have linked to the content from other places on your website or on social media you‚Äôll want to use the 301 redirect plugin to set up your redirect. This is simple to do‚Ä¶
Step 6. Publish your updated content
If your content is older and you‚Äôve updated it, I like to add this at the top of it: Last Updated On: (add the date you updated). This lets readers know you have updated the content recently and that it is worthwhile for them to read it.
Step 7. Promote your content out on Social Media
At the very least you‚Äôll want to promote your new content out on Google Plus. This will get the search engines crawling your site and they will put your google + post in one of the top positions right away for the keyword.
When I did mine this week, it only took a few minutes for my google + post to get into the #2 place for my keywords:
To recap the process:
Before you get started get these 3 things in place if you don‚Äôt have them already:
- Google account
- SEO by Yoast Plugin
- 301 Redirect Plugin
7 Step Recap to Increase Website Traffic With This Simple SEO Strategy
- Locate Your Most Popular Content
- Go to the Google Keyword Planner
- Strategize Your Keywords
- Update Your Content With Your Keywords
- Set Up Your Redirect
- Publish Your Content
- Promote Your Content Out on Social Media
It only takes 15 minutes tops!
Don‚Äôt let yourself get obsessed with picking exactly the right keyword. Find one that meets the criteria and works with your post and go with it.
Get everything right here in this handy checklist! 01, 2006
bad week
This was a bad week for my diet. On one hand I'm actually tickled that my weight has remained in the same range. BUT, this was a very stressful week, Todd and I were getting ready to go on vacation and stopped by to say goodbye to his mom. We found her in bed, delirious. APparently, the cancer in her bones was not only eating the bones, but releasing all that calcium into her bloodstream...causing delirium. From research and from what Hospice said, I knew that this was going to lead to her death. We cancelled our vaction and we started spendign 20 hours out of the day over there. It was a rough week. When we did find time to eat, it was really bad food. We live in the country...restaurants are not plentiful so we ate where we could catch a bite. AND to make matters worse, even when we were at home, there was no food....remember we were leaving for vacation so we had no food at the house...ok we had food but the basics that you need to prepare that food was/is missing. So, eating bad and exhaustion was my week. I didn't drink my water like I should be doing. Last night was the first night I slept in my bed, she passed yesterday and I weighed myself this morning. I was sad to see 2 pounds up...but tickled because that could really be water retention or something......it could have been a lot worse! But what an interesting lesson to see what happens when things get bad in my life.

The following statement was sent via email on Thursday, September 16, 2021 at 12:24, to KU Lawrence Faculty and Staff, and Active Students on the Lawrence and Edwards Campus
September 16, 2021
Dear members of the KU community,
We have had three different student protests or rallies in only one week on campus.
The first (9/12) was a protest organized to demand a vaccination mandate at KU. The second (9/13) was a rally celebrating Indigenous cultures, which occurred in response to the vandalization of the KU Common Work of Art titled Native Hosts, by Edgar Heap of Birds. The third (9/13, 9/14) was held in condemnation of sexual assault and rape culture, and triggered by a reported case of sexual assault at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. Furthermore, during this last week and a half the KU Student Body President has been confronted with ongoing racist attacks on social media.
Taken together, these events tell us that many members of our community feel unsafe: fearful about a global pandemic that rages on, racist attacks, and sexual violence.
We want to take this moment as your teachers, advisors, support and research staff, and fellow students, to tell you that you are not alone, especially if you feel unsafe, or unseen. While our return to campus brought much-needed community, the last week and a half has been both directly violent and violating to some members of our community. We know that this kind of violence can also trigger survivors, and makes us all feel less safe.
We condemn racism. We condemn sexual violence. We stand with those of you who feel unsafe.
We know that the University is still investigating the recent acts of vandalism at the Spencer Museum. We do not know the intent behind these acts, but we know their impact on the Indigenous community has been profound. Years of colonial violence make it impossible not to experience the desecration as racist. The peaceful rally Monday, which featured several of our community‚Äôs Indigenous artists and leaders, was a moment of affirmation and peace for many of us. We appreciate that the Indigenous community welcomed us all into their rally to celebrate their heritage.
We know that the recent incidents of sexual assault are still under investigation, but while we believe in due process, we also believe survivors and stand with the young woman whose college career was disrupted in this horrific way last weekend. We are all thinking of you, Jane Doe; you have a community on this campus that will be here to support you, and peers that are fearlessly seeking justice for you. Those of you with your own #metoo stories, KU has confidential resources to assist you through ourCARE Coordinator, or the Sexual Trauma and Abuse Care Center.
There is also another young woman who needs our community‚Äôs support. Regardless of one‚Äôs feelings about the retweet by Student Body President, Niya McAdoo, no one should ever be subjected to racist and misogynistic attacks for exercising their right to free speech. We condemn these attacks. It is through our ability to stand together, whether we agree with one another or not, whether we look the same or not, to shield one another and to keep one another safe, that we will truly measure the strength of community.
Many of us at KU have stood together in solidarity against different forms of violence this last week. These efforts come on the heels of a long and ongoing pandemic that has deprived many of us of community. Now more than ever, we must continue to denounce violence of all forms. Now more than ever, we must work together to create a community of care for all of us.
Please know that the University Senate is a space in which you can find support. If you need dialogue and community, reach out to any of us, and we will work to foster these spaces for you. We also strongly believe that as a community we need to work together to ensure that all spaces feel safe and unthreatening to all of us. We are proud of KU students for their strength in standing up for all those who may not have the strength to stand alone.

I‚Äôve been thinking about this idea that people who don‚Äôt know about evolution (or vaccines, or whatever) in this age of the Internet are willfully ignorant, and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I disagree quite strongly.
Yes, all the evidence is online. Yes, the evidence for these scientific discoveries is overwhelming. Yes, pretty much all of us have internet access. But there‚Äôs another side to this story.
First, can we really expect people to have the curiosity to go learn something new all on their own, especially if it could endanger their place in life? Many creationists are taught that evolution in particular is a hoax that leads people away from God and therefore into Hell. If you believed you were risking eternal damnation, would you really go looking for evidence for evolution? Would you really go through the effort of searching through the Google results for a site that looked legitimate? Of course not, you would stick to nice safe sites like icr.org. Even if someone does learn about evolution, they might lose their whole community and even their job, in some cases, by coming to accept it and its implications for Christianity.
Not only that, but most people simply aren‚Äôt that curious. It takes effort to learn about evolution (or vaccines); evolution is counter-intuitive in some ways, and you‚Äôre just as likely to find bad information as good if you don‚Äôt already know what you‚Äôre looking for. It isn‚Äôt like learning who is the governor of Arizona or what movies Nicholas Cage starred in or some little factoid question like that. Many, perhaps most, people are just going to stick with what they learned growing up and never question it.
Second, even if someone is curious, they might simply not have the time. Many people work extremely long hours and simply can‚Äôt take up a side research project, especially if they want to do the honest thing and read as much as they can from experts on both sides. There‚Äôs too much data to take in and analyze when you only have a spare 15 minutes every few days.
Third, even if someone is curious and has time, there is no guarantee that they will look in the right place. There are tons and tons and tons of information on the internet, and no good way to tell which is true and which is false. It simply makes more sense to ask a trusted friend or family member for a starting place, which is likely to only give the searcher evidence for the position they already hold.
Fourth, even if someone is curious, has time, and looks in the right place(s), they may still not be able to tell which of two opposing viewpoints presents a better argument or has more evidence. Maybe they don‚Äôt have critical thinking skills, or maybe they aren‚Äôt overly intelligent, or maybe they have a vested interest in believing one side over the other, or maybe there is a combination of all three going on. In any case, even the best someone has might still not be good enough to help them draw the right conclusion, especially if they live fairly withdrawn from varying opinions (and many people do).
Therefore, painting everyone who holds any opinion with the same brush of ‚Äúwillfully ignorant‚Äù is committing the hasty generalization fallacy. Of course some people who hold opinions like young earth creationism are willfully ignorant, and of course it is frustrating that so many people hold false opinions, but to assume that any ignorance is willful is foolish and ignorant. Almost, I would say, willfully ignorant, but it is more likely that people who claim those with false opinions (like young earth creationism) are willfully ignorant simply haven‚Äôt considered points like the ones I just brought up.
6 thoughts on ‚ÄúOn Whether All Ignorance Is Willful‚Äù
I actually agree with this fairly strongly.
Yes but when someone comes along and explains the science to them and they say ‚Äúla la la la I can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù that‚Äôs where the willful part comes in. I agree, but there are a lot of willfully ignorant people out there.
You‚Äôre certainly right; I have encountered willfully ignorant people more than I would prefer. I wrote this post mainly out of frustration that I was repeatedly encountering the obviously foolish idea that all ignorance is willful because we live in the internet age, where essentially all information is available for almost no effort or money.
I can‚Äôt help but think that somebody trusting their parents or not knowing a topic exists are very valid reasons for them to be ignorant; in such a situation, how can their ignorance be called willful?
There is also the phenomenon of people who essentially become experts in anti-science bullshit. You could read answers in genesis articles that seem professional and scientific for hours a day and think you‚Äôre educating yourself, when in reality they‚Äôre biased to say the least and inaccurate and unscientific to the extreme.
That‚Äôs a very good point. I have personally been there with icr.org.
They dress up pseudoscience very well. Especially when creationist websites title all their articles ‚Äúby so n‚Äô so, PhD‚Äù but don‚Äôt tell you the person has a PhD in a completely unrelated field, often not even related to natural science at all. I remember seeing a creationist website where a guy was wearing a white lab coat, calling himself doctor and lecturing about genetics and his credentials were that he was a chemist and an automotive technician. The degrees of the ‚Äúscientists who reject evolution‚Äù list are often things like law degrees, engineering degrees, criminology degrees etc. It‚Äôs like if I had a philosophy degree and walked around hospitals in a white coat calling myself doctor and asking everyone how they‚Äôre feeling today.[ PT032AER ]

Today comes news from a start-up that has actually been a part of that trend: Calendly, a popular cloud-based service that people use to set up and confirm conference times with others, has actually closed a financial investment of $350 million from OpenView Endeavor Partners and Iconiq.
The financing round consists of both primary and secondary cash (slightly more of the latter than the previous, from what I understand) and values the Atlanta-based startup, developed around what is basically a really, consisting of the capability to spend for a service in case your visit is not an organization meeting however, state, a yoga class. Prices varieties from totally free (one calendar/one user/one event) to premium ($ 8/month) and pro ($ 12/month) for more calendars, functions, occasions and combinations, with larger bundles for business likewise available.
Its growth, meanwhile, has to date been based primarily around a really organic technique: Calendly welcomes become links to Calendly itself, so people who utilize it and like it can (and do) start to utilize it, too.
The vast array of its use cases, and the virality of that growth method, have actually been winners. Calendly is currently lucrative, and it has been for several years. And more recently, it has seen a boost, specifically in the last twelve months, as brand-new Calendly users have emerged, as a result of how we are living.
We may not be doing more traditional ‚Äúcompany meetings‚Äù each week, but the number of conferences we now need to set up, has increased.
All of the impromptu and serendipitous encounters we used to have around an office, or a neighborhood coffee shop, or the park? Those also need invites for online conferences.
And so do sessions with therapists, virtual supper celebrations, and even (where they can still happen) in-person meetings, which are frequently now occurring with more timed accuracy and more record-keeping, to keep social distancing and prospective joined by instructors, freelancers, specialists, and entrepreneurs, the business says.
The company last year made about $70 million each year in membership incomes from its SaaS-based service design and seems positive that its aggregated profits will not long from now get to $1 billion.
While the secondary funding is going towards providing liquidity to existing financiers and early employees, Awotona said the strategy will be to use the primary capital to invest in the company‚Äôs organization.
That will include developing out its platform with more tools and integrations‚Äì it started with and still has a significant R&D operation in Kiev, Ukraine‚Äì broadening its operations with more talent (it presently has around 200 staff members and strategies to double headcount), further service advancement and more. Calendly Llc Vat
2 notable proceed that front are also being revealed with the financing: Jeff Diana is coming on as primary individuals building in San Francisco is currently a huge modification for Calendly. The start-up, which is going on 8 years old, has actually been rather off the radar for many years.
That remains in part due to the truth that it raised really little money up to now (just $550,000 from a handful of investors that consist of OpenView, Atlanta Ventures, IncWell and Greenspring Associates).
It‚Äôs likewise based in Atlanta, a significantly significant may have closed this big round quietly and continued to proceed with service, were it not for a brief Tweet last fall that signaled the business raising money and shaping up to be a quiet giant.
‚Äù The business‚Äôs capital effectiveness and what @TopeAwotona has actually developed should have way more credit than they get,‚Äù it read. ‚ÄúPerhaps this will start to alter that acknowledgment.‚Äù

This course will equip participants to perform hybrid QM/MM simulations using the molecular dynamics code GROMACS in combination with the quantum chemistry package CP2K through an interface developed by one of the instructors from the BioExcel Centre of Excellence ().
Prerequisites
Participants should be familiar with using GROMACS to perform molecular dynamics simulations. A background in computational quantum chemistry is not strictly required since an introduction of key aspects will be provided, but previous familiarity is beneficial. You should be familiar with connecting to a remote machine using ssh and will benefit from experience using an HPC facility as you will execute hands-on practicals on the UK supercomputer ARCHER2.
Description
Most classical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields are not sufficiently flexible to model processes in which chemical bonds are broken or formed. Instead, some level of quantum mechanical (QM) description is needed to gain detailed mechanistic insights into reaction mechanisms, e.g. the catalytic action of enzymes, and to compute photochemical properties such as absorption and emission spectra of fluorescent proteins. However biochemical systems (including solvent) are too large to be solved in their entirety at ab initio QM level or efficiently even with a high-quality density functional theory (DFT) approximation. To overcome the cost of a QM description on the one hand versus the limitations of a MM treatment on the other hand, methods have been developed that treat a small critical region of interest at QM level while retaining the computationally cheaper MM force field for the majority of the system.
Despite the simplicity of the QM/MM concept, its application is currently restricted to a relatively small group of specialised expert users often using in-house codes. To unlock the power of QM/MM simulations for the wider biomolecular simulation community, the BioExcel Centre of Excellence has developed an interface between the molecular dynamics code GROMACS, which is widely used in the biomolecular simulation community, and the quantum chemistry package CP2K, which supports calculations under periodic boundary conditions with DFT methods.
This course explains key aspects relating to the use of QM/MM for biomolecular simulation with these two codes and equips participants with the ability to start using GROMACS and CP2K for this purpose in their own research. Participants are provided with the opportunity to gain hands-on practical experience running several example calculations on ARCHER2, the UK national supercomputing service.

In this case, you should be paid $10/hr for the first 40 hours (totaling $400) and $15/hr for the 5 overtime hours (totaling $75).
If you are eligible for overtime pay, it must be calculated on a weekly basis, regardless of whether or not you are paid hourly, by a monthly salary, or on another basis.
Remember, overtime pay cannot be offset by mandatory time off in a prior or subsequent workweek. If an employer has you work 45 hours in one week, but restricts you to 35 hours the next, he or she still has to pay you overtime for the first workweek.
Exempt Status
If you are a salaried employee, you should check your employment contract for overtime provisions. Generally, though, salaried employees are exempt from overtime. This means you are not entitled to overtime pay even if you work over 40 hours in a workweek.

If you are unsure, an employment lawyer can look into your situation and give you an opinion. Generally, factors included in this determination are:
- Whether or not your primary duty is to manage business
- Your control over other employees
- Your ability to hire and fire others
Suppose you are a retail manager. Most of your workday consists of stocking shelves and ringing up customers. You work over 40 hours in a workweek and are not paid overtime. When you ask why, your employer tells you that, per the law, you are exempt since you are considered a manager. This may be a misclassification. Despite your title, your duties consist mostly of non-managerial tasks and you do not have much control over other employees. An employment lawyer can help you remedy this misclassification.
Discrepancies between federal and state regulations
Sometimes, federal and state regulations regarding overtime clash. For example, federal law allows employers to restrict overtime to an employee if he or she earns over $100,000 annually. Pennsylvania law does not allow such a restriction. Also, federal law does not require overtime for computer employees but Pennsylvania law does. The regulation (federal or state) that provides the greatest benefit to the employee will be the standard that is enforced.In the event of program, the company are able to get ownership within the application by simply paying a particular sum.

Back in 2018, Takumi and Masato fight, allowing Karin to run away. Masato says this is none of Takumi‚Äôs business.
Sougo and Geiz arrive back home and are greeted by Takumi who Tsukuyomi has also brought home. Takumi introduces himself and Tsukuyomi explains what happened. Sougo and Geiz also fill Tsukuyomi in on the events back in 2011.
Next day, Sougo and Takumi approach Karin at school so they can protect her.
Back at the shop, Geiz and Tsukuyomi continue looking into the disappearances and find that they started before 2011. Geiz then notices that in all of the photos of the missing 18 year old Libras‚Ä¶ is Karin! And she looks exactly the same as she does now.
Karin tells Sougo and Takumi to leave her alone. Ohsugi-sensei finds them on the roof and they explain the situation and how they need to protect the one girl in school. But Ohsugi says there‚Äôs two girls now since one girl in his class is turning 18 today.
Tsukuyomi finds a newspaper article that says Karin is actually already dead after an accident in 2003 and her body had disappeared shortly after. The same day, two of her classmates also disappeared.
Uncle Junichiro arrives home with an old radio he‚Äôs going to fix. He points out that he‚Äôs only replacing it with new parts so it can last longer. But after he does, is it really still the same radio? It might be the same on the outside, but the insides are being replaced with new parts, basically on life support.
That‚Äôs a lightbulb for Geiz. He realizes the same may be happening to Karin. She wasn‚Äôt protecting them after falling from the roof, she was protecting Another Fourze who is using some kind of strange power to keep her alive by attacking high school girls over the course of15 years.
Tsukuyomi calls Sougo to tell him about their breakthrough.
The other Amanogawa High student turning 18 today, is celebrating her birthday in the Kazuraba apartment with her friends when Sakuma/Another Fourze appears to attack her. He chases her outside, but Karin stops Sakuma.
Karin tells the girl to run and tells Sakuma she wants him to stop killing for her.
Masato grabs Karin, saying he wants to stop Sakuma‚Äôs killing by basically killing Karin for good. They fight.
But Takumi arrives to help. Masato asks why he would do this. ‚ÄúI may hate you, Kusaka,‚Äù Takumi says, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre my friend! Though I hate to admit it.‚Äù
Sougo, Geiz and Tsukuyomi arrive.
Sakuma leaves. Takumi calls Sougo over and hands him the Faiz Watch. But Sougo decides to give it to Geiz to use and defeat Another Faiz. Geiz accepts its and leaves for 2003.
In 2003, Sakuma and Karin are making plans to meet for a date tonight to watch the meteor shower. But it‚Äôs another day and Karin seems sad and upset. With no presence of mind, she steps out onto the rain-soaked street as a car comes speeding toward her. She is hit and dies.
Sakuma is distraught and angry with himself when he goes to see Karin in the morgue. It appears he had not kept his promise to meet, which is why Karin was so sad.
Just then, Ora appears and explains that Sakuma will continue living hating and blame himself for this. But she offers him the contract to save Karin. Sakuma wants to do anything and everything for that so Ora shoves the Faiz Watch into him and he becomes Another Faiz.
Elsewhere in the city, Takumi suddenly dehenshins as he is fighting.
Sakuma finds the first 18 year old Libra from his class and sucks her in. But Geiz arrives. Ora freezes time.
Geiz lays it out on the table. Sakuma had been killing girls to keep Karin alive. But that power ran out after 15 years which is why sought out a new power, that is, the Fourze Watch courtesy of Schwartz.
Ora realizes it was Schwartz‚Äôs doing.
Back in 2018, Masato explains that all of Sakuma‚Äôs victims were assumed to be runaways and Karin would just transfer schools. Karin and Sakuma were part of a school for orphans called the Ryuusei School, which Masato was part of himself.
Sougo realizes that must be what Woz meant about shooting stars.
Masato couldn‚Äôt stop Sakuma, so he decided he should kill Karin and hide her from Sakuma instead, per her request.
‚ÄúRuining your life for a friend, what a fool,‚Äù Takumi says. But Sougo says Takumi is like that too. They all are. They would risk their lives to save their friends.
Back in 2003, Ora asks if Geiz is okay with letting Karin die if he defeats Another Faiz. But Geiz maintains that Karin is already dead. That cannot change. Ora says Geiz won‚Äôt be able to save anyone then. But Geiz says he will. He will defeat this foe for a friend 15 years away.
Ora restarts time and Geiz henshins. He then locks in the Faiz Watch and uphenshins to Geiz Faiz Armor.
Sougo finds Sakuma/Another Fourze attacking the new 18 year old Libra. He tells her to run and he henshins. They spar a little before he uphenshins to Fourze Armor.
The others arrive and Karin tries to plead with Sakuma. She tells him she doesn‚Äôt want to live on the death of others and she doesn‚Äôt want Sakuma to ruin his life. Sakuma can‚Äôt stop. He wants to save Karin.
Sougo says Sakuma isn‚Äôt saving her. Geiz tells 2003 Sakuma that what he‚Äôs doing is just making Karin suffer.
Sougo and Geiz both say they will save both!
Sougo and Geiz deliver Rider Kicks to Another Faiz and Another Fourze, destroying them for good and freeing Sakuma.
In 2018, Karin runs over to Sakuma. She thanks him for what he has done for her. But it‚Äôs time for her to go and for him to live his life.
Karin fades away.
Takumi follows Masato out, but Masato stops him before leaving alone.
Woz confirms Fourze and Faiz‚Äôs history has been rewritten.
Back at the shop, Tsukuyomi asks Sougo if he made sure to leave blank Watches for Fourze and Faiz. He hasn‚Äôt.
Next week‚Ä¶ donuts please!
Recap: Episode 6.5 ‚Äì Fourze 555‚Äôs Secret
Sougo wonders why Faiz was involved in these episodes when it was supposed to be a Fourze-focus. Indeed, Tsukuyomi is disappointed she wasn‚Äôt able to meet Sota Fukushi and Ryo Yoshizawa. Geiz says they couldn‚Äôt show up because they‚Äôre too busy filming Bleach.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making it seem like I have nothing else to do.‚Äù Takumi steps forward and says he‚Äôs making a special appearance since it is the 15th anniversary of Faiz.
But Geiz asks what does Faiz have to do with Fourze. Takumi says Fourze paid homage to Faiz. Takumi points out the X and triangle on Fourze‚Äôs legs. In Greek letters, they are Chi and Delta. Faiz‚Äôs circle is on the right elbow, ‚ÄúPhi‚Äù.
Geiz points out that there‚Äôs a square on the left elbow that has nothing to do with Faiz.
Masato steps forward to explain the real connection is through the Ryuusei School. The Ryuusei School exists to search for the Orphnoc King. It is an orphanage for children who escape death through unusual circumstances. Tsukuyomi realizes both Faiz and Fourze are about schools then.
Sougo perks up at hearing about a king, or ‚ÄúOh‚Äù in Japanese. Masato continues to explain that Fo-OH-rze means it‚Äôs about a king as well.
Tsukuyomi concludes that since Zi-O is about a king as well, it‚Äôs only natural that Fourze and Faiz would be paired together.
Takumi tells them not to be fooled by Masato. They lock heads and walk away.
Tsukuyomi says the two of them are definitely different from Sota Fukushi and Ryo Yoshizawa. Geiz suggests they go watch Bleach now. Sougo and Tsukuyomi cheer and they run off.
Takumi and Masato come back and wonder who wrote this script. They see it was Toei Producer Shirakura.
Episode Thoughts
I very much enjoyed this episode and I think this two-parter might be the strongest of the three pairs so far. The story itself was also the most cohesive of the three MOTWs and maybe the best illustration of how the Time Jackers do their work.
It‚Äôs been a little difficult to follow the season so far but I think they have improved week after week. That‚Äôs why I feel like this pair of eps really worked because it was clear, it gave a good look at how the Time Jackers work and the story of the MOTW was relatable and emotional. There was a real sense of danger and consequence with what Sakuma was doing. And that‚Äôs always a good way to give a sense of legitimacy to the proceedings.
It‚Äôs actually a very morbid story if you look at it. Sakuma/Another FaizFourze has basically been killing girls, taking their body parts (or soul power I guess) and putting them in some kind of FrankenKarin! Yikes!
Still, it really was exciting to see the story unfold for Karin and Sakuma. The execution for the story and the little twists were done very well. And it was done in a way that wasn‚Äôt confusing or required a high suspension of disbelief.
Like, you don‚Äôt feel that they pulled stuff out of their you know where. Everything fit. Everything was plausible. And again, the story hit the right notes when it comes to being relatable and emotional for the viewer.
All our main characters were used well. And they were all involved in a way that really helped the story move forward. At least for this two-parter. Like Uncle‚Äôs metaphor that led to Geiz figuring it out was so obvious, but still alright. Interesting that we got no in-episode Woz this week. But then of course, his King didn‚Äôt get a new power up since Sougo gave Geiz the Faiz Watch.
Not having watched Faiz, just seeing Takumi and Masato‚Äôs relationship in these two episodes has me interested in the season. I can only imagine how crazy and emotional their story must have been!
I definitely enjoyed the Bleach shout out in episode 6.5. It was probably the most funny of X.5 episode so far since they didn‚Äôt really use it for exposition of in-series stuff. They instead used it for some fun moments with Kento Handa and Kohei Murakami as well as fanboying and fangirling about Rider alums doing big things. That is, Sota Fukushi and Ryo Yoshizawa being in the successful Bleach film. Which again, I very much enjoyed.
Overall, I thought this was a very good and enjoyable episode. Maybe the most satisfying of the six episodes so far. Obviously it was very fun for me to see Sento and Ryuga and Emu and Hiiro again. But as a complete package. I think these two episodes were the best in terms of getting the hang of how this season will work.Sorry, no content matched your criteria.

Out of nowhere the mind comes forth.
Show me your original face, the one you had before your parents were born.
A koan demonstrates the inadequacy of logical thinking!
A master who lived as a hermit on a mountain was asked by a man, "What is the way?" and the master said, "What a fine mountain this is." The man felt frustrated. He said, "I am not asking you about the mountain, but about the way!" The master said, "So long as you cannot go beyond the mountain, my son, you cannot reach the way."
Out beyond the ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there.
Thank you for that long, hot, sex-filled summer in Europe with Sol.
Thank you for that first year of my marriage to Henry which, to be honest, God, was one of the happiest of my life.
Thank you for a career that has given me virtually nothing but pleasure and I'm sorry for all that fuss about the review. I'm sure that reviewer is one of God's children too.
Thank you for my health, you've been quite generous in that regard, and it was rude of me to make such a fuss over a bad cold.
Thank you for friends who are more like family.
Thank you for my dad, even though you took him quite early.
Thank you for Bellinis and all champagne cocktails.
Sorry for complaining about a paper cut while others suffer atrocities. Although, to be frank, that's why I gave up believing in you -that whole paper cuts for some versus atrocities for others thing.Picking out the some time the energy, let alone a babysitter basically a few of the evident challenges when it comes to any unmarried mum or dad hoping to get back to online dating.

As to CDS, leading derivatives trader and expert Satiyajit Das wrote a must-read article pointing out the falsity of the justifications used by both buyers and sellers of credit default swaps and other complex forms of "financial innovation":
The unpalatable reality that very few, self interested industry participants are prepared to admit is that much of what passed for financial innovation was specifically designed to conceal risk, obfuscate investors and reduce transparency. The process was entirely deliberate. Efficiency and transparency are not consistent with the high profit margins that are much sought after on Wall Street. Financial products need to be opaque and priced inefficiently to produce excessive profits or economic rents.
Das is not alone. The top derivatives experts all say (except those who work for the too-big-to-fail banks) that CDS are incredibly dangerous, don't provide much benefit to the consumer or the economy as a whole, and must be reigned in.
The Bloomberg article goes on to give the real reason that the TBTFs and their many lapdogs in Congress don't want CDS regulated:
The change [in Obama's proposed regulation being championed by McMahon and Frank, which even the guy who formerly blocked regulation is now saying is too weak]...
Not mandating exchange or other types of electronic trading ‚Äúwill probably prevent spreads from dropping like a rock,‚Äù said Kevin McPartland, a senior analyst in New York at Tabb Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm...
In other words, beneath all of the fancy arguments from the TFTFs and their mouthpieces in Congress, the real reason that they don't want CDS regulated is because it will narrow the spreads, and they will make a little less money. In addition, transparency would reduce the market, because investors would see CDS as the snake oil that they are (outside of some very narrow, specific uses).
The TBTFs couldn't care less that a huge, unregulated CDS market will destabilize the economy and lead to crises in the future.
Why should they? As Nobel prize-winning economist George Akerlof predicted in 1993, the financial giants would use CDS until the system crashed, knowing that the taxpayers would bail them out when the crash happened.
They know the same thing will happen tomorrow . . .
The bottom line is that we are now in a system where gains are privatized and losses are socialized (and see this). The debate over CDS is really one part of the larger debate as to whether that system will continue.Parent MoveTo aw. Roblox Anti Furry Script Pastebincom.

One of the most amazing facts uncovered in the process of viewing the first episode of the ‚ÄúRace ‚Äì The Power of an Illusion‚Äù documentary is that people of different races have significant genetic coincidences. Also, it is quite unusual that the majority of external human traits like skin color, hair texture, eye color, etc., depends on individual genes and can be inherited completely beyond any dependence on one another. Moreover, genetic connections are so strong that some DNA strands can influence susceptibility to certain diseases. Therefore, the information described in the first episode is full of surprises and unexpected facts.

The Story We Tell
Quite unusual is the fact that in ancient times, people did not mention the society as people divided into races and treated the inhabitants of the Earth as a single organism. Also, the turn of history is rather interesting when the concept of slavery based on skin color gave way to ethical considerations and ceased to be relevant in both American continents. Moreover, while recalling the video, it can be noted that despite differences in languages and appearance, there are certain mechanisms that can make people think differently and reconsider judgments about slavery and other historical remnants.
The House We Live in
One of the most unusual facts obtained in the course of viewing the episode is that emigrating Greeks, Italians, and some other European peoples were previously considered a separate race since they needed to confirm the right to be called so-called white people. Also, unusual and even innovative is the view that wealth is not ordinary luxury but the means of achieving social equality, which can be traced even in the modern world. Nevertheless, based on conducted tests, it was found that the level of well-being does not affect the change in the perception of the world by different races, which emphasizes the groundlessness of various theories about class inequality.‚Ä¶

Reaction AI is an artificial intelligence engine to be used for game developers that have non-player characters governed by AI or other game components that rely on artificial intelligence for reactions based on actions by the avatar. It can also be used for other systems that require learning systems and provides an intelligent output based on input. Reaction AI models the human brain and neural networks in its design. It learns over time and uses past events in a memory system to determine the next best reaction. However, it is pseudo-dynamic in the resulting output based on how well the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is functioning at that time based on stimuli. The ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is divided into four components, each sized proportionally to the human mind. This includes the Frontal Lobe which performs reasoning and emotion, the Parietal Lobe for movement, the Occipital Lobe for visuals, and the Temporal Lobe for memory. When the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is created, the number of total neurons must be specified. This will generate an n-ary tree. At each time a new ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is created (i.e. for different NPCs), a different brain structure is created dynamically and pseudo-randomly. When stimuli is applied (i.e. an avatar action), Reaction AI will send a random set (within a range) of electrons to each component of the brain (also proportional to the size of the respective lobe) to activate a subset of the neurons. The algorithm uses the active neurons to total neurons to determine the performance of the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù in each of the lobes for their respective purpose. Thus, a better functioning ‚Äúbrain‚Äù will yield more ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù results. Each time stimuli is applied, the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù will function slightly better or worse due to the difference in the number of active neurons. This is done by ranking the results and using data based on whether it can map the avatar action with a calculated emotion and prior reaction data for what the NPC ‚Äúthinks‚Äù is the best next action. If certain data fails to map, fallback mechanisms are performed which still are ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù. There is a memory system where historical data is stored. When a new memory is created, the successfulness of the most recent reaction is also mapped to that memory cell. The data includes what the avatar action was, what was the AI‚Äôs output for that action, and how successful it was. This data grows over time and the ‚Äúsearch‚Äù starts from most recent memory to earlier in time memories. However, the ‚Äúsearch‚Äù also goes as far back in memory as the number of active neurons at that time. The maximum size of the memory is the total number of neurons in the temporal lobe. When a new memory is created, and the maximum size is reached, the oldest memory is removed. When the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is created, the memory is initialized with a user defined input (one time) for the NPC‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù, which defines the allowed reactions, sub-reactions, and emotions. The final output of the system is a reaction category, sub-reaction, emotion, visual rank (ranging from 1 -5 where 1 is the lowest rank and 5 is the highest), and a speed value (ranging from 1 ‚Äì 4 where 1 is the slowest and 4 is the fastest). You can decide how to handle (how the NPC behaves) based on the output, and can cause a different reaction as well based on the values returned for emotion, visuals, and speed. The neural networks involve the structure of the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù, the stimuli that activate neurons, the memory, and the personality, being passed to different functions in different parts of the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù and results in final outputs. The fact that the system is varying each time a ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is created, the performance of the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù per stimulus, and what the allowed output values can be, allow Reaction AI to be reused any number of times with varying results. Thus, the same engine can be used for any number of different NPCs or AI based elements. The user defined ‚Äúsize‚Äù of the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù also introduces dynamics. Finally, for extremely large ‚Äúbrain‚Äù sizes, and longer periods of learning, Reaction AI can be as complex accordingly. Also, for NPC attacks (proactive actions instead of reaction to avatar action), use Avatar action states as idle=1, blocking=2, starting attack=3, etc) Requires .NET Framework 3.5 or higher Available downloadsReaction AI v2.0 March 7, 2020 See also...

Miami Dolphins Acquire Controversial Pro Bowl Receiver Brandon Marshall
April 14, 2010 ¬∑ Chris J. Nelson ¬∑ Jump to comments
Heading into the 2010 offseason (and just about every offseason before that since the Marks Brothers were still playing), one of the biggest needs for the Miami Dolphins has been a true, play-making No. 1 receiver.
In a somewhat surprising move, the Dolphins have acquired such a player by landing troubled two-time Pro Bowler Brandon Marshall from the Denver Broncos.
In return, the Broncos will receive Miami's second-round pick in 2010 (43rd overall) as well as the team's second-round selection in 2011.
The acquisition comes just one day after Marshall signed his one-year tender offer from the Broncos as a restricted free agent‚Äîa required precursor for him to be traded.
Upon arriving in Miami on Wednesday and undergoing a physical to complete the deal, the Dolphins signed Marshall to a four-year, $47.5 million extension that is believed to be the biggest contract for a wide receiver in NFL history.

World Fantasy Convention 2013, as with any other predominantly adult gathering, will have a number of rules and regulations for the safety of attendees. These will be clearly stated in our Programme Guide, which will be given to each attendee when they register. In the meantime, we refer you to the UK‚Äôs Protection from Harassment Act 1997.. Being a columnist or a critic used to be a skill, combining knowledge and the ability to write with insightful observations. These days it seems that everybody has an opinion and evolving technology has given us numerous platforms through which to make our views known. Have we degraded the true art of criticism to a point where it has lost all value?.
In barely any horror/fantasy/sci-fi conventions do you get a free pass if you do a panel. The panels are made up of the registered attending professionals and have been in my ten years in the business and that works on both sides of the pond. If they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre attending, they can‚Äôt panel you and if you leave it to the last minute to register of course it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll get a panel if you want one. There are a huge amount of talented women attending WFC 2013 and having spoken to the Chair ( a woman) there will be absolutely no shortage of woman speakers. It‚Äôs the men who will have to keep up.
Thanks for dropping by, Sarah. It‚Äôs good to hear from someone with inside knowledge that there is going to be a good roster of women speakers. In many ways, that makes it even sadder that they reacted as they did to Pollock, and that they don‚Äôt seem committed to the idea of putting up a harassment policy. I know some people may feel the latter is pointless, but I think it‚Äôs one of those signifiers that says ‚ÄúWe have considered this issue thoroughly and take it seriously‚Äù, which is in many ways as important as what the policy itself says.
I think it was a badly worded response. Basically, they were offering him that one panel in the programming and were basically saying if he turned it down then he wasn‚Äôt on any programming. Also it‚Äôs interesting that no women (thus far) have asked about panel parity when accepting or declining their panel options, it‚Äôs only been men ‚Äì three of them. I also think that just because panel parity isn‚Äôt a policy, it doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre not trying to make it as balanced as possible, they just don‚Äôt believe in it as a policy. Panelists should be judged on body of work, not body (I stole that line from someone else;-)) I think perhaps everyone is geared up to be angry before knowing if there‚Äôs anything to be angry about. It‚Äôs very early for programming to be released ‚Äì normally only a couple of weeks before the con, and they‚Äôll still be sorting out who‚Äôs doing what depending on who accepts declines stuff. I declined the panel they asked Tom to do so it‚Äôs not that they weren‚Äôt trying to get women on it.
As you can probably tell, I‚Äôve been doing some behind the scenes investigating;-)
And yes, I think there should be a harrassment policy, even if it is just to say, hey, if you have a problem go to this person and they will deal with it.
I‚Äôm sure that people were geared up to be angry, but I can‚Äôt blame them as there‚Äôs far too much sexist shit that happens, not just in SF/F but in all sorts of areas, and if you pay attention to it you get primed to see it. However, whenever something like this blows up, even if it‚Äôs unwarranted, then one just has to get on the case immediately with an apology and clarification. There‚Äôs nothing on the WFC2013‚Äôs Twitter feed, nothing that I can find on the website, that addresses what happened. That omission says ‚ÄòHey, we don‚Äôt actually care what you think‚Äô. It‚Äôs a bad look on anyone, worse when it‚Äôs an event in a field that‚Äôs known to have a few problems with various unpleasant -isms. An apology for the misunderstanding costs nothing and would have been a good idea.
And yes, even if the harassment policy is simple, just having a clear way for people to report problems would be a good start.
Ach, well, I have no dog in this fight, really. Will be sad to miss seeing everyone, but that‚Äôs mostly a financial issue. üôÅ
Your comparison with professional conferences really doesn‚Äôt work well here. I don‚Äôt want to bore people with lengthy explanations of the differences. Hopefully it will suffice to say that no event of this type has more than a handful of invited speakers, and there are normally plenty of well qualified women amongst the membership.
However, at the better conventions programme development is a collaborative process between the members and the programming staff. This year‚Äôs WFC is not following that model, and it appears to be deliberately trolling the attendees by putting on panels whose descriptions are likely to offend some of those asked to be on them. I am expecting this to be defended as being ‚Äúrobust‚Äù, ‚Äúprovoking discussion‚Äù and ‚Äúnot Politically Correct‚Äù.
Thankfully, WFC has a long-standing reputation for poor programming. Hardly anyone goes in the expectation of interesting panels. They go there to network. All of the interesting interaction happens in the bar and in restaurants.
Fwiw I did ask them about panel parity yesterday. So it‚Äôs not just dudes asking. I think folks are just tired of business as usual. It‚Äôs 2013. I‚Äôve only been doing panels for 7 years and *I‚Äôm* tired of the same old hackneyed vaguely women-erasing panels. It‚Äôs temping to say this stuff doesn‚Äôt matter and panelists will say what they want anyway. But when historians look back at what our field was talking about in 2013 the narrative will tell them we thought few women of importance wrote fantasy between 1970 and 2013. And that‚Äôs just one of many problematic panel assumptions across hundreds of conventions for what, 80 years? It adds up.
I wish they‚Äôd actually respond to what‚Äôs being said on Twitter.. I don‚Äôt think silence helps anyone. Hmmm‚Ä¶
I want to point out I don‚Äôt think Tom was being punished, I think they were saying that his stance was going to preclude him from being seen on a panel and therefore being seen as a leader in the genre. Which I still think is shitty behaviour, so I‚Äôm still calling them out on it. But I don‚Äôt think they were barking ‚Äòno! bad dog!‚Äô at him, just ‚Äòwell, joke‚Äôs on you mate as you‚Äôll never get heard with that equalitist attitude‚Äô.
Does that make sense? It reflects Kameron‚Äôs experience with the whole ‚Äòwell, you may want equality but it means you won‚Äôt get your voice heard as it‚Äôs take it or leave it‚Äô. And that‚Äôs not really a listening approach or a fair choice. It‚Äôs still discrimination but it‚Äôs not punishment.
The WFC program-building model is, in fact, unusual at sf conventions. A more usual one is:
1. You do have to be a registered member first
2. You contact programming to volunteer, giving a brief outline of who you are and the sort of topics you can contribute to.
3. Everyone who passes step #2 gets to fill out a more detailed survey. Some cons will give a list of specific panel topics and let you indicate your interest level for each one; others will ask about general topic areas. You also indicate what hours you‚Äôre willing to be on panels, maximum number per day, and so forth.
4. Anywhere from 3 weeks to a couple months before the convention, you get a preliminary schedule. (Or, if they couldn‚Äôt find a spot for you, you get a polite note explaining that.) If you‚Äôve been placed on a panel you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a good fit for, or your availability has changed, or have any other issues with it, this is where that gets worked out.
5. If it‚Äôs a convention which is held in the same place every year, usually you will then be on their permanent list and will get a notification when the survey is ready the next year.
Many cons do provide free or reduced-rate memberships for panelists, but sometimes it‚Äôs handled as a refund rather than a comp. It depends on the stability of the con, economic conditions, local custom, etc.
The one-panel-per-person rule is not common either; at a regional con, if you acquit yourself well your first year as a panelist, you‚Äôre likely to wind up scheduled at or close to the maximum you‚Äôre willing to handle in subsequent ones.
Thanks, everyone, for your comments! Much appreciated!
Cheryl, I know that the conference experience doesn‚Äôt directly map, but I do think that conventions could learn a thing or two from them. Primarily, I think that there are some much more robust methodologies for coming up with topics and speakers. There are a whole bunch of options that are better than ‚ÄúSee who signs up, and then from that invite as many as possible to do something, anything‚Äù. That leads to a horribly messy, over-scheduled con (which was the problem with Fantasy Con when I went). I do agree, though, that WFC seems to be deliberately trolling, but it‚Äôs a shame that people have to decide to go for the networking instead of the panels. What a waste.
Kameron, I couldn‚Äôt agree more that this ‚Äòbusiness as usual‚Äô is tedious. I think it‚Äôs not just that people will look back and be confused by the narrative, it‚Äôs also that it doesn‚Äôt serve anyone right now. Ignoring women‚Äôs contributions doesn‚Äôt just sidelines women, it fails readers too, who miss out on some really awesome stuff, and fans, who miss out on seeing their favourite female authors being recognised for their achievements.
Sarah, any response at the moment would be a start. Even acknowledging that there‚Äôs a conversation happening. I do hope that they haven‚Äôt just gone into a defensive crouch, because that won‚Äôt end well at all.
ALittleBriton, thank you for clarifying your position. Maybe I should have used the word ‚Äòpenalise‚Äô instead of ‚Äòpunish‚Äô. But whatever words we use to describe what they did, it‚Äôs shitty, absolutely, and they deserve to be called out on it.
Petr√©a, thanks for explaining how things work elsewhere! As an outsider to these things, it was illuminating to hear how it usually works!
Speaking from too many years of organising FantasyCons‚Ä¶ Petr√©a‚Äôs summary is pretty much how it works, though I‚Äôve always been more involved in admin/logistics than programming. I do know that in most cases it‚Äôd be impossible to provide comp memberships to panellists up front, as there simply isn‚Äôt the money. Several years we‚Äôve trod a fine line with cancellation, just trying to balance the books as many people don‚Äôt register until late in the day! As far as I can recall, we‚Äôd think up interesting topics for discussion and then see who we had on the list who might be able/willing to contribute. Or we‚Äôd look at the membership lists and think person A would be great talking about something or other. I don‚Äôt recall gender ever coming into it at all.
Suw: given that this convention has been happening for many years, and almost always sells out, I suspect that going for the networking is exactly what the attendees want from it.
Of course any convention could be better with better programming, but you‚Äôd have to think fairly carefully about who your expected audience is, and how you will pay for it. Things like the Hay Lecture at Eastercon are a good example of bringing in an outsider who will give an interesting presentation, but at the same time you have to deal with a lot of pro writers who want to be on panels, and who are offended if they don‚Äôt get them. I‚Äôd be interested to know what sort of people you think ought to be on programming at conventions, and what they should talk about.
Isn‚Äôt it a shame, though, that a convention sells out despite the programming, rather than because of it?
I organise Ada Lovelace Day, so I‚Äôm well aware of the struggles of volunteer-led, minimal budget (in our case, a budget of ¬£0) events, but that‚Äôs the same as many, many events organised around the world. It‚Äôs not an excuse for acting the way WFC have.
I think the major difference between conferences and conventions is outlined in your second paragraph: big egos who think they should be on stage and who get sniffy if they aren‚Äôt invited. Conferences don‚Äôt have to deal with that so much, because the way that they are programmed is so completely different. There isn‚Äôt an expectation that if you‚Äôre a name and you buy a ticket that you‚Äôll end up on stage. The big names still go, though.
As for the kinds of programming I‚Äôd like to see, well, this isn‚Äôt a reaction to WFC‚Äôs programming as we don‚Äôt know what the full schedule is yet, but when I work on Ada Lovelace Day, I try to get a couple of big names that people will come for almost no matter what, and then a bunch of people with interesting things to say, including at least one person who‚Äôs pretty new on the circuit. We have 8-10 speakers, but our event is very particular ‚Äì a sort of nerd cabaret, if you like ‚Äì so finding the right performers is actually quite hard.
I‚Äôve only been to two writer events, FantasyCon a few years back and Write The Future. The former was mostly boring in terms of panels, and the latter was fantastic, except for the panel with writers bibbling on about their books. Most of the other speakers were writers with presentations about fiction trends or scientists/technologists talking about what they are working on. It was absolutely fantastic to have my mind blown by the idea that someone is actually working on a ‚Äòworld ship‚Äô, a project expected to take 100 yrs. (When I‚Äôm back on my laptop, I‚Äôll add links.)
So I‚Äôd want to see a few big names ‚Äì the Guests of Honour that WFC has look pretty good ‚Äì but I‚Äôd also want to bring in domain experts from outside of writing, eg. get a couple of pro swordfighters to demo how realistic swordfights go down, or get a good paramedic to talk about how to write injuries or illness, or get a historian to talk about period dress. There are loads of things one could do that would require getting people in from outside the convention membership that would make the event utterly awesome and completely unmissable. That doesn‚Äôt mean no writer panels where the egos get to prattle on about whatever the hell they want, but that that isn‚Äôt the whole of the program.
But that‚Äôs just my view, and it‚Äôs clear that I‚Äôm neither the target audience nor ever likely to be so for something like WFC. I obviously come from a different world, and I can‚Äôt say that WFC‚Äôs world looks at all attractive to me.
We‚Äôve had expert talks at BristolCon before. The ones on writing fight scenes and archery went down really well. On the other hand, we had the guy who wrote Scrivener to come and talk. I figured it was geek heaven: software and writing together in one talk, but the room was almost empty. What was the difference? The other two talks were given by people who were experts, but were also well-known writers.
That shouldn‚Äôt be an issue with WFC as it is supposedly a professional event. Unfortunately the WF Board usually micromanages programming and insists on really dull stuff. For fan conventions, on the other hand, the general membership comes to see their favourite authors, and the authors come to get exposure in front of fans. The sort of programming that goes down really well are things like celebrity game shows featuring famous writers. That may not be your cup of tea, but it works.
I‚Äôm with you on the subject of egos, but the culture that has grown up over the decades it is very hard to break. Many writers won‚Äôt attend a convention unless they think they are going to be on programme. It‚Äôs tempting to say that you don‚Äôt need them there, but what tends to happen with membership is that each writer draws in a few people who wouldn‚Äôt go otherwise.
So yeah, there‚Äôs much that could be done, and much that many conventions are doing. But not WFC. It is a very odd beast, and deeply conservative.
Debbie, I think gender should come into it, if only to do a sense check before invitations go out to make sure that women are represented. Same with other minorities. The problem is that only too often the default is ‚Äòstraight white male‚Äô, and sometimes even the best of us need to double check that we‚Äôre not going for the obvious choices instead of giving others a voice. That‚Äôs no slur on any organiser, it should just be standard practice. Because how do you know that you‚Äôre not subconsciously discriminating if you don‚Äôt even check?
Cheryl, I‚Äôm not surprised that the dude from Scrivener didn‚Äôt go down well. I doubt that it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not a writer, but because he‚Äôs tackling what is essentially a process problem, ie how physically do you write. That‚Äôs probably not a very attractive theme for most writers because they‚Äôll mostly have settled on an existing process, and hearing someone say that there something better out there is not going to be top on their list of fun times to have. For context, a while back I worked with a start-up that wanted to change how writers proofread. The resistance to any sort of change to the actual writing process from the very people who stood to benefit most from such a change was really surprising to me.
On the other hand, fight scenes and archery are more interesting and less threatening to writers‚Äô sense of self. (You‚Äôd be surprised how many people in all walks of life identify themselves through the processes they go through in the course of their work, rather than the end product that they create. Trying to change the process, which is what most of my professional life involves, is often seen as an attack on their very being. Weird but true.)
I totally understand that cultures are hard to change. It‚Äôs a shame that WFC is so set in its ways, but that just means that there is an opportunity for someone else to step in and do something more interesting! By the way, I‚Äôd love to know which conventions you‚Äôd recommend. I‚Äôd really like to go to some next year, if I can (though it all depends on my budget, which is currently similar to that of Ada Lovelace Day. üôÅ )
Good point re Scrivener, though most of my writer friends swear by it these days. Many of them are geeks and committed early adopters.
As to recommendations, you might try Nine Worlds. It is fairly new so might have organizational issues, but they are much more of a popular culture event than a book-fan event. Last year they had Laurie Penny as a speaker. And they are at Heathrow so I think you could avoid the hotel bill.
Alternatively you might try a day at Worldcon. It‚Äôs in London next year, but the full 5 days is quite expensive. I‚Äôd like to see a programme item about ALD, but I have no influence over what they choose to do and you have to be a pretty big name for them to bring you just for programming. Nine Worlds would be much more open to that as they have a whole Geek Feminism programme track.
I‚Äôll be going to Eurocon in Dublin as part of a commitment to making the SF&F world less Anglo-centric, but I don‚Äôt think it will be your sort of thing as it is very much community building rather than entertainment.
And all of those will be in August. Exhausting.
I love Scrivener to bits, absolutely. Couldn‚Äôt do without it. Everything gets written in Scrivener now, from client reports to Forbes blog posts to my fiction. I‚Äôm a huge fan! I‚Äôm also a massive geek, but I‚Äôm not sure even I would go to a Scrivener session‚Ä¶ üòâ
Thanks for the recommendations! Nine Worlds sounds good, and I do like the popular culture stuff too. And Heathrow is very close to Woking so very easy to get to for me ‚Äì 25 mins to Terminal 5! Worldcon also sounds good. I will investigate. I did go to Story once, but it wasn‚Äôt quite what I‚Äôd hoped it would be. A bit too much performance, not enough nitty gritty.
I will say, one of the reasons I‚Äôm not doing WFC is because it‚Äôs in Brighton, which is awkward to get to from here and I can‚Äôt afford the travel, hotel and conference fee at this point in time. I‚Äôd rather spend the money on a new foil blocking machine or, frankly, a new pair of shoes!
I‚Äôve also considered running my own writing conference, but ALD is enough for me right now! That eats up a good chunk of my time (when I should be working!!) Aug-Oct, so it‚Äôs pretty heavy going, even with some awesome volunteers. I certainly don‚Äôt envy con organisers, as I know how much work it is, especially when you‚Äôre only doing it for the love of it. But the sacrifice doesn‚Äôt make you infallible or excuse self-righteousness, a point I fear WFC may possibly have missed.
I‚Äôm going to WFC because a bunch of my US and Australian friends will be there, and I haven‚Äôt seem them for ages. Also I have a publishing company and bookstore so there are business opportunities. It is not a convention that I‚Äôd recommend to writers unless you have at least started selling short fiction at pro rates.
If it is all the same to you, I‚Äôd prefer you to concentrate on ALD. It is a very important initiative, and I know to my cost what happens when you spread yourself too thin. Then again, I‚Äôm the last person to be able to criticize anyone for going off to do new and interesting things.
I pretty much agree with everything you say here, but do want to make one minor clarification: ‚ÄúIn the conference world, if you speak you get free entry‚Äù is not, in my experience, the case in academic conferences, at least not in the subjects I specialise in (Classical Studies and science fiction). It does happen, but it‚Äôs very much the exception rather than the norm (though many speakers get their fees paid by other bodies).
Cheryl, I suspect a bunch of my mates will be there too. I‚Äôll be sad to miss them! Fwiw, I entirely understand why other people go, and that the networking and opportunity to hang out in the bar is important and fun. That‚Äôs mostly what I did at FantasyCon!
And thank you for the kind words about ALD. I have an exciting announcement coming up soon, which will marry my passion for ALD with my passion for writerly things‚Ä¶ üòâ That will breathe new life into it for me, I think.
Hi Tony, thanks for dropping by! That‚Äôs very interesting to know about academic conferences! Maybe tech conferences are the odd ones out? I suspect I might also be self-selecting a little bit, though, because as a freelance there‚Äôs simply no way I can speak at a conference unless my expenses are covered, ie entry, flights, hotel, as I have no employer or institution to pay for me. But even so, in the nearly 10 years I‚Äôve been speaking, I‚Äôve only been asked to pay once and that was an opportunity I turned down.
I‚Äôve spoken at, and arranged, business conferences before. Whether speakers have to pay depends a) on how high profile they are ‚Äì a CEO won‚Äôt have to pay but a low-level technical expert might; and b) on how much the conference can charge the businesses who send delegates. High powered consultancies are prepared to pay a lot more to send staff to conferences than universities. And yes, since I have been freelance I won‚Äôt go to a business conference if I have to pay. But I have just paid to go to an academic conference that I‚Äôm speaking at next month.
The other kind of conference we have in the tech world is the unconference. This is an extension of the ‚Äúonly attendees speak‚Äù model to the edge of chaos, where the sessions are proposed by attendees on the day, and scheduled by sticking then on a grid on the wall. Many of the conferences I get the most out of either are run wholly this way, or have a component of it (even Internet Identity Workshop, Indiewebcamp, food camp, bar camps).
I wonder if writing con organisers have tried this?
Kevin, Ooh yes! I had forgotten about the unconference! I wonder if I could persuade Penguin or Hachette to provide space? That could be a lot of fun!
Kevin: yes, we are familiar with that idea. Many science fiction fans are also programmers, after all. Many conventions allow members to propose programming topics, though mainly in advance rather than on the day. I don‚Äôt know of any that are wholly run on the unconference pattern, but there are several that provide space for additional programme items that can be developed by members on the day. WisCon, the feminist SF convention, is the first place where I saw this happen.
Suw,
I‚Äôm one of the organisers of Nine Worlds. We *may* have already met through Jen & Owen / OpenTech / ALD stuff, but it would be good to talk more sometime. Anyhoo, you should feel free to poke us about speaking at next year‚Äôs event if you‚Äôre interested. ALD, social technology and the future of journalism are all really good fits to what we‚Äôre doing.
Cheers,
Daniel
I‚Äôm curious why Kameron Hurley was asked to speak on a panel about women fantasy writers. I thought she wrote science fiction? Surely there are a lot of women writing in the fantasy genre available to speak about their experiences of the fantasy genre?
You‚Äôd have to ask the organisers that!The SNF-funded project ‚ÄúDiversity on the International Bench: Building Legitimacy for International Courts and Tribunals‚Äú, led by Professors Neus Torbisco-Casals and Andrew Clapham, is happy to announce its 6th lecture of the series on October 25 at 6:30PM (CEST).
This lecture, ‚ÄúGender Perspective at the ICC: Legal Principles and Institutional Impact‚Äù will be led by Dr. Silvia Fern√°ndez de Gurmendi, President of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and former President (2015 ‚Äì 2018) and Judge (2010 ‚Äì 2018) of the ICC.
The lecture series aims to reflect on the lack of diversity in the international judiciary‚Äîespecially gender diversity‚Äî, which raises concerns not just in terms of descriptive representation and symbolic self-identification, but also regarding unconscious bias and systemic privileging of specific ideologies or positions in the process of adjudication.
Although the main lecture will be in English, participants will be welcome to submit questions in Spanish in the Q&A portion. To register for this event, click here.Effect of HIV and malaria chemo-prophylaxis on multiplicity of plasmodium falciparum infections in pregnant women in western Kenya

Abstract
Malaria during pregnancy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continue to be enormous public health challenges in sub-Saharan Africa. Sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine (SP) and cotrimoxazole (CTX) that are currently recommended for prevention of malaria and opportunistic infections (OIs) in HIV infected persons respectively, are both sulphur-based drugs with similar modes of action. Owing to the risk of adverse reactions, SP is contraindicated in HIV -infected women who are already on daily CTX. Natural immunity against malaria during pregnancy is acquired in a gradual gravidity-dependent manner and is dependent on the diversity of parasites to which an individual is exposed, multiplicity of infections (Mal), and the period of exposure. Studies have shown that the gravidity- dependent acquisition of immunity is affected by both SP intake and HIV infection. However, there is limited information on the effect of drugs used during pregnancy and HIV infection on MOls. This study therefore sought to investigate the effect of drugs used to prevent both malaria during pregnancy and OIs, and HIV-infection on the MOls of Plasmodium falciparum in 332 peripheral and placental samples collected between August 2008 and June 2009 in a retrospective study conducted in Siaya and Bondo district hospitals. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from dried blood spots (DBSs) by Chelex method was analysed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the highly polymorphic merozoite surface proteins (MSP-l and MSP-2). In this study, MSP-l Mal was higher in peripheral than placental samples, while MSP-2 MOl was more predominant in placental samples. These differences were, however, not statistically significant. HIV infection and high parasite densities, 1001-9999 parasites/uL and ~1 0000 parasites/ul., were associated with significantly high MOls (p = 0.036, p = 0.023 and p = 0.002, respectively). Similarly, primigravidae was associated with significantly high MOls (p = 0.043). There was a trend towards high MOls in women presenting with anaemia and fever, however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.085 and p = 0.090 respectively). Overall, there was no association between drug intake during pregnancy and MOls. These findings suggest that first pregnancy and high parasite densities may be independent risk factors for high MOls in pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas. The role of SP and/or daily CTX on P. falciparum MOls in pregnant women requires further evaluations using a larger sample size and alternative molecular markers such as microsatellite markers in order to fully elucidate the effect of drugs on MOls.Klik p√• en miniature for at g√• til Google Books.

RIYADH: Zombies dancing, clowns performing, fireworks lighting the city sky ‚Äî this is how visitors were welcomed to Winter Wonderland, part of Riyadh Season‚Äôs 14 zones.
Some families even skipped school and work to make sure they were the first to enter the zone.
Mustafa Usman, a logistics operation manager from Uzbekistan, told Arab News how he had loved Winter Wonderland during the last season and could not wait for it to open again this season.
‚ÄúThe reason why I came on the first day of Winter Wonderland is that last season I visited the zone twice, and this time I wanted my kids to enjoy the experience; they were excited. That is why I got an excuse from my job to be here,‚Äù Usman said.
Usman said that he has visited almost all the zones and events during the first ten days since the launch of Riyadh Season. ‚ÄúI went to almost all events, the grand opening for Riyadh Season . . . the WWE Crown Jewel show‚Ä¶ I went to Combat Field‚Ä¶ and today here at Winter Wonderland‚Ä¶ and on Friday I‚Äôm going to the (Egyptian) Orchestra in (Riyadh) Boulevard, at Muhammed Abdu‚Äôs arena . . . I am excited to go to (Riyadh) Safari once the weather gets better.‚Äù
Winter Wonderland opened its doors yesterday with a sense of huge anticipation from a large audience of game-lovers. The zone consists of six primary areas including, for the first time, the children‚Äôs corner. The corner is dedicated to the nursery and care of children from one year to 7 years old and is equipped with games for toddlers.
Turki Al-Sheikh, chairman of the board of the General Entertainment Authority, revealed earlier in a tweet that more than 60,000 entry tickets were sold during the first minutes of the ticket portal opening. This confirms visitors‚Äô enthusiasm, especially after the zone‚Äôs area capacity increased 40 percent from last season.
The zone includes more than 103 games that meet all age groups‚Äô tastes ‚Äî from adults to children ‚Äî and with cosy snowy scenes and lights where people can enjoy hot drinks and different types of foods. Visitors can also try out the snow maze and skating rink.
The winter atmosphere attracts visitors from all over the world to enjoy experiences that bring back memories of their childhood, with decorations that mix reality with dreams.
Many visitors from GCC countries such as Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait have come to visit the zones of Riyadh Season.
Eisa Adnan, a civil engineer visiting from Kuwait, told Arab News that he would stay for two weeks in Riyadh to attend most of the events during the season. ‚ÄúWe want to go to Al-Murabba zone, and I heard that there is a play coming up for Mohammed Hunaidi, a very famous actor; we would love to see that play,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI thank all the girls and boys who are organizing and preparing these amazing events. I never came to the previous seasons; this is my first season to attend, and it is luxurious.‚Äù
The zone opens its doors to visitors from 4 p.m. until 1 a.m. daily throughout the season, and entry tickets can be booked online through Riyadh Season‚Äôs website or application.
Al-Murabba welcomes visitors with music, food and more for Riyadh SeasonRiyadh Season kicks off with a bang as WWE Crown Jewel returns to Saudi ArabiaCyclotron is the 'Tron' light cycle you peddle
The dream of riding one of the light cycles from the movie Tron just got a lot closer to becoming a reality.
SEE ALSO: Ray J reveals the inside story of his bid to launch a tech startup.
In place of the wheel's spokes, the bike offers utility slots, which can be used to hold carrying cases inside the back and front wheels. The sleek vehicle is controlled in part by what the company calls an internal, 18-speed "E-Gear Box" with electronic shifting, as well as an encapsulated chainless drive train. However, this is not an e-bike ‚Äî you still have to peddle.
One particularly clever touch is the fact that the LED lights on the wheels are powered by self-charging lithium ion batteries that last up to eight hours. Finally, the makers claim that the unique airless tires on the bike will last over 6,000 miles, with the option to replace them with a kit that costs about $118 per set.
In addition to its futuristic look, the bike bike really works. Supporters are slated to get their bikes in the summer of 2017.REAL UNLIMITED WEBSITE TRAFFIC

An attitude for gratitude: Apeejay students thank those who make our lives easier
Apeejay School, Noida (Junior School) students celebrated International Peace and World Gratitude Day on September 21 by honouring those silent workers who serve us every day without expectation of any reward
‚ÄúGratitude can transform common days into thanksgiving, turn routine jobs into joy and change the ordinary opportunities into blessings.‚Äù
The above mentioned quote by American motivational writer William Arthur Ward is a reminder that no amount of expressing gratitude is enough for the services one receives in daily life. One is surrounded by people who work, day in and day out for common welfare and peace. Gratitude towards such people alone comprises a ticket to a brighter future for mankind. Without peace and a sense of gratitude in the human heart, there is no way out of the perpetual cycle of inequity and violence.
Keeping the aforementioned thought in mind, students of Apeejay School, Noida (Junior School) on the occasion of World Gratitude Day on September 21, expressed their gratitude not only towards the people who provide support to them in all walks of life but also towards nature.
The class teachers gave the students an informative talk on the concept of ‚Äògratitude‚Äô. They also explained to the students through a video the relevance and importance of ‚ÄòInternational Peace Day‚Äô, celebrated globally alongside World Gratitude day on September 21.
The students participated in a range of activities to celebrate this special day. Students of classes Nursery and Kindergarten, carried out art and craft activities. They coloured pictures of a dove, the symbol of peace and hope. Class 1 and 2 students, on the other hand, made pictures of a dove using their palm-prints.
The students of classes 3, 4 and 5 designed posters to commemorate the International Peace and World Gratitude Day. The students also presented little gifts of affection and gratitude to the security personnel of the school, to honour their tireless service.
These activities brought out the latent creativity of the students. It also gave the students a free space to use their imagination and paint their way to a peaceful world.
Speaking about the activities conducted, Principal, Mr AK Sharma emphasised: ‚ÄúThe International Day of Peace reminds us that regardless of where we come from or which languages we speak, we are more alike than we are different‚Äù. He also elaborated about the theme for this year‚Äôs Peace day celebration: observing 24 hours of non-violence.
Primary school In-charge, Mrs Smriti Samuel addressed the students and sensitised them towards the significance of peace for the development and growth of humanity in the world. She listed ways to transform the world into a place that is more equal, inclusive, sustainable and healthier. Concepts such as conflict-resolution through peaceful dialogue, consensus-building and the choice of non-violence are the fundamentals for a peaceful world. She mentioned that students must be made to understand these key concepts from an early age for a healthy tomorrow.
‚ÄúTo show gratitude is the process to cleanse the soul and open the windows of faculties of mind to allow more wisdom and get peace. We should be grateful to feel free and have inner peace.‚Äù-A K Sharma,Reviews

George MandaGetty Images In spite of the variety of property flooring products now availablelaminate, bamboo, tile, vinyl, wood, stone, and corkcarpeting remains incredibly popular. In reality, the carpet industry in the U.S. represent about 51 percent of the overall flooring market, which created over $10 billion in earnings in 2019 alone, according to the U.S.
One factor that people love carpetingbesides its warmth and softnessis that it requires less upkeep and upkeep than hard-surface floorings. Frequent vacuuming and an occasional deep-clean scrubbing is generally all that's needed to keep carpeting looking brand-new and fresh. Nevertheless, despite your best shots, faster or later your carpet will become the victim of spills, splashes, messy accidents, and whatever you track in on the bottom of your shoes.

That'll just drive the stain down into the carpet. Instead, carefully dab discolorations with a cleaning solution and a clean cloth, paper towel, or sponge.
Blotting puts a percentage of pressure on the stain, so you can soak it up," Tarbox states (How Long For Carpet To Dry After Steam Cleaning). "Rubbing triggers the particles to get ground into the fibers, which can lead to the premature breakdown of those fibers." And always blot from the external edge of the stain inward toward the center; blotting outside can spread the stain even more throughout area, then wait 10 or 15 minutes for it to take in.
Repeat this process, if essential, until the entire stain is gone." When you have actually removed the stain, wash the area with tidy, warm water. Use your hand to brush the carpet strands into their natural direction. Finally, lay numerous white paper towels over the area and weigh them down with something heavy, like a phonebook," explains Tarbox.
3 Try Shaving Cream Tarbox states the very best carpet cleaner for general stains isbelieve it or notordinary shaving cream. "It will eliminate simply about every kind of stain.

Depending on the size and age of the stain, you might need to duplicate this treatment multiple times. 6 Heat Hardened Wax Burning candles in the home can result in wax dripping onto the carpet, where it quickly solidifiesBy Kevin Collison
A new development team is taking on the previously approved Jazz Hill Apartment plan and intends to invest more renovating the grand, but moribund, old apartment buildings near downtown into affordable housing.
Indianapolis-based Flaherty & Collins Properties and the Twelfth Street Heritage Development Corp. plan to renovate the 11 apartment buildings on the west side of The Paseo between Ninth and 14th streets into 197 affordable apartments.
‚ÄúThe deal had run into a standstill and we thought we could work with Twelfth Street to get it back on track and to a higher level than proposed before,‚Äù said Drew Rosenbarger of Flaherty & Collins Properties.
‚ÄúWhen we got the opportunity to work with Flaherty & Collins, it made sense to jump on board,‚Äù said Dwayne Willams, president and CEO of Twelfth Street Heritage. ‚ÄúWe wanted to take care of the neighborhood and bring back what‚Äôs turning out to be an awesome boulevard.‚Äù
This is not the first time the Indy developer and Twelfth Street have joined forces.
The two had proposed building a 124-unit affordable housing project on the riverfront a year ago, but that project stalled after failing to receive state low-income housing tax credits.
Maxus originally had proposed investing $18.5 million in its Jazz Hill plan, but the new team is budgeting $26.5 million for the project.
The large brick apartment buildings to be renovated were built between 1896 and 1906 and are located along the west side of an impressive stretch of the historic boulevard. Eight of the 11 buildings are currently vacant.
The buildings were converted to public housing in 1975 and later renovated using the historic tax credit program in 2000, according to documents filed with the Planned Industrial Expansion Authority.
The new redevelopment plan will continue to utilize the 25-year property tax abatement, 10 years at 100 percent, 15 years at 50 percent, and a sales tax exemption on construction material approved two years ago by the PIEA.
In addition, Williams said the Jazz Hill project is slated to receive $3.9 million from the Central City Economic Development program. The CCED uses a special city sales tax approved by voters to assist projects on the East Side.
The monthly rents expected to be charged for the revived Jazz Hill project are estimated at $600 for a studio, $725 for a one-bedroom and $825 for a two-bedroom.
The new development team anticipates beginning work by the end of the year and delivering buildings on a staggered basis throughout 2022 with the entire project completed by 2023. The renovation will include restoring the exterior masonry, windows and balconies and a full interior renovation including new appliances, bathrooms, flooring and building mechanical systems.
‚ÄúWhen this project came across the desk for us, we were excited because Flaherty & Collins has a lot of experience with complex, affordable housing projects and historic tax credits,‚Äù Rosenbarger said.
Flaherty & Collins Properties also has been active building new apartment projects in greater downtown including the Union at Berkley Riverfront and The Yards located in the West Bottoms. The firm also is pursuing a 300-unit apartment tower project next to the City Market on what is now a city-owned parking lot.Call Sales (888) 532-9265

Upgrading to eFax Corporate, the world‚Äôs #1 cloud fax service, can eliminate a significant upfront capital expense plus monthly recurring telco line charges, not to mention the IT overhead to keep it all running:
Faxing is universal, ubiquitous, and easy to use. But increasingly, there are challenges seen with legacy paper fax, their related workflows, and costs. The industry has long been moving to replace the paper fax with more secure and HIPAA-compliant technology and there are two technologies at the forefront. They are: The fax server, which requires on-premise hardware and software; and digital cloud fax technology (DCFT), a reliable and scalable technology that runs entirely on the cloud and requires no additional hardware or software.
In addition to the extra hardware, fax software, and telecommunications services, on-premise fax servers also require on-site installation, training, and ongoing maintenance. These items are costly as they involve IT personnel for administration and maintenance. Other expenses also include monthly telco charges for phone lines, phone numbers, and PBX ports.
Because of these expenses, on-prem fax server solutions are cost-prohibitive for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and for even mid to large-sized corporations.
Fax servers are also less than reliable. The costs of downtime to a business can be incredibly high ‚Äì and for some industries like healthcare and financial services ‚Äì are completely untenable.
Cloud Fax delivers encrypted communications and password-protected documents. You can get a complete audit trail of all activity and optional features such as fax tagging, annotations and digital signatures.
Experience better than 99.5% uptime fast delivery and receipt rates, with is ideal for time-sensitive information with high completion rates and reliability.
Better still, cloud fax is easy-to-use on the desktop, web, on the go (iOS and Android smartphones and tablets) and through an integration with enterprise-level APIs.
No fax maintenance, no hardware or software needed with our Enterprise cloud fax solution.
Fax by email right from your CRM, ERP or Electronic Healthcare Systems(EHR) application via our secure Fax API.
with optional TLS 1.2 encryption for fax transmissions, and AES 256-bit encryption for fax storage.
Maintains audit logs for all sent and received fax documents and files with the capability to view up to 20 different tracking and reporting metrics.
Fax server environments cost significantly more, take more to maintain, and require more effort to deploy when compared to digital cloud fax technology.
Replace fax servers with cloud fax to eliminate major capital expenditures associated with faxing equipment ‚Äì and the fax server -- and reduce fax expenses to a low operational cost. This means more to your bottom line. Furthermore, cloud fax requires no additional effort and time to deploy, is far more reliable, scalable, and flexible than other options.

Now that 2020 is finally here, I'm all about making some important changes in my gaming life. I'm going to make this year special in several ways, cut out some old habits, and try plenty of new things. That brings me here: to my 2020 New Year's gaming resolutions. I've been thinking about it, and there are a few things I'd like to address now that it's a new year. Here are some of my 2020 New Year's gaming resolutions.
Finish Those Games
I'm a video game journalist, so much of my time is spent playing games for review, writing up reviews, covering news, and all of that fun stuff. So I spend a lot of the day and night finishing review titles. That leaves me little time to invest in actually finishing the games I'm playing for fun.
This, of course, is much different from when I was a kid, where I could just sit and while away my time pouring hours into Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete or work to unlock all of the summons in Final Fantasy VII. Now, I have a bad habit of starting a game, then setting it aside to play and finish a review game, and then never picking the original back up. I may be 75% finished with one, but forget where I was to pick it up back up again, so I never do.
This year, since 2020 has rolled around, I'm going to make it my business to start completing games again, without setting the ones I'm personally interested in aside, even if I have to get through a few reviews games first. It's totally doable if I manage my time correctly, which is a challenge in and of itself. That's no matter, though. As they say, ain't nothin' to it but to do it. And that's what I need to do, because life is short, and I've got too many games I want to get through.
But in the meantime, if anyone has any suggestions for maximizing my time in each game and making sure I see the credits roll while juggling all of my other responsibilities, I'm all ears!News & Stories

Based on the document, a feasibility study and research will be conducted for the project, the Ministry said.
The canal would link the Danube, Morava and Vardar rivers, so connecting Serbia, Macedonia, Greece and the Danube region to Central Europe.
According to the Ministry, the project would boost Serbia‚Äôs transportation and energy sectors, while an irrigation system to be built along the Morava River should advance the Serbian agriculture and the economy in general.
The project would take about eight years and cost about 12 billion euro, the ministry said.
But Serbia‚Äôs biggest opposition party, the Democratic Party, has criticized the project as unrealistic, saying it would leave the country massively indebted.
‚ÄúThe economy is still in decline, so such unrealistic projects must be stopped at any cost,‚Äù Bozidar Djelic, of the Democrats, said in parliament on Wednesday.
The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has also slated the project, saying that the country has no resources for such grand ideas.
Economist Aleksandar Stevanovic doubts anyone will get deeply involved in a project that Serbia cannot support financially.
‚ÄúThere is no chance that anyone will start building a channel whose cost is equal to that of Serbia‚Äôs [annual] GDP,‚Äù Stevanovic said.
The economist said Serbia was unable now even properly to clean the Corridor VII waterway, or build infrastructure to turn the Danube into ‚Äúa development opportunity for Serbia, let alone cut into the Morava and Vardar river beds.‚Äù
So far, Macedonia‚Äôs government says it has not received any request for cooperation on the project from Serbia, although the Vardar runs through Macedonia.
‚ÄúIf we get a proposal, of course we will approach it seriously and do some analysis, consulting experts and business associations about the possibilities,‚Äù the Macedonian government spokesman Alensandar Gjorgjiev said.Mini center feed toilet paper dispenser

George was crouched in the bushes, staring at the backpack lying on the path in front of him. Not so much at the unconscious girl next to it‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt hungry enough to try his hand at cannibalism‚Äîbut he wondered if he could steal it before she woke up. It could be a trap, though. A nice backpack dropped in the middle of Central Park, enticing hungry scavengers like him with the possibility of food. He‚Äôd have to give it up for whoever set it, if it was a trap. The fall the girl took earlier had certainly looked convincing.
George decided to chance it. He quietly shifted his feet through the mass of brown leaves (everything seems to be brown since the aliens) and hungrily advanced on the backpack. Greedily, he reached out and picked up the backpack. It was heavy, which was good. George started to walk away.
‚ÄúHey!‚Äù exclaimed a voice from the ground. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doing with my bag?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said George, turning around to look at a girl who couldn‚Äôt have been older that twelve. ‚ÄúIs this yours?‚Äù
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs else would it be?‚Äù
George paused. ‚ÄúWhat if you stole it? Then it could be anybody‚Äôs. I‚Äôd have a moral obligation to return it to whoever you took it from. I wouldn‚Äôt judge, but I‚Äôd have to do the right thing- times being what they are.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd how are times?‚Äù
‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt know,‚Äù said George. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in a singular time, let alone a plural one.‚Äù
‚ÄúTake it then,‚Äù said the girl with infinite resignation. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point arguing about something as trivial as property with someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in time.‚Äù
George wanted to turn around and walk away right then and there. To take literally the figurative statement, which was probably said to elicit some human feeling or something. But George was in the mood for being manipulated, so he handed the backpack over to her.
The girl stood up and made a big show of checking inside the bag to see if George had taken anything. ‚ÄúDo you normally steal other people‚Äôs belongings?‚Äù
‚ÄúOnly friends. I‚Äôm George, by the way.‚Äù
‚ÄúChristina.‚Äù
‚ÄúPleasure to meet you, Christina.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt happen to have any food with you, George?‚Äù
And with that, the trap was sprung.
George nodded wearily. ‚ÄúA bunch of us have a stockpile at the Museum of Modern Art. The General‚Äîhe looks after it‚Äîgives out rations every night. I suppose you could join us. Just for one night.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd like that.‚Äù
And George led the way out of Central Park, admiring the expert way he‚Äôd been manipulated. And by someone so young. Although he‚Äôd failed at finding food, he‚Äôd succeeded in giving it away. Times really are what they are.
#
The Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs upkeep had declined in recent years. The whole of New York City‚Äôs had. That‚Äôs what happens when ninety percent of all people die- the upkeep declines. The black squares that made up the Museum‚Äôs fa√ßade were chipped in places, and you could see the squalor of everything inside. George led the way into the building with Christina trailing behind him.
‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt there meant to be paintings and stuff in here?‚Äù asked Christina, gesturing to the empty walls.
‚ÄúIt gets cold in the winter,‚Äù said George. ‚ÄúThe General kept a few Van Gogh‚Äôs and Picassos‚Äô with him for old times‚Äô sake, but all that canvas makes for good kindling.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this General like, anyway?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a bit of a nut but means well. He stockpiled a bunch of food before the aliens came and wrecked everything, which makes him the leader, I guess. As far as anyone can really be a leader now, though.‚Äù
They came to a greenish staff door which opened onto a flight of stairs. George led the way down the steps to a darkened service corridor; a low humming reverberated through the air.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that sound?‚Äù asked Christina.
‚ÄúThe Museum‚Äôs generators,‚Äù said George. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not much, but they keep the place warm. And the lights stay on at night, which is nice. I must say, you‚Äôre awfully calm. Following a stranger into an abandoned building like this.‚Äù
‚ÄúI can run.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo can I.‚Äù
‚ÄúHumans don‚Äôt taste very good. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre thinking about.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow do you know what humans taste like?‚Äù
‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
The corridor was long, and they walked down it in silence. At the end of it there was another staff door, which George opened. Inside was a largish room that had about twenty people in it, all huddled together in clumps. They were dressed‚Äîlike George and Christina‚Äîin rags, which made it look like the basement was being held hostage by a group of homeless people. A large red generator had been dragged into the centre of the room and was rattling and thundering away. George waved to some people he knew and sat down against a wall.
‚ÄúWhen‚Äôs this General character going to appear, anyway?‚Äù asked Christina after taking in the scene.
George gestured to another staff door at the other end of the room. ‚ÄúAny minute now. He‚Äôs normally punctual, which is good. I like my Generals punctual- especially in times of hunger.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking the piss.‚Äù
‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù
And the General‚Äôs door was thrown open with a loud bang. Silence. A thin figure appeared from the gloom. And the General‚Äîdressed in a crusty military uniform with his white hair fluffed up‚Äîentered the room. Slowly, reverentially, holily, he pushed a toy cart containing various canned goods into the room and returned to the doorway. He waited until everybody had a can, then began to speak:
‚ÄúIndulge me, children, as I pontificate. Before we satiate our base desires for sustenance it is best to remember the cause of our current miseries- the aliens. Those evil beings who, descending from on high, spread plague and destruction among us. A cosmic pathogen that ragged through the peoples of the Earth, killing indiscriminately. Then satisfied by the death that they had wrought the returned to their great ships and fled. And I curse them, curse them with every fibre of my being for what they have done to us. Thank you.‚Äù
And with that, the General vanished back into his room, slamming the door behind him. There were murmurs of praise from the old people who had been with the General since before the aliens, but mostly chewing sounds as people ate.
#
Christina became a part of the Museum‚Äôs basement community. Helping scavenge for food, exploring the empty skyscrapers, and listening to the General go on about life before the aliens. And falling into some semblance of a normal day to day routine.
‚ÄúCould you tell me something about the aliens?‚Äù Christina asked George as they picked through the remains of the Standard Oil building.
George sat down at a crumbling board table. ‚ÄúWhat do you want to know?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat did they look like? Everybody‚Äôs always so vague when they talk about them that I can never picture what they looked like.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, the one I saw was a green thing with many mouths and many eyes. A writhing mass of flesh and saliva,‚Äù said George. ‚ÄúI was walking home from school when I saw it, God, I would‚Äôve been about your age. There was a flash of purple fire and it materialized in front of me.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen what happened?‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing really. It just kind of grunted at me for a bit, like it was trying to say something important, then disappeared. I guess that was enough time for whatever disease it was carrying to infect me. I was sick for what felt like years and when I finally got better everything was like this,‚Äù George gestured at the ruined boardroom. ‚ÄúWhy so curious about aliens all of a sudden?‚Äù
‚ÄúI talked to one the other day.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou what!‚Äù George exclaimed with some urgency.
‚ÄúNot talked, exactly. I was exploring Central Park the other day when a bean of purple light surrounded me. It felt like something or someone was staring into my very soul. And then it was gone.‚Äù
George‚Äôs blood ran cold. ‚ÄúYou should tell the General about this.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause that means they might be coming back. And that scares me. It scares me a lot.‚Äù
And they made their way out of the Standard Oil building back to the Museum; George trying not to break into a run on the long walk back. They descended into the basement with possibility hanging heavy in the air. The basement was mostly empty as everybody was out looking for food. George knocked on the General‚Äôs door. It opened a crack and a bloodshot eye peered out at them.
‚ÄúYes?‚Äù asked the General.
‚ÄúSir,‚Äù said George. My friend here told me something very serious just now. About the aliens.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù said the General.
Christina hesitated a moment. ‚ÄúWell‚Äì‚Äù
‚ÄúYou may address me as either General or Sir, child, but not Well. Do I look like a body of water to you?‚Äù
‚ÄúUm,‚Äù said Christina.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very colloquial, is all,‚Äù said the General. ‚ÄúProper leaders remain formal at all times.‚Äù
‚ÄúOk, Sir,‚Äù said Christina. ‚ÄúI think I saw the aliens. What do you think of that?‚Äù
The General was silent. ‚ÄúI must consider this.‚Äù
With that, the General slammed the door in their faces. George and Christina were quiet.
‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù asked Christina.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said George. ‚ÄúIf they come back‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
#
The General was late handing out that night‚Äôs rations. And when he did, he let everyone eat without first treating them to a lecture. He stood in his doorway, watching everybody eat, like a guardian angel or an anxious parent or what have you. And when everyone had finished, he motioned for silence and started speaking:
‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to give you a good life. I have. Despite the aliens. Despite the plague they caused. Despite there being no food. Despite there being no point to any of this. I tried. And today, I failed.‚Äù
There were surprised gasps from the older people and amused glances from everybody else- tonight‚Äôs entertainment was going to be different. But George felt a sinking feeling in his stomach.
‚ÄúQuiet please, children. Thank you. I‚Äôve felt in my gut for some time now that the aliens are returning. And just this morning, a trusted and confidential source confirmed it. I‚Äôm not the man I was before. And I can‚Äôt protect you from them any longer. But I can be merciful. And spare you the pain those bastards will inevitably bring with them. Which is why I laced the rations with cyanide. I, myself, consumed a dose earlier. We will all be safe within the hour. Questions?‚Äù
George stood up. ‚ÄúYeah, I have a question.‚Äù
‚ÄúSpeak, child.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù
Worried murmurs went through the room, and the General looked confused. ‚ÄúI understand if you‚Äôre upset, but‚Äì‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm upset?‚Äù exclaimed George. ‚ÄúMe, upset? About being poisoned?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe aliens are coming back! You know what happened last time!‚Äù
Before George could answer, Christina stood up. She was red in the face and had her hand on her throat. That was when the coughing started- violent spams that ran through her body. And she fell to the floor. And the fear set in as more people started coughing and falling and dying. The General collapsed, a contented look on his face.
George felt the poison coursing through his system, and a sudden feeling of claustrophobia came over him. If he was to die so be it, but it wouldn‚Äôt be in some basement no matter how nice it might be. He fled upstairs and collapsed on the ground outside the Museum. As consciousness slipped away from him, his last thought was spent wondering why everything was purple. It‚Äôs not meant to be purple, is it? But it doesn‚Äôt really matter what colour things are anymore.
#
Darkness.
Silence.
Eternity.
For a time, George experienced the complete negation of all perspective, emotion, and identity.
Bliss.
And then he was alive again.
A well-dressed, clean-shaven man was smiling down at him. Above, the hull of a great ship stretched from horizon to horizon; a machine sky that occasionally shot purple lightening at the Earth.
‚ÄúHi,‚Äù said the man excitedly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Al!‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you an alien, Al?‚Äù asked George.
‚ÄúYup!‚Äù said Al, the alien.
‚ÄúWho thought Al was a good name for an alien?‚Äù
Al looked hurt. ‚ÄúI picked this name myself! We studied your culture a lot since our last visit, learning your language, how you act, how you talk. I wanted to sound familiar, so I became Al. Say hello to my little friend!‚Äù
‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre a person, aren‚Äôt you? You look like one. And why am I alive?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been scanning you humans for a while now, so we could update our biology. So we could actually talk to you. And you‚Äôre alive because I gave you the cure,‚Äù Al held up something that looked like a white glow stick. ‚ÄúThis: THE CURE FOR ALL PHYSICAL AILMENTS AND DISEASES UP TO AND INCLUDING DEATH.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou guys have one of those?‚Äù
‚ÄúYup! It‚Äôs really very handy. Back home, nobody dies unless they want too. It was the reason we came here in the first place- to share it with the universe. But the last time we used it on a human, it ended up backfiring and creating the plague.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, that sucked.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe feel terrible about it!‚Äù protested Al. ‚ÄúWe spend the last, I don‚Äôt know how many years, trying to undo it. We even learnt your languages and everything! I just wish there were more dead people around so I could show you how it works.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck, my friend, there‚Äôs just been a mass murder downstairs.‚Äù
Al looked genuinely excited. ‚ÄúGoodie!‚Äù
And Al went bounding inside the Museum to make everybody alive again. And all George could do was lie where he was on the sidewalk and laugh. Laugh hard enough to keep the tears away.

Summer Reading Programs and Summer Homeschooling
Summer is totally kicking my butt this year. Hence my lack of posts lately.
Took my kids up to one of our local libraries last week to get them signed up for the summer reading program. I was a bit disappointed. I signed them up as pre-readers since that's what they are. But I'm thinking I may have to go and see if they'll make an exception for us, and let them do the regular reading program. The pre-readers are given these little Bingo-type cards with various different activities on them and they have to cross 10 off to win their first prize, and then another 10 to get their second. The activities are so simple, and my kids are so eager to get their prize, that they had 10 crossed off in less than a week. At this rate, they'll have completed the entire summer reading program in less than three weeks. And it really isn't challenging them at all.
In other news, we are trying to start some reading instruction this summer (squeezing our lessons in between ESL summer school and swimming at the pool). We haven't made much progress yet. Much of the time I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall. It's tough when you've got one that is so easily discouraged, but yet puts hardly any effort into even TRYING.
Anybody else participating in a summer reading program with their kids? How are you liking it?

A prominent Hindu temple here has been attacked, the sixth such incident in an Indian place of worship since March this year, drawing sharp reaction from the religious leaders of the Indian community against the brazen strike by criminal elements.
Hindu, Muslim and Christian religious leaders strongly reacted after the Grama Devi temple was raided by criminals for the second time this week since September.
Devotees were robbed of jewellery, watches, cell phones, and other valuables.
The Anglican Bishop of KwaZulu-Natal, Reuben Philip, who is of an Indian origin said robberies at places of worship was a new phenomenon.
"Criminals seem to be taking advantage of vulnerable communities," he said.
A member of the Inter-religious council, Philip said the body would take up the matter with the police authorities.
Ashwin Trikamjee, chairman of the South African Hindu Maha Sabha and National Religious Leaders' Forum, said the attacks on places of worship was "unacceptable".Background
Knee dislocations are uncommon. [1] A knee dislocation is defined as complete displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur (see the image below), with disruption of three or more of the stabilizing ligaments. [2, 3] Small avulsion fractures from the ligaments and capsular insertions may be present.
Anatomy
Knee anatomy relevant to dislocations is related to the four main ligament and neurovascular structures. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), the medial collateral ligament (MCL), and the posterolateral corner (lateral collateral ligament [LCL], arcuate complex, popliteus, and biceps femoris), together with the joint capsule, are responsible for knee stability. [2]
Knee dislocation requires injury to at least three of the four. [4]
Fractures about the knee are fairly common in knee dislocations. These can be severe periarticular fractures, commonly tibial plateau fractures or ligamentous and tendinous avulsion fractures. [5] Few data exist on the true incidence of these fractures, in that many reports do not mention them. One unpublished study noted a 35% (eight of 23 cases) incidence of fractures associated with high-velocity knee dislocations (Owens, unpublished data, 2003). The presence of the fracture may alter management and require supplemental bony fixation or may allow ligamentous repair versus reconstruction. three or more ligaments torn. Vigilance is required because of the high incidence of neurovascular injuries associated with knee dislocation (vascular injuries 5-79%, nerve injuries 16-40%).
Classification
Knee dislocations are classified into five types on the basis of the direction of tibial displacement, as follows [6] :
- Anterior
- Posterior
- Medial
- Lateral
- Rotational four either open or closed and as either reducible or irreducible.%).
Epidemiology
The Mayo Clinic recorded 14 knee dislocations during an interval of 2 million admissions. [7] In a large series from Los Angeles County Hospital, 53 knee dislocations were reported over a 10-year period. A study from Finland reported 837 knee dislcoations over a period of 14 years and found the incidence to be highest in men aged 18 to 29 years (29 dislocations per 1 million person-years in 2011). [8]
The true incidence of knee dislocations is higher than reported because as many as 50% of knee dislocations spontaneously reduce before patients present to the emergency department.
Prognosis
Multiple outcome studies after surgical intervention for knee dislocation universally report that patients rarely claim that their knee function is normal. [9, 10] Wascher reported results after ACL reconstruction, PCL reconstruction, or both in 13 patients with knee dislocations, and results after a mean of 38 months follow-up care. [11] One patient claimed his knee felt normal, six returned to unrestricted sports activities, and four returned to modified sports.
Shapiro reported the outcome after allograft reconstruction of the ACL and PCL after traumatic knee dislocation. [12] Seven patients had an average of 51 months follow-up care postoperatively. Only one patient had significant pain, three had occasional or rare sensations of knee instability, and all seven were able to return to work or school. Four patients required knee manipulation at an average of 16.8 weeks postoperatively for knee arthrofibrosis. The functional grading was excellent in three, good in three, and fair in one.
Yeh reported the outcome after arthroscopic reconstruction of the PCL with open repair of collateral ligaments and capsule in 23 patietns followed for a mean of 27 months. [13] At the latest follow-up visit, the mean knee extension was 1¬∞ and knee flexion was 129.6¬∞.

England:.
The slaying Friday of the 69-year-old Conservative lawmaker David Amess during his regular weeklyK security services "to make sure that all measures are being put in place for the security of MPs so that they can carry on with their duties as elected democratic members."
Amess was attacked around midday Friday during his weekly constituency meeting in a church in Leigh-on-Sea, a town 40 miles (62 kilometers) east of London. He suffered multiple stab wounds. Paramedics tried without success to save him. Police have arrested a 25-year-old British man for the attack.
In a statement early Saturday, the Metropolitan Police described the attack as terrorism and said its early investigation "has revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism." It did not provide any details about the basis for that assessment. As part of the investigation, officers were searching two locations in the London area.
Amess died doing what he most cherished " helping out residents in his seaside constituency of Southend West. Under Britain's parliamentary system, lawmakers have direct links with their local voters, often hosting open meetings, or "surgeries," on Fridays, the topics raised by constituents positions during his long career and had a reputation of being a social conservative on issues such as capital punishment and abortion, he was considered a fixer in Parliament,."
On Saturday morning, in an echo of the political unity that emerged in the immediate aftermath of Cox's murder, the Conservatives' Johnson, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, and the non-partisan speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, arrived at the church where Amess died and laid flowers.

Read more on World by Firstpost.At a Minister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Family getaway the lead speaker[1] Tom Rodgerson used the metaphor of a virus and how it can sometimes be like church life. The over all big idea was that you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t control the issues that other people have (the virus), but you can control how you respond to them (the immune system). He suggested that pastors/leaders should focus on the immune system and making sure it is healthy instead of trying to track down and get rid of all the viruses.
So just by way of continuing the discussion and how leaders can stay healthy, let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s push the metaphor of the virus a little further.√Ç In nature in order for a virus to attach itself to the body, it has to have a host cell. And the connection between the host cell and the virus has to be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìa perfect fit.√¢‚Ç¨ So the body√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition must be in such a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìshape√¢‚Ç¨ so that the virus perfectly matches the virus. If it is healthy, it is less likely to connect to the virus. If it is unhealthy it far more likely to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmatch up√¢‚Ç¨ with a virus. So the following are some ways the leader can stay healthy and deal with ‚Äúviruses.‚Äù
1.√Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç Focus On What You Can Control.
Leaders only have so much time, energy, and emotional fortitude, so focus on what you can control √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú the immune system. There are ways to control exposure to viruses. One could live in a bubble, never go around √¢‚Ç¨≈ìviruses√¢‚Ç¨ and focus on avoiding √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsickness.√¢‚Ç¨ But Christ has called those who call on His name to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGo therefore and make disciples of all nations. . .√¢‚Ç¨[2] The world is a very messy and sick place.√Ç Viruses are all around us, every moment of every day. To try and avoid them is not practical.
In church life, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìviruses√¢‚Ç¨ (i.e. people who don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to have a biblical healthy relationship, and default to unhealthy behavior when anxiety arises) can not be avoided. But the leader who is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhealthy√¢‚Ç¨ will be far less likely to be affected by the illness. Remember, there has to be a perfect match between the two in order for the virus to spread.
2.√Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç Constantly Reinforce the Mission of the Organization.
Know the Mission. One of the main tasks of the leader is to keep people focused on the mission and values of the organization. If the body as a whole knows the mission, vision, and values of the organization, when viruses attack, the healthy body will be able to fend off attacks that try and get it off task and engaged in ungodly behavior (infighting, gossiping, jumping to false assumptions, etc.).
3.√Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç Recognize Unhealthy Patterns (and Change Them).
It won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be very long in leadership before the leader will encounter an issue that causes anxiety in the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbody.√¢‚Ç¨ There are different ways that people deal with this anxiety; some people emotionally distance themselves from the leader, they may pull new people into a two person disagreement, they may pull up old issues that have already been dealt with, or just leave the organization all together.
But when the anxiety comes to the surface and the tension begins to build, leaders will have a default pattern that they conform to in order to deal with the issue. Remember you only have so much time and energy; focus on developing the immune system, not fighting the virus. Part of developing the immune system is to recognize patterns in your own life that are unhealthy.√Ç How do you typically handle stress and anxiety? Is this pattern healthy?
In default mode, in reaction to anxiety, we tend to be reactive. We have a certain way we react to the stimulus (or virus). One may retreat, attack back, get quiet, lash out, loss one√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s temper, etc√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ but instead of reacting the way one typically has always defaulted to (assuming it is unhealthy), one should become curious as to why they react this way.
It is as if one is in pain from an injury √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú do you ignore the problem, cover it up, or explore getting medical attention?√Ç Be curious about why you are injured. √Ç Why does the virus so easily become attached? What is it about the immune system that keeps letting this virus in and perfectly attaching to it?
When a person learns something new, or even does something new, the brain creates new thinking pathways. Remember we react to certain stimulus in a default way. If we change how we react enough, our brain will actually change in order to adapt to this new behavior. Romans 12:2 says, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo not be conformed to this world,√Ç but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.√¢‚Ç¨ The most significant part of dealing with unhealthy patterns in our lives is to change them, then our brains will change, and this will become a new default way of dealing with anxiety and stress.
4.√Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç √Ç Prayer and Bible Study.
So how do I change how I react? √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú through prayer and Bible study. It always amazes me at people who want to lose weight some other way than exercise and eating healthy. This is the tried and true way of having a healthy body (eat right and exercise). But every year there are constant √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnew discoveries√¢‚Ç¨ that always prove to be worthless because they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t involve exercise or eating healthy.
The same is true for followers of Christ. If we are to be healthy (and fighting off √¢‚Ç¨≈ìviruses√¢‚Ç¨) we have to study the Bible and pray. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s as easy or as hard as that. There are no shortcuts or easy methods for changing our own sin nature and depravity √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú other than taking in God√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Word and praying to our Creator.
There is a way to think about this process. Imagine you sit down for dinner and putting the food in your mouth (reading), then you chew on the food (reflecting/meditating). Next, you swallow it and it becomes apart of your body because it is absorbed and the nutrients are taken in (responding to the Word, it becomes apart of who you are). Then one has a sense of satisfaction and can rest in the fullness of God√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Word. It does satisfy (and change) the soul like nothing else can.[3]

Posted on Nov 16, 2020, by Tara Perre
Whether you‚Äôve been a runner for life, have picked it up the past few years or you‚Äôre training for your first half marathon ‚Äì cross training should be one of the key parts of any runner‚Äôs workout program. What is one of the best ways to cross train? Indoor cycling, commonly referred to as ‚Äúspin.‚Äù
Although there are MANY, here are just 4 of the reasons why you should be adding spin into your weekly workout routine, runner or not:
- It‚Äôs a low impact, full body workout. A stationary bike provides a low impact workout that is easy on the joints and gives you the ability to create a full-body experience. You can build muscle strength, increase your cardiovascular endurance, work your core & more ‚Äì all from riding in place. Climbing giant hills will keep those legs feeling strong, increasing your resistance while changing positions creates a tremendous ‚Äúcrunchless‚Äù core workout. And, did you know you can lift weights while riding? Using light weight dumbbells while riding helps you build lean muscle and tone your upper body, all while still working your lower body.
- A heart healthy killer calorie burner. Increasing your heart rate through cardiovascular exercise increases your heart rate which strengthens your heart. Our heart is a muscle and just like we‚Äôd weight train our biceps or shoulders, we need to be sure to engage in activities that help make our hearts stronger. Running, especially intervals or sprints, is a great way to work the heart. Another activity that is great for strengthening the heart? Spin! Classes vary in the steepness of the hills and length of the sprints, but each of these exercises increases your heart rate for an extended period of time. This helps you burn an average of 300-600+ calories in a 45-minute class.
- We are stronger when we ride together. Spin is one of the most inclusive workouts you can do. Any fitness level can ride at their own pace and resistance all while still riding side by side with others in the room. It‚Äôs a group ride where no one gets left behind. You have the accountability of knowing others are right there with you on every drill, each at their own level, and encouraging each other every step of the way.
- It‚Äôs about the body, but it‚Äôs also fun! The right spin class will have you feeling motivated and inspired to push harder than you would riding on your own. A killer workout is even better when it‚Äôs something you constantly look forward to, as well as, one that helps you feel motivated and inspired after class ‚Äì it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúspinners high.‚Äù
Keeping it safe. Sharing is caring, just not at spin. During this COVID environment we live in, it‚Äôs important to avoid high-touch services to do our part to slow the spread. Every rider gets their own equipment for the entire workout. With spin class, you never move around the room. You stay stationary on your own bike, maintaining a safe distance from the person next to you, using your own weights, drinking your own water, etc.
Our studio has 1,800 square feet of space that houses 12-20 bikes each class. This allows for 9+ feet in between each rider to ensure extra health & safety measures are taken. Our studio is sanitized from top to bottom by our staff after each class so riders can feel confident that the equipment they are using and the space they are exercising in is safe.

The roadmap will enable the master trusts‚Äô auto-enrolment defaults to target reduced carbon emissions intensity, including the setting of minimum climate expectations for investee companies.
In particular, the framework has targeted a carbon emissions intensity reduction of 50 per cent by 2025, and a further 65 per cent by 2030 in target date default.
It is also aiming for a 65 per cent reduction in the growth phase, with the framework to be available to over 4 million DC scheme members and ¬£53bn assets under management.
These targets are designed to reflect the beginning of alignment with the Paris Agreement goal to limit warming to 1.5C and will be reviewed "periodically" in-line with the best available science-based approaches and industry practice.
The group is expected to achieve reductions via a combination of the use of climate transition aligned benchmark indices in some index tracking funds, selective divestment where appropriate and a focus on re-shaping exposures within priority sectors.
Alongside a reduction in emissions, L&G will also be looking to increase exposure to climate solutions, such as sustainable forestry and renewable energy, within the relevant investment strategies.
The plans follow a year of ‚Äúsignificant progress‚Äù, which has seen LGIM reduce the carbon emission intensity on default multi-asset funds by 23 per cent, as well as a 30 per cent reduction on its target date funds.
Around ¬£11bn within its default funds equity exposure has also been transitioned from a standard market cap weighted index to tracking indices which enforce minimum standards on investee companies.
This includes applying the climate impact pledge, which includes divestment sanctions against investee companies that do not meet LGIM‚Äôs expectation, and has now been incorporated into all of the group's auto-enrolment defaults.
This has resulted in approximately ¬£170m of selective divestments, including ¬£75m from coal companies and Climate Impact Pledge divestments, with the group emphasising that all of these changes are necessary to address climate risk as a financially material risk factor to clients‚Äô portfolios.
Indeed, the roadmap builds on L&G‚Äôs broader commitment to be net zero by 2050, and has also been highlighted as an "important milestone" in LGIM's previous pledge to work with clients to increase the proportion of assets managed under the net zero target.
Commenting on the plans, LGIM head of DC, Emma Douglas, said: ‚ÄúAs the UK‚Äôs largest DC provider, we are fully supportive of achieving the target of net zero by 2050 and the roadmap we are setting out today provides further detail as to how we plan to de-carbonise our own range of auto-enrolment defaults and those of the L&G Master Trust.
"Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation and an area of great concern to many of our members.
‚ÄúAs the innovations and change required to deliver net-zero materialise, we will continue to evolve our roadmap for the coming years and use our proprietary framework to monitor the progress.
"Our roadmap to net zero is a significant step in assuring our members that their retirement savings are influencing real change.‚Äù
L&G Master Trust and independent governance committee independent chair, Dermot Courtier, added: ‚ÄúManaging climate-related risks on behalf of our members is a crucial financial factor and a key priority for the trustee board.
‚ÄúWe are delighted that L&G has followed up on their commitment to net zero within the default funds with this clear ESG and climate change roadmap to enable us to ensure the long-term performance of our investments and improve member outcomes in retirement.
‚ÄúThese timelines and milestones will further support us in overseeing the progress to net zero on behalf of our scheme members and we look forward to collaborating with L&G as we progress on this important journey.‚Äù
Make My Money Matter co-founder, Richard Curtis, has also highlighted the announcement as evidence that the race to the top amongst pension providers is ‚Äúpicking up pace‚Äù.
He continued: Since we launched our campaign to green the UK's pensions industry, schemes have been making more and more ambitious commitments, and L&G‚Äôs pledge shows what is possible when providers harness the power of our pensions to build a better world.
‚ÄúTheir target of reducing emissions by 65 per cent by 2030 is particularly encouraging, and demonstrates the speed and urgency required by providers to combat the climate crisis. When I spoke with L&G members last year I heard loud and clear that they wanted to see their pensions go green, and it‚Äôs fantastic that these voices are being heard.
‚ÄúNow is the moment for the rest of the industry to follow suit and ensure that by November‚Äôs COP26 summit everyone in the UK has a pension they can be proud of.‚Äù
L&G also clarified that all targets are relative to end-2019 data and are focused on the portfolios‚Äô listed equity and publicly traded corporate debt exposure.
LGIM DC business and L&G Master Trust commit to net zero
Legal and General Investment Management's (LGIM) Workplace Defined Contribution (DC) business and the L&G Master Trust have unveiled a roadmap to achieve net zero by 2050 across all of their auto-enrolment default investment options.

More names for wall of sporting excellence Crawley Borough Council and Everyone Active are asking for nominations for the second phase of the wall of sporting excellence at K2 Crawley. The wall, unveiled in 2019 and featuring sportspeople connected to Crawley, has become a fantastic feature in the leisure centre and highlights the town‚Äôs rich sporting history. The wall currently features Steve Arneil, karate; Nick Buckfield, pole vault; Paulo Da Silva, Muay Thai; Sharron Davies MBE, swimming; Katie-George Dunlevy, cycling; Sally Gunnell OBE, hurdles; Mick Jones, hammer throw; Jade Lally, discuss; Mick Leigh, judo; Alan Minter, boxing; Gareth Southgate OBE, football; Daley Thompson CBE, decathlon; Zara Williams, swimming. Each sporting hero is represented on the wall with a graphical portrait and information plaque. Now, the council and Everyone Active want to add to the wall. If you want to make suggestions for the next phase of selection, email communications@crawley.gov.uk before Monday 4 October.
Gareth Southgate OBE, manager of the England men‚Äôs football team, said: ‚ÄúCrawley has a proud sporting tradition and produces a great number of sportsmen and women who compete nationally and internationally. ‚ÄúUnderpinning these achievements, many Crawley residents are actively engaged as coaches, volunteers, participants, administrators and spectators. I am proud to have grown up in Crawley where sport plays such an important role in the local community.‚Äù Katie-George Dunlevy, Paralympic cyclist, said: ‚ÄúSport not only gave me a life beyond my wildest dreams but it has also saved it. I was diagnosed visually impaired at aged 11 with a progressive degenerative eye condition and faced with a potentially bleak future. However, when I found sport, I found a passion and a drive to be the best I could possibly be. ‚ÄúLiving and training in and around Crawley all my life, I work extremely hard and K2 Crawley is where I do a lot of my work towards becoming the current Paralympic and World Champion that I am. I now travel the world doing what I do. I am immensely proud, as are my family and the sporting community in Crawley.‚Äù
From the Leader the-19-19. It‚Äôs going to be a tough few years, but if looking back tells me anything it‚Äôs that any problem will eventually be overcome.

Town Centre BID In 2019, businesses in the town centre voted in favour of a Business Improvement District (Crawley Town Centre BID). The BID, a not-for-profit company, is financed by businesses within the area to deliver improvements in footfall, entertainment and accessibility. Crawley Town Centre BID is focusing on four key areas: SHOWCASED ‚Äì Promoting the heart of the town to show how much Crawley has to offer to residents, potential businesses and visitors. CONNECTED ‚Äì So many people and businesses have felt isolated over the last 18 months, so the BID is working hard to help them make connections and feel part of and proud of something bigger and better than before. SAFER ‚Äì Working with the whole of Crawley‚Äôs community to improve the overall experience of visitors to the BID area, including the provision of Ambassadors who are providing a welcoming presence in the town centre. ENLIVENED ‚Äì Helping to create a thriving town centre where people want to be through an engaging arts, culture and entertainment programme throughout the year.

Keeping your garage secure Police regularly receive reports of garages that have been broken into. They‚Äôre often located in garage blocks, which are isolated from view and only visited occasionally. In many instances the locks or handles of the garage doors have been kicked and broken or doors have been forced with an instrument of some kind. There are ways you can improve the security of your garage to prevent yourself becoming a victim of crime. The police advice is: ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt leave valuables in your garage if you can avoid it. If there is no option but to store items in the garage, make sure items of value are insured ‚Ä¢
Chain together garden equipment such as chainsaws and mowers and padlock to the concrete floor using secure fixings or a ground anchor, a high tensile cable or chain with a close shackle padlock. Ladders should always be locked away to stop a thief from using them
‚Ä¢
Add additional security such as padlocks and hasps to either side of the garage door and frame or into the concrete base. Don‚Äôt rely on the original garage door lock alone
‚Ä¢ Cover windows, if your garage has any, so thieves can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs inside ‚Ä¢ Security mark items with your postcode, by engraving or painting, or by using an ultraviolet marker pen ‚Ä¢ Check your garage regularly. If you see anything suspicious call 999 in an emergency or 101 for non-emergencies or visit sussex.police.uk to report online. If you have any information to help the police apprehend the offenders, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

NEW FLOOD WARNING SYSTEM FOR TILGATE AND FURNACE GREEN RESIDENTS The Environment Agency is using the latest technology to monitor rainfall, river and tide levels 24 hours a day to forecast flooding. You will receive a flood warning when properties in your area are expected to flood. The accuracy of flood warnings improves over time as more data is gathered and a better understanding of how the river reacts to heavy rainfall. In the short term, as this is a brand new service, there may be a higher than normal occurrence of false alarms. In some built up residential areas, flooding can happen extremely quickly after heavy rain. This means that flooding could occur very soon after a flood warning is issued, so you may need to act fast. In some circumstances there may be no time to issue a flood warning in advance so be prepared, know the signs to look out for and stay alert. It is important for the Environment Agency to verify what happens every time a flood warning is issued

Protecting employment areas from housing New moves to protect Crawley‚Äôs employment areas from housing are being made by Crawley Borough Council, following government changes to permitted development rights. Currently in Manor Royal, Lowfield Heath, Maidenbower Business Park, Three Bridges Corridor and Tilgate Forest Business Centre, office, light industrial and warehouse premises cannot be converted to housing without planning permission. The council adopted Article 4 directions which removed permitted development rights (allowing the conversion of certain property uses to housing without a need for planning permission) following concerns raised by the council and business community that residential development in employment areas is having a negative impact on the operation of these areas and the supply of business land.
The council also had concerns about the quality of life for anyone living in these areas, which can be noisy, busy places that don‚Äôt have the supporting facilities found in the town‚Äôs residential neighbourhoods. Recent government changes to the use classes for planning mean that the council now has to take new measures to protect employment land from being turned into housing. The council has chosen to pursue non-immediate Article 4 directions, which are subject to a 12-month notification period, including a statutory consultation period. Details of the Article 4 Directions and consultation materials can be viewed at crawley.gov.uk/planning and paper copies are also available at Crawley Library.

Fancy being a zookeeper for the day? The meerkats have welcomed their adoring fans once more! Of all the animals in the Nature Centre, they have missed the public the most. And after months of waiting, the meet the meerkats experience has resumed. Joined by the curious yellow mongooses, the new meerkat enclosure is a hive of constant activity. The new enclosure is wheelchair accessible and has a large indoor area, allowing visitors to meet the meerkats come rain or shine. Far from being nervous of their new dinner guests, the meerkats have flocked to welcome people back with open paws, especially if they come with mealworms to eat! Over on the domestic zone, the more boisterous goats are also enjoying having visitors. They are an irrepressible bunch with an insatiable appetite. Armed with plenty of tasty field maple, beech or hazel and a few choice veggies, visitors can now meet and feed the goats. Their various personalities shine through, as Nigel pushes his way to the front to snag the best treats while Norris jumps up like a friendly puppy to try his luck.
The Group Keeper experience has proved to be a big hit too. Children and adults have enjoyed meeting a variety of animals up close and getting a taste of what working with animals is like. The experience allows participants to range all over the zoo and try their hand at the different facets of zookeeping, such as falconry, feeding, enrichment and general husbandry. The animal collection has continued to grow with the addition of the adorably small Brazilian cavies. These small, speedy rodents are ancestors of domestic guinea pigs. In keeping with the South American theme, the alpacas have also started to have their babies ‚Äì the first born in mid-August.

House fire candle warning Firefighters at West Sussex Fire & Rescue Service are urging residents not to leave burning candles unattended after a house fire in Crawley. The service is also reminding residents of the importance of having working smoke alarms and that they are tested regularly. The warnings come after fire crews attended an incident where a fire began upstairs in the property after a candle was left burning by an open window and curtains while the family was downstairs. Unfortunately, while they had a smoke alarm fitted, there weren‚Äôt any batteries in it. The first they knew of the fire was when a neighbour banged on their front door to alert them.

But in recent times, the matriarchal owners of these animals have shied away from their role, fearing or even hating some of their charges, like the lions they would come across on walks to fetch firewood and water, while the Samburu men, known often as warriors, were out herding livestock.
Now a group of Samburu women have tapped back into their maternal pride to become lion defenders, their own warriors in a culture where women‚Äôs roles rarely exceed domestic chores. The women‚Äôs interest was piqued after seeing men being trained to fight for lions by conservation organization Ewaso Lions. Despite some initial apprehension, the women now doggedly campaign for a program called Mama Simba.
‚ÄúThe women kept approaching Ewaso Lions, coming to camp practically every day saying ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve seen the warriors doing this. We feel that we could do just as good a job if only someone gave us the opportunity,‚Äô so that was the start of Mama Simba,‚Äù Heather Gurd, conservation manager at Ewaso Lions, said.
Mama Simba participants set up their own school, which operates four days a week. (Tyrell Bernardini)
The Mama Simba program started in 2013 by taking more than 30 women from Sasaab village in the Westgate Community Conservancy on safari drives to learn about the environment. Staff then set up a school to educate a small group of women who had never been taught to write even their names.
The women are trained in conservation, including the importance of litter-gathering, how to reinforce bomas ‚Äì thorny stick-walled enclosures where they keep cattle ‚Äì to stop predators coming and how to identify and report the tracks of predators. The loss of cattle often leads to conflicts between communities, so women are also taught how to resolve disputes peacefully.
But the weekly lessons held in the village preschool were soon not enough for such determined students.
‚ÄúThey were so passionate about learning that they decided to build their own bush school, so they now have that just on the outskirts of their village which means they can now go four times a week,‚Äù Gurd said.
One Mama Simba recruit, Munteli Lalparasaroi, in her 20s, has gone from complete illiteracy to training other women to defend lions. From having barely left her home area, she has crisscrossed Kenya to learn more about conservation in areas such as the Maasai Mara and Lake Victoria.
‚ÄúBefore I was asleep but now I have been educated,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI am the most lucky Samburu woman to board an airplane, which the Samburu before thought was only for those who went to school.‚Äù
Munteli is even more thrilled about learning to drive, because it allows her to spread her conservation message further and make more women lion-loving warriors. ‚ÄúNow I can drive and before I never thought this was possible. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm dreaming,‚Äù she said.
One of Ewaso‚Äôs aims is to change people‚Äôs beliefs that lions and other carnivores are a menace and that wildlife belongs to tourists and the government. She wants to replace these attitudes with a sense of local pride in wildlife. ‚ÄúPeople are learning that wildlife is a good natural resource and that everybody needs to be responsible,‚Äù Munteli said.
There are only 50 lions left in the Samburu lands of Kenya, but a determined group of women is fighting to save them. (Biosphoto/Berndt Fischer)
With only an estimated 50 lions remaining in the Samburu-Isiolo ecosystem, women are a great asset for monitoring the population, because they often hear about lions‚Äô whereabouts from other women in the community while men are off herding.
‚ÄúHaving these ladies increases our network of informants about lions, because all the ladies will report back to us if they see tracks around their village or on their way to town they come across lions or they hear from others in the community that there has been a conflict incident,‚Äù Gurd said.
From being shut out of conversations outside the home and therefore conservation, the 19 educated and trained Mama Simbas have earned women a say at meetings and a greater level of respect in the community.
‚ÄúGirls are learning they have a voice in the community as human beings. The ladies can also take part in leadership and governance. Ladies are getting enlightened,‚Äù Munteli said.
‚ÄúThey were very shy at the start of the program and we‚Äôve seen a real change in their confidence and the enthusiasm they have,‚Äù Gurd said.
She has seen women become spokespeople for lion conservation, passing their ideas on to their children who in turn tell warriors not to kill lions for cultural, ecological, economic or environmental reasons.
When not monitoring lions, the women make and sell beaded figurines or use other craft skills learned in the program to support their families during the dry season, when men migrate with livestock.
‚ÄúI have learnt a good number of business ideas and can now make money of my own, which is not something that is done so much by any Samburu women,‚Äù Munteli said.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean that she and the other women aren‚Äôt still pushing to know and do more. ‚ÄúI have not yet reached my expectations because I want to ask more and stay with Ewaso Lions so I can read and write very well,‚Äù Munteli said.
This article originally contained a reference to Samburu warriors going hunting. This has been corrected to reflect that the Samburu are pastoralists, and instead go out herding livestock.All the life was sucked out of Asian shares on Wednesday as oil prices took a fresh spill after news that Kuwaiti oil workers ended a three-day strike, leaving markets suddenly directionless.

TULSA - Every mother was grinning. Most fathers burst out laughing. White-haired grandmothers clapped in delight as hundreds of children gleefully consumed large servings of vegetables.
Many thought they'd never see it in their lifetime. Surely, no adult at the Tulsa Performing Arts Center ever expected children to embrace green, leafy vegetables. But even more surprising than the mass fiber intake was the first exposure to a live children's show that didn't put anyone to sleep or send them scurrying out at intermission.
"VeggieTales Live!" began a five-day run in Tulsa on Wednesday and continues this weekend.
The pleas from children trying to bypass the broccoli usually are similar to those of a dad devising a detour past the singing, dancing cartoon characters his family wants to hear.
But the only begging going on here is for more. More cucumber, more tomato and (gasp!) definitely more asparagus. As Larry, Bob and Junior, respectively, in "VeggieTales Live!" these three have done what few characters can: peel away the labels.
Veggies are, indeed, for everyone. At least for those in the 28 cities lucky enough to be included in the first year of the touring theatrical show.
There's a balance to this popular collection of Bible-themed, value-teaching vegetables, and not just because they can dance, glide and spin without the use of arms. It's a genuine, life-application base that shines through in the stage show.
To illustrate this, larger-than-life versions of Archibald Asparagus, Pa Grape, Jimmy and Jerry Gourd, John and Philippe the French Peas and a massive giant pickle named Goliath are paired with people in a variety of roles. Interaction between man, animal and food in a nonthreatening way gives the performance a flavor not unlike the popular video series, where letters from children are the impetus for stories that teach lessons such as honesty, sharing and contentment.
The Monty Python-like exchanges and self-deprecating humor where the veggies' lack of hands is concerned draw some of the loudest laughs.
Larry: Give me a hug!
Bob: I would if I could, man.
Others come from family members pointing at each other while singing along with familiar favorites.
The sets are just as clever visually as the exchanges are verbally. Nine sets, ranging from the desert to Broadway, give the audience a feel for the past and present as the characters re-enact Bible stories the audience knows from the video series.
Goliath was an obvious favorite with the crowd, and most would agree the seats really did shake when the Wall of Jericho came tumbling down.
All children aside, if placed under a light bulb for long period, most adults will admit the Silly Songs are their favorite. "Love My Lips" was no disappointment in the live format, as Larry laments the temporary loss of his lips and ongoing fear they'll be taken to Dr. Archibald.
The director's choice for that segment was so good, in fact, that some forgot they had been wishing for Mr. Lunt's Cheeseburger Song instead. Who says Veggie fans can't live on fiber alone?
'VeggieTales Live!'
Tickets for "VeggieTales Live!" at Tulsa Performing Arts Center are $15 to $26.50.
Remaining show times are 1, 4 and 7 p.m. today and 2 and 5 p.m. Sunday.

Bluehost Review
Bluehost is among the biggest host firms in the world, obtaining both huge advertising and marketing assistance from the firm itself and also affiliate marketers who advertise it.
It truly is a huge business, that has been around for a long time, has a huge reputation, and also is certainly one of the top choices when it concerns web hosting (most definitely within the leading 3, at least in my publication).
Yet what is it precisely, as well as should you obtain its solutions?
Learn More About Reddit Best Web Hosting For WordPress Here ->
Today, I will answer all there is you require to understand, provided that you are a blog owner or a business owner who is seeking a web host, and doesn‚Äôt understand where to get going, given that it‚Äôs a wonderful service for that audience in general.
Allow‚Äôs envision, you wish to host your websites and also make them noticeable. Okay?
You currently have your domain name (which is your website location or URL) now you want to ‚Äútransform the lights on‚Äù. Reddit Best Web Hosting For WordPress
You require some hosting‚Ä¶
To accomplish all of this, and also to make your site noticeable, you need what is called a ‚Äúserver‚Äù. A web server is a black box, or device, that keeps all your internet site data (data such as photos, texts, videos, web links, plugins, and various other info).
Currently, this web server, needs to get on at all times as well as it has to be attached to the web 100% of the time (I‚Äôll be pointing out something called ‚Äúdowntime‚Äù later).
Furthermore, it likewise requires (without getting as well fancy and also into information) a file transfer protocol frequently known as FTP, so it can show internet browsers your internet site in its intended type.
All these points are either pricey, or need a high degree of technological skill (or both), to create and also maintain. As well as you can totally head out there as well as learn these points by yourself and also set them up ‚Ä¶ but what regarding rather than you acquiring and also preserving one ‚Ä¶ why not simply ‚Äúrenting hosting‚Äù rather?
This is where Bluehost can be found in. You rent their servers (called Shared Hosting) as well as you release a web site using those servers.
Given that Bluehost keeps all your data, the company additionally permits you to set up your material management systems (CMS, for brief) such as WordPress for you. WordPress is an incredibly popular CMS ‚Ä¶ so it just makes good sense to have that alternative available (virtually every organizing business now has this alternative as well).
In other words, you no more need to set-up a web server and after that integrate a software where you can construct your content, individually. It is already rolled into one package.
Is it safe to have Bluehost care for your web sites?
Well ‚Ä¶ envision if your web server remains troubles away, and also deals with whatever technological: Pay your web server ‚Äúrent‚Äù, and they will certainly care for every little thing. And once you buy the solution, you can after that begin focusing on adding web content to your internet site, or you can put your effort right into your advertising and marketing projects.
What Provider Do You Get From Bluehost?
Bluehost supplies a myriad of various solutions, however the key one is hosting obviously.
The hosting itself, is of different kinds incidentally. You can rent a shared web server, have a specialized web server, or additionally a digitalexclusive web server.
For the purpose of this Bluehost review, we will certainly concentrate on holding services and also various other services, that a blog writer or an online entrepreneur would need, instead of go too deep into the bunny hole and also discuss the various other services, that are targeted at even more seasoned individuals.
- WordPress, WordPress PRO, and also e-Commerce‚Äî these organizing solutions are the bundles that allow you to host a web site utilizing WordPress and WooCommerce (the latter of which enables you to do ecommerce). After buying any of these packages, you can start developing your internet site with WordPress as your CMS.
- Domain Industry‚Äî you can likewise purchase your domain from Bluehost as opposed to other domain name registrars. Doing so will make it easier to direct your domain to your host‚Äôs name web servers, considering that you‚Äôre making use of the exact same market.
- Email‚Äî when you have actually bought your domain, it makes good sense to likewise get an e-mail address connected to it. As a blogger or on the internet business owner, you ought to pretty much never utilize a cost-free e-mail solution, like Yahoo! or Gmail. An e-mail similar to this makes you look unprofessional. Luckily, Bluehost provides you one totally free with your domain name.

Bluehost additionally provides devoted servers.
And also you may be asking ‚Ä¶‚Äù What is a specialized server anyhow?‚Äù.
Well, the important things is, the standard web hosting bundles of Bluehost can only a lot website traffic for your website, after which you‚Äôll need to update your organizing. The factor being is that the common servers, are shared.
What this suggests is that server can be servicing 2 or more internet sites, at the same time, among which can be yours.
What does this mean for you?
It means that the single web server‚Äôs sources are shared, and also it is doing several tasks at any type of given time. When your website begins to strike 100,000 site sees every month, Expense?
In this Bluehost testimonial, I‚Äôll be focusing my attention primarily on the Bluehost WordPress Hosting bundles, since it‚Äôs the most preferred one, as well as most likely the one that you‚Äôre seeking which will certainly match you the most effective (unless you‚Äôre a substantial brand, business or website).
The 3 readily available plans, are as follows:
- Standard Plan‚Äì $2.95 each month/ $7.99 regular cost
- Plus Strategy‚Äì $5.45 per month/ $10.99 routine rate
- Option Plus Plan‚Äì $5.45 each month/ $14.99 routine rate
The very first price you see is the price you pay upon register, and also the second cost is what the price is, after the very first year of being with the business.
So basically, Bluehost is going to charge you on an annual basis. As well as you can likewise select the amount of years you intend to organize your site on them with. Reddit Best Web Hosting For WordPress
If you pick the Standard plan, you will certainly pay $2.95 x 12 = $35.40 starting today and by the time you enter your 13th month, you will certainly currently pay $7.99 each month, which is likewise charged annually. If that makes any type of feeling.
If you are serious about your website, you ought to 100% obtain the three-year choice. This means that for the fundamental strategy, you will pay $2.95 x 36 months = $106.2.
By the time you hit your fourth year, that is the only time you will pay $7.99 per month. If you think about it, this technique will certainly save you $120 throughout 3 years. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs still something.
If you intend to obtain greater than one website (which I highly suggest, and if you‚Äôre serious, you‚Äôll probably be getting even more eventually in time) you‚Äôll intend to make use of the option plus strategy. It‚Äôll permit you to host endless websites.

What Does Each Strategy Offer?
So, in the case of WordPress holding plans (which resemble the shared holding plans, yet are more geared towards WordPress, which is what we‚Äôll be concentrating on) the features are as follows:
For the Standard strategy, you get:
- One web site just
- Secured site via SSL certification
- Maximum of 50GB of storage space
- Free domain name for a year
- $ 200 advertising and marketing credit scores
Bear in mind that the domains are purchased independently from the holding. You can get a totally free domain name with Bluehost below.
For both the Bluehost Plus hosting and Choice Plus, you get the following:
- Limitless number of websites

However, mortgage brokers, being your intermediary, can always make out time or rearrange their routines to your convenience. And most times, your meetings will be set at a time and place that is convenient for you.

National School of Opera, and privately with Otakar Kraus.
Performances of opera
David Hillman spent several years working as a quantity surveyor before studying as a singer. His solo debut in 1962 was as Arvino in Verdi‚Äôs I Lombardi with Welsh National Opera, returning to that company for William Tell, The Marriage of Figaro and The Seraglio. He soon joined the company at Sadler‚Äôs Wells. In Britain his career was divided largely between that company and Scottish Opera. He showed a remarkable degree of versatility. His voice was a lyric tenor, but even after it grew to allow him to sing heavier roles such as Hermann or Bacchus, he was still able to negotiate the coloratura requirements of Rossini‚Äôs Count Almaviva. He was an excellent actor, equally good in serious and comic parts, with a handsome appearance, and an ideal sense of timing for comic dialogue in operetta roles.
In the 1960s he toured to Scotland regularly with Sadler‚Äôs Wells. His roles with that company included Mozart (Belmonte, Ferrando, Tamino), Beethoven (Jaquino in a rare staging of Leonora), Verdi (Alfredo), Puccini (Rodolfo), Offenbach (Paris) and Johann Strauss (Eisenstein). He also sang in revivals of The Makropulos Case (Janek), Gloriana (Essex), and The Queen of Spades (Hermann). His last role at the Coliseum was in 1987 (the title-role of The Tales of Hoffmann). At Sadler‚Äôs Wells he created the roles of Fenney in The Mines of Sulphur (Richard Rodney Bennett 1965) and Sosth√®ne in The Violins of Saint-Jacques (Malcolm Williamson 1966). Both these operas were brought to Scotland on tour. He also sang Essex when the Sadler's Wells company visited Vienna.
He worked with Scottish Opera for the first time in 1970, singing Tamino in a production of The Magic Flute mounted for the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. His next role, a few weeks later, was Toni Reischmann in Henze‚Äôs own production of Elegy for Young Lovers at the 1970 Edinburgh Festival. Thereafter he was a frequent guest as Almaviva, Nero (The Coronation of Poppea), Camille (The Merry Widow), Edgardo (Lucia di Lammermoor), Eisenstein (Die Fledermaus), Macduff (Macbeth), Cassio (Otello), and Lysander (A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream), He doubled as the Brazilian millionaire and Frick the cobbler in La vie Parisienne, before tripling as Governor, Captain & Gambler in Candide. His last role with the company was Daniel Buchanan in Weill‚Äôs Street Scene in 1989. He created two roles with Scottish Opera ‚Äì Quintus in The Catiline Conspiracy (Iain Hamilton 1974) and Darnley in Mary, Queen of Scots (Thea Musgrave 1977 Edinburgh Festival).
He appeared only rarely at Covent Garden ‚Äì Malcolm in Verdi‚Äôs Macbeth in 1976, and Joe, one of the miners, in a revival of La fanciulla del West conducted by John Mauceri (1985). At the Camden Festival he sang Leicester in the British premiere of Donizetti‚Äôs Maria Stuarda (1966). He appeared as Dauntless in New Sadler‚Äôs Wells Opera‚Äôs first modern revival of the original version of Ruddigore, and with Kent Opera he sang Duke of Mantua in Jonathan Miller‚Äôs first production of Rigoletto, given a Dickensian setting. He was the Shepherd in Szymanowski‚Äôs King Roger for the New Opera Company at Sadler‚Äôs Wells (British Premiere 1975), and also sang Hoffmann with Opera North. At Glyndebourne he sang Elemer in John Cox‚Äôs 1985 production of Arabella. Broadcasts for BBC Radio include Sir John in Love (Vaughan Williams).
Appearances in Ireland included both Dublin Grand and the Wexford Festival. He worked abroad frequently, performing in the USA and South Africa as well as Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Towards the end of his career he continued to sing from time to time as a guest artist with smaller companies if one of his favourite roles was available. In this way he returned to Scotland to sing with Tayside Opera in Dundee as Hermann in The Queen of Spades (1990) and Gustavus in A Masked Ball (1991).
Recordings
Sadly, there does not seem to be any record of Hillman in any of his serious roles or creations, however the lighter side of his art is well documented. He appears on the 1976 EMI Classics for Pleasure recording of Scottish Opera‚Äôs production of The Merry Widow. There are three recordings of him in leading Gilbert and Sullivan parts. He sings Dick Dauntless in the 1987 recording of Ruddigore, and also appears in two of the video series made in 1982 ‚Äì Tolloller in Iolanthe (directed by David Pountney) and Colonel Fairfax in The Yeomen of the Guard. These have been available on DVD.

But let's talk about the magazine's website, shall we? It's quite sad, really. The site has had an "under construction" banner for years, it seems, and no sign of when the new version will launch. For a magazine that represents a city at the forefront of entertainment and media, the static site is embarrassing. Right now, they've posted the cover of the latest issue, with three stories underneath it. Wow...that's so...1995?

The silver-tone metal double link vintage chain is 13 1/2" long (half), and the necklace hangs about 18" long.

[King of Macedonia]
Here come I, the great King of Macedonia,
Conquered all the world round.
When first I came to Scotland my heart was so cold
To see this little nation so proud and so bold,
So proud and so bold, so frank and so free,
That I called upon Gallachen to fight along with me.
[Gallachen]
Here come I, Gallachen -
Gallachen is my name -
My sword and pistol by my side,
I hope to win the game.
[King of Macedonia]
The game, sir, the game, is not within your power,
For with this little weapon I'll slay you in less than half an hour.
[Gallachen]
What's that you say?
[King of Macedonia]
I say what I mean.

Well, let us begin, {dead man}

Any doctors in this town?
[Doctor Brown]
Yes, here come I, the little Doctor Brown,
The best old doctor in the town.

What can you cure?
[Doctor Brown]
The rout, the gout, the ringworm, and the scurvy!
[Unknown]
Do you think you could cure a dead man?
[Doctor Brown]
Oh, well, I'll try.
Here's a little box of inkey-pinkey
I got from my great-grandmother-in-law.
Put a little on his back,
put a little on his head.
Rise up. Jack, and sing a song.

Once I was dead, but now I'm alive -
Blessed be the doctor who made me alive! -
And we'll all join hands, and we'll never fight no more,
And we'll be happy comrades, as we were before.

I wonder if anybody can give me any advice. I have a family linked high cholesterol and follow a healthy diet exercise and am not overweight but can't get cholesterol level down naturally. Can't take statins because of side effects. Doctor now put me on nicotinic acid. Can anybody give me any information on this. Is it effective and will the well documented side effects subside.
Also, I have long term muscle damage due to the statins. I do some exercise and have just started Pilates but that seems to be aggravating the situation. I would be grateful for any advice anybody can give
There are a lot of posts with some answer to statin side effect!
What are your lipid numbers? When was it last tested?
The only person who can advice you is your GP as ha has access to your medical records!

Good one!! Congrats!!Police in Beijing and Shanghai detained 10 people on allegations of illegally raising billions of RMB through investment fund products backed by a web of closely held companies disguised as state owned, reported Caixin.
The individuals, detained in May, include legal representatives and senior executives of several companies affiliated with China Railway Supply Chain Group and Zhongtie Zhongji Construction Group, said Caixin sources. Among them, a businessman called Cen Peng, sits at the heart of a web of companies that provided guarantees for each other in fundraising, business registration records showed.
China Railway Supply Chain and Zhongtie Zhongji Construction are among many private businesses that pretend to be state-backed with misleading names or false information to lure investors. Such fake SOEs often confuse investors with an opaque ownership structure that conceals their actual controlling owners, analysts said.
China Railway Supply Chain and Zhongtie Zhongji Constructioncame under public scrutiny in December when investors reported that several privately offered fund products guaranteed by the two companies failed to pay up. The overdue balance of the products, issued by at least four private investment firms, amounted to nearly RMB 4 billion ($575 million).

I'm unlikely to ever go through a breakup again (thankfully- love u Finn xxx) but I'm a big sister and a friend... so just because I won't go through them myself doesn't mean I won't ever be aware of the drama of them.
I broke up with my first boyfriend over text because I had to. The only way I felt I could get my point across was in writing, there's no nice way of breaking up with someone- there never has been and never will be- and I truly believe that each breakup is different and circumstantial.
I think as young people we get so much shit for making the most of technology, despite the fact it would be ridiculous not to. We use social media to have our voices heard as well as to give and receive compliments and it's lovely, perhaps publicly breaking up with someone on a social platform would be insensitive (it deffo would be) but surely that would be the same for any social setting; like a coffee shop. People are inherently nosey and sniff out drama wherever they can.. so if anything, breaking up with someone over text is pretty considerate?
I'm not sure why I'm writing this post or why I felt the need to justify this opinion. I think I just wanted a reassuring voice out there, that if someone needed it, they'd have? If you feel the need to break up with someone (lover, friend or foe) I am here to reassure you that you can do it over text and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Nor is it anyone else's business.

For those with a Mini CC..
I am looking at eventually getting a Mini CC, but had some questions. I noticed that there are a few options available. Does anyone know if there is a huge difference between the regular torch and the high-oxygen option? Does the high-oxygen cost more? Did any of you get the stainless steel body? I've seen prices from $189 to $299! Why is there such a wide range in price?
Thanks

I have the high-oxy that is not stainless steel. I love it and have no problems with hot knobs ( some people do report hot knobs) . I can melt 1 1/4 rods into a large gather and blow 2 1/2 to 3 inch ornaments without spending alot of time waiting for glass to melt. I can get 5 ornaments in the kiln in an hour and I am very newby slow.That seems like a pretty good job for a little torch but I don't have anything to compare it to.Maybe someone with a minor can give you some input to compare this to.
Call Carlise and ask for a qoute on the model you are interested in this should clear up the pricing.
Good luck, happy melting,
Alison

We run a Mini cc (not high oxy or stainless), great torch. Works well for soft glass and small boro projects. The largest marble we have made with it it about 1 1/2 inch. When torch is turned down to work on small beads the knobs do tend to get warm. You also have to be careful not to over tighten knobs or they will leak. We run ours on two M-15 concentrators, one works well for soft but then need to run both for boro.

When Carlisle first came out with the Mini CC, there were two models: a pinpoint-flame, and the high-oxygen. Both models look identical, and there is very little on the torch to indicate which model it is.
While I see both models still listed on Carlisle's web site, I have not seen a pinpoint-flame model being offered anywhere. I had heard that Carlisle had dropped the pinpoint model, and is now making only the high-oxygen. It may be available only by special order.
All of the Mini CCs that I've seen have a brass body with the internal tube matrix made of stainless steel. I have not seen one with a stainless steel body.
The torch retails for $229, although I have seen it on sale as low as $189. The Crowley Marver is often included, which retails for an additional $79. So, the $299 price probably includes the optional Crowley Marver.

Thanks for that information Malcolm, and based on that I would have to say that our torch is the High oxy, I had thought the high oxy was a pinpoint.... maybe thats why they have dropped it, gets confusing.
We have the Crowley Marver and that is a very nice addition.

Thank you guys! I got a little confused when I went to Carlisle's site. Just tryin' to do all the research before I make the investment. A lot of people seem to be really happy with theirs. That means the most to me!

I have a mini cc and love it. I work with 2 oxycons and natural gas and it produces a nice hot flame. My mini cc is the wider bushy flame version.
Having said that, I just upgraded to the Hellcat and the only reason for that is that I want to do bigger projects.

I think about it a lot and then started to wonder about current marketing lingo and how there are more definitions and abbreviations since I completed my marketing degree all those years ago.
Thankfully, SWOTs, Marketing Mix and the 4 Ps are all still current/ valid but there is so much more, especially when you work in the field. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with as the most important and widely used, with a particular slant on metrics as this area seems to be where most the abbreviations fall.
A marketing campaign ‚Äì by definition ‚Äì is a set of activities within a timeframe, using multi-channels and methods to promote a particular service or product, for example in terms of B2B, a new service being offered so that businesses can measure the existing projects of that service in the pipeline/revenue, and then from promoting it from October 1st, how many more projects or revenue is being generated from four weeks of buzz around it. Maybe it‚Äôs a new coined phrase for your service? Or have you moved into a new revenue stream from making a particular product or buying out services from another firm?
Being ‚ÄòChannel agnostic‚Äô ‚Äì a slant on how to think about the customer journey, it‚Äôs not about the channel per se, but the communication received in whatever form by the customer when interacting with the brand or company. A business or brand communicates consistently and without preference to all channels, in the hope that consumer who sees the content become customers. In the B2C world, a brand seen to be ‚Äòchannel agnostic‚Äô will position themselves as believing they are customer-centric and the journey starting with them but shouldn‚Äôt that always be the case?
Digital communication evolves constantly but more recently it‚Äôs taken huge leaps, WhatsApp is no longer for just between friends etc. Digital is finally being considered within the marketing team‚Äôs job description instead of a separate department. Of course digital specialists exist, but the commerce or digital team should not be separated, they should be brought to the fore. Who are your digital gurus? Are their ideas at the start of your marketing and business development plans? Do you have SEO specialists on your books?

An article on how marketers should report marketing activity to CEOS stated that they care most about the ‚ÄòCAC‚Äô (Customer Acquisition Cost) which is‚Ä¶.

What about Share of Voice, what does that mean?
‚ÄúShare of voice is a marketing metric that helps your business determine how much exposure your brand is receiving. The primary goal of looking into your share of voice is to gain insight into the overall visibility of the brand. With that in mind, it‚Äôs also a useful marketing metric to utilize when conducting competitive analysis.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs an article on how to measure it (lots of other information out there!)
I saw a poll recently on LinkedIn that asked if I podded?! Its to do with conquering the LinkedIn algorithm ‚Äì we are all having our content filtered / manipulated so we only see the content from the people you engage with the most, so if you have a big family and always like their posts, you will probably only see the activity your family are up to, which personally, I find annoying. I‚Äôd like the news in chronological order from all my contacts please, not this filtered version which gives me a very slanted view.
Have you reported your MQLs or SQLs? These are Marketing or Sales Qualified Leads. Most of the time any business is excited about the prospect of a new project and getting proposals / quotes written and contracts drawn up so checking where or how the lead came from does not happen. It should! I always ask how did you find us or hear about us? Might sound obvious. Here‚Äôs a good article on the topic and includes info on lead scoring.

What Are The Child Custody Laws In Michigan?
Michigan follows The Michigan Child Custody Act. The Act lays out 12 factors for a court to consider when determining the best child custody arrangement. The court views these twelve factors in the view that the best interests of the child are served by having a relationship with both parents.
What Types Of Custody Arrangements Are There?
There are multiple types of custody arrangement such as:
- Legal custody: A legal custody gives the parent(s) the ability to make decisions about the child‚Äôs health care, education, and general welfare. If you are awarded sole custody, then you alone have the ability to make these decisions. If you are awarded joint custody, you must make these decisions with the child‚Äôs other parent.
- Physical custody: Physical custody is about where the child lives. If you have sole custody, then your child only lives with you. If you have joint custody then your child splits time between your home and the other parent‚Äôs home. A custody schedule will be worked out between you and your child‚Äôs other parent with the help of an attorney and a family law judge.
Who Gets Child Support?
Michigan courts take a formulaic approach to child support. Typically, among other factors, the court will take into account both parents‚Äô salaries and the amount of time the child spends at each parents‚Äô home. A court will likely award the parent of the home the child spends the most time at with child support to help with living expenses, food costs, and other child-rearing expenses.
What If I Am Awarded Full-Custody
If you are awarded sole custody, your child custody attorney, you, the judge, and the other parent will need to come up with a parenting schedule and visitation schedule. Under Michigan law, the child has a right to a relationship with his or her noncustodial parent. The parenting and visitation schedule will help you and the non-custodial parent determine when the child will see the non-custodial parent.

How Apple Attacked (and Marginalised) the Linux-powered WebOS
Summary: Professor Michael Risch talks about WebOS, responds to our criticism
There is a fascinating story about WebOS, the operating system built on Linux and optimised to work well on the Web, using some portable framework that is Web-compatible (a growing trend in SDKs). Apple‚Äôs devices are poor at Web browsing, so WebOS (now open source as we hoped but unfortunately patents-encumbered) and some platforms like Android, which now has Chrome, have had a huge potential for growth, mostly at Apple‚Äôs and Nokia‚Äôs expense. Android is well ahead of Apple in technical terms and ‚ÄúSamsung [is] Innovating Faster Than Apple‚Äù claims a minister. So anyway, after Apple threatened Palm with lawsuits [1, 2] we find out in Risch‚Äôs rant about the already-controversial SHIELD act that WebOS was derailed by Apple:.
Pamela Jones wrote: ‚ÄúApple did that? I didn‚Äôt know that. If so, then I spit in their general direction. I love WebOS, and Apple needs to cut it out. It can‚Äôt be the only tablet maker in the universe. The more they sue and threaten, the more determined I am never to buy anything from them again.‚Äù
Wired had Risch (prominent in the debate over patent trolls) as a guest in a debate full of lawyers whose opinions omit the obvious solution (here is
another recent example) and after our criticism of his suggestions he wrote to me to say: ‚ÄúThanks for reading, even if you don‚Äôt agree. I‚Äôm glad to hear that I‚Äôm even slightly controversial, as I usually see myself as plain vanilla.
‚ÄúI outside us was a bit surprised by your characterization of the op-ed, though. For one thing, I quote Stallman‚Äôs editorial. For another, my very first suggestion was: ‚Äù More patents should be rejected, and especially weak software patents. Limiting these should continue regardless of who ‚Äì troll or product company ‚Äì owns those patents.‚Äù I realize that this doesn‚Äôt go far enough for those who would abolish software patents, but it‚Äôs hardly a defense. Indeed, at least one person shared this sentiment as the takeaway from the op-ed on twitter. I actually had a lot more written about software patents, but they limited me to 1100 words, so anything not core to the primary argument got slashed ‚Äì so it goes.‚Äù
I replied by saying that ‚ÄúI do believe that we need to end software patents as a whole.‚Äù
‚ÄúI hear you,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI know a lot a people feel that way. Even though I disagree, at least that would be owner neutral!‚Äù
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a debate. Every debate has some factions on each side. Anup Malani, writing this paper about patents, says: ‚ÄúCounter-intuitively, we propose raising the stakes of patent litigation by providing enhanced rewards to victorious patent holders and imposing enhanced penalties on owners of patents that are invalidated at trial.‚Äù This is not the obvious solution, either. It evades the obvious fix which is related to scope, not legal action.
Stephen Ornes, a writer based in Nashville, Tennessee, wrote this article in the New Scientist yesterday. He opposes software patents on the ground that they are akin to patenting mathematics. To quote:
AT SOME point in their career every mathematician comes up against the question, is mathematics invented or discovered? The query makes some cranky. The answer doesn‚Äôt directly affect their work, after all, and the discussion often leads nowhere useful. Spending time debating the ultimate nature of mathematics takes away from actually doing it.
Some scholars take issue with the terms themselves. In his 2008 essay Mathematical Platonism and Its Opposites, Harvard University mathematician Barry Mazur called discovery and invention ‚Äúthose two too-brittle words‚Äù. One might be tempted to defuse the question altogether with a merger: perhaps maths involves inventing new relationships between things we have discovered.
It‚Äôs a metaphysical query, a nerdy way to ask whether or not some pre-existing truths underlie our existence. Here we bump up against theology. If mathematical ideas are discovered ‚Äì the Platonist position ‚Äì then a proof is a real-world encounter with an immortal truth. But then where, exactly, is this ethereal pool of truths? Did prime numbers exist before the big bang?
If, on the other hand, mathematics is invented, then proofs spring from human intelligence a bit like art or law. But then why do mathematicians across time and space always agree on what‚Äôs right and wrong?
The question about invention versus discovery flares up every few years, often in a different guise. The latest incarnation concerns something very down to earth: money. In this case, the discovery versus invention question has profound consequences. In fact, there may be no mathematical question with higher stakes. That‚Äôs because mathematics powers the algorithms that drive computer software, and software is big business, worth over $300 billion a year to the global economy.
If we start with the hypothesis that algorithms are reducible to maths ‚Äî which they are ‚Äî then it becomes apparent that the patent system is inherently broken in the scope sense. Talking about damages in litigation is not the point. We must identify and address root causes, not symptoms. ‚ñà

Having a logo is a crucial aspect for business branding. So its important to avoid logo design mistakes for any company. We should realize how important it is to have a good impact on the people we interact with. This is valid in the business as well.
So, why is this logo important? Since creates a good first impression and brand image, distinguishes you from competitors, it helps to establish brand loyalty. A logo will easily catch the interest of audiences and express the fundamental principles of a business fascinatingly. This allows customers to evaluate your business by its presence, so that will function to your benefit if you have a good logo to talk for your brand.
Not only logo, but also a well designed website or app is an integral part for your business. So, to enhance you business you should hire top website design companies who will provide you best services according to your requirement.
A unique logo design is perhaps the most recognizable part of a business. It is therefore extremely profitable to hire the best logo design firm to help meet the needs of your brand.
Below are 6 logo design mistakes that should be prevented by logo design firms or designers to produce a good and professional logo.
6 Logo Design Mistakes That Should Be Prevented
#1. Bad choice of font
Once it comes to designing a logo, choosing the correct font is the most critical choice a designer can make. Bad use of font would indicate either the message would not hit the audience, or that they would get an incorrect message. The font chosen must represent the characteristics of the logo, otherwise, the meaning of the brand would be fumbled.
Every font and typeface have their personality. You should choose the correct font personality for your business logo. Finding the right font for your logo is all about matching the font to the icon style. Spend some time studying the different fonts that suit the company‚Äôs theme. Seek to be innovative and come out with something that fits your needs.

#2. Highly Complex
Your logo can be used in many contexts, in many mediums and various sizes. If your logo is too complex, it won‚Äôt be made well in smaller sizes. When it‚Äôs so familiar, it‚Äôs not going to be recognizable enough to draw notice. The more complex the logo is, the more details the audience has to absorb. A logo can be iconic, and one of the easiest ways to make it unforgettable is to keep it simple. A clear and simple logo can be quickly replicated in any size.
#3. Copied Design
As already stated, the logo intends to represent a company. When it looks the same as someone else‚Äôs, it has failed to achieve so. Copying the others does not benefit either, neither the customer nor the maker.
Using a logo that looks identical to the logo of another organization will hinder the marketing efforts. Not only is it unethical, but you‚Äôll also be found on sooner or later. If your logo is too similar to your competitor‚Äôs, you‚Äôll be opening up for competition with other brands. Make sure to test your nearest rivals immediately.

#4. Use of Raster Images
When creating a logo, you must use a vector graphics system such as Adobe Illustrator and Corel Draw to establish consistency in all mediums and sizes. Many designers use its alternate form which is raster graphics. Using raster images for logos is not recommended since it may cause replication problems. If you zoom in on a raster graphic, it looks pixelated, making it unreadable. Maintaining visual continuity by ensuring that the logo looks the same in all sizes is important. This is more important than ever to ensure the logos are displayed properly on various devices. Avoiding raster images can let users see your logo on whatever screen they use.
#5. Poor Color Combination
Finding the correct combination of color in the logo can be just as important as selecting the right font. Choosing color would be the last resort, and it‚Äôs best to continue operating in black and white. The easiest way to prevent this is to skip colors at first. You should start the logo design in black and white first to focus on the idea and its presentation.
As a designer, you need to pick colors that resonate with the personality and core message of the brand.

#6. Following Trends
Some of the errors most artists make is to create a logo that is focused on recent trends. Don‚Äôt adhere to the current trends as if it‚Äôs the only way to design your logo. The logo design of a brand is its signature mark and needs to be timeless because if it is built according to trends, it can quickly begin to look old because of clich√©. When creating a logo, depending so heavily on these patterns may do more harm than good to the company.
Instead, seek to concentrate on the visual identity of the company and what message has to be passed on to the customers regarding the company‚Äôs goals and image.
Conclusion
Designing the best logo for your company will make you feel frustratingly arbitrary. From your model colors to typeface, make sure you have a professional visual identity.There‚Äôs Never A Good Reason To Put Microtransactions in a $60, Singleplayer Game
For better or worse, microtransactions are a permanent facet of the gaming industry. Despite the optimism of some consumers, who assumed they‚Äôd be used sparingly, responsibly, and limit themselves to free-to-purchase titles, it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôve overtaken the market.
Now, microtransactions aren‚Äôt inherently a bad thing. In ‚Äúfree-to-play‚Äù games, they‚Äôre used in place of a traditional purchase price. In multiplayer games, they can help fund ongoing updates, and allow the developers to support a game long after it‚Äôs released.
But that‚Äôs not the world we live in. The industry is completely incapable of moderation, entirely devoid of shame or self-reflection. They took what could have been a revolutionary pricing model and corrupted it into the nickel-and-dime, casino-style scam we know today.
But most concerning is when microtransactions end up in singleplayer, full-priced games. These aren‚Äôt games that require ongoing support at high costs. These aren‚Äôt free games that need an additional source of revenue. These are games we purchase for $60, with the expectation that they‚Äôll be more or less complete.
Put simply, there‚Äôs never a good reason to put microtransactions in a full-priced singleplayer game. It‚Äôs never good for the consumer, and yet I‚Äôm stunned at the amount of people that defend this practice. In this article, I want to dispel the most common myths I see about microtransactions. I want to take the very arguments I‚Äôve seen from publishers and consumers alike, and explain why they‚Äôre nonsense.
So, what‚Äôs wrong with microtransactions in $60 games? Why shouldn‚Äôt we accept them as a permanent facet of the industry? What‚Äôs wrong with the arguments supporting this practice? Well, let‚Äôs take a look!
‚ÄúJust ignore them‚Äù
This is the most common, and most easily defeated argument I‚Äôve seen. On the surface, it makes sense. Most microtransactions come in the form of items already available in the game or serve to speed you through the gameplay toward an individual goal. Loot boxes, for example, are a glorified form of gambling that allows you to spend money for the chance to get a useful item without earning it through the gameplay. This type of microtransaction has become increasingly popular over the years, and many defend them because you don‚Äôt need to use them to enjoy the game. According to this argument, so long as the item is available in the game, or has no effect on the gameplay, then why should we care if you can buy them?
Well, whenever we talk about microtransactions, it‚Äôs important to keep two things in mind:
- They wouldn‚Äôt have made these microtransactions if they didn‚Äôt expect people to buy them.
- They wouldn‚Äôt expect people to buy them if they thought they didn‚Äôt have value.
With this in mind, consider the following: If there‚Äôs value in skipping content, or fast-tracking the player through the gameplay, then it‚Äôs probably not good gameplay. If anything, the gameplay is likely designed around these microtransactions, forcing the player to grind through boring, repetitive tasks, or spend a few bucks to get what they want immediately. Sure, this isn‚Äôt always the case, but the sheer nature of business incentivizes companies to do this. They wouldn‚Äôt be doing their job if they didn‚Äôt try, in some way, to urge you to buy their product.
There Are Better Ways To Serve The Consumer
Another facet of this argument is the idea that microtransactions aren‚Äôt designed for ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù players; they‚Äôre for people who want an easier experience or are having trouble beating the game. In an interview with Eurogamer, Bob Roberts had this to say on the microtransactions in SHADOW OF WAR:
‚Äú‚Ä¶it‚Äôs there as a player choice. It‚Äôs there, from my perspective, for people who are protective of their spare time and scared when a massive game comes along that they‚Äôre not getting to see the full experience.‚Äù
This statement is nonsense and a massive lie of omission. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with players who want an easier experience, or just want to feel powerful, but microtransactions aren‚Äôt the only way to achieve this. Remember difficulty levels? Or cheats? I swear, it‚Äôs like the publishers think we have the memory of a goldfish.
They honestly think we‚Äôll believe they‚Äôre doing us a favor by nickel-and-diming us. They truly believe we‚Äôve forgotten the very things they‚Äôre trying to sell us used to be free.
Put simply, a publisher isn‚Äôt going to charge you for something they don‚Äôt think you want. So, if it‚Äôs possible to completely ignore the microtransactions, then they serve no purpose to anyone. Anything useful to the player can more easily be achieved for free.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Just Cosmetic‚Äù
This is the most infuriating argument of all, as it generalizes gamers and invalidates the tastes of others. Often, games will lock ‚Äúflavor‚Äù items like toys, appearances, and other features that don‚Äôt affect the gameplay behind a paywall. The argument here is that if it doesn‚Äôt affect your ability to fight, navigate, or solve problems, then it‚Äôs not important. Well like I said before: if these items had no value they wouldn‚Äôt be selling them; clearly, they matter to someone.
People play games for different reasons. Some people just want to shoot monsters. Some want to explore to a unique environment. Others want to engage with a compelling story, to immerse themselves in a virtual world. You can‚Äôt place an objective value on any of this.
All that fun, ‚Äúuseless,‚Äù ‚Äúflavor‚Äù content serves to make the game more diverse, enjoyable, and immersive for many gamers. For some, atmosphere and immersion are just as important as pure gameplay. Cosmetics, in particular, can enhance a gamer‚Äôs experience. They can be a sign of hard work, a sign of experience and status among your peers. They can be a memento of past experiences, a reward for completing a difficult task. Cosmetics are often rare collectibles earned by exploring every nook and cranny of the game-world. All of this is lost when you lock them behind a paywall.
Where This Argument Takes Us
Look at a game like WORLD OF WARCRAFT for example. There‚Äôs a small cash shop, but the vast majority of ‚Äúflavor‚Äù items like mounts, cool-looking gear and ‚Äútoy‚Äù items are earned in the game itself. There are 343 free mounts and, thousands of pets, and countless unique pieces of gear. Many of these are difficult to find or require a large amount of time and skill to acquire. They‚Äôre an integral part of the game, even if they have no effect on the actual gameplay.
Can you imagine a world where every mount beyond a basic horse was locked behind a paywall? Can you imagine if a weapon‚Äôs appearance could only be unlocked with a $0.99 purchase? It would strip away a huge part of the game‚Äôs identity: earning cool and strange new items and the feeling of satisfaction you get showing them off.
Now, the obvious counter-argument here is that WORLD OF WARCRAFT is a subscription-style MMO. In one way or another, you‚Äôre paying for these items. But you‚Äôre not paying for cosmetics alone. You‚Äôre paying for servers, regular updates, and more content than several games combined. It‚Äôs this sense of value that AAA publishers are missing.
‚ÄúPublishers Are Too Poor To Make Games Without Microtransactions‚Äù
Never believe a word of this. The cry of poverty is the biggest lie of all.
The majority of American game companies are making millions dodging taxes. I have a hard time believing they‚Äôre too poor to make games without double or triple dipping.
If companies are losing money, then it‚Äôs because of their over-bloated budgets and hilarious lack of business acumen. We‚Äôre living in an age where every big budget game can decimate a company if it doesn‚Äôt make massive profits. Publishers will accept nothing less than exponential profits, and that leads to the overpriced, over-produced, underdeveloped games we see again and again. The cost for ‚Äúfailure‚Äù is so high because of their own actions. These bloated budgets necessitate the predatory behavior we see in the industry. Poor budgeting means every game could be their last.
They have no one to blame but themselves
Some would argue this is the player‚Äôs fault, that our demands and expectations are forcing publishers to spend so much.
Quite frankly, this is bullshit.
The publishers created this market. Players demand realistic graphics and the biggest worlds because the publishers told us that‚Äôs what matters. Because it‚Äôs the one piece of quality, they told us to demand. It‚Äôs basic marketing. For better or worse, we‚Äôve come to expect this from the AAAs, and anything less is seen as yet another insult to the consumer. At the same time, we‚Äôve seen that games don‚Äôt need photorealistic graphics or superior technology to be successful. So even if they couldn‚Äôt make games without nickel-and-diming us (they can), it‚Äôs on them and their shoddy business practices.
If these companies were honest, they‚Äôd just come out and say what they really think, ‚ÄúWe want more of your money.‚Äù It‚Äôs a less defensible position, but I could respect it more.
The Point
The overuse of microtransactions is one of the most pressing issues in the industry. As bad as it‚Äôs gotten lately, it‚Äôs clear this is just the beginning. Companies like Bethesda, WB, 2K, and countless others are testing the waters. They want to see how much they can get away with.
They‚Äôre testing their boundaries and the limits of consumer patience. At what point do we respond? At what point does the market falter, as sales decrease and games collapse under the weight of their own greed? I don‚Äôt know, but the market can‚Äôt sustain itself like this. One way or another, we‚Äôre going to reach a breaking point, and I hope it happens sooner rather than later.

Relearning Jesus‚Ä¶
Take a moment and mull over what Jesus is saying to the increasingly larger crowd gathering about Him (Luke 11.29a). Speaking of his own generation (of those gathering around him) he labels them evil. In Matthews retelling of the same event he adds another colorful adjective to describe his contemporaries; ‚Äúadulterous‚Äù (Matt 12.39).
A Needed Smack‚Ä¶
Kind of smacks in the face of the stereotypical version of Jesus paraded around in our time, doesn‚Äôt it? Lowly Jesus, meek and mild Jesus, kindly and somewhat beggarly Jesus, Jesus who is all about love and never has a harsh word to say, Jesus who desires all to come to Him and be saved. The Jesus of today is never sarcastic, never mean, never harsh or bold. The Jesus of today surely wouldn‚Äôt call people evil or wicked or adulterous (i.e., whorish)! I have a word for this version of Evangelical consensus: Bologna!
And yet, biblical testimony says something else entirely. Though Jesus was surely all those wonderful things that we love to spout in order to gain a hearing from the world around us, He was also those things that learned men and women get red faced over. He says and does things that professing believers shake their head at and say, ‚ÄúThat just seems so out of character of the Jesus I know.‚Äù That‚Äôs because the Jesus many profess to know is a 1960‚Äôs flower child and not the Holy of Holies in the flesh.
The fact is very simple, there is a time and a place for everything under the sun (cf. Eccl 3.1-8) And this includes a time for stiff rebuke, for calling things what they are without giving a million qualifications so people aren‚Äôt butt hurt. Lord knows getting struck on the behind is a form of abuse that should never be done by a parent. Let alone by the Sovereign God over all creation. Ahh‚Ä¶wait a minute‚Ä¶nope that‚Äôs wrong God does sharply rebuke, He does smite us when because we deserve it, and willfully wounds our precious self-esteem (a.k.a., pride).
His Reason‚Ä¶
Jesus calls those gathered around them evil, unfaithful whores, but He doesn‚Äôt leave it at that‚Ä¶He gives them the reason: ‚Äú‚Ä¶an evil generation‚Ä¶seeks for a sign.‚Äù That is to say, wicked people demand proof! This may seem a bit extreme to our ears, but context is everything. The truth is that Jesus had already given the people (religious leaders and common folk) plenty of signs (what we would call evidences).
Three Types‚Ä¶
In Luke 11 and Matthew 12 Jesus has just healed a demon possessed person. This caused the people ‚Äúto marvel‚Äù (Luke 11.14). Not all in a good way, for ‚Äúsome of them said, ‚ÄòHe casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons,‚Äô while others, to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven‚Äù (Luke 11.15-16; italics mine). Essentially there were three responses to the evidence that Jesus provided that day of His deity, His anointed status. The first one is not mentioned, it is belief. Only those that were numbered among the faithful would have believed what they had witnessed and not assumed it was a parlor trick. The second group accused Jesus of being in league with Satan, who they assumed was the master of this Nazarene‚Äôs house (i.e., life). The third group wanted more signs to test him (i.e., to judge the validity of Jesus‚Äô claims).
In vv. 17-26 the Lord rebukes group #2. He calls their logic into question stating that a divided house by its very nature will not stand. He then challenges them to see that what they are witnessing is not the power of the devil, but ‚Äúthe finger of God‚Äù (Luke 11.20). In short, they are seeing a demonstration of God‚Äôs dominion exercised through the rightful king over all creation (cf. Psa 5.2; 10.16)‚Äîincluding demonic forces.
The second half of v. 29 provides Jesus‚Äô response to group #3. We shouldn‚Äôt assume that group #3 is only made up of common folk and not the leaders in Israel, for later on in His ministry we find that the religious leaders wanted the same thing as those found here in Luke 11:16 (see Matt 16.4). The request made by group #3 is rooted in a desire to ‚Äútest‚Äù Jesus.
A Wrong Assumption‚Ä¶
Why is that important for the reader to note? Because some reading such things assume that a request for evidences, proofs, or signs by the skeptic (i.e., the unbeliever) is innocent or perhaps even academic. That is to say, they are just trying to learn the truth. Of course, this assumption is driven by the idea that when it comes to evidence people are neutral. However, the desire to ‚Äútest‚Äù a claim is an instance of no-neutrality, for that person(s) assumes the authority of a judge. They believe that they are capable of judging (discerning) the validity and/or veracity of the evidence, sign or proof before them.
But Jesus knowing what is in their heart‚Äôs cuts to the chase (Luke 11.17). And so, when he rebukes group #2 a woman cheers the Lord on from the crowd (evidently, she was a member of group #3) saying to Him: ‚ÄúBlessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!‚Äù (Luke 11.27). He immediately responds, ‚ÄúBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!‚Äù (Luke 11.28; italics mine). Which brings us to the last point Jesus makes to those listening.
The Sign or Evidence‚Ä¶
Remember, He has called them evil and He has based His judgment on their seeking a sign from Him. He‚Äôs already done plenty of things that verify His personal claims of being; of who He really is. And yet, the people don‚Äôt believe. They say, ‚ÄúWe need more evidence!‚Äù Jesus responds, ‚Äúyou shall have none!‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶No sign will be given to [this generation] except the sign of Jonah‚Äù (11.29c).
Obviously, we find ourselves on the horn of another question: ‚ÄúWhat is the sign of Jonah?‚Äù What evidence did Jonah present to the Ninevites when preached to them? Allow me to shorten your inquiry and keep you from hopping down numerous rabbit trails, ending up at the wrong destination. Jesus says that the sign of Jonah is‚Ä¶‚Äù Jonah‚Äù (Luke 11.30).
What it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
It says nothing about Jonah in the belly of a fish for three days. That was a sign of judgment against Jonah for disobedience. A reminder to Jonah the prophet who the Lord of his life truly is. A sign to Jonah of God‚Äôs mercy (he deserved to die for rebelling) and of blessing/life (the reward of obedience).
Fanciful conjecture is unneeded at this point, and to be frank unwanted. The context of Luke 11 and the words of Jesus provide all the information we need to ascertain the meaning of the sign of Jonah that is promised to this evil, whorish generation. The sign of Jonah, which is Jonah, that was given to Nineveh was this: ‚ÄúYet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!‚Äù (Jon 3.4). This is the message that God had given His prophet to preach (Jon 3.2).
Remember what Jesus said to the woman who yelled out to Him:
‚ÄúBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!‚Äù (Luke 11.28).
Jesus is the Same Sign‚Ä¶
Jonah preached bad news to the Ninevites. Their only hope was to believe the message (God‚Äôs Word) and turn from their wicked ways (i.e., repent). From the moment Jesus stepped into His ministry role, after His baptism by John, He preached the same sort of message to His generation: ‚ÄúThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel‚Äù (Mark 1.15; Matt 4.17). Jesus‚Äô teaching and word possessed authority (Luke 4.32), the kind of power that could drive Satan and his little minions from where they were entrenched (Luke 4.35; 11.14). Those to whom the Lord proclaimed the Word of God were presented with one hope: believe the message, repent of their rebellion and live. If they refused to do so they would die in their sins (John 8.24). Thus, Jesus is the same type of sign as Jonah (Luke 11.30b).
The Demand and Unfortunate Response by some‚Ä¶
Recently I read an atheist‚Äôs comments that in the Bible Jesus provided evidence, God provided evidence, but Christians today do not provide evidence. Such individuals speak as if they just ‚Äúsee‚Äù the evidence, then they will believe the message. This attitude is precisely the same one that Jesus faced, rebuked and condemned. Some well-intentioned, but misguided Christians today assume that they must submit to these demands from unbelievers for signs, proofs, and evidences in order for the unbelievers to ‚Äútest‚Äù them.
Problematic Concerns‚Ä¶
Two problems are apparent with such an approach. First, it establishes a precedent that Scripture denies‚Äîit places man in the judgment seat and God in the dock (to borrow from C. S. Lewis). Second, it assumes that when it comes to evidences that people are neutral and given enough, we might push the unbeliever over the edge into belief.
Sin is more than outward actions like picking a fruit from a forbidden tree and eating it. Sin is rooted in the heart/mind of man. That‚Äôs what Jesus said. He also said that if people won‚Äôt believe God‚Äôs Word, then they won‚Äôt believe outward signs either (cf. Luke 11.28-30; 16.31).
I have heard far too many atheists and agnostics say that if God would do some miracle they would believe. They say this mockingly against the Christian faith. For in the next breath, when pressed, they will admit that even if they saw something, they‚Äôd still probably doubt the God of the Bible. Anthony Flew who eventually changed his mind saying that there must be something out there that brought things into being, also said that he did not entertain, nor did he want to do so, the possibility that the Christian God is the one at back of it all.
As for evidences‚Ä¶
For the devout unbeliever who says that there is no evidence for the Christian faith, or not enough evidence for the Christian faith, I will offer the following response. Yes, there is. The evidence of the Creator is all around you. The evidence of the biblical God‚Äôs existence is clearly perceived both in supernatural revelation and what is often termed natural revelation. Every believer whose life has been radically changed from a hater of God to a lover of God is positive proof. Every babe born. Every cell replication. Every breath that you draw in your lungs is sufficient proof for the existence of God. Your own conscience, your desire for justice and righteousness, and your want of love and goodness (among other things) are expressions of having been specially made in the image of the God you strongly detest.
We all live in the same world. We all have access to the same evidences. The only reason we see things differently is that our starting points are different. We view the same evidences through different sets of lenses.
The question that ought to drive us, that needs to be entertained although is sadly often ignored is this: Which view of reality gives meaning and purpose to life and the values we hold dear? The Christian worldview alone provides consistent, non-arbitrary grounds for all of life. The Christian worldview alone provides the necessary preconditions that make knowledge possible.
Where it starts‚Ä¶
Belief starts not with evidences, but with the Word of God that makes sense of them (Rom 10.17; 1Cor 2.14-16). So, with two, I leave you:
 12.28-30)

‚Äú‚Ä¶the Scriptures‚Ä¶bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life‚Äù (John 5.39, 40).
ENDNOTES:
[i] All Scripture unless otherwise noted shall be of the English Standard Version (ESV).GUILT AND SHAME:
So, you have guilt or shame ... two complex feelings that are difficult to understand and solve. We'll give you some of the best solutions we've encountered in our decades of doing psychotherapy. None of our solutions, however, are to take the place of a live person talking with you until the gloom lifts. Still, there is much that can be communicated by print and, perhaps, you will find an answer that will be freeing.
Let's first distinguish between real guilt and self-imposed guilt. Real guilt means that you purposefully hurt someone or the possessions of someone and feel sorry for doing that. Real guilt ranges from murder and rape on through various sex acts upon innocents to the various misdemeanors outlined by societies. Self-imposed guilt refers to non-criminal matters where a person has decided that they should have done something but didn't, or did something that may have caused hurt to someone else. Thus, self-imposed guilt means that a person has a measure of mind-reading going on, a mental guess that an action, thought, or even word caused harm to another. This could even range to the point where, as a child, you were playing as a child when someone else got hurt (or maybe even died). As a result, you turned on yourself with blame.
REAL GUILT: FORM ONE
We'll provide a number of solutions for the second form of guilt later. Now let's deal with intentional hurt you did to someone else. It could be a moment of rage or a planned pain, but your mind has begun to haunt you that what you did was not acceptable - not only by the society but by your own self-appraisal. The great book on this subject is Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevski. The leading character, Raskolnikov, kills and old woman and is hounded in his own mind for what he did. If you read that book, be sure and follow up by reading a second book that gives a better solution than the one of Dostoevski: Victor Hugo's Les Miserables . The hero of that book, Jean Valjean, learns to give, love, and spend a life of service. Hugo's solution will not be improved upon. If you have done purposeful harm to another at one point in your life, the answer to assuage your guilt will be some form of giving to others, concentration upon loving deeds, and spending your life helping others. This does not mean occasional. It means full devotion.
REAL GUILT: FORM TWO
While this form of `real' guilt is debatable, the fact remains that many think it should fall under that category. This is where a child is taking care of a younger sibling and the younger one gets hurt. For instance, at age five Billy was given care of his younger brother at a mountain cabin during the winter. His mother went into town for supplies.While she was gone, the eighteen month old baby crawled up by the open fireplace with his blankie in tow. The blanket was highly flammable. He caught on fire and, in his panic, fell into the flames. When the mother returned, Billy was happily playing in a different room. She discovered her charred child in the fireplace. To cover up her own mistake of having left a five year old to tend an eighteen month old, the mother attacked Billy verbally, blamed him, and continued to mistreat him until he left home at age eighteen. While we, the authors, think fault lies elsewhere, thirteen years of mental brain-washing by his mother left Billy mentally unbalanced. The condemning voice of his mother haunted his unconscious mind.
The solution of the Billy Problem is that he must learn to give his mother back her guilt and not carry it for her. In addition, he must realize that what he did was what five year olds do: lose themselves in play. If he still carries a form of guilt response where he thinks himself at fault, he may have to concentrate upon giving to others, doing loving deeds, and maybe even live a life of service. This last step, though filled with the grandiosity of five year old thinking that he is ultimately responsible, may still be the only solution for some. Only time will tell. We prefer that the person give the ultimate responsibility back to his mom and to re-gain some of the natural playing ability of a young child who deserves childhood.
THE HINGE FOR UNDERSTANDING GUILT
By now you may have realized that the word `Guilt' refers to an internal process, usually auditory, where a person does some form of self-abuse. The internal process is usually auditory, in the sense that a person talks to him/herself - usually just below the level of consciousness. In Billy's case, his mother's words are carried on the equivalent of a tape machine and he played her words over and over to himself. Sometimes the person's internal condemning voice happens to be a father, an older sibling, or even a self-generated harsh voice. Upon occasion, a person mentally sees a picture over and over again, say, in Billy's case the charred remains of his little brother. That picture is just out of consciousness, also.
After identifying the process by which a person 'guiltifies' within, the therapeutic task is set. Either the dialog must be destroyed or the picture removed. There are many methods of doing this and we shall list some now: write the internal dialog down and lampoon each side of the debate by yelling it aloud in a staccato manner; change each of the voices repeatedly - in an operatic voice, for instance; put the voices to music such as `I ain't nothing but a hound dog' or some other Elvis song; have two of your friends take each part and argue it out in a soap opera fashion while you watch; study the information provided in this paper over and over again.
If there is a haunting picture just out of consciousness and you have now brought it to consciousness, several options come forth: Install in that picture you, as a grown-up caring person, loving the child within who saw the grossness; change the internal picture by surrendering the deceased to the care of God; ask within the picture that the deceased give you a blessing of forgiveness; take the horrific that you see and put it in your favorite spot of nature; and return to the picture and fill it with answers.
THE LARGER PROCESS OF GUILT
There can be a much larger process occurring devoid of any single tragic scene. What may be transpiring is an internal dialog with a mother or a father that took place over the duration of childhood. For instance, Mary's mother was deep into a self-sacrificing religion and programmed her daughter throughout the years of dependency. The mother scolded Mary all day long, all childhood long. You should cook, clean, wash, and serve the man. The mother's voice was installed in Mary's brain/mind. As an adult living in a different house from her mother, Mary was bound internally by the voice of her mother. Each time she started to do something for herself, she was hounded internally with the words `pride goeth before a fall'.
If the voice cannot be changed by one of the previously given auditory techniques, it is probably wise to change this through psychotherapy sessions. Make sure you pick a therapist who knows how to do this, possibly someone from a gestalt or Transactional Analysis background. You want to accomplish the shrinking of the paternal presence and enlarge your thinking and acting options as a grown-up. Incidentally, but not unimportantly, you want to free up your personality so you can play, laugh, sing, and enjoy life. Mary, for instance, needs to become a liberated woman who can think, act, feel, and live a self-programmed existence. She needs to learn that playing freely is one of her rights. If she decides from her grown-up analysis of life that she wants to cook, clean, wash and have a partner, then that's a different matter.
When you begin to understand the larger process of guilt, you have crossed a line of ordinary understanding. Most people do not know that the brain/mind houses childhood brainwashings. To diminish the internal voice and the model provided by the parents takes some doing.
RE-PROGRAMMING THE UNCONSCIOUS
Okay. By now you understand that you may be chewing on a larger problem: how to get your mom and dad out of your head. You do not want to be an automaton in life following the programmed instructions of a previous generation who tells you how to think, be, work, feel, live. You do not want to end up having simply been a copy of your mom or dad. You are sick of having an internal dialog with a sibling (two and a half years of age when you were born) who wished that you had not been born and would shrivel up and die. In other words, you want to become your own boss inside your skull.
Besides longterm talking with a therapist, there is a procedure that therapists use that can be done - if you feel strong enough to do it by yourself. It is called, by Gestaltists,The Two Chair. Place two chairs facing each other. In one chair you place your mom, dad (or older sibling) - or whatever voice that continues in your mind. You then video or tape record the exchange as you go through a typical scene. Be very objective as you analyze your audio or visual production. You may want to exaggerate these as you go along.
With the basic ideas listed so far, you will have a head start in ridding yourself of guilt. Let's turn to shame.
SHAME
Guilt refers to something done or not done; shame has to do with a person's body and being. In other words, a person thinks there is something wrong with their very being. If, as a child, you has allergies and your mother scolded you, there would be guilt. If,as a child you had allergies and the kids ridiculed and avoided you, then shame would probably result. It is, as is said in Transactional Analysis, a sense that `I'm not OK - You're OK'.
Classically, shame results from a repetitive scene. It could be a father's drunken displays, a mother's enormous obesity as she hung out the clothes on the line, a child's crippled legs, a nose considered ugly, a size thought of as small. Clear cases of shame result from sexual, physical, emotional or even religious abuse. This is not to say that the child should take on the issue of someone else; it is to regretfully admit that many people walk around thinking their very person is evil due to what adults did to them. A relative may have crossed the ethical line and played with the child sexually. A father may have worked out his own frustration at life by beating his children. A child may have been considered illegitimate, weak, stupid, or profane by a parent and humiliated accordingly. A parent may have brain-washed a child by inculcating negative religious thoughts of sinfulness.
No matter the source: shame is in the person. Yes, matter the source! Madder the source. The job of caretakers is to nurture and give options, not abuse and take away rejoicing. One way out of the pit of shame is to name the abuser, be angry at the beater, feel out the rage at the emotional mistreatment, and shun the fundamentalists who taught such rigid self-hate. Anger and even rage, boiling out of the unconscious, needs to be legitimated. If parents install such self-loathing in a person, that parent needs to be hauled to the bar of emotional judgement and dealt with.
Anger, how ever and how deep, though, can take us only so far. What has to be understood is that you, the shame-bearer, are actually carrying the feelings of the abuser. In other words, you are still acting out the failures of a previous generation. You must divorce that generation in order to be free. There is no substitute for this. If you carry the shame, you are carrying someone else's problem! Not yours. Your body is okay, your soul beautiful, and your life your own. No amount of your own pain will assuage the true guilt of those who put off their problems on you. There is no true vicarious option: it is all grandiosity.
In other words, you must refuse at the level of your own being, to carry another's failed life. If that means surrendering your genetic forebears and embracing humanity and other life forms, so be it. If that means moving away from a family that continues emotional abuse, that too must be carried out. The idea is simple and profound at the same time: you must not carry a previous generation's problems.
The grand way to free yourself happens to be modeling of others. After all, if your original copies were invalid, you can use the same mechanism of copying in terms of great examples. This does not mean a simple studying of people you admire. It means that you systematically incorporate their personality into yours. You may spend the day - without others being aware of it - thinking, talking, and acting like your new role model. This procedure must be done repeatedly until the copy has taken, which is to say that your acting has become your reality. You may want to read Hawthorne's The Great Stone Face, a story that reveals the process.Balancing life is tricky and is something most of us are actively trying to achieve. Rather than the constant juggle between the different areas in our lives, we‚Äôre trying to balance it and make sacrifices at our own choosing‚Äîincluding the choice to change careers.
If we‚Äôre all honest with ourselves, many would agree that finding the balance between the different areas in our lives takes practice. One interesting tool to help evaluate and experiment with the balance in your life is called Four Circles. Created by Total Leadership, Four Circles is a tool that helps people evaluate the different areas in their lives, compare them, and experiment with different ways to find more balance and compatibility between the different areas.
Created by Stew Friedman in 1984, Four Circles evaluates the main areas of a person‚Äôs life that includes work, home, community, and private self. By using the tool, people can evaluate these four areas by comparing the size and position of each circle. Ideally, by examining each of the four circles, people can create goals and experiment with each area to create mutual value among all of them.
Here‚Äôs an overview of how Four Circles by Total Leadership works:
- Step One: You create your personal Four Circles picture. Together, the circles must equal 100 percent. You add or decrease the value of each circle based on what is most important to you. Then you move each of your circles in relation to how compatible each of them are, with closer and overlapping circles being more compatible than circles not touching.
- Step Two: Now you view your completed Four Circles picture and reflect on its meaning. Are there areas of your life that you want to increase or decrease? Perhaps you need to make certain areas more compatible with each other to find work-life balance.
- Step Three: Now that you know where you want to change, you set goals for yourself that will help you achieve your ideal Four Circles picture. These goals will help you resize the different areas of your life and also work to make them more compatible.
- Step Four: This step is optional, as you do not have to share with others. However, you may share your Four Circles picture and thoughts through social media or email with those you would like feedback or advice from.
Through the Four Circles tool, balancing life can turn something abstract into something more visual with concrete goals. You can assess your four domains to figure out if they are in harmony or conflict, then address the problem areas. Rather than continuing to juggle the different areas, you can balance and make them more compatible with clear, direct, and actionable goals.

Having an eco-conscious lifestyle doesn‚Äôt mean you always have to compromise, especially when it comes to your health. With cleanliness and sanitation at the forefront of everyone‚Äôs minds, we wanted to share our DIY eco-friendly hand sanitiser recipe with you.
Ingredients
- 1 part aloe vera gel
- 2 parts 99% rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol)*
- Essential oils (optional) - You only need to use a few drops. Essential oils we love to use that have anti-bacterial properties are; tea tree oil, anise oil or rosemary oil. Please make sure you test your skin for sensitivities first before using it in this recipe.
Tools
- Container with lid, something that won‚Äôt leak like a repurposed glass bottle with a screw-top lid.
- Funnel (optional)
- Bowl
- Spoon or something to stir with
Method
- Combine the aloe vera gel and rubbing alcohol together, until it becomes fluffy
- Add a few drops of essential oils (optional)
- Using a funnel or spoon add the hand sanitiser into your container, make sure the container has a secure, leakproof lid.
To use your hand sanitiser, apply a small pea-size amount to your hands and rub together until dry. Keep your hand sanitiser out of reach of children and please remember, while hand sanitiser is a great tool to use while out and about, its no substitute for properly washing your hands with soap and warm water, as directed by a physician. *For hand sanitiser to be effective, it needs to contain at least 60 percent alcohol, according to health organisations.

Other Worlds Are Possible: Life Against and Beyond Neoliberal Logics
Middletown, CT, United States; Oaxaca, Mexico
A Wesleyan faculty-led program with Professor Anu Sharma () and Gustavo Esteva, Universidad de la Tierra () This four-week intensive course examines radical challenges, in theory and on the ground, to mainstream neoliberal capitalism and development strategies promoted by international organizations such as World Bank and the IMF. After the 1980s, considered by many as ‚Äúthe lost decade‚Äù of development, some scholars and practitioners declared the development enterprise as fundamentally wrong: It was a misguided and violent neocolonial project that could never provide the answer to inequality and poverty. These radical critics argued for building a ‚Äúpost-development‚Äù era. In this course, we look at the conceptual history of the term ‚Äúpost-development‚Äù and also examine what post-development life looks like on the ground, among dispossessed communities. We will focus on lived and imagined challenges to neoliberal capitalism. We spend the first week at Wesleyan, brushing up on the critical ideas and movements that have emerged out of Mexico (and Latin America, broadly) over the past four decades in reaction to mainstream development discourse. We will then explore these ideas and lived alternatives in Oaxaca, Mexico. We will spend three weeks learning about and working with marginalized communities that are rejecting capitalist development and building and experimenting with living a ‚Äúgood life‚Äù (buen vivir) on their own terms.
Application and deposit due by March 8. Current sophomores and juniors may apply. Limited financial aid is available for this program.

A random attack. A brutal killing. A community shaken. And everything changed

Print:
On a crisp winter day in early March, seven-year-old Zrav bounces from a swing into his parents‚Äô arms. The whirlwind of kids at Galloway Park on Burke Mountain does little to tame the boy‚Äôs affection for his two dads, Irshad Abdulla and Vishad Deeplaul. He runs to them, hugs them, seemingly unaware his family makeup may not be the same as those of the other children climbing and jumping and sliding.
The Coquitlam boy also knows next to nothing about the role he played in a historic court decision on a continent far away, how his life set off a legal battle that would cut to the very core of the South African constitution.
Abdulla and Deeplaul first started dating in Pietermaritzburg, the capital of South Africa‚Äôs KwaZulu-Natal province. It was 2003, six years after then-president Nelson Mandela pushed through what many considered the most progressive constitution in the world.
Old apartheid-era laws that banned homosexuality under punishment of prison were struck down and a country that long carried the mantle of subjugation embraced gay pride, incorporating the rainbow into the national flag.
From the beginning, their relationship closely traced the footsteps of one legal milestone after another: Abdulla and Deeplaul got married in 2010, a few years after gay marriage was made legal and the same year that surrogate parents got full legal protection.
By then, Deeplaul was running the family‚Äôs event planning business and Abdulla was working full-time at the state IT corporation. That‚Äôs when the couple decided it was time to have a child with a surrogate mother.
After a year and a half of trying, two doctors and one miscarriage, heartache finally gave way to celebration.
The trouble began before Zrav was born.
As soon as Abdulla and Deeplaul learned their surrogate was pregnant, Abdulla went to his company‚Äôs human resources department to apply for parental leave as the parents-to-be were ‚Äúpreparing to the n-th degree,‚Äù taking courses on parenting, first aid and CPR for children.
‚ÄúI thought my employer, being in the public sector, would realize, you know, this is the right thing to do and give me the time that I needed to take care of my child,‚Äù Abdulla told The Tri-City News.
At the time, most South African companies would give fathers two weeks leave while maternity leave lasted four months.
But somewhere between the national capital of Pretoria and Pietermaritzburg, the request fell into a bureaucratic black hole.
As the negotiations dragged on, Abdulla became increasingly agitated, finally approaching a lawyer through probono.org.
By denying Abdulla four months of parental leave, attorney Irvin Lawrence said, the government was denying Abdulla‚Äôs rights.
‚ÄúThe state would normally pay for that,‚Äù Lawrence told The Tri-City News. ‚ÄúThe guy looked at him and said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not a woman. We‚Äôre not going to give you this leave.‚Äô‚Äù
That‚Äôs when the couple started the process of mounting a challenge. The government relented and said it would give Abdulla the equivalent of adoption leave ‚Äî two months instead of the four months a mother would get.
‚ÄúWe said, ‚ÄòNot good enough,‚Äù Lawrence said.
A big part of maternity leave is to give the parent and child an opportunity to bond. But as the date grew closer, Abdulla grew increasingly worried he would miss out on those precious moments with his son.
‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen when we had the child,‚Äù Abdulla said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take care of my child for two weeks and then come back to work with a newborn.‚Äù
The first few months of the pregnancy, Abdulla was quietly submissive, hoping it would all work out. But when he was forced to take the matter to court, the experience lit a fire under him.
For years, the law had progressed in one area after another, from gay marriage to surrogacy. Now, a legal door was being slammed in the couple‚Äôs faces.
It was ‚Äúthe last step preventing us from living our lives,‚Äù Abdulla said.
By the time they had bounced from negotiations to labour commissions and, finally, to South Africa‚Äôs Supreme Court, the parents were ready for a fight.
‚ÄúVishad and I are not apologetic about anything in our lives,‚Äù said Abdulla. ‚ÄúI found myself thinking, why was I apologetic with this? Why was I going with my tail between my legs, cap in hand asking for a handout when it‚Äôs something that I should have got from the start?‚Äù
In 2015, more than four years after their son was born, the court ruled the state had violated Abdulla‚Äôs rights and was forced to pay out the two months he never got to spend with his infant.
The case sparked sweeping changes to South Africa‚Äôs labour laws. Last November, president Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law several amendment bills that, among other measures, guaranteed 10 weeks of leave for same-sex fathers who have a baby through a surrogate.
And while nearly the entire sweeping package of labour amendments went into effect Jan. 1 of this year, Lawrence said the provisions for same-sex fathers is still waiting and likely won‚Äôt go into effect until after elections in May.
Abdulla and Deeplaul are not ones to wait. Shortly after the court decision in 2015, they immigrated to Canada, settling in Coquitlam.
By then, a stagnant economy, fraud and corruption had taken their toll in their homeland. But it was the violent crime that brought them to Burke Mountain, they said (Deeplaul watched his father struggle through multiple surgeries after a thief broke into his house and shot him).
‚ÄúWhen you go through incidents like that, it just makes you want to be in a safer place to grow up your kids,‚Äù Deeplaul told The Tri-City News.
While leaving home is never easy, the couple has found solace in the fact that, one day, they‚Äôll be able to share what they achieved with their son. As they wait the final months for the law to take hold, it‚Äôs all finally sinking in.
‚ÄúWe feel like we‚Äôve left a part of ourselves back in South Africa ‚Äî permanently,‚Äù said Deeplaul, bursting into a chuckle.
‚ÄúWe were the first. We just did it and went with it all the way to the top.‚Äù

And, as I had figured, they found nothing. I don‚Äôt know whether that means the carpenter, Othniel Miller, was ruled out as a suspect or not. It may not matter much to him if he has been: his name‚Äôs been dragged through the mud in the national news and he‚Äôll be drawing suspicious looks for quite awhile.
I am curious if he raped his 10 year old neice why weren;t there charges? Has the SOL expired? I think Etans body was out in a hot furnace and incinerated.
They couldn‚Äôt prove it, that‚Äôs why there were no charges.
Off-topic, but we finally got some details on the resolution to Marx Barnes case. His mom apparently had a breakdown, was taken to a psychiatric hospital where she gave a false name, and left the baby behind when she checked out. He went into state custody and was eventually adopted.
It‚Äôs still a little hinky that nobody realized the unidentified baby in state custody was the baby who had been reported missing ‚Äî how many unclaimed babies can there have been floating around Hawaii that fall? ‚Äî but I guess those things were different in the ‚Äô70s.

By Oluwakemi
Short cuts to losing weight is a welcome development any day, anytime, however, it just got better with the latest finding that all your need to burn some calories is to relax in your bath.
So, forget, sweating it away at the gym, doing the Saturday morning run on the popular Lekki bridge or simply going on a long brisk walk as a sure fire way to burn heaps of calories. Just relax.
It‚Äôs sounds too good to be true right? Well, its true, as experts from Loughborough University recently found that simply lying in a 40 degree bath can be more effective than a brisk walk for calorie burning and lowering blood sugar.
In the study, Steve Faulkner from Loughborough University in the UK followed 2,300 middle-aged male participants for 20 years on average who were fitted with monitors and found that a hot bath increased blood flow and burnt energy.
Supposedly the magic is in heat shock proteins, which are released when your body temperature is raised significantly and in turn lowers your blood sugar levels. So an hour long bath is actually the equivalent to a 20 -30 minute walk and can burn around 126 calories.
Now, this isn‚Äôt to say that we can all go out and consume whatever we want, so long as we have an hour long bath everyday, but it does mean that you should start embracing your tub as part of your daily health routine. Question is, will you last in a 40 degree bath for an hour? We‚Äôre not sure we could handle it.Guilt grows out of healthy shame, and healthy shame allows me to acknowledge neediness, experience humility, identify limitations, admit mistakes, weep in sadness, wish for better, and grow in empathy and conscience as a human being.
Here is how healthy shame and guilt connect. I hurt when I fall. You probably hurt when you fall. If I push you to make you fall, I have guilt because I can see and know the experience of what your pain would be like.
We have heard the Golden Rule. We are drawn together through it. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It starts with the recognition that we are created alike.
We are not guilty for having feelings. We have guilt when we do actions or make plans that harm who we are created to be or harm another who is like us. Guilt moves us to seek forgiveness, not for how we are created but for what we have done with how we are created.I have just heard that an asteroid has recently been named after J.C.Beaglehole.
We are regularly reminded of just what a significant figure J.C.Beaglehole was in the history of exploration. It seems that space exploration is no different. It most definitely tips its hat to the explorers of the past as inspiration, and apparently gives due credit to those who have contributed to that history. There is even a profile of JCB in NASA‚Äôs Apollo Lunar Surface Journal. And now he is remembered and acknowledged in the naming of asteroid. I think it is quite reasonable to say ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù in such circumstances.
Here is the citation for newly named asteroid Beaglehole
(15413) Beaglehole = 1998 BX9
Discovered 1998 Jan. 22 by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak.
J.C. Beaglehole (1901-1971) was a New Zealand historian and authority on the European exploration of the Pacific. His ‚ÄúLife of Captain Cook‚Äù and associated ‚ÄúJournals of Captain Cook‚Äù and ‚ÄúJournals of Joseph Banks‚Äù constitute a definitive account of the Cook voyages. Name suggested and citation supplied by Eric M. Jones.
‚Äì and here is the listing the the Minor Planet Catalog
Asteroid Beaglehole is in the main Asteroid Belt; and has a semi-major axis of
3.07 astronomical units, which is 3.07 times Earth‚Äôs average distance from the Sun. Its absolute magnitude is 13.9, which puts the diameter between about 5.2 to 10.2 kilometers, depending on how reflective it really is. [Thanks to Eric Jones for this information.]
There is also an Antarctic glacier which the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee named after him in 1976, honouring his contribution to Cook sholarship and Antarctic history.

There are several common questions concerning the deployment and configuration of the enterprise database.
If the initial High Availability (HA) configuration was performed using DDL, are there any other permissions required to perform the upgrade with DDL?
The answer is no, as long as you have applied the DDL migration scripts (
fixupxx.sql) for that particular IBM Traveler release and the
appGrants.sql. It is recommended that you run the
appGrants.sqlevery time DDL migration scripts are executed, as this will configure permissions for new tables if any have been added in that release.
What is the default value for the
NTS_AUTO_DBSCHEMAparameter in
notes.ini?
The default is
true, which means IBM Traveler will perform automatic schema migration.
Is it possible to switch from DDL to Automatic Schema migration when performing an IBM Traveler upgrade? If so, how?
Yes, you can switch to automatic schema migration by removing the configuration parameter
NTS_AUTO_DBSCHEMA=falsefrom
notes.ini.
What permissions are required for switching from DDL to Automatic Schema migration during an upgrade?
If you are switching to automatic schema migration, you cannot use the LNTUSER as it is. This user was only granted specific permissions for IBM Traveler operations, and does not include permissions for modifying schema or altering the database. As a result, a schema upgrade will fail and the IBM Traveler server will not start. The DB administrator must configure LNTUSER with schema privileges to create/alter/drop tables, columns, primary keys, and indexes, as well as grant database alter permission. LNTUSER, by default, should have INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT and DELETE permissions for all database objects (tables).For SQL Server the schema authorization must be altered:
ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON SCHEMA :: LNT TO LNTUSERFor DB2, LNTUSER must have permission to create and drop schema:
GRANT CREATEIN, ALTERIN, DROPIN ON SCHEMA LNT TO LNTUSERNote: Please refer to the SQL server or DB2 documentation for more information on setting these permissions, as well as the Database permissions topic in the IBM Traveler documentation.
What DDL migration script(s) are needed for upgrading IBM Traveler HA to the latest release?Start with the
fixup#.sqllisted below and run all remaining
fixup#.sqlscripts. When this completes, you should also run
appGrants.sqlto ensure any new schema elements have the appropriate access rights.Note: There are no migration scripts required for IBM Traveler server Interim Fix pack(s) .
What are the recommended settings for DB2 transaction logs?
By default, the size of the DB2 transaction log is small, and an IBM Traveler server under heavy load can easily exceed the default size. As a result, it is recommended to set the transaction log to a larger size during HA setup. To get an initial estimate of the log size, refer to the IBM Traveler performance measurement guide and compare it against your environment. You should also monitor the DB2 transaction log space and check the utilization percentage. If it is high, or if you see DB2 transaction related errors
SQLCODE=-964, SQLSTATE=57011, SQLERRMC=null, then adjust the following log settings to higher values:
LOGFILESIZ, LOGPRIMARY, LOGSECOND.For example, perform the following commands on the DB2 server (or, if DB2 is configured with standby mirrors, on each DB2 server in the cluster):
db2 update db cfg for traveler using LOGFILSIZ 8192 LOGPRIMARY 40 LOGSECOND 120 db2stop force db2start db2 activate db traveler
When does a schema normally get changed?
Schema changes occur only during major releases, upgrades, and/or to resolve a critical issue. Documentation will be provided for any fix pack or major release.PEERNOVATION: What Peer Advisory Groups Can Teach Us About Building High Performing Teams (October 2020).

Best items I got are a smashed up #70814 Emmet's Construct-o-Mech for $35, and 50% off Snap Circuits Lights (I know not Lego but still kewl!).
You can see several us can't pull the trigger on those & Mechdragons at 50%. That has to say something. :p
It is a pretty unique build but I wasn't too impressed with it. MIT is also pretty flimsy like many ninjago vehicles. Pixal is unique to this set as well as the partially exposed Zane.
On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised with the mech dragon. It was not a set I was interested in but my son needed the sensei garmadon. I ended up buying it to get the free minifigure cube from target and I really enjoyed the build as well as the final product of both the dragon and the vehicle.

3s. Tons of ninja and Chima that we are not into.
Often within the clearance aisle they will have signs up showing that certain sections have varying clearance, but if every sign in the aisle states 50% off, then all items in that area should be 50% off.

Alright, so as I am in the process of learning about Cumul.io myself, what better way to learn about plugins than building one. So, in this post I‚Äôll walk through how I built a plugin with an open API. I‚Äôll go up to how I integrated it in a simple web page. I wanted to build something that I‚Äôd actually care about and be interested in looking at so I spent quite some time looking through open APIs. I wanted one that would provide some pollution or climate change data. I‚Äôve ended up using the AirVisual API (if you have any other suggestions for future projects please tell me in the comments!). As I‚Äôm using the community version I limited myself to a few major cities around the world and am displaying daily air quality data for them. This is what I ended up with:
Like my previous post on multi-tenancy, I am accompanying this one with open repositories so you can follow the steps exactly if you so wish. First, cumulio-pollution for the plugin itself. Second, cumulio-pollution-landingpage, a simple webpage to integrate the dashboard into. If you don‚Äôt use these repos, each of the steps should still be relevant to anyone trying to build a basic plugin from an API for their Cumul.io dashboard.
Why would you build a plugin?
Cumul.io provides great visualizations for your data, but there‚Äôs the question of connecting such data to it. One way to accomplish this is by writing your own plugin, for example for an existing API. Plugins work as a bridge, or a connector from an external source of data to Cumul.io.
Without further ado, let me jump into how I got this thing working:
- Building the Plugin
- Building the Dashboard
- Integrating the Dashboard
- Filtering the Dashboard (Extra)
- Useful Resources
Building the Plugin
First step is to build the plugin itself. I‚Äôve built mine on cumulio-pollution which you can clone if you‚Äôd like to follow the next steps exactly. To begin, I followed the steps in a previous tutorial on how to build plugins for Cumul.io dashboards which I found very useful, would recommend.
Here I will be building a basic plugin with no added authorization, since I‚Äôm using an open data source. I will connect to the open API from AirVisual as an example. This contains real time and historical weather and air quality data for requested cities, as well as forecast.
Once the plugin is written and added to Cumul.io, it will appear as a new data source when you want to add data to your dashboard in your account.
To start with, you will need the following:
- A Cumul.io account (there are free trials available)
- An API Key from AirVisual (I used the community edition)
- An App Secret from Cumul.io which you get when you create the plugin on your profile
This plugin only needs two endpoints. The /datasets endpoint and the /query endpoint:
// > index.js var app = require('./server.js')(); app.get('/datasets', function(req, res) { // code that retrieves the metadata (which datasets and columns are available). }) app.post('/query', function(req, res) { // code that retrieves the actual data upon a query })
The /datasets Endpoint
This endpoint gives information about the structure of the data to Cumul.io. In my example, I‚Äôm only going to be providing one dataset:
app.get('/datasets', function(req, res) { var datasets = [ { id: "Air Visuals Data", name: {en: `Air Quality for Select Cities`}, description: {en: `Real-time air quality data for select cities`}, columns: [ {id: 'city', name: {en: 'City'}, type: 'hierarchy'}, {id: 'update', name: {en: 'Update time'}, type: 'datetime'}, {id: 'latitude', name: {en: 'Latitude'}, type: 'numeric'}, {id: 'longitude', name: {en: 'Longitude'}, type: 'numeric'}, {id: 'aqius', name: {en: 'Air Quality Index (US)'}, type: 'numeric'}, {id: 'aqcn', name: {en: 'Air Quality Index (China)'}, type: 'numeric'} ] }]; return res.status(200).json(datasets); });
The code defines 5 columns which the AirVisual API will fill with city names, update time, latitude, longitude and the two air quality indexes (US and China have different measures for air quality).
Note: If you run your code at this point you can have a look on postman to test GET localhost:3030/datasets
The /query Endpoint
At this point, we‚Äôve defined what the dataset will be but there‚Äôs no actual data coming in. This is where we use the /query endpoint. In a regular plugin the result of the /query call returns an array of arrays with values that follow the exact same structure as defined in the /datasets endpoint. For example, we could return something like this:
// > index.js app.post('/query', function(req, res) { if (req.headers['x-secret'] !== process.env.CUMULIO_SECRET) return res.status(403).end('Given plugin secret does not match Cumul.io plugin secret.'); return res.status(200).json([ ["Istanbul", "2020-10-06T14:33:34 , "41.02", "29.10" ,"96", "75"], ["Los Angeles", "2020-10-06T14:33:34 , "34.07", "-118.24" ,"111", "56"]], ... ]); })
Now, what the following code does is create this array of arrays returned by the /query endpoint with responses it gets from the AirVisual API. I have picked a few major cities so as to limit the number of requests I make to the API. Feel free to change them as you like. To receive air quality and weather data, the API expects the name of the city, its state and country in the request:
var my_cities = { "New York City" : { "state" : "New York", "country" : "USA"}, "Los Angeles" : { "state" : "California", "country" : "USA"}, "Paris" : { "state" : "Ile-de-France", "country" : "France"}, "Istanbul" : { "state" : "Istanbul", "country" : "Turkey"}, "Hong Kong" : { "state" : "Hong Kong", "country" : "Hong Kong"}, "Delhi" : { "state" : "Delhi", "country" : "India"}, "Beijing" : { "state" : "Beijing", "country" : "China"} };
Since there are limits to the number of requests I can make to the API within a given time period, I‚Äôve implemented a cache and am checking whether the fields are over 24 hours old. If they are, I am adding to my cache:
const got = require('got'); var moment = require('moment'); const cache = {}; var city_keys = new Set(); async function getAirQuality(city) { const state = my_cities[city].state; const country = my_cities[city].country; let response = await got(`{city}&state=${state}&country=${country}&key=${process.env.API_KEY}`).json(); if(response !== undefined && response !== null && response.data !== undefined && response.data !== null && response.data.current !== undefined && response.data.current !== null) return [city, response.data.current.pollution.ts, response.data.location.coordinates[1], response.data.location.coordinates[0], response.data.current.pollution.aqius, response.data.current.pollution.aqicn]; else throw new Error("mesage request limit"); }; function isCacheStale(id) { const curTime = moment(); return curTime.diff(cache[id].last_update, 'hours') >= 24; } function createCache(id) { if(!cache[id]) { cache[id] = { values : [], last_update : null } } } app.post('/query', async function(req, res) { const details = req.body; if (req.headers['x-secret'] !== process.env.CUMULIO_SECRET) return res.status(403).end('Given plugin secret does not match Cumul.io plugin secret.'); if(cache[details.id] !== undefined && !isCacheStale(details.id)) { return res.status(200).json(cache[details.id].values); } else { createCache(details.id); for(const key in my_cities){ try { let city_data = await getAirQuality(key); let city_key = city_data[0] + city_data[1]; if(!city_keys.has(city_key)) { city_keys.add(city_key); cache[details.id].values.push(city_data); } cache[details.id].last_update = moment(); } catch(error) { console.error("Reached request limit, will serve from cache"); } } return res.status(200).json(cache[details.id].values); } });
If you‚Äôve cloned and are using the cumulio-pollution repository, you can do the following to run the plugin:
npm install
- Create a file called ‚Äò.env‚Äô in the root directory. Here, fill the API_KEY with the key you create with AirVisual API, and CUMULIO_SECRET with the App Secret that is created when you create the plugin on Cumul.io:
API_KEY=XXX<br>CUMULIO_SECRET=XXX
PORT=3030
npm run start or node index.js
To test that the /query endpoint works correctly I used postman (If you do, don‚Äôt forget to add the Cumul.io secret to the header):
Now your plugin is running on localhost:3030, but we have to add it to your Cumul.io account and make it accessible to it. For this step, I used ngrok. Running this will give you a https URL that you can use to make your plugin accessible from outside your PC. If you‚Äôre using Visual Studio Code you can install the ngrok extension, run it with port number 3030 and copy link (you can also run ngrok on a separate terminal). Once you‚Äôve done that you can now;
Create the plugin on Cumul.io
Now let‚Äôs add your plugin to Cumul.io. Go to your profile and Create Plugin on the Plugins tab. Add the URL created in the previous step to Base URL & authentication:
Once it‚Äôs been created you will see the plugin on your profile and you can copy the App Secret to the CUMULIO_SECRET field in your .env file:
Building the Dashboard
Now that you have a plugin, when it‚Äôs running, you can create a dashboard on Cumul.io and add your plugin as a data source to it. Create a new dashboard and go to add data. You should now see a new plugin in the ‚ÄòYour plugins‚Äô tab:
Since we told the plugin to return only one dataset in the /datasets endpoint, you will see the following which you can import:
Now you will see the Air Quality for Select Cities dataset listed on the right as one of your datasets. If you ‚ÄòOpen in Editor‚Äô, you should see the following:
You can now use this dataset to build pretty dashboards to your heart‚Äôs content üôÇ I, for example, decided that I would like to display a map, and that I would like the symbol colours to represent the official air quality colouring system. In the rest of this section, I‚Äôll walk through what I did and how I achieved it;
Adding Coordinates and Custom Colours
For those of you who are interested, here is the colour scheme for the US air quality index (which is the one I used):
0 ‚Äì 50 Healthy (green)
51 ‚Äì 100 Moderate (yellow)
101-150 Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (orange)
151 ‚Äì 200 Unhealthy (red)
201 ‚Äì 300 Very Unhealthy (purple)
301 =< Hazardous (maroon)
So I added two new fields to the dataset: Health Status and Coordinates;
Health Status:
On the Dataset Editor, select Add Formula and you can now define a chain of if statements that checks the Air Quality Index (US) column and classifies the health status:
To add colours, in the settings for the Health Status column you‚Äôve just created, you can Edit Hierarchy and define custom colours:
Coordinates:
For this one, I already had latitude and longitude columns in the dataset so I simply had to select one of the two and add coordinates:
Once I had these two columns ready, I added a few charts to my dashboard:
The Map
For this, I‚Äôve used a symbol map and have added the Coordinates column to Geography, the Health Status column to Color and the Air Quality Index (US) column to Measure. For more info on how to add data to your dashboard charts you can visit this webinar on adding charts.
I also want this map and the following bar chart to display today‚Äôs figures. So I‚Äôve added a filter that checks the Update time is within the last 1 day:
The Bar Chart
The bar chart is much the same as the map, it displays the days air quality data. So again, I‚Äôve added Air Quality Index (US) as Measure, but this time I‚Äôve added the City to Category and Health Status to Group By. The same filter is also used here to display only the last 1 day. In the Item Settings, you can select Stacked Mode to achieve the same visuals.
The Grouped Line Chart
The line chart aims to provide a timeline for air quality data, so it will build up as you keep your plugin running. In the image above you see mine with 2 days of data. The X-axis is Update time, the Measure again is Air Quality Index (US) and the Group By is City.
The Speedometers
This last one I couldn‚Äôt resist. The speedometer was recently introduced to the dashboard editor. So, I selected two cities, Delhi and New York, and am displaying their air quality indexes here as well. In addition to the filter selecting the last 1 day, I‚Äôve also added to each a filter on City and selected the relevant city name:
I do not select a Target for these charts, instead, I set the ranges in the settings:
There is a useful academy article on speedometers that details how to add and customize them.
Integrating the Dashboard
Once the dashboard exists, great, you have a dashboard that you can see when you login to your Cumul.io account. But you may want to have it integrated into another webpage for others to see too. Which is what I wanted to do; for this step, I‚Äôve created cumulio-pollution-landingpage which you can clone and use. To run it:
npm install
- Create a file called ‚Äò.env‚Äô in the root directory. Here, fill the CUMULIO_API_KEY and CUMULIO_API_TOKEN fields with the ones from your Cumul.io profile. If you don‚Äôt have any yet, you can create them in the API Tokens tab in your profile:
CUMULIO_API_KEY=XXX
CUMULIO_API_TOKEN=XXX
- Replace
dashboardIdin public/js/app.js and server.js with your own dashboard ID which you can find on the dashboard editor in Cumul.io.
npm run start or node index.js
You can visit your webpage on localhost:3000
For this section you can have a look at the Integration API Documentation. As well as a previous blog post that walks through integrating a dashboard. For the full code you can visit the repo but here are some of the key points:
As an initial step, I load the Integration API in the header of my webpage:
//index.html <html> <head> <script type="text/javascript" src=""></script> </head> <body> ... </body> </html>
Next up I decided to add a side bar and a main content element where I would display my dashboard, and load the js/app.js script:
//index.html <body> <div id="content" class="d-flex align-items-stretch w-100"> <!-- Sidebar Container--> <div id="sidebar" class="d-flex flex-column h-100 text-white p-4"> <!-- Company logo and name --> <div class="company-logo px-2 w-100 mb-5 mr-4"> <img src="/images/color_logo_white_text.png" width="50%"/> </div> <div class="mb-4"> <div class="d-flex"> <div> <h5>Welcome to Demo Air Quality Dashboards</h5> </div> </div> </div> <div class="flex-fill"></div> </div> <!-- Dashboard container --> <div class="main-container text-center"> <div class="dashboard-outer-container"> <div id="dashboard-container"></div> </div> </div> <div id="overlay"></div> </div> <script src="/js/app.js"></script> </body>
The actual dashboard embedding happens in js/app.js. Here I call the addDashboard function. This function loads and renders the dashboard with the specified id in the specified HTML div, which for me is the ‚Äòdashboard-container‚Äô:
const dashboardOptions = { dashboardId: dashboardId, container: '#dashboard-container', loader: { background: '#EEF3F6', spinnerColor: '#004CB7', spinnerBackground: '#DCDCDC', fontColor: '#000000' } Cumulio.addDashboard(dashboardOptions);
I wrap the above addDashboard in a loadInsightsPage function that is called when the window loads:
const loadDashboard = (key, token) => { // use tokens if available if (key && token) { dashboardOptions.key = key; dashboardOptions.token = token; } // add the dashboard to the #dashboard-container element Cumulio.addDashboard(dashboardOptions); } // Function to retrieve the dashboard authorization token from the platform's backend const getDashboardAuthorizationToken = async (city) => { try { const response = await fetch(`/authorization`, {}); // Fetch the JSON result with the Cumul.io Authorization key & token const responseData = await response.json(); return responseData; } catch (e) { // Display errors in the console console.error(e); return { error: 'Could not retrieve dashboard authorization token.' }; } }; // function to load the insight page const loadInsightsPage = async () => { const authorizationToken = await getDashboardAuthorizationToken(); if (authorizationToken.id && authorizationToken.token) { loadDashboard(authorizationToken.id, authorizationToken.token); } } // on page load window.onload = async () => { loadInsightsPage(); }
And finally, one last thing to note is server.js where the /authorization endpoint is defined. It uses the Cumul.io Node SDK to request an authorization key & token for the dashboard. The Cumul.io API key and token are first read from the .env file:
const Cumulio = require('cumulio'); const client = new Cumulio({ api_key: process.env.CUMULIO_API_KEY, api_token: process.env.CUMULIO_API_TOKEN }); app.get('/authorization', (req, res) => { const options = { type: 'temporary', expiry: '1 day', inactivity_interval: '30 minutes', securables: [dashboardId] }; client.create('authorization', options).then((result) => { return res.status(200).json(result); }); }); app.get('/*', (req, res) => { res.sendFile(join(__dirname, 'index.html')); }); app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Application running on port 3000'));
Finally, I decided that I‚Äôd like to add some extras so as to experiment with filtering from an integrated dashboard. The next section will walk through how I achieved some simple filtering by interacting with the webpage.
Filtering the Dashboard (Extra)
For this final step, I just approached it experimentally so there‚Äôs nothing fancy going on. I simply added the list of cities on the sidebar, and filtered the dashboard on that city when clicked:
To achieve this, I first added a list of cities to the sidebar that calls a reloadDashboard function on click:
//index.html <div class="pages small"> <ul class="list-unstyled text-uppercase p-0"> <li onclick="reloadDashboard('Los Angeles')">Los Angeles</li> <li onclick="reloadDashboard('Delhi')">Delhi</li> <li onclick="reloadDashboard('Istanbul')">Istanbul</li> <li onclick="reloadDashboard('New York City')">New York</li> <li onclick="reloadDashboard('Paris')">Paris</li> <li onclick="reloadDashboard('Beijng')">Beijng</li> </ul> </div>
Then I had to modify the getDashboardAuthorizationToken function to accept an input (the city name) which we can add to /authorization and then refreshData with the filtering added to our authorization options:
//app.js const getDashboardAuthorizationToken = async (city) => { try { const response = await fetch(`/authorization${city ? '?city=' + city : ''}`, {}); // Fetch the JSON result with the Cumul.io Authorization key & token const responseData = await response.json(); return responseData; } catch (e) { // Display errors in the console console.error(e); return { error: 'Could not retrieve dashboard authorization token.' }; } }; const reloadDashboard = async (city) => { const authorizationToken = await getDashboardAuthorizationToken(city); Cumulio.setAuthorization(authorizationToken.id, authorizationToken.token, {dashboardId : dashboardId, container : '#dashboard-container'}); Cumulio.refreshData(); }
//server.js app.get('/authorization', (req, res) => { const options = { type: 'temporary', expiry: '1 day', inactivity_interval: '30 minutes', securables: [dashboardId] }; if(req.query.city){ options.metadata = {city : [req.query.city]}; } client.create('authorization', options).then((result) => { return res.status(200).json(result); }); });
And that‚Äôs it for coding! The only thing remained to do is to add ‚Äòcity‚Äô as a parameter to the dashboard itself on Cumul.io. Now when the reloadDashboard is called on click, we send meta_data to the dashboard with ‚Äòcity‚Äô name, and Cumul.io uses the value I send over as its parameter value. To add a parameter, you can go to the FILTERS tab and ‚ÄòCreate Parameter‚Äô with type Hierarchy[].
I wanted to be able to see all cities on the dashboard editor so added all my cities as default values here. Then I need to use this parameter on the dashboard so on Dashboard Filters ‚ÄòCreate filter‚Äô:
And that‚Äôs it üôÇ I now have my own plugin that uses an API, used on a dashboard that I integrate into a webpage and filter from there. Voila ladies and gentlemen:

Combining the unique corona structure of worm-like patchy micelles immobilized on a polymer fiber with the molecular self-assembly of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) leads to hierarchical superstructures with a fir-tree-like morphology. For this purpose, worm-like patchy micelles bearing pendant, functional tertiary amino groups in one of the corona patches were prepared by crystallization-driven self-assembly and immobilized on a supporting polystyrene fiber by coaxial electrospinning. The obtained patchy fibers were then immersed in an aqueous solution of a tertiary amino-functionalized BTA to induce patch-mediated molecular self-assembly to well-defined fir-tree-like superstructures upon solvent evaporation. Interestingly, defined superstructures are obtained only if the pendant functional groups in the surface patches match with the peripheral substituents of the BTA, which is attributed to a local increase in BTA concentration at the polymer fibers‚Äô surface.I‚Äôve spent the last few days at Type-A West in Denver, Colorado, including being part of a panel discussion about Dad Influencers, along with long-time friend Eric Elkins and new friend Bolaji Oyejide. Ably moderated by Don Jackson, we ended up talking a lot more about fatherhood and the nuanced issue of appropriately sharing our experiences as fathers with our followers. Do you reveal all, or do you keep everyone at arm‚Äôs length?
Bolaji was all for opening up and being maximally transparent, while Eric and I represented more of the perspective that you should be careful because of privacy and because the online world is full of, well, odd individuals and you never really know how they‚Äôll react or respond to something you‚Äôve shared.
The question that most made me ponder, however, was a simple one: what advice would you give other parents?
For this post, however, I want to dig into a slightly different question, one that came up in discussion after discussion as I met up with divorcing, freshly divorced and newly single moms and dads. The question is:
What Advice Would You Give to Newly Single Parents?
In a lot of ways, it boils down to the essence of my own journey, a decade of being a single parent, starting with our intention of being 50/50 with our parenting time, but in reality sometimes having my children with me 60-75%, sometimes less than half-time, and now, having my youngest with me full time. It‚Äôs kind of like being a soldier: it‚Äôs really time in the trenches that gives you the experience to know how to handle good times and bad.
So I offer up three simple pieces of advice:
1. Shut Up And Listen
Perhaps the most basic of parenting strategies, we adults have a really bad habit of not listening to our children and just imparting our judgment or wisdom over them speaking to us, sharing or venting. I‚Äôm not great at this because like many men (I see it as more of a masculine trait) I‚Äôm a fixit guy. You have a problem, I‚Äôm going to start spinning off ideas about how to analyze it and solve it. Professionally that‚Äôs an extraordinarily useful trait, but interpersonally? Not so much.
It‚Äôs a great zen practice anyway; just stop talking. Your children want to share with you, they want your advice, and sometimes, they might just want your sympathy. So stop talking already, stop interrupting them, stop discounting or belittling what they say, stop being unsympathetic and just listen to them. Even if it takes a while for them to unwind or get to the point.
Just because you do this, doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôll thank you or even realize you‚Äôve heard them. Case in point: My 13yo got in trouble at school last week. She got in the car in tears. I asked what happened and let her talk for a while, gradually telling the full story. I kept nodding, saying ‚ÄúMmm hmm‚Äù and sharing that it sounded rough and that she seemed to have had a tough afternoon. Then I told her that she‚Äôd made a mistake in judgment and would have a consequence from me because of it, to which she then complained vehemently that I didn‚Äôt listen to her at all, I didn‚Äôt care about how hard a day it was for her, and I should stop yelling at her. I again let her just get that off her chest: It wasn‚Äôt me she was really yelling at, after all, but the situation she was complaining about. Okay. Hard in the moment, but you can do that too.
Which leads up to my second piece of parental advice, after having spend 20+ years being a parent:
2. Keep Your Sense of Humor
Turns out that there‚Äôs a lot about parenting that‚Äôs pretty wack. Times you do the right thing just to have your young person tell you what a beast, what a monster you are. That comes with the territory, whether the overt ways of a little one or the more nuanced ‚Äî and often more hurtful ‚Äî comments of a teenager who‚Äôs learning about emotions and how to hurt people with words. One of my classic interactions with my daughter is for her to yell at me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúyelling at her‚Äù because she doesn‚Äôt like the words I say, regardless of my tone, volume and inflection.
To retain my sanity, I don‚Äôt argue, I sure as heck don‚Äôt smile (that‚Äôd be a huge mistake!), I just say ‚Äúah, okay‚Äù or similar and react as little as possible. Do I sometimes yell? Of course. I have emotions too, and can get frustrated, upset or wound up, but by seeking to remain calm and retaining my sense of humor about a situation, we can weather a lot of chaos and challenges without them escalating into major blowups.
And that‚Äôs really the purpose of your parental sense of humor anyway; to give you an alternative to getting really pissed off. I can remember years and years ago we were out at a restaurant with friends and their daughter knocked over a glass of water and broke the glass. I was so impressed by the dad‚Äôs reaction of staying calm and asking the most important question in all situations: ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Since then I have endeavored to be that dad too, so that when something untoward happens, my go-to response is calm humor. ‚ÄúDid that darn glass just fall down? They need to use glasses that aren‚Äôt so darn tired!‚Äù goes a long way to helping your child cope with accidents. Much better than ‚Äúdid you knock over your water again? You clumsy oaf!‚Äù
There‚Äôs also an inherent level of humor in the entire parenting journey anyway. I mean, let‚Äôs face it, if you watch other parents, they‚Äôre hilarious. Ever seen an adult pick up a baby and literally smell their butt to see if a diaper needs changing? That‚Äôs not bizarre and funny? Or what I like is the helicopter parents where you see them lugging the child‚Äôs backpack, musical instrument, and everything else, while the child dances along beside them, complaining about having to carry the book they‚Äôre reading for class or even busily tapping on their phone. That‚Äôs not teaching the kids anything useful, but it‚Äôs also funny. Yes, I sit and judge, knowing that my doing that is funny too.
I think the thing about keeping your sense of humor in parenting is that it helps you have perspective and not take it all so darn seriously. There are big, important situations to deal with ‚Äî and they get more and more important as your children grow up ‚Äî but keeping a bigger perspective and realizing that one incident does not a lifelong habit make is pretty darn important too, both for your child‚Äôs mental health and your own.
3. Honor and respect your co-parent
This might be the crux of the challenge of separating, divorcing and being co-parents; you have your own personal emotional journey that you‚Äôre on, whether you split amicably or are the most hateful, spitting kittens-in-the-alley couple of all time. Divorce sucks. It hurts. It‚Äôs a rejection from someone who knows you better than just about anyone else in the world. How can it not be incredibly difficult?
Unfortunately, that often comes out in judgment, criticism and outright hateful behavior towards your ex. And boy is that a terrible thing for children to experience, whether it‚Äôs a little one or a teen. They have their own incredibly difficult journey too and I highly encourage all parents to ensure they can have time away from both parents, time with an unbiased adult in whom they can confide. A therapist is trained to do just this, or a pastor, friend‚Äôs parent, or similar. The key: unbiased. Someone who can apply the two rules I‚Äôve already shared without injecting subsequent criticism or snark about the other parent. So your new girlfriend, grandma or Uncle Charlie isn‚Äôt really going to cut it.
The great challenge is to acknowledge and validate your children‚Äôs complaints about your ex without actually agreeing with them. Remember; kids like to complain. It‚Äôs how they push out those unpleasant emotions and sometimes those emotions are things like disappointment, hurt, sadness, or a sense of failure. A lot more kids than you realize have an internal voice that tells them if they would have been a better child mommy and daddy would still be together. Oh, what a weight to bear! Think about it too much and it can break your heart. Makes ya a bit more sympathetic to their journey too, doesn‚Äôt it?
My advice to divorced or separated parents, therefore, is to be at least neutral towards the other parent, to bolster them in front of your children and to accept that solo parenting is a very different task than having two parents in the house to work together (or, in many cases, to just let the other parent deal with situations). It took me years to learn how to be a parent rather than just a drill instructor, and I wish I would have been better at learning how to be a full-rounded, sympathetic and [appropriately] strict single parent for my children‚Äôs sake.
I‚Äôve seen moms and dads who are also ‚ÄúDisney Dads‚Äù, as they say; the children aren‚Äôt with them very often, and so it‚Äôs always a fun, candy-filled, shopping-filled, video game playing adventure when they are together. Mostly you see this with single dads, however, and 10x when it‚Äôs a very imbalanced parenting schedule. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs crazy hard to establish a real relationship with a child when you see them one night/month or every other weekend. But that‚Äôs another discussion entirely.
Before this turns into an ebook, I just encourage you to keep these three pieces of advice in mind as you go through your single parenting day, whether it‚Äôs brand new to you or you‚Äôve been doing it for years: shut up and listen to your children. Put down your phone, turn away from the TV, pay attention to them. Keep your sense of humor as they talk and share and live. Because, trust me, they definitely are keeping their sense of humor about you and what you‚Äôre doing day by day! And, finally, don‚Äôt bad-mouth your ex to your children or even to your friends if your children might overhear you. Hold them in high esteem in your heart, accept their failings and that they might struggle as parents, and things will inevitably move along a bit more smoothly.
I sure hope that helps. Thanks for reading this far.

Dave, Great advice for all single parents. I agree being respectful of the other parent is probably the hardest part of parenting when divorced, but definitely one of the most important. It is easy to forget that when we throw daggers at the other parent, it is our children who are pierced first.Advanced Keto 1500 is a dietary complement that helps people drop some pounds shortly and naturally, utilizing full-spectrum Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salts as its foremost ingredient. BHB is a ketone that prompts and maintains ketosis within the physique. While ketones are naturally produced by the liver and used as a supply of power when glucose will not be obtainable, utilizing BHB supplementation may help these making an attempt to drop some pounds.
How Does Advanced Keto 1500 Work?
As talked about, Advanced Keto 1500 helps the physique enter ketosis and continues to take care of the state. Consumers at the moment eat meals which are crammed with carbs which ends up in weight acquire. While ketosis may be triggered with a keto food plan and includes consuming little to no carbs, the Advanced Keto 1500 is an alternative product to using a keto diet, with no unwanted side effects such because the keto flu, or ‚Äúlow carb flu,‚Äù which is prompted when the physique is not equipped with excessive carb meals.
How Is Keto a Weight Loss Answer?
When the physique begins utilizing the fats that has been gathered in cells to provide power and enters ketosis, fats is burned. Ketones are a sort of acid the liver naturally produces which turns the fats into ketones, a sort of acid, and sends them into the bloodstream. When the physique doesn‚Äôt have sufficient insulin to show sugar into power, the physique enters ketosis, which forces the physique to start producing ketone our bodies out of the saved fats and used for power and cease counting on carbs. To attain ketosis, dieters must observe a particularly low carb and a high-fat ketogenic food plan.
Supplements that comprise BHB have completely modified the title of the burden loss recreation, as simply utilizing the keto food plan to achieve ketosis may be daunting and should take weeks of restrictive weight-reduction plan earlier than reaching this metabolic state. To attain ketosis faster, Advanced Keto 1500 helps the body by adding full-spectrum BHB ketones salts.
More About BHB
The ingredient in Advanced Keto 1500 is BHB which improves cognitive perform. It can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is hydrophilic and may simply dissolve in water; the Advanced Keto 1500 supplement can be considered a brain booster.
Keto Advanced 1500 Benefits
Below are all of the health benefits provided by the Keto Advanced 1500 formula, per the official web site and as reviewed in the Globe Newswire:
- Rapid weight reduction

With Halloween less than one week away, the Oct. 25 episode of Dancing with the Stars is appropriately HORROR themed! The remaining ten couples perform routines inspired by some of the most all-time classic horror films and television shows. After Melanie C‚Äôs shocking elimination last week, it‚Äôs clear that anything can happen, so the pressure is definitely on for those who are still in the running for the Mirror Ball.
Horror Night Performances
The first performance of the night is a paso doble from Mike ‚ÄúThe Miz‚Äù Mizanin and Witney Carson. They perform their Hellraiser-inspired dance to ‚ÄúWicked Games,‚Äù and right off the bat, their costumes are out of control and spot-on. Len Goodman warns The Miz that he has to work on his posture, but overall, he says that Mike ‚Äúnailed‚Äù the routine. Derek Hough praises the pro wrestler for really getting into character with the routine, and Bruno Tonioli compliments Mike on his footwork. The Miz & Witney‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 9; Len = 8; Derek = 9; Bruno = 8. Total Score = 34 out of 40.
Next up is Kenya Moore and Brandon Armstrong, who dance an Argentine Tango to ‚ÄúTake My Breath.‚Äù The routine is inspired by the show Arachnophobia, and Kenya goes into the routine on a high after receiving her highest scores so far last week. Derek points out that there were a ‚Äúfew little wobbles‚Äù in the routine, but says he‚Äôs ‚Äúso impressed‚Äù with the Real Housewives of Atlanta star. Carrie Ann Inaba raves over Kenya‚Äôs ‚Äúspectacular power,‚Äù but offers some constructive criticism about making sure she steals the spotlight over Brandon in her future dances. Kenya & Brandon‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 8; Len = 8; Derek = 8; Bruno = 8. Total Score = 32 out of 40.
JoJo Siwa and Jenna Johnson are up next. Following their perfect score last week, the ladies dance a Jazz routine to ‚ÄúAnything Goes,‚Äù inspired by IT, for Horror Night. Bruno says the routine is ‚Äúterrifying and absolutely brilliant,‚Äù and raves over how JoJo and Jenna transformed a ‚Äúnightmare into a work of art.‚Äù Meanwhile, Carrie Ann gushes over JoJo‚Äôs ability to continue pushing herself with new moves week after week, and Derek says it‚Äôs ‚Äúbeautifully done and phenomenal.‚Äù JoJo & Jenna‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 10; Len = 10; Derek = 10; Bruno = 10. Total Score = 40 out of 40. Another perfect score!
The next dance is a Cha Cha from Cody Rigsby and Cheryl Burke. They perform an American Psycho routine to ‚ÄúThere Will Be Blood‚Äù by Kim Petras. The judges are impressed with the routine and Len applauds Cody for finally showing his potential in the competition. ‚ÄúThat was definitely your best dance,‚Äù Derek confirms, praising the detail and technique. ‚ÄúYou really put the work into that dance. Cody & Cheryl‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 9; Len = 9; Derek = 9; Bruno = 9. Total Scores = 36 out of 40.
Jimmie Allen and his partner Emma Slater are the next to perform. This week, they do a stunning contemporary dance to ‚ÄúSay Something,‚Äù and it‚Äôs inspired by ‚ÄúA Quiet Place.‚Äù Jimmie and Emma both get emotional after doing the dance, which he dedicated to his three children. ‚ÄúI loved it,‚Äù Len raves. ‚ÄúIt had control, it had emotion, and it held my attention.‚Äù He also points out that the music was ‚Äútricky,‚Äù but Jimmie was able to ‚Äúdance right along with it.‚Äù Jimmie & Emma‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 10; Len = 9; Derek = 10; Bruno = 9. Total Scores = 38 out of 40.
After a special performance from Derek, it‚Äôs back to the competition. Olivia Jade and Val Chmerkovskiy are up with a paso doble, and after landing in the bottom two last week, there‚Äôs a lot riding on their routine. The do a dance inspired by The Purge to ‚ÄúBeggin.‚Äù Derek assures Olivia that he has no idea why she was ever in the bottom two, and congratulates her for doing a ‚Äúgreat job‚Äù on such a ‚Äúdifficult routine.‚Äù Bruno also praises the beauty blogger for ‚Äúkeeping up with‚Äù Val in a ‚Äúvery hard‚Äù dance with difficult choreography. Olivia & Val‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 9; Len = 9; Derek = 9; Bruno = 9. Total Score = 36 out of 40.
Melora Hardin and Artem Chigvintsev are the next pair to take the floor. This week, they do a jive to ‚ÄúHound Dog‚Äù and it‚Äôs inspired by Cujo. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not all of the judges‚Äô favorite. ‚ÄúI feel like you need to give us more,‚Äù Carrie Ann admits. ‚ÄúI want you to push yourself. It was a little safe.‚Äù Derek agrees with the sentiment, while Len says it was great quality and quantity for a jive dance. Melora & Artem‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 8; Len = 9; Derek = 8; Bruno = 9. Total Score = 34 out of 40.
On the dance floor next is Iman Shumpert and Daniella Karagach with a contemporary dance inspired by Us. The intimate routine is set to ‚ÄúI Got 5 On It,‚Äù and features more impressive lifts like we saw in Iman‚Äôs argentine tango two weeks ago. Not only does Iman nail the routine, but he completely transforms into the character. ‚ÄúMy mind was blown!‚Äù Carrie Ann raves. ‚ÄúIt was sheer perfection.‚Äù Len goes crazy over Daniella‚Äôs choreography and says that Iman looked ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù performing it. Iman & Daniella‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 10; Len = 10; Derek = 10; Bruno = 10. Total Score = 40 out of 40.
Suni Lee and Sasha Farber take the floor next. They to a tango to Ed Sheeran‚Äôs ‚ÄúBad Habits,‚Äù inspired by The Vampire Diaries. Len admits that Suni‚Äôs footwork was a bit ‚Äúhit or miss,‚Äù but says she was great in frame and did a great job at getting into character. ‚ÄúThere was a little it of disconnect with the music and stepping,‚Äù Derek adds. Overall, the judges have some criticism, but are proud of Suni for giving it her all. Suni & Sasha‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 9; Len = 9; Derek = 9; Bruno = 9. Total Score = 36 out of 40.
The final routine of the night is an argentine tango from Amanda Kloots and Alan Bersten. It‚Äôs inspired by Saw and set to Ciara‚Äôs ‚ÄúPaint It Black.‚Äù Amanda and Alan have a tough week of rehearsals, and Alan choreographs an incredibly difficult routine. On show night, though, they totally come together. Derek says Amanda finally gave him what he needed to see to earn a 10 from him, and Bruno gushes that ‚Äúthe whole thing was GREAT!‚Äù Carrie Ann has some criticism, though, and she lets Amanda know that she‚Äôs ‚Äúforcing herself‚Äù in some of the movements. Amanda & Alan‚Äôs scores: Carrie Ann = 9; Len = 9; Derek = 10; Bruno = 10. Total Score = 38 out of 40.
Horror Night Elimination
Despite a night of amazing performances, there, unfortunately, still has to be an elimination. The couples who are safe are: Iman and Daniella, Olivia and Val, JoJo and Jenna, Cody and Cheryl, The Miz and Witney, Amanda and Alan, Jimmie and Emma and Melora and Artem.
That means that Suni and Sasha and Kenya and Brandon are in the bottom two. The judges each get to vote for one couple who they want to save, with the tie-breaking vote going to Len if it comes to that. Carrie Ann votes to save Suni, Derek saves Suni and Bruno saves Suni. Len agrees that he would‚Äôve saved Suni, too, and Kenya Moore is eliminated.

Thanks to Revell, a division of Baker Publishing Company, for sending me this book to read and review. I was intrigued by the story line- Cate Reilly detective goes undercover to investigate a missing person case at a prestigious boarding school and Deke Sloan also is undercover DEA investigating drug trafficking at the same school. The story just was a little too far fetched for me- Cate who is 33 goes undercover as a high schooler, and Deke is the long term Spanish substitute. Cate and Deke have old history (8 years before they were in love and Deke picked his job over Cate and left Cate heart broken). Their relationship was not my favorite part of the story. I enjoyed the detective an investigative work more. I also enjoyed Cate‚Äôs relationship building with her roomie Kayla. I just struggled to by into the story as a whole and it was just an OK mystery for me.Our Crumbling Sanctuaries
I. ‚ÄúAll your problems are in your head.‚Äù
That‚Äôs what he told me. I can remember that day like it was yesterday. I had been in a sour mood all week. Nothing made me happy and everybody was irritating. I was working in the candle room when I stepped out to mope, and there was Fr. Xerubim passing by. He was one of the largest and strongest men I‚Äôd ever known. He‚Äôd grown up a farmer, served in the army, and now worked with the livestock at our monastery. Tall and massive, with a thick beard and all robed in black, he looked like Hagrid from Harry Potter. The monk took one look at me and peered down. I can still see his eyebrows frowning. ‚ÄúPetros, all your problems are in your head.‚Äù
I was living in Greece at a monastery founded by saints in the 15th century. It was built like a castle, with huge beautiful stones covered in ivy and flowers and looming over miles of forests on Mt. Olympus and the bright Aegean Sea below. It was the climax of my dreams. I hadn‚Äôt been a very content teenager, if there is such a thing, and always wanted something more, something grander, something exotic and exciting. Now, I‚Äôd found my adventure. Yet, I wasn‚Äôt happy. My moods swung back and forth. Sometimes I felt close to paradise and other times I felt depressed or just plain melancholy.
Fr. Xerubim‚Äôs words pierced me at that moment. It was true. I had everything, but I was looking to external things to make me happy. I lived literally in a castle in the sky, but I was just as prone to fleeting moods as I was in my childhood, in school, at work, or anywhere.
II. Our happiness has so little to do with life around us. It always comes back to our heart.
. 24-34).
God knows what we need.
He sees everything we go through and listens to all our worries and fears. When you lie awake at night, upset with yourself, upset with others, frightened by what tomorrow will bring or hurt from the past, God is present. When we struggle to keep on going because life changes so fast, when our anchors seem to fall apart, when everything that once brought us comfort is gone, God stands by us with compassion and gentleness. Yet, this same loving God allows that world to crumble. He doesn‚Äôt stop it. Why?
III. Today, I want to talk about sanctuaries.
What are the sanctuaries in your life? To where do you retreat to find peace?
The ancient sense of the word comes from the Hebrew, ‚Äòmiqdas‚Äô, which refers to a place set aside as sacred. The temple was a ‚Äòmiqdas‚Äô: ‚ÄúThe place, O LORD, which you have made for your dwelling, the sanctuary [miqdas], O Lord, which your hands have established‚Äù (Exodus 15:17). In the Medieval world, the sanctuary became a place of refuge for prisoners and fugitives. According to Church law, no arrest or violence could take place in a church, and so it became the respite from the world. From there, the modern English use of the word developed to describe a place of retreat, for renewal or comfort.
Your sanctuary may be your home, your workshop, your man-cave, the kitchen, a park, your church, a friendship or marriage. All of these are good. God gives them to us for a time so we can retreat, heal and revitalize.
IV. Nonetheless, there is one universal rule in life.
Every sanctuary will change and die. Every place of rest, every relationship, every solace and comfort will break down and vanish. Every sanctuary, that is, except for one: God.
In his first epistle, St. Peter warns the Christians about becoming too attached to this world. Comforts and pleasures are good, in their own place and time, but they eventually fade. ‚ÄúAll flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away.‚Äù Then, a few verses latter, the letter goes on to say, ‚ÄúTherefore‚Ä¶crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good‚Äù (I Peter 1:24-2:3).
V. ‚ÄúCrave pure spiritual milk, so that you my grow up in your salvation.‚Äù
Why does God allow our sanctuaries to die? We needed them at one time, but then He takes them away. They weren‚Äôt meant to be eternal. All these pleasures and comforts are just temporary. They are never good as an end in themselves but as a means to something more. Everything exists to prepare us for something greater and something lasting. In the end, everyone has to let go. Only God remains.
It‚Äôs no different at church.
At seasons in our lives, the church sanctuary serves as a time of peace and joy. We get in routine. We become used to the same faces and same songs. We live in a world with so many changes, after all. It‚Äôs comforting to find a place removed from everything. In the Orthodox Church, we celebrate the same Mass passed down through the centuries since the times of the apostles. It is the same Mass, the same Eucharist, the same Body of Christ. Yet, the forms of music do change, the language, atmosphere, faces change and cultural expectations change, all these come and go. Each generation brings it‚Äôs own expectations and its own pastoral needs. Year by year, like the flow of a stream, everything changes.
Why?
God is jealous. He will allow nothing to remain an idol of the heart. He trains us, gently and strongly, to find our sole sanctuary in Him. He removes our comforts when we are ready, because He wants our affections whole and complete. He wants you.
Church, family, relationships, retreat places, all these can become an idol just as easily as anything else.
So what has died in your life?
God allowed the death. At the other end, He promises life.
VI. ‚ÄúConsider the lilies of the field.‚Äù
What does all this have to do with the lilies and the birds? How does it relate to my story in Greece, and Fr. Xerubim‚Äôs thick advice?
Have you ever noticed how happy Jesus is?
Yes, He has times of real grief and mourning. But those are exceptions. Most of the time, he was simply happy. In every event, He was at peace. There‚Äôs only one explanation.
He had one sanctuary, one love, one heart: God the Father.
VII. We too can find peace if we anchor our hearts to God.
I‚Äôm not sure if Fr. Xerubim‚Äôs words are always true. I suspect some of our problems aren‚Äôt in our head, but most of them most certainly are. Christ‚Äôs message is clear: we can let go.
‚ÄúAim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you get neither‚Äù (C. S. Lewis).
If we spend our lives craving the spiritual milk, then we will be prepared to handle every death.
If we anchor our hearts on God, He will give us a peace, which nothing can take away.
Jesus Christ is the only peace, and a peace ‚Äúwhich passeth all understanding‚Äù (Philippians 4:7).
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.Kpop Idols Ideal Type Age.

Resolution approved to exempt PATA from taxes for 10-Islam Fazl.
The resolution demanded a development package of rs 100 billion for the PATA, same as the FATA region. It also demanded subsidy on electricity.
The resolution also asked for continuation of Sharia justice system in the Malakand Division.
Protesters clash with police outside KP Assembly
Earlier, protesters clashed with police outside the KP assembly over the merger bill. The police are said to have baton-charged the protesters to stop them from entering the assembly building. The police also shelled tear-gas and used water cannons to disperse the protesters.
However, the protesters, who are reported to be members of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl, pelted stones at the police officers.
Five people have sustained minor injuries while as many as 20 people have been detained.
The JUI-F lawmakers had reached the assembly building Sunday morning to besiege it in protest.
Earlier, lawmakers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (PATA) had expressed their reservations over the FATA-KP merger bill.
In wake of the situation, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led provincial government had approached the lawmakers to resolve the building crisis.
It was learnt that 24 MPAs from Malakand Division had expressed their reservations over the content of the bill.
The PATA lawmakers maintain that inclusion of PATA in FATA-KP merger was unjustifiable, and if the government wanted to change the status of PATA it should announce a monetary package for the area.
Meanwhile, KP minister Shaukat Yousafzai had met Federal Law Minister Zafarullah Khan and apprised him on the issues the provincial government faced in getting the bill passed from the assembly.
Yousufzai told media that the federal government had promised to resolve the concerns raised by PATA lawmakers.
Declare PATA, FATA tax-free for 10 years: Asad Qaiser
The concerns of PATA lawmakers have been taken up in a letter that KP Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser wrote to his National Assembly counterpart Ayaz Sadiq, demanding that PATA and FATA be declared as tax-free zones for at least 10 years.
Qaiser stated that the two regions have been exempted from taxes since a long time, which is fair as the areas are badly affected by insurgencies and internal displacement of people due to military operations and natural calamities.
Since the constitutional amendment would result in withdrawal of tax exemptions from the tribal areas, MPAs from PATA have shown concern over passage of the bill, the letter reads.
Qaiser had requested Sadiq to provide the sought exemptions on an urgent basis before voting started on the amended bill in KP Assembly.
Thirty-First Amendment Act, 2018
The National Assembly and Senate had already passed the bill titled Thirty-First Amendment Act, 2018. In the lower house, the bill was moved by Minister for Law and Justice Chaudhry Mahmood Bashir Virk.
Two hundred and twenty-nine parliamentarians voted in favour of the constitutional amendment, while one voted against it. The bill was opposed by government-allied parties JUI-F and Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP).
In Senate, 71 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill while five opposed the constitutional amendment.17September 2021.

Let‚Äôs begin with a Tour de France regular, shall we? On Sunday, George Hincapie finished a record-tying 16 Tours, and he‚Äôs won four stages in the big race along the way. He has won three U.S. national championships. Yes, the man can race a bike. Bike racing is all well and good, but we have way more important things on our minds. Is he hot? Hincapie is 6‚Äô3‚Äù, 170 pounds. He has dark hair and a dimple on his chin. Intrigued yet? You should be. Just wait until you see Hincapie smile. Well, hello there, dreamy!
Is the tall American not quite to your taste? Fear not, we‚Äôve only just begun.
Ladies prefer blonds, am I right? Well, if blond is your thing, look no further than Linus Gerdemann of Leopard Trek. For their team presentation last winter, the Leopard Trek riders rocked the long black manscarf. Not every dude can look hot in a scarf, but Gerdemann did. So stylish. He can also ride a bike fast. Gerdemann won a stage in the 2007 Tour and, thanks to his long day on the attack, pulled on the maillot jaune of race leader. A man in the yellow jersey‚Äîcompletely irresistible, no?
But maybe you find Gerdemann a little too pretty for your liking? Let‚Äôs look further.
If your tastes run to the ruggedly handsome, Thor Hushovd is your man. He‚Äôs tall and blonde. So far so good, right? Piercing blue eyes and a fabulous smile add up to a rather glorious whole. Hushovd is also the world champion. If you think the yellow jersey makes a man hotter than hot, try the rainbow jersey of world champion. Straight to the front of the line! Hushovd won two stages of the Tour de France this year and helped his Garmin-Cervelo squad win the team time trial. Oh, he also wore the yellow jersey for much of the first week. It‚Äôs no surprise really‚ÄîThor has won stages in each of the race‚Äôs past five editions. He‚Äôs a past winner of the green jersey competition to boot. He looks good, and he‚Äôs fast. Still wondering why this Tour de France thing is so awesome? Wonder no longer.
Perhaps you aren‚Äôt a fan of the blond boys. Certainly there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking. Looking for tall, dark, and handsome?
Allow me to introduce you to Ivan Basso, for he is most definitely tall, dark, and handsome. Nicknamed the ‚ÄúSmiling Assassin,‚Äù Basso always smiles a mysterious Mona Lisa smile when he‚Äôs riding fast. What is he thinking with that little smile? Only he knows for sure. A girl could get distracted watching him, that‚Äôs all I know. Last season, Basso won the Giro d‚ÄôItalia, which is exactly like the Tour de France, except that it‚Äôs not in July and it‚Äôs not in France. Details, shmetails. Look for his long Italian legs at the front when the Tour hits the high mountains this year. I bet you won‚Äôt be able to look away.
Still not satisfied? Come on then. Let‚Äôs see who‚Äôs next.
Let‚Äôs continue this tall, dark, and handsome theme, shall we? Bernhard Eisel has serious style, and he likes to laugh. Also, he knows about wine. He once said he would never drink a Chilean wine in a French bistro. Words to live by, right there. Eisel rides as road captain for HTC-Highroad. While he has never won a stage of the Tour de France, his teammate Mark Cavendish has won now 20, which is quite a lot when it comes right down to it. Eisel is happy if he wins one race a year for himself. Selfless and sexy, what more could a girl wish for?
But you‚Äôre still skeptical, aren‚Äôt you. I hear you muttering: She promised me hot men if I kept reading, and here I am reading, and I‚Äôm not seeing the hot men, and would she get on with it already. Don‚Äôt think I can‚Äôt hear you over there. Next!
Tom Boonen has one of those secret smiles like he knows something you don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs nothing like a little mystery to add to a man‚Äôs allure, is there? Boonen‚Äôs chiseled legs, which have won Paris-Roubaix on three separate occasions, don‚Äôt hurt either. Boonen is also a past world champion and has won six stages at the Tour de France. Winning, so hot. Not good enough? Boonen once posed as a Roman gladiator in leather for his shoe sponsor Northwave. What do gladiators wear under their armor? Ponder that one for a moment, or several. Also, hot men in leather. Is it a little warm in here? I think it‚Äôs a little warm in here.
.
More Italians! There must be something in the water there in Italy. Meet Alessandro Petacchi. Nicknamed the ‚ÄúGentleman Sprinter,‚Äù Petacchi is the strong, silent type. He also has a vicious turn of speed in the final kilometer. If winning races makes the man, Petacchi has it made. He‚Äôs won six stages of the Tour de France and the green jersey. Petacchi has also won 22 stages of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia, that race that‚Äôs like the Tour, only it‚Äôs in Italy.

An important part of Andra‚Äôs international business mission is participation in the project development. It can be a repository design project, siting studies, development of waste acceptance criteria or a reference waste inventory, to name but a few.
Andra typically takes the position of a partner in a consortium or a subcontractor where the task is relatively small. Andra is able to undertake continuous engagement for several months or even years and to guarantee the availability of its experts to fully participate in the project, by attending project progress meetings, working on a specific task or a document or reviewing project deliverables. Most of the time, it is the international department that ensures the coordination of Andra‚Äôs participation and the liaison between its experts and the rest of the project team and the final beneficiary, providing organizational assistance, deadline and progress monitoring and quality assurance. Such way of international cooperation is one of the most effective means to share Andra‚Äôs experience and to contribute directly to new projects in the radwaste management sphere.
Nuclear safety that translates into operational and post-closure (long-term) safety demonstration is the true know-how of the agency, along with the waste acceptance criteria and operational facility management and monitoring; hence, the projects tasks undertaken by Andra are most often related to those technical or scientific fields.
To date, Andra has taken part in several such projects. To list some examples:
- Near-surface repository technical design for Ignalina NPP, Lithuania
- Deep Geological Repository project, Belgium
- Near-surface repository project design and safety demonstration, South Korea
- Near surface repository, Italy
- Near surface repository (silo), Slovenia
- Dismantling project (and waste management), Bulgaria
- Siting project, Poland

Must be logged in to commentof doctors and their specialization helps.
In this post, we want to have a quick look at seven different kinds of doctors and their specialization. We will dig a bit deeper into what they do and how they can help you.
1 ‚Äì Ophthalmologist
An ophthalmologist is also referred to as an eye doctor. Sometimes people get confused between an optometrist and an ophthalmologist. The difference is that optometrists aren‚Äôt doctors. Instead, they are certified to do eye tests, dispense with corrective eyewear and vision aids. An ophthalmologist, on the other hand, is a medical doctor specializing in eye and vision care.
Some duties required by ophthalmologists in the field of eye care include:
- Performing corrective eye surgery for near and far-sighted patients. LASIK surgery is one of the surgical procedures for corrective vision.
- Eye doctors prescribe the medication for treatment after or before surgery. The medication also forms part of eye care management.
- Ophthalmologists work closely with the optometrist to further improve the patient‚Äôs eye health.
- Eye MD‚Äôs also diagnose and treat all eye diseases in patients
- An ophthalmologist also treats eye injuries and conditions which may occur in their patients.
- Manage eye clinics and their outpatients
- They also holistically treat medical conditions that result in eye diseases.
Essential skills of an ophthalmologist include complete knowledge of eye anatomy and related diseases. In addition to medical skills, the eye doctor also needs to have good maths, physics, and administration in their skills. Be a good listener and able to work with nervous and anxious patients. Adapt and continue training and learning about the latest advances in medical eye care. Precision is vital when it comes to working with medical tools. All doctors need precision skills.
2- Chiropractor
Chiropractors specialize in everything related to the nervous system and the musculoskeletal system. When it comes to sore muscles, aches, sprains, and correcting spinal curvature, you can head over to a chiropractor.
A disability attorney may be one of the people who could ask you to retain your receipts from your chiropractor. For example, you sustained an injury at work and had to get chiropractic treatment to help the healing. These expenses may be reimbursed when a settlement is won.
Different kinds of doctors and their specialization is extensive. Some duties and specialties of a chiropractic doctor include, but are not limited to the following:
- Chiropractors must be able to assess and identify visual conditions in their patients.
- Chiros conduct tests and examinations to rule out possible diseases or degenerating eye illnesses.
- Chiropractors must be able to analyze and examine their patient‚Äôs spines. Checking for poor posture is critical to lead to the root cause of back pain.
- Chiropractor doctors make plenty of spinal, back, and joint adjustments. This is one of the most critical skills.
- While chiropractic treatment is non-invasive and drug-free, sometimes it forms part of a patient‚Äôs larger physiotherapy process.
Chiros can also advise their patients about certain lifestyle habits that could possibly be a factor that could contribute to their pain. Lifestyle changes are often part of the process with a chiro.
Different kinds of doctors and their specialization, including the skills of a chiropractic doctor: Have the ability to listen well, adapt to changes, and improve technologies. Chiros must work with nervous and uncomfortable patients, as well as have excellent communication skills.
3- Audiologist
An audiology specialist, just like their title suggests, is highly versed in dealing with everything related to hearing. Your local audiologist has a huge responsibility when it comes to hearing conditions. Just like their other medical peers, they need to identify certain hearing conditions or problems before they progress. Audiologists also treat conditions and infections that result in hearing loss. Most of all, they need to advise their patients of treatment options.
An audiologist is responsible for the following:
‚Ä¢ Audiologists examine whether their patients have problems with balance and hearing. There are tests involved as well as treatment and monitoring of the treatment.
‚Ä¢ The ear doctor should also be able to advise their patients. These doctors know about suitable treatment, possible surgery recommendations, whether a specific hearing aid or other assistive hearing technology.
‚Ä¢ Audiology doctors should advise patients and their families (where possible) of communication systems. Some people will need lip reading or sign language, depending on the level of their hearing loss.
Help educate patients on factors of hearing loss.
Skills for an audiologist: The audiologist specialist must be able to work with patients from all walks of life. Their communications must be clear, and they should stay abreast with the new treatments and technology related to hearing loss. Different kinds of doctors and their specialization like audiologists, deal with patients of different ages.
4- Dentist
Dentists are responsible for helping their patients maintain a healthy smile. They may do minor surgery and may also specialize in cosmetic dentistry. Some dentists only focus on general dentistry.
An orthodontist is a further trained dentist. Oral care professionals will continue studying in the field of teeth alignment. Prescribing suitable headgear and facemasks are also some of the tools by orthodontists.
It‚Äôs easy to confuse orthodontics with orthotics. Orthotics relate to the treatment of foot problems and the medical devices used to manage them.
Some of the responsibilities of dentists include the following:
‚Ä¢ Skilled in general dentistry (extractions, fillings, dentistry endodontics, cleaning, and corrective dentistry)
‚Ä¢ An orthodontist will branch further into another dental sector that focuses on tooth misalignment. They will also deal with speech defects, complications with chewing, retainers, and fitting braces.
‚Ä¢ Dentists also remove plaque build-up, prescribe dentures, take impressions, make crowns, and secure bridges
‚Ä¢ A dentist can operate an x-ray machine and prescribe antibiotics to their patients if needed.
‚Ä¢ Teeth whitening, veneers, overlays, and underlays.
Some of the skills for dentistry include; excellent communication with patients, ability to work with nervous patients. Able to perform dentistry on children and seniors. Knowledge of machinery and tools used in the dental practice.
5- OBY/GYN ‚Äì Ostentation and gynecologist
Different kinds of doctors and their specialization includes multiple skilled and dedicated professionals. The OBY/GYN specialists play a vital role in managing and preparing mothers to be. But, they are not only there to support expecting mothers, they further help with the birthing process and sometimes home care visitations.
The OBY/GYN is specialized in the reproductive organs of a woman. They also focus on the wellness of the baby. And the pregnancy.
Some of the responsibilities of an obstetrician and gynecologist include:
- Minor laser surgeries
- Being able to diagnose and treat diseases in patients
- Obstetricians, more than gynecologists, assist women who want to get pregnant. They may prescribe prenatal and fertility drugs and will work closely with the couple on their journey.
- The OBY/GYN is responsible for monitoring the mother and baby‚Äôs health throughout the pregnancy.
- OBY/GYN specialists work in hospitals, maternity wards, clinics, and sometimes practice privately.
Some important skills for ostentations and gynecologists include. Excellent communication, ability to reassure patients in difficult situations. Be able to think on their feet. Precision is critical for the surgery and delivery of babies.OBY/GYN doctors are able to work under stress and pressure.
6- Dermatologist
A dermatologist is a doctor specializing in all things skin. Whether a patient has a skin condition or is merely looking for a prescription to treat severely dry skin, a dermatologist is a doctor for you. Comparing different kinds of doctors and their specialization, you‚Äôll find the one that is suited to your health concerns.
Furthermore, a dermatologist is also responsible for the following:
- Diagnosing and treating skin diseases and conditions.
- The skin doctor may also need to conduct minor non-invasive surgery on the skin.
- Dermatologists can prescribe topical and oral treatments for their patients.
- Evaluation and examination of a patient‚Äôs skin condition to find the root cause and treatment for the condition.
- Skin practitioners are also responsible for monitoring the progress of any treatment they prescribe. Not all treatments work the same way for every patient.
- Provide medical advice to the patient to help improve and manage their skin condition from their home. Or on their own.
Some skills that dermatologists need in their career include, but are not limited to; precision while using special tools. They should have the ability to speak to patients effectively and reassure them if they are feeling distressed.
7- Psychiatrist
Psychiatrists play an integral role in helping their patient‚Äôs mental wellness and relationships with others. They are specialized in monitoring their patient‚Äôs wellness on a broad scale which includes physical well-being too.
When thinking about different kinds of doctors and their specialization, psychiatrists play a fundamental role in society. The same can be said for all doctors, including general practitioners (GP).
Some responsibilities of psychiatrists include but are not limited to, the following:
- Evaluating possible mental illnesses
- Diagnosing mental conditions and prescribing medication and further treatment
- Psychiatrists also carefully monitor their patients to ensure that they are getting the treatment they need to get well. They will also monitor the treatment‚Äôs side effects and if it‚Äôs working for the patient.
- The psychiatrist may also offer lifestyle changes to help the patients heal from the inside out.
- Psychiatrists are skilled at working with patients who are borderline suicidal. Some patients may have personality disorders like schizophrenia.
- Provide patients with solutions to help them transition into life as normally as possible. This is mainly for patients with PTSD and other mental conditions that alter their lives and the effect on the people around them.
The skills of a psychiatrist are very critical; they need to be able to analyze their patients closely to pick up any danger signs. They must be level-headed and able to solve various emotional and even certain physical problems that the patient may face.
General practitioner
While general practitioners, or GP‚Äôs for short, are doctors too, they don‚Äôt specialize in a specific medical field. GP‚Äôs help deal with a broad spectrum of medical concerns, whether treating diseases, common cold, flu, anxiety, skin problems, and minor surgery. General doctors are the ones that cover everything.
Unlike specialist doctors, general practitioners may not earn the same equivalent. While every specialized field will differ from one to the next. As a patient, you may pay more to a specialist than a GP. In the same way, the general practitioner will refer their patients to a specialist when there are more complex treatments needed.
Oftentimes, the general practitioner is the ‚Äúfirst response‚Äù to many medical conditions. Whether they work in the ER or run their own practice.
Conclusion to noticing the different kinds of doctors and their specialization
Assessing all the above-mentioned different kinds of doctors and their specialization a few things are clear. All doctors need to have excellent communication skills. They need to be comfortable working with nervous and non-nervous patients. Likewise, doctors should be compassionate and show empathy towards their patients.
Another thing all doctors have in common is that they are constantly learning. Doctors often have to adapt to changes and discoveries within their field of specialty. This could include new technologies and also newly discovered diseases and health conditions.
Finding a good doctor isn‚Äôt that hard. Finding one that you‚Äôre comfortable and looking forward to keeping as your specialized doctor is another kettle of fish. For most people, once they‚Äôve found the one they trust and feel comfortable with, they won‚Äôt be keen on changing medical professionals all the time.Green Bay police seeks man who fired gun into the air
GREEN BAY - Green Bay Police are searching for man who fired a single shot in the 1400 block of Admiral Court Wednesday afternoon.
Officers responded to a call of a single shot fired at 4:13 p.m., said Lt. Thomas Denney. The man fired the gun into the air during a disturbance that involved a large number of people.
It is unknown how many people were involved or what the disturbance was about, Denney said.
Several of those involved, including the suspect, fled the scene before officers arrived.
A police dog was used to track the man but was unable to locate him, Denney said. It is believed the man got into a car and left the scene.
Two people who were detained by officers took off and were found at an apartment on Plymouth Lane, Denney said. They are now cooperating with police.
"We haven't found any bullet holes in buildings or cars or anything like that. We really don't expect to at this point based on the fact it was fired straight up," Denney said.

August 10, 2021
South African consumers are heading online in greater numbers as the e-commerce shopping experience increasingly offers more choice and convenience than can be found at traditional big-brand, brick-and-mortar retailers, says Mike Farquharson, Managing Director of online courier aggregator Rush.
Statista market and consumer data projects that 31.6 million South Africans could be converted to online shopping by 2024. According to FNB, the average e-commerce spend already increased by 30 percent in the first half of 2020 compared to the year prior while Rand Merchant Bank expects the sector‚Äôs value to surge by 150 percent, to R225 billion, within the next five years. ‚ÄúThese findings suggest that shifts in shopper behaviour towards online stores are becoming more permanent as consumers elect to spend at smaller, independent retailers for niche products, first rate service, and quick delivery,‚Äù notes Farquharson.
He says that thanks to game-changing technologies which have revolutionised logistics and supply chains the world over, independent retailers can compete with their larger peers in ways that weren‚Äôt possible just a few short years ago. ‚ÄúAlong with advances in technology, more informed and sceptical consumers are holding retailers to higher standards. Small, e-commerce sites have a distinct advantage in that they can harness shopper loyalty through total customer-centricity and excellent service levels throughout the customer journey, including the all-important delivery ‚Äòlast-mile‚Äô.‚Äù
That consumers have access to more options and unprecedented amounts of information at their fingertips is well known. Farquharson says this makes getting the basics right very important. ‚ÄúAn e-commerce business‚Äô success depends upon speedy and proper delivery of products. The Rush platform allows online retailers to find a reputable, cost effective courier partner within seconds. Thanks to monumental changes in the sector, e-commerce deliveries have evolved from taking days or weeks to complete, to a day or even less.‚Äù
Farquharson adds that as large retailers grapple with how to nurture and retain customers, independent e-commerce players are leading the way with speedy, superior service. ‚ÄúThe numbers prove that shoppers will trust an e-commerce site if they provide proper delivery of quality products. Rush ensures e-tailers have a choice of the best courier partners that are fast, safe, secure, and trustworthy. South Africa‚Äôs online retail sector shows real promise for long term growth potential, and the recent boom in online spending and adoption is great news for small South African businesses making a difference to our economy.‚Äù

Unmasking Sexual Depression, Healing and Winning the Battle Within. Free Yourself from Yourself, by Loving Yourself!
A personal message from the author:
The reason for me writing this book is because of sexual PTSD, Trauma, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. It's no fun being trapped within yourself due to the cause of someone else's doing. People today are looking for an outlet to fix themselves without being confronted with negative actions or remarks from others. I walked many paths over the years. From listening to others, groups, and family members I never really got advice, help that was clear and beneficial. I had to learn everything on my own due to insufficient teaching as a child. Over time I learned that a lot of my problems came from trusting myself or judgments against myself. I had to figure this out on my own cause it was truly hard to accept anyone in my life new or old. Today, I am in a better position with myself and my loved ones after being open and truthful with myself. So I wrote this book hoping to reach others in similar situations.
‚Äî Lavender Jones news is that blaming yourself, feeling defective and helpless are NOT reality. As difficult as it must seem, there are strategies and techniques that will help you come to terms with the unfortunate circumstances in your life so you can regain your sense of trust and safety, and learn how to heal and move forward in your life.
Understanding Sexual Repression/Depression .
- Shame around any form of nudity
- Discomfort or shock when viewing anything sexual on TV or in the movies
- Shaming you for sexually expressing yourself in any way (i.e., You dirty boy, take your hand off of there!‚Äù),
- Dirty, bad, and/or wrong labels for sex (Dirty magazines)
- Anything having to do with sexuality is a family secrets, stiff gender roles, and punishment for any type of sexual expression

One of the greatest challenges parents face is sibling rivalry. If you do become a parent coach who can give parents help in this area, you will never lack for clients. Some parents struggle with siblings who fight more than others, but if you become a life coach who helps parents instruct their children in some basic skills you will give them more than hope. You will change the atmosphere of their lives by teaching these three basic parent coaching skills.
Three Basic Skills to Become a Life Coach Who Has Also Become a Parent Coach
1. Become a parent coach who helps parents see their children‚Äôs needs for achieving belonging. One of the four basics needs we all have is for love and connection. When you become a life coach it‚Äôs clear, but often parents don‚Äôt recognize this need as the basis of sibling rivalry. In fact, children prefer the negative attention that they get when they fight rather than to have no attention at all. Become a parent coach who helps parents satisfy their children‚Äôs needs by letting their children know it‚Äôs ok to ask for attention, give attention to behavior you would like to see more of, and give your children messages that affirm that you like to be with them and that you love them.
2. Become a parent coach who helps parents see that children also fight with their siblings to achieve significance. As children grow, the start recognizing that there are some things they have control over and some things that they don‚Äôt. Become a life coach who recognizes that we all have a need to feel significant. Help parents show their children how to feel special, valued, needed and unique in other ways than fighting.
3. Become a parent coach who helps parents recognize children need certainty. Certainty is safety, but also control over what will happen. Become a life coach who helps parents show children that they have some control over which toys they will share with their siblings, and which ones they won‚Äôt. Instead of insisting that an older sibling share his best crayons with his younger brother who may break them, have a box that both children can share.
Whether You Become a Life Coach or Become a Parent Coach, You Need to Truly Offer Value
If you can transfer the skills you learned to become a life coach to parents, you will become a parent coach who truly offers value. As children learn these skills, you will be helping to prepare them to go out into the world and share with others. They will become the next generation of leaders.

Hybrid thermal-PV solar trough collectors combine concentrated photovoltaics and concentrated solar power technology to harvest and store solar energy. In this work, the optical and mechanical requirements for optimal efficiency are analyzed using non-sequential ray tracing techniques. The results are used to generate opto-mechanical tolerances that can be compared to those of traditional solar collectors. We also explore ideas on how to relieve tracking tolerances for single-axis solar collectors. The objective is to establish a basis for tolerances required for the fabrication and manufacturing of hybrid solar trough collectors.

This kind of trading program makes use of statistical algorithms to match large amounts of clean and historical data produce informed trading decisions. It has many positive aspects over traditional data analysis strategies such as tendency analysis, marketplace observation, and regression analysis and possesses proven to be a helpful and trustworthy way to build investment decisions. The following document will talk about how this kind of technology can benefit common people by making purchase decisions and increasing fluid.
Probably the most distinctive options that come with this system can be its usage of complex numerical algorithms to visit the up coming webpage meet trading guidelines with external factors. Because system functions on mathematically worked out trading guidelines, it is important that traders can successfully deal with intense inputs. Because all decisions are made on mathematical equations, there is no space for person error or emotions in the trading process. By using the bitcoin Era, an investor can ensure that he is not really making risky decisions because of whims or perhaps hunches. This system has proved to be remarkably accurate in the predictions and accuracy in doing trades.
This system also permits the use of a ‚Äúrobot, ‚Äù which is essentially a software program or software application that a trader can easily install on his computer. The robot serves as a protocol between the dealer and the trading parameters, actors as a website link between the dealer and the marketplace. In many ways, this kind of robot ensures that the correct trading parameters happen to be chosen, which may dramatically enhance the probability of success in the trader. The use of a robot could also significantly decrease the amount of time an investor must use analyzing market data or interpreting information personally in order to obtain successful trades. This diminishes the work load on the trader and improves his likelihood of making rewarding decisions.
As detailed in the previous section, the use of this algorithmically influenced trading parameters generation computer software is particularly beneficial for newer dealers who can be unfamiliar with the workings of your market. The bitcoin era app automates a great deal of the task, allowing actually beginners to produce profitable investments with only a couple of minutes of. With only a couple of clicks of the mouse, you can actually generate trading parameters and place them into place on your personal trading program. All that‚Äôs needed are the labels and account numbers of the traders you wish to place the trades with.
Even though the popularity and ease of access of this fresh trading platform can be increasing tremendously, there are still some aspects of the platform that require learning in order to become good. The most important part of the software app is how it pays away incentives to traders that reach a specific threshold of performance. The threshold may differ depending on the certain platform applied, but the basic concept is the fact a trader will be compensated for getting to a set range of profitable trades. To put it simply, the greater trades performed by a dealer, the more funds that will be generated in earnings. However , the payout fee can be impacted by various elements such as the amount of trading wins an investor has, as well as the size of his or her bankroll. It is important to remember it does not matter what, if you are not producing a profit at a rate higher than 3% annualized, then you certainly will not be qualified to continue to get incentive repayments.
This essentially means that in order to continue receiving the incentive payments, you must have a top winning percentage or a wide range of cash to payout the incentive fees. Thankfully, there are several different varieties of robots which can help traders gain both of these desired goals. One of the hottest and best applications utilizes an artificial intelligence program called the Forex Megadroid, which was produced by an investment banking organization called IvyBot. The Fx Megadroid is certainly four software in one, with each an individual designed to control at varied times depending on pre-set, highly-respectively criteria to ensure that every single robot obtains an equal quantity of trading indicators and pays out equally.

TGCT, also referred to as pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) or giant cell tumour of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS), is a non-malignant tumour of the joint or tendon sheath, which can be locally aggressive and debilitating in some patients. There are no currently approved systemic therapies for TGCT.

Today we‚Äôll talk about what makes cannabis different. The main difference between medical and recreational weed is its legal status. What does it mean?
‚Ä¢ In order to legally purchase and also be able to use medical marijuana, you need a prescription from your doctor (in different countries, the indications for the use of cannabis for medical purposes differ significantly).
‚Ä¢ To buy recreational cannabis, in countries where it is legal, you only need an identification card so that the seller can be sure that he is an adult buyer and nothing else.
Some also classify weed as recreational or medicinal, depending on the purposes and methods of using this miraculous herb, which helps with many diseases, but we will talk about that a little later.
As for the legalization and the difference between medical and recreational marijuana. It is known that back in 2012, the states of Colorado and Washington became the first to legalize recreational marijuana. Prior to this, cannabis was legal in some states only for those with qualifying medical conditions and prescriptions to use it legally. As more and more states follow in the footsteps of Washington and Colorado, ‚Äúrecreational‚Äù or ‚Äúadult use‚Äù has become a widely used term for personal cannabis consumption that is not exclusively medical. But besides the difference in consumer intent, what other differences are there between medical and recreational cannabis?
Difference between Medical Marijuana and Recreational Cannabis Buying Experience
When it comes to shopping itself, medical and entertainment stores tend to offer similar products. When purchasing marijuana, qualified medical patients present as their ID, which shows their age in order to buy marijuana. They also show their valid medical record for cannabis use. Some medical stores have a waiting room where patients are called one at a time so that everything is confidential and no one can hear what they are talking about.
Medical centers and licensed stores are dedicated to answering patients‚Äô questions, especially those that provide an opportunity to educate their future clients, such as workshops on the correct use of cannabis. Don‚Äôt be afraid to check information from multiple centers or stores at once until you find the best option with well-trained staff with who you can communicate within a professional manner.
As for the difference between marijuana and medical marijuana, there is usually a very small menu. In any type of store, you are bound to find shelves filled with a variety of food, drinks, topics, and concentrates.
Different states and benefits for the difference between recreational and medical weed. Patients may receive certain benefits that are not available to recreational consumers. They usually include:
‚Ä¢ Reduced costs and taxes
‚Ä¢ Higher limits of THC concentration
‚Ä¢ Higher quantitative limits
‚Ä¢ Legal access for minors in authorized medical cases (such as cancer or epilepsy)
‚Ä¢ Medical patients may be allowed to grow their own cannabis (or higher numbers of plants are allowed than recreational users).
Medical Marijuana vs Recreational
It is difficult to say that the medical or recreational use of marijuana is better. It all depends on what medical vs recreational purposes you will use this plant for. Let‚Äôs dwell on this in more detail and consider what medical vs recreational marijuana is for.
Benefits of Recreational Marijuana Use
Is medical weed better? Let‚Äôs figure it out. Medical cannabis is hemp cones or concentrates or synthetic cannabinoids intended for therapeutic use as recreational weed vs medical weed. The active substances found in the buds and leaves of cannabis, which scientists have dubbed cannabinoids, exhibit a wide range of medicinal properties. In particular, medical marijuana has been shown to have a proven pain reliever in cancer patients and HIV-infected people receiving antiretroviral therapy. It is possible that cannabis slows down the growth of cancerous tumors and has a neuroprotective effect in the stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and Huntington‚Äôs disease.
In the world of psychiatric practice, there is an experience of the successful application of the difference between medical marijuana and street marijuana, where, after all, medical marijuana was used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Privately, a therapist may recommend smoking weed to reduce anxiety and reduce stress. After that, the question may arise: is weed the same as marijuana? In a sense, yes, but their differences begin after the dose and the intended use.
What is medical vs recreational potency? With chronic pain, spastic syndrome and increased convulsive readiness, foci of pathological activity arise in the cerebral cortex, which the body cannot cope with on its own. Entering the body from the outside, plant and synthetic cannabinoids bind free receptors and stop the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid, one of the leading neurotransmitters. As a result, the excitement is not transmitted to the higher nerve centers and gradually dies out. Curiously, reflexes with negative reinforcement associated with pain and fear are primarily suppressed, and the general inhibitory effect, causing temporary disorders of memory and attention, is manifested only with frequent use of medical marijuana vs recreational marijuana in high doses.
In March 2021, New York City joined a number of US states and countries to legalize the use of marijuana for non-medical purposes. However, there is no international consensus on this issue. For example, the UN International Committee is against the use of cannabis without medical indications, so it is useful to know the difference between medical marijuana and recreational marijuana.
Recreational marijuana is prized for its psychoactive properties, seeking pleasure in the process of use. People who suffer from certain diseases hope that marijuana will help them cope with various pains and other consequences of diseases, and maybe even completely recover.
If you do not suffer from severe back pain, you do not have cancer or Parkinson‚Äôs disease, then here is a new difference between medical marijuana vs street marijuana. Chances are, if you do not have these diseases, then recreational use is suitable for you. This means that the dosage you will be prescribed will be much lower, and the THC content will also be lower.
Recreational marijuana use can help if you are under severe stress, headaches, and migraines, this is what medical and recreational weed is all about.
Also, recreational marijuana is good for managing insomnia. With the right dosage, you will fall asleep harder and faster, your anxiety will decrease, and cramps or muscle spasms will go away.
As for medical vs recreational quality, nothing can be said for sure. It can be assumed that marijuana, prescribed by a doctor and issued to you in a special dispensary, will be of higher quality and safer than street marijuana. This is the confrontation between medical weed vs street weed.
The creators of the article were happy to share with you such an important topic as the difference between medical marijuana and recreational marijuana. Many people do not know the simple difference between these two phenomena, so we hope that now you understand what the essence is. Use marijuana only as prescribed by your doctor, be healthy!

Photo: Youtube August in which Ukrainian troops were marching alongside representatives of Ukraine‚Äôs NATO partners used to be a yearly tradition in 2014-2018 during the tenure of his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, amid the war with Russia in Ukraine‚Äôs eastern provinces that has been cindering to this day since the late spring of 2014 and the ongoing Russian occupation of Ukraine‚Äôs Crimean peninsula.
Zelenskyy‚Äôs reasoning for replacing the parade with entertainment events was that the money spent for organizing a parade would be better used to pay bonuses to military staff (2019) and that a big parade should be held when Ukraine wins in the war (2020).
Both years, veterans, military volunteers, and families of KIA held their unofficial parades on Independence Day.
This year, on Ukraine‚Äôs 30th Independence Anniversary, something changed. Military parades will be held in Kyiv, Dnipro, and Odesa, including in the Black Sea. For the first time, all the forces and equipment of Ukraine‚Äôs defense sector will be involved ‚Äî i.e. the Army, Navy, and Air Forces. In a break with the two previous years, Ukraine‚Äôs international partners, namely from Canada, the USA, Estonia, the United Kingdom, Georgia, and Denmark participated as well.

Somehow I was convinced to try doing 11 minutes of Sarbang Dande Kriya every day for a year. I‚Äôm so glad. In the last two months of this daily practice, my entire consciousness has totally shifted. Things that seemed impossible are now totally happening. This kriya has immense benefits for the physical body but it also works on the other 9 bodies too, so it‚Äôs extremely effective for shifting your entire perception of reality‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs working on many levels of your being at once.
The best instruction out there on the internet is from my friend Harimander. Check out his video for complete instructions on doing this correctly. It‚Äôs an easy repetitive pattern but it‚Äôs important to get the breath right.
If you are like me and don‚Äôt historically really enjoy exercise and therefore kind of out of shape.. this kriya is for YOU! 11 minutes every day and you can change your whole relationship to your body ‚Äì to all 10 bodies. Just set the timer and show up. Do it at the pace you can and just accept where you are at. Go slow, like I do, or take rests as needed. Commit to showing up for the 11 minutes daily and you will see improvement, in all areas.
If you are NOT like me, and already pretty fit, this kriya is also for you! This kriya is a sophisticated technology that will work you out in an entirely new way. Because Kundalini Yoga is a 10 body system, you are getting many more benefits than a regular workout. Try it for 40 days to start and see for yourself.
I‚Äôm committed to doing this for a year, thanks to the birthday request of my teacher Harijiwan. He said if we wanted to get him a present, to just do this every day for a year. Somehow that request got through my thick skull and I just went for it. I‚Äôm so incredibly glad I did. I can‚Äôt tell you enough how deep an impact this has had on my life. I wish for you the same. Keep up and let me know how it goes üôÇ
Instructions (from Harimander‚Äôs Youtube) :
Between the veins and the arteries, spaced every few inches, are tiny valves. This is how the blood gets circulated through the system. These valves are responsible for the rejuvenation of the cells in the body. In this exercise the spine is worked from one vertebra to the other so that if there are any stoppages, they will get worked out. When these valves get stopped up and don‚Äôt work, the area that isn‚Äôt receiving the blood gets sick. This kriya is good for menstrual problems, digestion, eye troubles, circulation and anything that ails you.
There are three postures to the kriya:
1. Triangle Pose. Heels pressed to the floor, separated by one foot, palms flat on the ground.
2. Platform Pose. Face down and body flat, parallel to the floor. Only the hands and feet touch the ground.
3. Cobra Pose. Arms straight, head up. Lower body remains down. Toes stay in place; do not roll onto top of feet.
Inhale in position (1) then exhale and go into position (2), Inhale into position (3) and then exhale back to position (1). Repeat.
Be sure to Tune in with Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo 3 x before beginning.
Sat Nam, Jamila! Thank you for writing about this challenge . The one year mark is quickly approaching, can you believe it? I am hard pressed to imagine another practice more fortifying and clarifying than this one has been for 2020. Holy moly, what an anchor. God bless Harijiwan!
Your work is gorgeous! Hope you‚Äôre well.
Sending love your way from St. Thomas, USVI ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
Thanks so much for your comment ! YES! What a perfect challenge and anchor for this time. I am SO grateful I got on this one and stuck with it! Amazing almost a year‚Ä¶

‚ÄúA rapidly growing health care unit has been falling victim to many of the organizations policies and practices. ‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏õ‡πÅ‡∏≠‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏¢‡πá‡∏î The first dollar of health care cost is the most crucial factor, but most offices have barriers that prevent staff from filling positions outside their department.
Many health care offices have assigned a single HR department to recruiting, interviewing and scheduling applicants. Even when filling a position in a unit that has one human resources department, there are many factors to consider in evaluating applicants such as skills, knowledge, experience, self esteem and availability.
Paying higher wages is not the method of lowering costs or managing costs but rather, to attain a higher profit per purchaser or obtaining a higher ROI. My goal is to enhance the contribution we make to the community.‚Äù
But, staff in the current system believe that the ‚Äì ‚ÄúNew Health Care pay rate as a reward for filling a position ‚Äì sucks‚Äùo target from the deed of a kind-hearted doctor‚Äù suggested them, while ‚Äì ‚Äúunfair billing practices are thought to have caused significant revenue degradation and a deficit by about one million health care jobs leaving, according to the Advisory Committee (pKarely and Limit), a health care consulting firm.‚Äù
As this offshoot of two-income families, we get their appeal.
Anra Yocokos of AHP NewspOLD.com, stated that 63 percent of health care departments in the agency report a intrigue in competitive pay scales and hourly rates, appear to demonstrate a contrast toward the higher-priced medical transcriptionist. ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Æ‡∏¥‡∏ï Comparing wages against cost-of-living in multiple regions on the U.S. Gulf Coast, she continued to lament a kind reconciliation of these points among authors, in rate quotes. Even so, competitive bureau numbers simply don‚Äôt get it. I would doubt that around 4 out of 10 physicians would change their practice, even if they could get a better pay. Here‚Äôs what they could do to minimize their ‚Äúincome shock moment.‚Äù
Here is their solution:
1) Give the exceptional employer the maximum visibility. This will make the company more competitive.
2) Target them. ‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏≠‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢ Employers like to pick up the preferred employer clients whenever possible.
3) Take note on how they provide such attention to their applicants. Is the firm taking into account an applicant for, say, the Swcharge basement uncomfortable uncomfort
Hog syndrome or is it theÔøΩ hygienist getting sick?
Do not rush to pick up a ha fumble, which might not even be worthy of picking up under consideration. The haulers are being put at financial risk, in the event their truck gets rejected.
Secondly, you should be careful not to assume an interviewer is being honest. There is something wrong in the way the sign says ‚Äúwe are different.‚Äù You can assume much.s others of the profession will say.
Lastly, interviewers using close depicting questions might not be thinking, ‚ÄúDid you lack sleep, drove at an unusual hour, and you finished yesterday at 4:00 PM?‚Äù
Do not panoptomose blame on the office‚Äôs policies or procedures. Be objective. ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢ If an interviewer is ployng to make their job harder DOES THAT make them evil? Out complaints fold far too far to be meaningful practically, especially to employers or anyone.

We have gone back to school after a 7 week summer break. At the beginning of the break, I was like, ‚Äú7 weeks! I don‚Äôt want to miss school for 7 weeks!‚Äù. The week before we returned to school I was like, ‚Äú7 weeks!! I don‚Äôt want to go back to school after 7 weeks!!‚Äù. It was so nice to have a break from studying and just be a mom and wife. We had a great break. We traveled the area a little, visited the beach a few times, even had a group come down from one of our supporting churches. It was really great to have visitors.
Well, we have completed 2 weeks since we returned. I think we‚Äôre adjusting well to jumping back in. Yesterday, I gave my first devotional in portuguese for class. It is certainly a different experience giving a devotional in a language that I speak like a preschooler. Really what it consisted of was thinking in english in words I could translate into portuguese and writing them on paper. It was more of a 3 minute testimony about a passage that is dear to my heart than it was a devotional. I actually thought it was way too fluffy and it seriously annoyed me, but it was as far as my current portuguese would take me! Then the actual presentation itself was simply reading the written out devotional in portuguese. I‚Äôm not sure how I did, but it was kinda cool to talk about the Lord in a different language!

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll share more about it in blogs to come.

‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Got Talent‚Äù closed its 13th season on NBC by shedding the singers.
The winner was magician Shin Lim, who performs astounding tricks with cards. He upped his showmanship on Tuesday‚Äôs last performance show. When the results were announced, he looked stunned and thanked everyone.
He wins $1 million and will headline the ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Got Talent Live‚Äù stage show Nov. 2-4 at the Paris Theater at Paris Las Vegas.
Placing second was the dance troupe Zurcaroh, which impressed viewers with epic routines just right for Las Vegas.
Electric violinist Brian King Joseph came in third. He opened Tuesday‚Äôs show, which may have reduced the voting for him. The audience grew steadily during that two-hour show.
Comedian Samuel J. Comroe, who used his Tourette syndrome as a source of inspired humor, came in fourth.
Singer Michael Ketterer placed fifth. ‚ÄúAGT‚Äù creator Simon Cowell seemed stunned that Ketterer, his golden buzzer, was ejected.
The vote was one of the closest in an ‚ÄúAGT‚Äù final, host Tyra Banks revealed.
In another surprise, Ketterer took the last spot in the final five over Courtney Hadwin, the 14-year-old rocker who channels Janis Joplin. She had been considered a front-runner, but many fans complained that she received favorable treatment from the show.
Make no mistake: Fans decide the outcome on ‚ÄúAGT.‚Äù
The other finalists were singer Daniel Emmet, trapeze act Duo Transcend, singer Glennis Grace and comedian Vicki Barbolak. The splashy finale featured Placido Domingo, Kiss and David Spade.
Over on CBS, ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù provided a huge plot twist. Diminutive dancer JC finally won a head of household contest and saved himself from certain eviction.
He will make the final three, and that will allow him to force out one of the three other players in a strong alliance: lifeguard Tyler, fitness model Angela or professional football player Kaycee.
If Tyler goes, wow. He has been portrayed as the season‚Äôs mastermind.
The next eviction will be revealed in the episode at 9 p.m. Thursday.
The winner will be named Sept. 26.
Latest TV Guy
Host Julie Chen opened and closed Wednesday‚Äôs show by calling herself Julie Chen Moonves. It was a nod to her husband, Les Moonves, the former CBS boss ousted over sexual misconduct allegations.
More reality: ‚ÄúMasterChef‚Äù named its season nine winner. Gerron Hurt, an English teacher from Louisville, Ky., collects $250,000.
Here‚Äôs his winning menu on the Fox contest. His appetizer was Nashville hot quail with fingerling potato salad and poached quail eggs. His entr√©e was Carabinero prawns with heirloom grits, shellfish au jus and crispy shallots. His dessert was amaretto chess pie with a raspberry coulis and popped sorghum.

IAF Policy Call With Singapore‚Äôs Yeong Zee Kin ‚Äì A Very Different Approach to Data Protection
June 10 @ 11:00 am - 12:00 pm
To further discussion on models for data protection, the IAF is pleased to host a policy call on the pathway to accountability-based governance in Singapore. This policy call features an interview with Yeong Zee Kin, the Deputy Commissioner of the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and the Assistant CEO of Infocom Media Development Authority.
Digital transformation is very important to Singapore‚Äôs future, and front and center in that transformation is data protection. On the PDPC website landing page is a rotating banner for the ‚ÄúDPO Competency Framework and Training Roadmap.‚Äù The update to Singapore‚Äôs data protection law includes a legitimate interests exception to consent that requires a comprehensive data impact assessment. Guidance to the law includes a chapter on consent with conditions for legitimate interests (see chapter 12 and annex 3).
Following a recorded interview with Mr. Yeong, the IAF staff will be joined by Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, the Director for Global Privacy for the Future of Privacy Forum, for a dialog on the interoperable model that is seen in Singapore.
Please join the call on Thursday, June 10 at the time specific to your area.

The Met Office has offered guidance on the weather forecast for the bank holiday weekend in Sheffield, but will you need your brolly or your sun cream?
Dry sunny weather is expected for most of the bank holiday weekend from Friday 27 ‚Äì Monday 30, with warmer temperatures than we have been used to.
Temperatures are likely to be in the high teens or low 20s throughout the weekend, with cooler mornings and warmer evenings.
Friday will be see early clouds finally give way to sunshine in the evening and the sunny weather is expected to be intermittent over Saturday and Sunday.
Friday is expected to see lows of 12¬∞ in the early morning and highs of 18¬∞ around 4pm, with a low chance of rain all day.
On Saturday there will be patchy clouds with sunny spells throughout the morning and evening. Lows of 12¬∞ up to 7am and highs of 20¬∞ around 4pm are expected, and there is a very low chance of rain throughout the day.
This trend will continue into Sunday, with sunny spells in the early morning and clouds returning throughout the afternoon and early evening. Lows of 12¬∞ from 4am-7am are expected with highs of 20¬∞ around 4pm. Again, rain is very unlikely.
Monday is expected to be very similar with warm and dry weather throughout the bank holiday.
Whilst this forecast is a long way from a heatwave, it marks a refreshing change from the weekend of August 21 which saw sporadic showers on Saturday and Sunday.Why We Serve
In 2014, when heroin overdoses began to receive national attention 18 young people died in one week in Hamilton County, Ohio. Fourteen services were held at one funeral home that weekend. Jordan Mullins, an employee at this funeral home, called his cousin, Lawrence Bishop II, a Pastor at Solid Rock Church in Monroe, Ohio to share this tragic situation. Not only was the loss of life a devastating tragedy, but dying without Jesus Christ as their Savior was even more heartbreaking.
Pastor Lawrence stopped everything and declared to his congregation they had to do something. He met with staff sharing they would hold a series of meetings on one weekend in Hamilton, Ohio and call it Hope Over Heroin, unless someone thought of a better name. He called his friend, Billy Price, Pastor of City on a Hill, Cincinnati knowing without his involvement, the series of meetings may never happen. Pastor Billy and City on a Hill owned a significant outdoor staging and trussing structure with a full concert system capacity. Hope Over Heroin was Born.
A handful of praying and enthusiastic churches and pastors, planned and prayed for this 3 day weekend in August, 2014 where church was brought to the streets. On that weekend, 12,000 people showed up in attendance, 154 people were baptized, over 500 gave their lives to Jesus for the first time, with many others rededicating themselves to serve God!
This movement was already in motion back in May, 2008 at City on a Hill Church. God gave Pastor Billy a laser focused vision of a sound system, stage and roofing system, lights, massive power generator, and a specific amount of money that he needed to make that happen: $1 Million Dollars all earmarked for Evangelism in the Streets!
Pastor Lawrence and Pastor Billy had traveled across the United States together since 2004, they had ministered in prisons and events around the nation, but this was a seemingly impossible amount of money to commit to something like this. Pastor Billy‚Äôs Church only had about $20k in the bank; not enough to even buy power cables for a generator that God had shown him was needed!
Pastor Lawrence certainly got the name right! Thank you, Pastor Lawrence for this inspired moment when our direction toward destiny was engaged!

HOPE OVER HEROIN

More than 20,000 new followers have joined a Facebook page devoted to planking, despite a fatal fall involving a planking participant in Brisbane on the weekend.
Acton Beale of Kangaroo Point was planking on his balcony rail which is 5cm wide, when tragedy struck at 4.30am on Sunday and he plunged seven storeys to his death.
The accident, the first known fatality from the craze, has raised questions about whether the social network‚Äôs role has pushed this phenomenon too far.
Planking involves a person lying face down over various objects for the amusement of their friends and those involved in online communities.
The photos are posted on social-networking sites, with the most amusing positions and locations gaining the most attention.
Rockhampton resident and die-hard planker Ian Weir said people involving danger in this activity are missing the point.
‚ÄúThey are missing the idea of what it is about,‚Äô he said.‚ÄùIt was just a random bit of fun with mates and something to have a little laugh about and now everyone is just pushing it too far.‚Äù
Brisbane Planking Association president Richard Litonjua said his organisation preaches safety and creativity over danger.
‚ÄúWe are still about the competitive side of it but competing in a creative, interesting, clever way as opposed to being extreme and irresponsible about it,‚Äù he said.
Queensland Police yesterday issued a statement on the planking Facebook page, warning of the potential dangers surrounding this activity.Come Say Hello!

‚ÄúI mean, he was pampered, yes,‚Äù Evans said.
But now Evans plays for the Tennessee Titans, coached by Mike Vrabel, who spent 14 years playing linebacker in the NFL, so he‚Äôs getting Fitzpatrick‚Äôs Saban treatment as a pro, Evans said.
‚ÄúYou got a coach that was a DB himself, it‚Äôs the same thing with Vrabel and me,‚Äù Evans said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs pampering the linebackers.‚Äù
Pampering doesn‚Äôt mean going soft, though.
After coming out of a ‚Äúslugfest‚Äù and ‚Äúbloodbath‚Äù with a 45-26 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in their previous games, the Titans will need to assert their physicality again to come out on top against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, Evans said ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not just a defensive thing.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hand-in-hand,‚Äù Evans said during an appearance on CBS Sports Radio‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Jim Rome Show‚Äù on Friday. ‚ÄúI think whenever you get your defense going, you get that rhythm, you get that momentum, as we like to call it, it feeds off to the rest of the team. Not only does it feed off to the offense, it feeds off to the special-teams players as well.
‚ÄúBoth sides go hand-in-hand. When (Titans running back) Derrick Henry goes and stiff-arms the guy into the sidelines, into the stands, we get hyped about that. It‚Äôs one of those things where both sides are just as important when it comes to rhythm and momentum because it can change the dynamics of a game.‚Äù
The Cleveland-Tennessee game holds the promise of being particularly bruising as the top two running teams in the NFL square off. Also a former Alabama standout, Henry has 1,257 rushing yards, the most in the NFL, for Tennessee this season.
Cleveland has a one-two punch at running back with Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. Chubb has run for 719 yards, even though he‚Äôs missed four games this season, and Hunt has 706 yards. Evans will face the duo without Jayon Brown. The Titans‚Äô other starting inside linebacker went down with a season-ending elbow injury on Nov. 22.
‚ÄúThey got two really good running backs,‚Äù the former Auburn High School star said. ‚ÄúThey got Chubb, they got Hunt back there and both of those guys are on the verge of going for 1,000 yards apiece, so I‚Äôve seen multiple videos of those guys running through every arm tackle. Every single tackle that they‚Äôve had, they‚Äôve been able to run through it and get yards after the tackle. The No. 1 thing is our tackling, making sure we wrap up, making sure we do all those little things.‚Äù
Cleveland and Tennessee kick off at noon CST Sunday at Nissan Stadium in Nashville.
The Browns and Titans enter Sunday‚Äôs game with identical 8-3 records.
For Cleveland, the record leaves the Browns three games behind the NFL‚Äôs only undefeated team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, in the AFC North standings. But Cleveland does hold the No. 1 wild-card slot in the conference with five weeks remaining in the regular season.
For Tennessee, the record is good for the AFC South lead by one game over the Colts, who visit the Houston Texans on Sunday.

In the birthplace of vinegar-and-peppered pork, it‚Äôs an impossible task to sufficiently narrow down a list of must-try barbecue places to only 10. There are at least that many old-school, long-time, can‚Äôt-miss BBQ joints in the eastern part of the state.
When you add in newer ‚Äòcue masters who are coming on the scene, you could probably spend weeks tasting and sampling how different the flavors can be. Still, if you‚Äôre looking for a place to start, here are a few.
Skylight Inn BBQ
4618 Lee St., Ayden
Since 1947, this restaurant has been growing its legacy to become one of the state‚Äôs iconic whole hog restaurants ‚Äî especially since "National Geographic" identified it as the barbecue capital of the world in 1979. Look for crunchy bits of crackling sprinkled throughout the pork.
Bum‚Äôs Restaurant and Catering
566 3rd St., Ayden
A continuation in a long line of cooking meat over wood, and another classic restaurant in Ayden. This particular one was started by Latham ‚ÄúBum‚Äù Dennis in 1963 and is still family-run.
Grady‚Äôs BBQ
3096 Arrington Bridge Road, Dudley
Keeping their tradition going, even through the COVID-19 pandemic, Steve and Gerri Grady are also owners of the state's only Black-owned whole hog barbecue smokehouse. Order dine-in or take-out at the counter, and grab a dessert from the case along the way.
B‚Äôs Barbecue
751 B's Barbecue Road, Greenville
Another family-run classic stop on any N.C. barbecue trail, from those who are still doing it the way they've always done, except now the road is named for the business.

Wilber‚Äôs Barbecue
4172 US-70, Goldsboro
Wilber Shirley took over Hill's Barbecue, and renamed it, in 1962. He died in April, but along the way he became known as one of the region's legendary barbecue kings. Luckily, the restaurant (now run by longtime fans) still churns out whole hog 'cue and sides like Brunswick Stew.
Southern Smoke
29 E Warren St., Garland
Founded in 2010 by Matthew and Jessica Register, this restaurant was also among USA TODAY's 10 best barbecue restaurants in the state in 2019. He's also the author of a cookbook, "Southern Smoke: Barbecue, Traditions, and Treasured Recipes Reimagined for Today."
Shepard Barbecue
129 Bogue Inlet Drive, Emerald Isle
Owners Brandon and Elizabeth Shepard believe in barbecue that breaks the boundaries of conventional clich√©s, but still respects the traditions and techniques of the masters who came before them. And they are evolving the 'cue business in the process using all wood and heritage breed animals.
Kings Restaurant
405 E New Bern Road, Kinston
Anyone, no matter where they are, can satisfy their craving for Kings, one of the few regional barbecue restaurants on national food delivery service Goldbelly. The restaurant was also recently a winner on "The Drew Barrymore Show" for its ribs and collard greens.
Port City Que
Food truck, Wilmington/Rocky Point area

[wp_ad_camp_1]
After many washing, minerals dissolved in the hard water create a scaly film on the hair. This prevents the moisture from entering the hair. The result is dry, dull, and strange colored hair. Hard water can also cause build up on the scalp, causing a dandruff-like condition to form. It can also lead to hair loss.
But EHC reaffirms you that hard water need not ruin your hair. Read on to save your hair from the effects of hard water. First, let‚Äôs look at the effects of different minerals present in the hard water.
[wp_ad_camp_4]
Calcium makes the hair seem heavy and the scalp often seems flaky. It is not just bits of skin that are coming loose but the calcium slowly becoming unstuck. Iron leaves it feeling brittle and dry. Split ends appear and the hair will need to be trimmed on a regular basis. The discoloration comes from copper and it can also cause discoloration and pull down curls. Magnesium seems to combine all the problems of the others. It makes curls drop, leaves the hair dry and takes away the shine.
There are many easy natural home remedies you may try to regain your hair health.
Vinegar
The acidity of vinegar works to remove scaly build up from your hair. The preference is apple cider vinegar (do not use balsamic vinegar). Mix 1 tablespoon of vinegar to 3 cups of water. After shampooing, massage this mixture on to your hair. Leave it for couple of minutes and rinse it off. Vinegar rinse also increases shine and gives body to limp hair. Use it once a week, as every day use will make your hair dry.
Lemon
Fresh lemon/lime juice makes a very good rinse for those with oily hair. To make lemon rinse, take 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and add 3 cups of water, and mix well. Apply this rinse to your scalp and hair after shampooing, and let it sit for couple of minutes before rinsing off. Along with adding shine and luster to your hair, the antiseptic properties of lemon help with dandruff.
[wp_ad_camp_2]
Water softener
A water softener is a great, but expensive way to solve your hard water worries. It removes calcium and magnesium and certain other metals from the hard water, making the water soft. While installing a water softener is expensive, it may be extremely useful for people experiencing hair problems, eczema and other hard water related conditions.
Coconut/Almond oil
After washing your hair always apply a natural leave-in conditioner like coconut oil or almond oil. This will lock in moisture and make your hair look shiny and healthy. Apply 2 to 3 drops to the lower half of your hair. Be careful not to use too much as this can make your hair greasy.
Deep Conditioning.
Shower filter
Shower filter is a cheaper alternative to water softener. It can considerably reduce lime scale, chlorine and many other chemicals from hard water. There are many different types of shower filter that attach to your shower unit. You can buy these online or in home stores.
Bottled water
Another option is to use bottled mineral/spring water for final rinse. You will need about a liter of water for final rinse. Although not that expensive, but you will have plastic bottles piling up. This can be a temp solution especially if your hair is giving you a hard time, or when you are visiting hard water area for a short period of time.
Rainwater
Rainwater is a good substitute to hard water when washing your hair. Place a large bucket outside during rainfalls, collecting as much of the liquid as possible. When it is time to take a bath or shower, heat the water in batches in large pot on the stove to medium heat, and use while bathing.

The new owner of Current by GE will continue to use the Current brand under a licensing agreement..
GE announced on April 2 that it had completed the sale of its Current lighting plants to American Industrial Partners, a New York-based private equity firm focused on buying, improving and growing industrial businesses. March 29 was the last day the plant operated under GE ownership. Under a long-term licensing agreement, the plants will still be called Current and will continue using the Current Powered GE brand on its products and services moving forward.
"They have made that official," Brittany Brady, president of the Henderson County Partnership for Economic Development, said Wednesday. "I don't think we'll see many changes. I think the head count will remain the same right now. The first payroll (under new ownership) is this week." Under an agreement with the GE, the plant will continue to operate as Current. "It sounds like for the time being they will keep that name."
Brady and Bob Williford, the president of the Henderson County Chamber of Commerce, both said plant officials had assured the work force and even some of the management was likely to remain unchanged.
"No reduction in head count of personnel changes," Brady said "It sounds like things have been pretty seamless. They don't anticipate much of a shift, which is as good as it gets. It looks like it's a newly owned entity but not many changes beyond that."
Terry Collins, the East Flat Rock plant's director of human resources and a member of the Henderson County chamber board, has told chamber officials that few changes are expected.
"They'll keep operating like normal," Williford said. "We'll just have to wait and see what happens. I don't even know how much leadership change there's going to be. They're still making fixtures and still making money."
The new owner is a. Current‚Äôs portfolio spans LED and traditional lighting solutions, along with a wide variety of intelligent controls, sensors and software.

In this brief overview to developing your very own LLC, damage each action down right into absorbable bits so you can recognize every little thing there is to comprehend about just how to begin an LLC promptly and also successfully ‚Ä¶
Developing an LLC is quite various from most various other kinds of service enrollment. Among the very first points you need to do when you start the process is choose the name for your new LLC. Below, you will certainly additionally select the operating arrangement, which must cover all of the tiny information regarding exactly how your service will certainly be run, as well as which member(s) will certainly own and maintain business. There are some fantastic tools available to help you get going. The US government has helpful forms available online, in addition to directions for filing your articles of incorporation.
The next action in developing an LLC is choosing the tax obligation standing you will certainly operate under. Depending upon your organization framework, this could not be a straightforward choice. Will you be a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a C firm, or an LLC? Each of these structures have different regulations regarding that bears which taxes. You‚Äôll require to seek advice from a person particularly about which category to select, and also what you‚Äôll need to pay as well as what you‚Äôll owe for each classification.
When you‚Äôve chosen the kind of business structure you want, you will require to select a legal name for your brand-new business. This name will certainly likewise belong to the Articles of Company, which are the legal files that establish the LLC. Your various other documents, like your Operating Arrangement, Company Certificate, as well as Other Operating Terms, will be submitted with your neighborhood office. It‚Äôs an excellent suggestion to print out copies of all these files so you can bring them with you when you most likely to register your brand-new business at the region clerk‚Äôs workplace. You‚Äôll need to sign up the LLC. Ensure to read all of the great print, and also always read what you and also your accountant have agreed upon pertaining to the Operating Agreement prior to you authorize.
One of one of the most crucial things to cover when you begin an LLC is responsibility protection. Various sorts of firms use various degree of liability defense. You will certainly want to discover which company will certainly give it best for your scenario. Typically, the greater the liability security, the less you‚Äôll have to pay out in taxes if your company gets filed a claim against. If you‚Äôre just starting, start with a liability defense level that‚Äôs reduced, and also then raise it as your service expands.
The last point you must do when creating an LLC in New york city is file your Articles of Organization. In New York, short articles of organization are submitted with the state. Other than that, your owners have to submit their tax returns as well as see to it that their LLC is signed up with the internal revenue service. This can take 6 months to a year relying on exactly how lengthy you have actually had your business. This is one of the most tiresome, however essential actions when creating an LLC in New York City.
Type an LLC ‚Äì Small Service Tax Benefits
Creating an LLC is not as challenging as you might believe. You will intend to follow the steps laid out below if you intend to form an LLC. If you are still confused, make sure to speak with a certified tax expert. He/She will have the ability to describe the numerous choices readily available to you, consisting of the details regarding your state‚Äôs earnings tax obligation and business tax obligation laws. When your accountant has dealt with these details, you will need to choose what sort of entity you wish to develop.
There are two basic kinds of services ‚Äì single proprietorships and firms. A single proprietor is taken into consideration to be any individual that owns a house and operates that home as his or her major address. Instances of people who might come under this group include single proprietors of assisted living facility, private specialists, and so on. Companies, on the various other hand, are companies that are owned by one individual. They are strained like a company as well as have to report their properties as well as earnings on an annual basis. Examples of corporations are partnerships, restricted obligation business, as well as firm.
Numerous little business owners prefer to create an LLC due to the fact that they can stay clear of dual taxation. A single pass-through entity will certainly be exhausted as a private for income and returns but will certainly be exhausted as a company for resources gains and also payroll taxes. Since numerous tiny company proprietors choose to develop an LLC, they typically pay fewer taxes.
Forming an LLC is relatively simple. You will require to identify the name of the LLC, pick a lawful organization name, as well as register it in your name. The majority of business owners start with a C firm. This is referred to as being ‚Äúin the public eyes‚Äù and refers to the fact that your LLC will certainly be publicly provided for tax objectives such as on a notice board in your community‚Äôs service district. After submitting the kind called ‚Äúcreating an LLC in the state of The golden state,‚Äù all that is required of you is to deposit a quantity equal to the total quantity of cash invested in the LLC, pay the prescribed fee, and file an annual tax obligation return. After you submit, your LLC will certainly end up being ‚Äúregistered‚Äù and also will certainly be able to negotiate organization as a corporation.
Creating an LLC does not transform the fact that you are still the only individual with all of your individual possessions. That implies that if you were to be filed a claim against, you are the only individual that has any kind of possessions that can be safeguarded. With sole proprietor obligation collaborations, you as well as your companion each very own 100% of business‚Äôs properties, while the other possesses nothing. As for personal properties, you own your residence as well as all of your individual assets, while your partner has his or her home and individual assets. If every one of your possessions were separated up according to this type of partnership, you would certainly have the ability to rest well during the night recognizing that your personal obligation for debts to your companions is zero. As for an LLC, your individual obligation for debts of all kinds is double, so unless you want to be understood as a LLC owner that owes hundreds of hundreds of dollars to numerous creditors, you should most likely just develop an LLC as well as keep your residence, retired life fund, and also savings account.
Creating an LLC is not completely devoid of dangers, specifically if you or your partners are mere ‚Äúhouse cleaners‚Äù as well as do not have a performance history of effective procedures. There are times when a lawsuit is submitted versus you, either by a private or an entity that you did not produce. In these cases, you can shed everything that you have actually worked so hard for, including your organization and personal possessions. When you hold a meeting to review feasible resolutions to the legal action that will certainly safeguard you and also your companions, never include your home, retired life, as well as bank account in that conversation. You may finish up losing every little thing that you have worked so tough to obtain, consisting of the failed service.
Developing an LLC is relatively very easy, and it must not cost you way too much in fees. The most important element in your option of state to register your organization is its company certificate, because this will certainly determine the type of tax advantages that you appreciate. Numerous states limit the quantity of personal responsibility that organization partners can be held accountable for, as well as some limitation the quantity of revenues that they can make as well. Some states call for that an LLC be signed up on the area level, while others allow you to choose the tax obligation condition of your LLC at the time of enrollment. For more information concerning the choices that you have for tax obligation advantages, take a look at your state government site.
Forming an LLC is useful for several tiny companies, since it can provide the alternative to separate their individual possessions from their organization assets, while still maintaining control over those different entities. Even for huge corporations, that commonly operate as one big entity, establishing up an LLC (let‚Äôs call it run-down neighborhood) permits them to secure themselves from individual obligation for the actions of any one of the subsidiary business that they have. An LLC is additionally valuable for proprietors that are regularly changing their company designs, because rather than being held liable for every little thing via the name of their company, they just have to worry concerning their individual investment accounts.

This quest merges with another project that involves reconciling two contrary poetic modes. The first mode, which "Mariana" (1830) exemplifies, embodies an obvious drive to create intensely visual static panels or tableaux. This poem's seven 12-line stanzas use landscape in the expressionist manner to represent the state of mind of the speaker whom the epigraph identifies as "Mariana of the moated grange" waiting for her lover (from Shakespeare's Measure for Measure). Although time passes as we move from stanza to stanza, nothing happens in the poem, which takes the form of a powerful embodiment of mental depression. Whereas "Mariana" is entirely static, "The Kraken" (1830), whose 15 lines tell of a mythical sea monster's rising to the surface to die at the moment of Apocalypse, takes the form of a kinetic poetry of climax and visionary resolution.
Although in terms of structure and effect these poems appear diametrically opposed, they share a proto-decadent absence of moral or theme. Looking at these two pre-Victorian poems of 1830 (the Queen did not accede to the throne for another seven years), one sees that Tennyson's poetic project involved finding a way to reconcile his opposed poetic modes and at the same time to make them morally and intellectually relevant. He managed to do so two years later in "The Lady of Shalott" and "The Palace of Art", both of which poems take the reader through a series of sharply segmented panels or sections leading to a dramatic moment analogous to one of religious conversion.
In "The Lady of Shalott" Tennyson makes an Arthurian figure of his own invention serve as a symbol for the artist. Isolated within her tower, she weaves a tapestry that depicts human life, which she herself can only experience vicariously and at a distance in a mirror. When the beauty of the passing Lancelot leads her to turn away from her magic mirror and look directly out her window, her mirror and web shatter, flying apart, and her mortality comes upon her. This mythic poem embodies the way ordinary human needs destroy the artist, but in contrast "The Palace of Art", which shares the same climactic structure, makes the contrary point that isolating oneself from society also brings destruction.
Both poems, which present in parabolic form the problematic relation of the artist to society, reflect the political turmoil of the year in which they were written ‚Äî 1832, the time of the first Reform Bill and the fierce debates about the relation and responsibility of classes. Tennyson, like so many Victorian artists and writers who felt a need to preserve aesthetic distance while making statements about their own age, dramatizes his sense of the artist's problematic relation to his society in mythic, parabolic narratives, which he sets in other places and other times. "The Palace of Art" and "The Lady of Shalott" show Tennyson making a first attempt to find the proper relation of the Victorian author to his audience. They also show that he had solved some of his technical problems by creating a poetic structure that embraced his tendencies toward static and climactic verse and that he had applied the result in creating a morally relevant poetry of vision and conversion.
Throughout his career Tennyson remained interested in momentous changes in a character's consciousness, and his quest for a suitable narrative structure enabled him to discover a form particularly effective in dramatizing religious conversions and analogous moments of revelation. Tennyson's characteristic poetic structure takes the following form: the main character progresses through a series of discrete sections or panels that may take the form of landscapes, states of mind, arguments, or tests until he has a dream, vision, or other powerful revelation that effects a conversion to new ways of life and action. What is perhaps most distinctive about Tennyson's poetic structure is the sharp separation he achieves between sections in many of his poems. In fact, even when telling a story in an apparently straightforward chronological form, Tennyson always prefers to progress through a series of parables, songs, visions, arguments, and actions. His characteristic use of flashbacks, parabolic commentary, and complex plotting creates a narrative form in In Memoriam (1850) and The Idylls of the King (1859-1888) that anticipates the modernist narrative of Faulkner.

SMA‚Äôs ShadeFix optimization produces more energy than traditional optimizers. ShadeFix also provides greater reliability and less service risk than alternatives. Watch the video to see for yourself!
In the face of rapid technological and regulatory change, complexity has crept into DER system design and business models. And with increased complexity, the prospect of higher costs, lower predictability, and increased risk is the likely result. These statements are true of the DER system, and are also true of the individual components in the system. To illustrate this point, we‚Äôll look at the Module Level Power Electronics (MLPE) that are now part of the equation.
In 2014, the National Electrical Code (NEC) introduced requirements for arc fault detection and for de-energizing system arrays for the purpose of increasing safety. By 2017, the NEC began expanding the scope of the regulation by requiring that every solar array installed on a rooftop must have both arc fault protection and the ability to de-energize every individual module in the system within 30 seconds of deactivation by a user.
To comply with these compounding requirements, manufacturers introduced a variety of proprietary add-on devices (MLPE) to string inverter-based solar system designs. The result has been a dramatic increase in total parts count, a doubling in connector count, and the unintended consequence of signal congestion (‚Äúnoise‚Äù) on the DC wiring of the DER system that can hamstring both arc fault detection and rapid shutdown functions. Taken altogether, these factors result in higher component failure rates, increased safety risk for construction personnel and system owners, and lower system performance.
There has to be a better way.
Simplicity through standardization, integration, and adaptability
Anticipating this future, SunSpec Alliance members determined that adding more parts would not be a winning strategy for DER system builders that rely on efficiency and longevity to sustain profitability. In this light, the objective in DER system design should be to implement strategies that allow compliance with sometimes overlapping regulatory requirements while holding part counts, connecting points, and the physical labor required for system construction at a constant, and to accomplish these goals without introducing risky, new technologies.
Buyer Beware Webinar: Lessons Learned from Inverter Testing with PVEL ‚Äì April 6 ‚Äì Register here for free
When SunSpec embarked on developing the open SunSpec Communication Signal for Rapid Shutdown (SunSpec RSD) standard, the companies involved adopted three important principles:
1. The challenges faced in implementing a shutdown standard are old ones. Fundamental, proven, and well-aged solutions would be employed to address the problem.
2. Regulations set the boundaries on potential solutions. The need to embed technology in existing system components (e.g. the PV module junction box, the PV connector, or the inverter case) and utilize the PV array wiring was both obvious and required to minimize cost and enable mass adoption as required by law.
3. A rapid shutdown signal is likely one of many mandated signals that would be forced to share DC power lines. Federal Communication Commission regulations were bound to come into play.
Given these principles, the intellectual property comprising the standard would need to be mature, unencumbered, and well supported by high-volume component products to ensure reliability, acceptable market entry cost, and sustainable long-term cost.
This combination of factors set a high bar for a de facto standard that would require a number of proof points simply to enter the market. The SunSpec RSD solution would need a primary silicon chip provider (Texas Instruments); harmonization with the UL 1741 SA testing standard; a network of SunSpec Authorized Testing Laboratories to validate implementation; and shipping products from at least a dozen manufacturers that could be embedded in PV modules and other common system components. The SunSpec ecosystem accomplished all these things by 2020.
Since that time, SunSpec restarted its technical working group to adapt the SunSpec RSD standard to multi-module and string applications. It also developed a university-level online training course for installers that is now available at UC San Diego Extension and at North Carolina State University. And finally, SunSpec has introduced a whitepaper describing the technology and published an intellectual property prior art study to demonstrate the work done to define an open standard. As a serious standards development organization striving to produce a simple, complete solution, SunSpec understands that the industry requires transparency, and they strive for it each day.
SunSpec has gone to great lengths to fulfill its mission of defining open information standards for Distributed Energy that expand the market for all involved. SunSpec members and the entire DER supply chain expects that SunSpec standards result in solutions that offer lower cost and complexity, decreased installation times, fewer component failures, fewer worker safety hazards, lower total system costs, an expanding array of competing suppliers, and a growing DER market.
Tom Tansy is chairman of SunSpec Alliance.

It has been popular for eight years since its release in 2011 and has few competitors. It is one of PHP‚Äôs best frameworks, as well as one of the best frameworks available today. Why is it so much in demand?
Laravel has a history of usage in big websites. It is in some ways better than anything PHP has to offer. There are many reasons for this. Its Dependency Injection Container makes dependency much less complicated. It also has a baked-in queue system that is exclusive to the framework. The unique queue system simplifies background job processing. Laravel has several tools with which Laravel developers can interact with databases. Database migration is smooth, and so is designing or modifying a database. It is also independent of the platform. Laravel‚Äôs Artisan is a developer‚Äôs favorite tool. It can do anything. Running database migrations or executing unit tests takes no time or effort when developers use Artisan to do so.
Organizing website URLs may be tedious for developers. But the task can be made more accessible by using routers to do so. Laravel makes this possible. Developers can set up a website quickly and also ensure that it works without technical glitches. After a website is set up, Laravel ensured cleans views that are easy to navigate through. Its blade template engine has replacements for inline PHP. It includes many new features that are robust and powerful. Laravel has a service container that helps to manage class dependencies and to perform dependency injection. It also has Laravel queues. With this tool, a Laravel developer can postpone the processing of a task that is time-consuming and do it later. S/he can focus on other less consuming tasks on hand and ensure the work happens more quickly. Laravel queues come with a unified API and a relational database.
Laravel is built on over twenty different libraries. It is modular. It is a big framework based on some of the best PHP principles. It is divided into individual libraries. Due to its high-end features, it ensures that websites that are built on it are responsive and modular.
Why Choose Laravel for a Big Project like Facebook?
When building websites for companies as big as Facebook, several factors need to be considered. Some of these factors include authentication, mail service implementation, security threats, and vulnerabilities, error handling capacity, automated testing, and so on. Keeping these factors in mind, let us see how Laravel performs:
When it comes to implementing authentication, the process is simple in Laravel. The framework provides pre-configured solutions. It also provides an easy way to control access to various resources on the site and organize authorization logic.
Integrating various mail services is also a simple procedure in Laravel due to its clean API. It provides several drivers for Amazon SES, Mailgun, Mandrill, SMTP, and so on, thus facilitating a quick mail service for websites that use it. It also promotes push notifications, SMS, and other similar services that companies use to connect with their users.
Laravel ensures top-class website security by protecting against cross-site request forgery, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other significant threats. Its codebase is also secure, which means it reduces the risk of attacks and also significantly reduces security risks thereby.
Unit testing in Laravel is highly convenient. It supports the PHP unit and has a phpunit.xml file. It allows Laravel developers to perform intensive tests. They can simulate standard user behavior and perform various tasks on the site, such as clicking links or filling out forms to ensure it is working well. Doing this ensures that the website is error-free for the users and that they do not have to deal with technical issues when they visit it.
In the case of an error, developers can fix it quickly. For pre-configured Laravel based projects, developers can also use Laravel‚Äôs Monolog logging library for exception handling. It comes with several log handlers that are easy to use and have robust features.
Laravel also keeps the business logic code separate from the presentation code because it is a model-view-controller framework. Doing this ensures that HTML layout designers can make changes in the appearance of a web page without needing the help of developers. Companies benefit from this because hiring developers to do this involves unnecessary expenses. Developers can also benefit from this because they perform bug fixes more cost-effectively.
Web applications built with Laravel are fast and work at a surprisingly high speed. This is due to its unique caching mechanism. Caching is responsible for increasing web application performance. When users enter the website URL into a browser, the physical server for the web application receives a request and processes it immediately to send a response to the user. It can handle complex requests in a hassle-free manner. With popular company websites, more than a hundred thousand users visit the site at the same time and make requests to the database server. Laravel makes sure that these requests are handled efficiently. It transfers the most requested page once, caches them, and from the cache itself, it directly serves future requests. Its cache drivers are efficient in doing this.
The framework also supports Redis, Memcached, APC, and other sought-after back-end caching mechanisms. It is preconfigured to use the file cache driver. This driver stores all cached objects in the file system. While in-memory cache is highly suitable for large websites, Laravel supports multiple cache configurations for sites as well.
Laravel is almost incomplete without its packages. It comes with several packages to make it easy for developers to create websites for big projects. Some of its best packages include:
Laravel Entrust: Laravel Entrust lets a developer implement role-based permission, which is essential for big websites. In such websites, it is necessary to control access to specific sections of the site depending on who is using the site. Laravel Entrust makes it easy to create different types of users who have different roles.
Laravel Socialite: This package helps to manage user authentication. Developers can use the OAuth authentication mechanism to validate user credentials before allowing them to access the site. Due to Laravel Socialite, users can also login quickly into the site by providing a few details about themselves, such as their username and password. Currently, the package supports authentication with Google, Facebook, Twitter, Bitbucket, GitLab and GitHub.
Laravel Tracker: When users enter various information on a website, it is essential to track them to ensure website security. The task is seemingly impossible for big sites that have over a hundred thousand visitors every day. That is why Laravel has a tracker package to track things like session information, user devices, page views, browsers and operating systems, location data, and so on.
Laravel Buzzy: All big websites require a system by which they will be able to share their site on various social media platforms. Laravel Buzzy is one such package that makes this possible. It facilitates social media sharing and ensures that the site is visible to more and more users.
Laravel Spark: Laravel Spark is a package that comes with features like billing and subscription, invoicing, team management, and so on. These features are often necessary for big websites. At the same time, it also takes care of website security, such as authentication, password protection, and resetting, and so on.
Laravel is the ideal framework for multi-user websites or Software-as-a-Service applications. It is often difficult to build such sites, but Laravel‚Äôs built-in features make it well equipped to handle the difficulties. It has various components like payments, subscriptions, and admin dashboards that come with the framework. It also offers free trials, deal based offers and other such functionalities that a SaaS application must-have.
Is the Framework Really Important?
Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel, explains that when it comes to building websites for companies big or small, it is not about the framework. The coding is much more important than the framework itself. He says instead that the Laravel developer who is responsible for building a web application is essential. This is because a lousy developer will write a bad web application with any framework he chooses. We recommend an excellent project of our partners ‚Äì . Always an up-to-date view of events. While routing, caching, session, database calls are crucial aspects of a framework, it is the developer who has to handle more complex tasks such as that of domain problems. That is why it is also more essential to consider other factors like DevOps, caching mechanism, unique application logic, database, and so on and to ensure that there is no error in coding.
How to Build Websites for Big Projects?
When building a website for a big project, there are some crucial things you should keep in mind. You need to ensure that you are using Memcached, Redis, or some equally powerful cache or session driver. You should use a load balancer as well. You must also ensure that you are using config: cache and route: cache. You should keep your database and web server separate so that it is easier for you to scale the website.
How to Ensure Web Application Performance When Developing A Website for a Big Project?
Developing a website for a project as big as Facebook can be challenging. Here are some things you can do to ensure maximum website performance:
Website pages often take time to load because the database queries take time to process. This happens when the queries are incorrectly written, and indexing is not good enough. Sometimes the server requests are also complex. That is why it is necessary to cache requests that are more than two seconds and handle them correctly with proper index settings in tables. System caching the data received is also another highly effective way of handling repeated queries.
Another factor that affects loading time is image size. When a website has more than one image, and these images are large, each of them takes time to load and increases the overall loading time. To ensure that this does not happen on your site, it is a good idea to reduce the size of images and change the image compression degree. Keeping them in JPG format instead of PNG can also help. Doing this can reduce the image quality, but the difference will not be visible to the users.
Just like images, adding too many elements such as images, videos, or audios on the page can also increase loading time. That is why it is essential to add fewer items on a single page so that it loads quickly. In case adding heavy elements is unavoidable, you should make use of cloud storage to prevent them from bringing down the page load speed. Putting an arrow at the bottom of the page to allow scrolling to the top can also help users go directly to the top of the page without having to scroll back again.
If you build your website using programming languages like HTML or JavaScript, there can be errors in them that make your site difficult to load. Detecting the errors and correcting them can help you speed up your website. It can also improve the search engine ranking for your site and increase its visibility.
Source code optimization is another way of reducing loading time. The initial stages of developing a website are most important. Making sure that a site is built without errors also ensures that it is speedy and reliable in the long run. Making optimal use of the OOP paradigm can help you do so.
Laravel, then, is suitable for a project like Facebook. Today it is being used by some of the top companies around the world, such as 9GAG, TourRadar, BBC, Pfizer, Crowdcube, and so on. Its range of usage covers various domains and sectors from news websites to social media platforms. Its expanse is ever-increasing. The framework is improving with every update to adapt to the growing changes in web development. It has its unique potentials which can be combined with the unique abilities of the Laravel developer to make such a project a grand success.About our Hemp Liquid Gel Capsules

The city of Portland evacuated more residents as severe flooding from the Grand River got worse.
The town is about 25 miles northwest of Lansing.
About 50 people were evacuated Tuesday when ice and water began pouring over the banks along North Water Street.
Update: 7:31 p.m. Saturday
There are ice jams upstream on the Grand River that Portland city officials say could cause flooding, again.
Portland City Manager Tutt Gorman says on Saturday he joined the Michigan State Police Aviation Unit and a hydrologist with the National Weather Service for a flyover tour of two additional ice jams up river from the city of Portland.
‚ÄúThis is not a typical flood event,‚Äù Gorman said. ‚ÄúThis is basically just blocks of ice and when they let loose they‚Äôre going to shift and push water in different directions. It‚Äôs just extremely unpredictable.‚Ä¶ Flooding is absolutely possible again.‚Äù
The City of Portland re-opened the Grand River Bridge on Saturday, but in a statement on the city‚Äôs Facebook page said the bridge could close again ‚Äúat a moment's notice‚Äù as officials continue to monitor the ice jams upriver. Several other bridges in Portland were closed throughout Saturday.
Gorman says most of the people who are evacuated because of the flooding are staying with friends or family members, but he‚Äôs not sure when they might be able to come home. He says some homes are still sitting in a significant amount of water. He says some historic buildings in Portland‚Äôs downtown were damaged, but overall the damage from the flooding is difficult to assess at this point.
‚ÄúThis has to play out before you can have a ground zero, or a baseline with the damage,‚Äù Gorman said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult to anticipate what Mother Nature is going to do.‚Äù
Gorman says city and county officials are consulting with state and federal partners about how to address the situation and to secure funding to aid with eventual recovery efforts.
Update: 8:50 a.m. Saturday
The City of Portland is hastily constructing an earthen dam to protect its water treatment plant from the ice and water flooding into it.
In an update on its Facebook page Saturday morning, the city says the Grand River is currently stable "with minor fluctuations." The city says the Grand River Bridge and other bridges will be re-evaluated Saturday to see if they can be reopened.
Charlsie Abel was one of the first to be evacuated. She says everything seemed fine when her family went to bed Tuesday night.
"And then right around midnight our dogs kind of started growling and barking," says Abel. "And then we noticed our motion detector lights were coming on, and that's when my husband looked outside and could see water just flowing quite rapidly between our house and our detached garage."
Abel says the fire department showed up just as they were grabbing clothes and other necessary items to evacuate.
Meanwhile, things weren't that bad for Tim Fuller, who owns five buildings on Kent Street. Not at first.
He says the flooding in the basements was well under a foot, until Friday morning, when he looked outside and saw the ice and water moving. He thought it was going to keep going until it moved back into the river. But then it just... stopped.
He ran down to the basement of the building he was in.
"The water was just pouring in as fast as it could pour, every little crack and seam, bubbling up through the floor," says Fuller. "It rose probably 36 inches in 20 minutes in the basement. So, at that point we knew we were in pretty big trouble."
Fuller moved everything he could from his buildings onto the second floor.
He says there's nothing more he can do until the water and ice recedes, so he's going to leave town for a few days to try to put the mess out of his mind.
Both Abel and Fuller say neither they nor most of the people they know have flood insurance. They didn't see the need for it.
City and county emergency officials say the flooding is being caused by ice jams blocking the normal flow of water.
The Grand River Avenue bridge, Bridge Street Bridge, and the River Trail Pedestrian Bridge have been closed.
The city's wastewater treatment plant was overwhelmed by the volume of water and was forced to discharge some untreated sewage into the river.
Power and water service have been shut off to some of the affected neighborhoods.Country Concert (Concerto Campestre)

A farmer meets two Guarani Indian musicians, whom he invites to work for him as long as they play their instruments everyday. The farmer assembles his own orchestra, led by a man that his daughter soon falls in love with. ‚ÄúConcerto Campestre‚Äù is the love story of not only a man and a woman, but also a man and his music.Cee Kay¬¥s sixth week with KetOntrack
Completed the six-week program, what an experience! I¬¥m really happy to have marked this milestone. Summarizing the step by step approach of the previous weeks in one sentence: A very rewarding and change in a lifetime self-exploration.
Having pushed the boundaries in fasting, learning a lot about nutrition and digestion, and picking up on getting fit again, was unexpecting a very smooth ride. This was exceptionally possible through the KetOntrack principles and the 6-weeks program. It¬¥s not that you don¬¥t have access to the knowledge, knowing what is good for you, i.e. less carbs, more rich in nutrients food, focused workout, having the right level of hydration and so on, but it¬¥s the special way of KetOntrack having taught me and my body, to become metabolically flexible. This was a physical and psychological learning curve and has had so far, a big impact on my lifestyle.
Check my before and after pictures!
Week 0 ‚Äì Before KetOntrack ‚Äì 93 kg Week 6 ‚Äì KetOntrack Practiotioner ‚Äì 81 kg
Needless to state that I am now since two weeks in keto, justified and measured via the Keto-Mojo meter, whereby in week 5 it was as desired a slight ketosis, then this week, with 18/6 intermittent fasting and usually two rich meals, as well as a good level of activity, I¬¥m fully ‚Äòketonised‚Äô üôÇ
I¬¥m now much more energetic and I have written this in my previous posts, but what does it actually mean? For me it means, that I¬¥m much more focused on my energy levels. I have achieved to be more awake and productive during the day. I have the feeling as if someone switched on an additional battery. Even when there was some hick up¬¥s, as posted previously, with some sickness, I was able to recover quickly, my body and mind demanding to continue on the chosen path. This is simply fantastic.
Positive (side) effects I have noticed and which definitely need to be mentioned:
a.) Better Skin, cleaner, rosier look, less skin irritations
b.) Improved taste, food tastes richer and pure.
c.) Better sleep, more efficient recuperation.
d.) More relaxed, day to day approach to life.
e.) Down one and a half clothes sizes from my original size 6 weeks ago.
f.) All the gathered knowledge is very useful going forward.
g.) Picked up on autogenic training more frequently again.
Since one of my passions is cooking, for me it was a won challenge to cook keto compatible meals. I have amended a lot of my recipes to be keto friendly, derived from the nutritional awareness achieved with KetOntrack. Some of my recipes are already online here, and there are yet more to come. It was so far a fulfilling experience, with some slight challenges, where I needed to prep some side dishes for the family from time to time, to be equipped with the right level of needed carbs (I have a son of 1 year, he needs it).
Being a regular Sauna guest, especially in these nice Spa¬¥s, I¬¥m convinced that a Sauna visit can remarkably soothe your body and soul and I think everyone should do it frequently. I¬¥m now going every week once, at least in the winter months, so I stay fit and focused on staying healthy.
My three key take ways in week 6:
- Time flew by, and now I feel like a new human being. Really remarkable.
- Positive attitude comes from achieving set targets, as well as the overall improvements with KetOntrack, visible and inner strength. A foundation, which I trust to continue on the same path.
- Twelve (12)!! Kilo¬¥s down in 6 weeks. An achievement, but yet more to come and as the next steps, to increase muscle strength, resulting in more weight balance as a result.
In the weeks to come the focus is on trying to improve sleep length and quality. I will need to strengthen further my fitness and drive muscle growth in my back and hip and of course get the belly even more reduced. What¬¥s life without proper targets? All in all, I am eager to continue the given path and am happy to receive my KetOntrack Practitioner certificate, aiming to go the full path and become a Trainer at some point.
I¬¥m happy to have achieved all this and thanks to Panagiotis for gathering all the information and his consultancy and his mentoring on his true passion, being KetOntrack.
Cheers,
Cee Kay.

Like many NHL arenas, Nationwide boasts a wide variety of food, dining, and drink options inside and around the venue.
Nationwide Arena Food & Concession Stands
Nationwide Arena has concession stands and eateries along both the main and upper concourses, making it convenient for fans watching hockey games to grab a bite throughout the game. Arena favorites like hot dogs, specialty burgers, beer, soda, popcorn, nachos, and pizza are all available.

Classic Food at Nationwide Arena
In Columbus, Ohio, Skyline Chili is probably the most famous dish from that area of the country, and a must have if you‚Äôre attending a Columbus Blue Jackets game or any event at Nationwide Arena. If you‚Äôve already tried Skyline Chili on a previous trip to town, the pulled pork, chicken, and brisket are excellent choices from Arena Smokehouse. Local fans will also point you to Bob Evans, who supplies the bratwurst offerings at Nationwide Arena. Arena management has made sure that fans can get what they want on the main concourse as well as the upper concourse during a game. So don‚Äôt worry about where your seats might be, your food options and sight lines will both be great.

Nationwide Arena Food & Concession FAQs
How much does food cost at the Nationwide Arena?
Concession items at Nationwide Arena begin at about $5 for snacks like popcorn and a regular burger will cost you $7 to $8. Specialty items and full meals go up from there.
Can you bring food into the Nationwide Arena?
Outside items are not allowed into Nationwide Arena for Columbus Blue Jackets games.

The bill was approved by the Board of Aldermen on Friday and is expected to take effect in all high school, college and professional stadiums within the city limits ‚Äî including the Cardinals‚Äô Busch Stadium.
Under the ban, players, staff and fans will not be able to use any smokeless tobacco products, including chew, snuff and dip. A $100 fine will be levied for a first offense, followed by $250 for a subsequent violation and $500+ for any violation after that.
The measure will make St. Louis the ninth U.S. city with such a ban and will make the Cardinals the 12th MLB team to prohibit smokeless tobacco products in their stadium. While the new Collective Bargaining Agreement stipulates that new players must abstain from smokeless tobacco, several cities have not yet enacted a ban that extends to everyone within their sports venues.
California is expected to enforce a similar law that was passed by Gov. Jerry Brown in October 2015. The statewide ban will take effect in Anaheim, Oakland and San Diego prior to the 2017 season.Inesfly Africa grabs 2 awards at Manufacturing Awards others.

And the company has continued that trend with what now includes no fewer than two Legion branded headsets. Specifically, that‚Äôs the CES-worthy Lenovo Legion H200 and H600 gaming headsets.
But the company also wants to give its customers somewhere to store ‚Äî and, for wireless headsets, to charge ‚Äî their gadgets. So its announcement for this category starts with the Lenovo Legion S600 Gaming Station. The device not only acts as a rack to store the Lenovo Legion H600 Wireless Gaming Headset. But also has a wireless-charging base to charge up phones, a mouse, and more. All while fitting neatly in with the aesthetics of the rest of the Legion lineup.
Lenovo Legion H200 is the more affordable of the two gaming headsets at CES
The first product Lenovo talked about in terms of new gaming headsets, was the Lenovo Legion H200 Gaming Headset. The company didn‚Äôt give away too many details about the gadget but did share some information and images. As shown in those pictures, Lenovo Legion H200 offers similar functionality to other budget-friendly gaming headsets.
For example, it features a fold-away microphone stalk, an adjustable headband, and a sleek design. Those are, Lenovo says, meant to help cater to a comfortable fit and clear in-game audio. So, the wired offering fits right in with the rest of the Legion lineup, despite its sub-$50 price tag.
Lenovo has indicated that the cloth ear cups on Lenovo Legion H200 Gaming Headset are adjustable too. They can rotate and mold to the wearer‚Äôs ears. So they should be a great value, when they become available, for those who don‚Äôt want to spend a lot for a great headset.
Lenovo Legion H600 brings more to the table
Now, Lenovo was far more detailed with its next product, the Lenovo Legion H600 Wireless Gaming Headset. Not only does the headset come with a Qi-Enabled base for charging smartphones and other gadgets at up to 10W. That stand also features two USB-A pass-through ports for charging and connectivity.
And it also delivers the same comfort and flexibility as the H200 Gaming Headset. And, in this case, the flip-away unidirectional noise-canceling mic is also flip-to-mute.
On audio and connectivity, the Lenovo Legion H600 Wireless Gaming Headset is a great value. To begin with, the company says the audio delivered by the headset is ‚Äútournament-grade‚Äù and utilizes a 2.4GHz lossless wireless USB receiver. That can be used at a distance of up to 12m ‚Äî just under 40ft. But it still proffers a latency that‚Äôs under 35ms.
The earcups here additionally house 50mm, audio drivers, with up to 3M bandwidth. So audio playback should be wide and full, in addition to the strong connection. Potentially making these some of the best gaming headsets for the money.
When can you get your hands on these Lenovo Legion Gaming headsets?
Both Lenovo Legion headsets and the similarly-branded gaming station, as announced at CES 2021, will become available in April. Albeit, not necessarily at exactly the same time.
Regardless, users can pick up any of the new products for under $100.
Lenovo Legion H200 Gaming Headset will start things out at $49.99. The Lenovo Legion S600 Gaming Station for charging and storing headsets will cost a bit more. The company has placed its MSRP at $89.99. And, finally, the Lenovo Legion H600 Wireless Gaming Headset will hit shelves at $99.99.Craving chicken inasal but worried about dining in? JT‚Äôs Manukan has made it easier to fix you with their beloved grilled chicken skewers through their newest food trailer at the Araneta City Expo in Cubao, Quezon City.
JT‚Äôs Manukan has joined the fray of restaurants-on-wheels concepts by opening its own outdoor food truck where you can enjoy a much more straightforward menu consisting of their grilled items: there‚Äôs the famous inasal, plus other items like grilled liempo, sate babi, and pork barbecue.
Aila Torre, JT‚Äôs Manukan‚Äôs creative director, told Coconuts that the decision to launch a food trailer was prompted by the pandemic, as a result of a rise in delivery demand and changing dine-in guidelines.
‚ÄúAraneta City is also known as the ‚Äúcity of firsts‚Äù, so we felt it was also right to have the first-ever trailer located there,‚Äù Torre explained.
Customers can drop by the trailer every day from 11 am to 11 pm.
Torre added that the food trailer in Araneta City is the first of two trailers opening this year, with the next trailer launching in Marikina.

Functional as well as artistic, this circa 1860s baseball bat bears an acorn-style knob and narrow barrel, measuring 33" in length and weighing 28 ounces. The barrel is painted brown and has red and white painted rings, and there are also other red line designs on the barrel and upper handle. Very much a piece of folk art, it also bears the wear and tear of game use, a beautiful piece overall.

HTLW03 - Physics and knot homologies
In this talk we will present a Verlinde formula for the quantization of the Higgs bundle moduli spaces and stacks for any simple and simply-connected group. We further present a Verlinde formula for the quantization of parabolic Higgs bundle moduli spaces and stacks. We will explain how all these dimensions fit into a one parameter family of 2D TQFT 's, encoded in a one parameter family of Frobenius algebras, which we will construct.
This talk is part of the Isaac Newton Institute Seminar Series series.

A functional democracy rests on the belief that losing an election isn't an existential threat to one's family or community. Fear of the opposite party achieving victory at the ballot box incentivizes various forms of electoral foul play, inspires fierce partisanship in well-adjusted people and results in sporadic acts of violence from the more unhinged among us.
It would be easy to lament how both sides have come to fear people who disagree with them as if those fears were equally unfounded. But just as our sharply increased polarization is asymmetrical, so is the basis of our anxiety.
Fox News and the rest of the conservative media relentlessly promote narratives of a violent left bent on destroying the country as we know it. In their alternative universe, mainstream Democrats embrace aborting newborns and are always on the brink of repealing the 2nd Amendment. They deploy millions of undocumented immigrants to tilt elections in their favor, and use the resulting power to persecute white Christians for their beliefs. The mainstream press aren't just "biased" toward Democrats, they think reporters literally invent stories out of whole cloth to damage the GOP. Every source of knowledge is against them--the academy, scientists, fact-checkers, watchdogs like the Congressional Budget Office and even The Weather Channel. As Jared Holt explained on last week's podcast, the lines between the discourse of brewing civil war in the fever swamps of the internet and mainstream conservative discourse are becoming increasingly blurred.
In contrast, Democrats have reason to be fearful. On policy, the GOP's rightward lurch threatens people's healthcare and economic security and results in children being kept in cages. White nationalism is a driving force in the party's politics. Their opponents dress like ISIS fighters and protest even modest gun control laws with assault rifles. Right-wing terrorism is a real and growing threat. Elected Republicans have plotted attacks against antifascist activists and speak openly about jailing or killing their opponents. They introduce bills that would define abortion as murder and subject doctors who perform the procedure to prosecution.
The Republican senators who debased Donald Trump's impeachment trial this week by refusing to hear witnesses and review necessary evidence may not be motivated by the same fears as their base, but they too fear for their futures in a country that is becoming ever more urbanized and increasingly diverse. It's true that they fear Trump's base--themselves motivated by baseless terror of being "replaced" by immigrants and ethnic and religious minorities--but they also approve of his no-holds-barred campaign to win re-election and maintain power, even if it requires coercing an ally to launch a sham investigation of a prominent rival. Fear of losing their grip on power is the ultimate source of the rot we saw this week. It's why they don't care about bucking public opinion or establishing troubling precedents for future presidents or facing charges of hypocrisy. Winning is more important than upholding democratic norms or protecting the separation of powers because in their eyes, the alternative is too terrible to contemplate.

Note: All of these and much more have been merged into the project Makefile. You can
cross build via
make geth-<os>-<platform> without needing to know any of these details
from below.
Developers usually have a preferred platform that they feel most comfortable working in, with all the necessary tools, libraries and environments set up for an optimal workflow. However, there‚Äôs often need to build for either a different CPU architecture, or an entirely different operating system; but maintaining a development environment for each and switching between the them quickly becomes unwieldy.
Here we present a very simple way to cross compile Ethereum to various operating systems and architectures using a minimal set of prerequisites and a completely containerized approach, guaranteeing that your development environment remains clean even after the complex requirements and mechanisms of a cross compilation.
The currently supported target platforms are:
- ARMv7 Android and iOS
- 32 bit, 64 bit and ARMv5 Linux
- 32 bit and 64 bit Mac OSX
- 32 bit and 64 bit Windows
Please note, that cross compilation does not replace a release build. Although resulting binaries can usually run perfectly on the desired platform, compiling on a native system with the specialized tools provided by the official vendor can often result in more a finely optimized code.
Cross compilation environment
Although the
go-ethereum project is written in Go, it does include a bit of C code
shared between all implementations to ensure that all perform equally well, including a
dependency to the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library. Because of these, Go cannot
by itself compile to a different platform than the host. To overcome this limitation, we
will use
xgo, a Go cross compiler package based on
Docker containers that has been architected specifically to allow both embedded C snippets
as well as simpler external C dependencies during compilation.
The
xgo project has two simple dependencies: Docker (to ensure that the build
environment is completely contained) and Go. On most platforms these should be available
from the official package repositories. For manually installing them, please consult their
install guides at Docker and
Go respectively. This guide assumes that these two
dependencies are met.
To install and/or update xgo, simply type:
$ go get -u github.com/karalabe/xgo
You can test whether
xgo is functioning correctly by requesting it to cross
compile itself and verifying that all cross compilations succeeded or not.
$ xgo github.com/karalabe/xgo ... $ ls -al -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2792436 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-android-21-arm -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2353212 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-darwin-386 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2906128 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-darwin-amd64 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2388288 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-linux-386 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2960560 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-linux-amd64 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2437864 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-linux-arm -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2551808 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-windows-386.exe -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3130368 Sep 14 16:45 xgo-windows-amd64.exe
Building Ethereum
Cross compiling Ethereum is analogous to the above example, but an additional flags is required to satisfy the dependencies:
--depsis used to inject arbitrary C dependency packages and pre-build them
Injecting the GNU Arithmetic Library dependency and selecting
geth would be:
$ xgo --deps= \ github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/geth ... $ ls -al -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 23213372 Sep 14 17:59 geth-android-21-arm -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 14373980 Sep 14 17:59 geth-darwin-386 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 17373676 Sep 14 17:59 geth-darwin-amd64 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 21098910 Sep 14 17:59 geth-linux-386 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 25049693 Sep 14 17:59 geth-linux-amd64 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 20578535 Sep 14 17:59 geth-linux-arm -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 16351260 Sep 14 17:59 geth-windows-386.exe -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 19418071 Sep 14 17:59 geth-windows-amd64.exe
As the cross compiler needs to build all the dependencies as well as the main project itself for each platform, it may take a while for the build to complete (approximately 3-4 minutes on a Core i7 3770K machine).
Fine tuning the build
By default Go, and inherently
xgo, checks out and tries to build the master branch of a
source repository. However, more often than not, you‚Äôll probably want to build a different
branch from possibly an entirely different remote repository. These can be controlled via
the
--remote and
--branch flags.
To build the
develop branch of the official
go-ethereum repository instead of the
default
master branch, you just need to specify it as an additional command line flag
(
--branch):
$ xgo --deps= \ --branch=develop \ github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/geth
Additionally, during development you will most probably want to not only build a custom
branch, but also one originating from your own fork of the repository instead of the
upstream one. This can be done via the
--remote flag:
$ xgo --deps= \ --remote= \ --branch=rpi-staging \ github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/geth
By default
xgo builds binaries for all supported platforms and architectures, with
Android binaries defaulting to the highest released Android NDK platform. To limit the
build targets or compile to a different Android platform, use the
--targets CLI
parameter.
$ xgo --deps= \ --targets=android-16/arm,windows/* \ github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/geth
Building locally
If you would like to cross compile your local development version, simply specify a local
path (starting with
. or
/), and
xgo will use all local code from
GOPATH, only
downloading missing dependencies. In such a case of course, the
--branch,
--remote and
--pkg arguments are no-op:
$ xgo --deps= \ ./cmd/geth
Using the Makefile
Having understood the gist of
xgo based cross compilation, you do not need to actually
memorize and maintain these commands, as they have been incorporated into the official
Makefile and can be
invoked with a trivial
make request:
make geth-cross: Cross compiles to every supported OS and architecture
make geth-<os>: Cross compiles supported architectures of a particular OS (e.g.
linux)
make geth-<os>-<arch>: Cross compiles to a specific OS/architecture (e.g.
linux,
arm)
We advise using the
make based commands opposed to manually invoking
xgo as we do
maintain the Makefile actively whereas we cannot guarantee that this document will be
always readily updated to latest advancements.
Tuning the cross builds
A few of the
xgo build options have also been surfaced directly into the Makefile to
allow fine tuning builds to work around either upstream Go issues, or to enable some
fancier mechanics.
make ... GO=<go>: Use a specific Go runtime (e.g.
1.5.1,
1.5-develop,
develop)
make ... MODE=<mode>: Build a specific target type (e.g.
exe,
c-archive).
Please note that these are not yet fully finalized, so they may or may not change in the future as our code and the Go runtime features change.Date Unknown

FUOYE Procures Insurance Cover For Indigent Students
Agency Reporter
The Federal University of Oye-Ekiti in Ekiti (FUOYE) has approved a special insurance package of N3.1 million at N125, 000 each for 25 students to enable them to complete their programmes.
The students, it said, were those unable to continue with their education following death of their parents or guardians.
The Dean of Student Affairs of the university, Prof. Dosu Malomo in a statement issued on Sunday in Oye-Ekiti, said that the scheme would take care of the students‚Äô tuition and other essential needs covered by the insurance.
He disclosed that over 100 students had benefited from the scheme since it was set up.
Malomo explained that the management of FUOYE gave out N125, 000 each to the 25 students with a view to helping them continue with their education in the institution.
‚Äù The students who benefitted from the scheme expressed their gratitude to the university‚Äôs management team for making their dreams a reality, notwithstanding their financial constraints.
‚Äù The students appreciated the Vice-Chancellor , Prof. Abayomi Fasina and his team for showing support toward their education.
‚Äù They prayed that God will bless their children too and make them achieve the best in their future endeavours,‚Äù he said.
Malomo, who unveiled the scheme as approved by the vice-chancellor, said the NICON Insurance package, was introduced as a special policy to cater for students who suddenly lost their parents or guardian responsible for funding their education.
‚ÄúStudents will on submission of relevant documents, be screened for the claims of about N125, 000 each. The funds are sourced from the premium of N1, 000 paid by all students each session.
‚ÄúEqually, some truly indigent students may be considered for some funds from NICON Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) subject to the population of school and decision of NICON management.
‚ÄúThe criteria for qualifying for the package included earlier payment of the N1, 000 premium along with school fees, losing a parent or guardian and or the parent or guardian becoming fatally injured to a state of permanent disability,‚Äù he said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that members of staff of FUOYE have also lauded the vice chancellor for approving a proposal for special consideration for their biological children to get admissions into the university‚Äôs academic programmes..Wood Tech Systems

The Zeeland-based

GRAND RAPIDS (AP) - The
government helps the unemployed,
and there are dozens of charitable
organizations that aid the homeless.
But a new group called Family
Hope USA is using a "tough love"
approach to help the working poor, a
rowing population whose members
may be only one house payment away
from homelessness or one crisis away
from going hungry.
The nonprofit, Zeeland-based
group seeks to link the needy with
local professionals and tradespeople
willing to provide services such as
health care and auto repair for free,
President Joel Samy said in announc-
ing the group yesterday.
inIn return, recipients must enter
into a "written covenant" that requires
some community service.
"As the middle class sort of disap-
pears, ... the number of calls from the
working poor has increased dramati-
cally," said state Sen. William Van
Regenmorter (R-Jenison), who is on
the group's advisory board.
The group is just beginning to
Orm its network of providers in Kent
and Ottawa counties and hopes to
branch out to other parts of the state in
1994, said Samy, who most recently
was with the worldwide relief agency
International Aid of Spring Lake.
The "working poor" is defined as
families who fall below the poverty
line but are employed and do not seek
or qualify for government benefits.

$14,000 a year.
Among the five participants en-
rolled so far is a Hudsonville optom-
etrist who has agreed to set aside one
day per month to provide free eye
exams to children from working poor
families. Samy said he is in the pro-
cess of getting commitments from
doctors, plumbers, electricians, auto
mechanics and home builders.

Floods, fires
leave food
banks short
DETROIT (AP) - Food banks
that supply the needs of the homes,
elderly and unemployed are suffering
a growing gap between supply and
demand in a year plagued by natural
disasters and stagnant donations, of-
ficials say.
Two-hundred agencies in metro-
politan Detroit rely on the Gleaners
Community Food Bank to provide
200,000 meals a week. But this year,
the food bank finds itself pinched,
spokeswoman Kelly Farmer said
Tuesday.
"We are down from last year,"
Farmer said. "Financially, it's a little
bit of a harder year. Every dollar is a
struggle. We have a lot larger gap
between what's coming in and what's
needed."
In 1992, Gleaners distributed 13
million pounds of food. This year, it
expects to fall 1 million short of that,
Kelly said.
She said the largest reason for the
drop is this year's Midwestern floods
and other natural disasters.
"The food is diverted to these di-
saster zones, and it drains the food
from the system," Farmer said.
The food goes to soup kitchens
and to groups that supply food for the
needy to prepare at home, she said. Of
the 13 million pounds distributed last
year, Gleaners bought 2.5 million
pounds and received the rest in dona-
tions.
But changes in the food industry
threaten the supply of surplus food,
she said.

American Airlines is back in air; United faces slowdown
ASSOCIATED PRESS
American Airlines' flight atten-
dants returned to work and the airline
tried to resume normal service yester-
day, a day before the busiest travel
day of the year.
Passengers still faced possible
snarls and missed connections due to
disgruntled workers at another major
airline, United. Its machinists were
orchestrating strict safety checks that
amounted to a slowdown.
United reported no appreciable flight
delays from the action yesterday.
American Airlines expected to
return to full operations on Thanks-
giving Day.
The strike by the Association of
Professional Flight Attendants ended
in its fourth day Monday after Presi-
dent Clinton pushed the two sides to
submit their dispute to binding arbi-
tration.
"Directly after we met last evening,
everyone went to work to try to put
the airline back in the sky as promptly

nationwide, yesterday expects no delays for Thanksgiving travelers. At
United, machinists orchestrated strict safety checks that amounted to a
'slowdown.' United reported no delays in flights because of the action.
as possible," said Bob Baker,
American's executive vice president
for operations.
American was flying passengers
on more than 60 percent of its full
normal schedule of about 2,500 daily
flights, Baker said. He said the carrier
expected to be operating more than
70 percent by the end of the day.
On Wednesday, Baker said,
American expected to be running all
the 80 percent of its flights that it had
not canceled during the strike. The
airline had canceled 20 percent of its
flights outright and flew about 40
percent without passengers during the
strike because they lacked minimum
flight attendant crews.
By Thursday, the carrier hoped to
reach its original schedule and main-
tain it through the hectic post-Thanks-
giving weekend.
Baker said the strike does not ap-
pear to have hurt the airline's Christ-
mas bookings.
"It seems like the traveling public
had more confidence this would get
settled quicker than some of us on
both sides," said Don Carty,
American's executive vice president
for planning and finance.
American's rival carriers say they
will continue to take American tick-
ets through Nov. 30 without requiring
passengers to get American's ap-
proval.
"I think we're all relieved that
we'll have the quiet bedlam of Thanks-
giving holidays versus what we were
all anticipating," said Jon Austin,
spokesperson for Northwest Airlines.
"It seems to me the flight atten-
dants - for what they're doing -
they're pretty well paid," said Walter
Mundt of Raleigh, N.C., who was
waiting at that city's airport for a
flight to Charlotte.
"And Thanksgiving is not the time
to strike," added his wife, Donna.
"People want to be with their fami-
lies."
In Tulsa, Bernice Mitchell and her
husband said they had bought tickets
in September to go visit their son in
Washington.
"We just kept watching TV and
the radio and we were elated ysterday
to learn it was over," said Mrs.
Mitchell, a Payne County commis-
sioner from Stillwater, Okla.
"I don't have anything against
them," she said. "But we'll see. If we
can't get our flight today, then maybe
I'll say that I'll never fly American
again."
The union for American's 21,000
flight attendants said it and American
were working with the National Me-
diation Board to set up a meeting to
discuss specifics of the arbitration
process, possibly as early as Monday.
The flight attendants will work
under a contract American'imposed
on Nov. 1, which includes an average
7.8 percent annual pay raise. Flight
attendants' wages start at about
$16,000 per year, exceeding $40,000
after 14 years of service.
The union struck to try to win
better pay, medical benefits, staffing
and work rules. The strike was the
biggest against a U.S. airline since
1989.

Eighty-eight percent of high school seniors
drink alcoholic beverages, but illegal drug use
has declined, from 65 percent in 1980 to 41

said they smoked cigarettes.
The report said science scores for 9- and 13-

were in 1970, but fell for 17-year-olds. Profi-

Twin tragedies on opposite sides of the world are piling misery on people that have seen far more than their share. In Afghanistan, a group of gunmen known for sadistic tyranny rocketed back into power after 20 years as Western and Afghan leaders walked away with a sad shrug. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul, File)
The Taliban takeover of all of Afghanistan seems all but assured with the Islamist extremist group recently taking the capital, Kabul.
And while there are discussions taking place around the world, including in Canada, about whether countries should recognize ‚Äì if at all ‚Äì the new Taliban dictatorship, these discussions have largely surrounded the question of how foreign governments can support the Afghan people. But what has gone out of sight and out of mind is how widespread recognition of the Taliban could serve to significantly strengthen the regime, rather than serving as an important counter-balance to their extremist agenda.
Fortunately, there are significant parallels which the world can look to in order to understand the impact of appeasement on extremist Islamist terror organizations.
In 1982, in the face of incessant bombings from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which was using Lebanon as a staging ground for terrorist attacks against Israel, the Jewish State sought to end the violence, by launching Operation Peace for Galilee, which successfully uprooted the PLO. After Israel achieved its intended goals, the Israel Defense Forces withdrew from all of Lebanon, save for a tiny strip of land on the border called the Blue Line.
Hezbollah, an extremist Shia Islamist terror group based in southern Lebanon, had launched violent attacks against Israelis for decades, in an attempt to dislodge Israel, who stayed, recognizing the critical safety that the Blue Line provided.
But Israelis eventually grew tired of the ongoing attacks, and then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak unilaterally withdrew Israeli forces from the Blue Line in 2000, thinking that this would rob Hezbollah of its stated mandate to evict Israel from Lebanon, and would provide a long-standing peace.
That didn‚Äôt work. Hezbollah continued pursuing its mission, but greatly expanded its vision from the Lebanese-Israeli border, to destroying all of Israel. In 2006, Hezbollah launched a war with Israel which eventually killed approximately 1,300 Lebanese and 165 Israelis.
Hezbollah‚Äôs stance remains the same: ‚ÄúIsrael has no legitimacy to exist at all and must be destroyed,‚Äù Hezbollah‚Äôs leader, Hassan Nasrallah, proclaimed at an Al Quds rally last year to commemorate his group‚Äôs ongoing war with Israel.
Five years later, Israel tried the same tactic with the Gaza Strip. The small coastal enclave, despite its rich Jewish history stretching back thousands of years, remained in Egyptian hands until the Six Day War, when it was secured by Israel, which gained it in a defensive battle against Egypt.
By 2005, nearly 10,000 Israeli Jews were living in the Strip, but attacks on them from nearby Palestinian terrorist groups were a regular occurrence, and Israelis were once again growing tired of the ongoing war of attrition.
As a result, in 2005, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon led the Unilateral Disengagement, when the Israeli military removed all Israeli civilians and soldiers from the Gaza Strip. ‚ÄúThe purpose of the plan,‚Äù according to Israel‚Äôs ministry of foreign affairs, ‚Äúwas to improve Israel‚Äôs security and international status,‚Äù absent ongoing peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
When Israel left Gaza, Hamas, the fanatical Sunni Islamist group, replaced them.
Hamas soon turned the entire Strip into their personal terrorist fiefdom. Since then, Hamas has run roughshod over the rights of Gaza‚Äôs two million inhabitants, including executing homosexuals, dissidents and preventing women from leaving their homes without a male escort.
Hamas has also ceaselessly launched wars of aggression against Israel, most recently just three months ago, when it fired four thousand rockets into Israeli population centres, purposefully trying to kill Israeli civilians.
In 2000 and 2005, Israel had the best of intentions, to replicate its successful ‚ÄúLand for Peace‚Äù deal with Egypt in 1979. But in exchange for giving up land, Israel gave Hezbollah and Hamas an even bigger win: the perception of loss and appeasement.
That is precisely why, years later, most Israelis recognized that disengagement had unintended consequences. Israel made two very difficult decisions, in 2000 and 2005, for the cause of peace, and Israel cannot turn back the clock and re-evaluate those decisions in light of the enormous boost it has provided to Hezbollah and Hamas.
But the rest of the world can learn from Israel‚Äôs experiences, and our media should understand that groups like Hamas, Hezbollah or the Taliban think beyond four year election terms, sloganeering, or what will help them win votes. They think long-term, and that means any concession the world makes now ‚Äì through withdrawal, recognition or other diplomatic gifts ‚Äì will only serve to benefit these terror groups for many more years to come.THE COURTS

[Pa.B. Doc. No. 20-1265. Filed for public inspection September 18,.Economist David Rosenberg believes the bond market is getting inflation right and yields shouldn‚Äôt trade at higher levels.
His reasoning: Inflation as a temporary phenomenon caused by enormous pent-up demand and supply chain issues connected to the coronavirus pandemic.
‚ÄúThe numbers have been shocking to the upside, no doubt about it. But it‚Äôs pretty easily explainable,‚Äù the Rosenberg Research president told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrading Nation‚Äù on Friday. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why people want to superimpose these last couple of months into the future.‚Äù
So far, the bond market is shrugging off inflation. The benchmark 10-year Treasury Note yield hit its lowest level since March 3 on Friday and closed at 1.45%. The yield is off 7% over the last week and down almost 11% over the past month.
Sliding yields have been on Rosenberg‚Äôs radar for months.
In late February on ‚ÄúTrading Nation,‚Äù Rosenberg called the bond market ‚Äúradically oversold‚Äù and predicted the 10-year yield would retreat to 1%. At the time, the yield was around 1.5%.
‚ÄúThere is just so much noise and distortion in the data,‚Äù said Rosenberg, who served as Merrill Lynch‚Äôs top North American economist from 2002 to 2009. ‚ÄúThe most dangerous thing anybody can do is extrapolate what‚Äôs happening now.‚Äù
‚ÄúI refuse to hyperventilate over inflation.‚Äù
David Rosenberg
In a note to investors on Friday, he wrote ‚ÄúI refuse to hyperventilate over inflation.‚Äù He believes the other side of surging growth is a plateau.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the story for the second half of the year‚Ä¶ The bond market is sniffing that out right now,‚Äù Rosenberg said. ‚ÄúMy forecast is slower growth, inflation peaking out and rolling over and a bull flattening in the yield curve.‚Äù
It‚Äôs an outlook that would spell trouble for the reopening trade. Rosenberg predicts consumer cyclicals, a major part of it, will fall out of favor later this year.
‚ÄúGrowth should reclaim leadership over value in the stock market,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou want to be more in defensive growth and in areas of the market that are going to benefit from a lower bond yield.‚Äù
Rosenberg may be expecting trouble for the reopening trade, but he also believes bitcoin is prime for a resurgence. The cryptocurrency has been getting walloped, down 38% over the past two months.
He also wrote on Friday about encouraging signs that show bitcoin is getting ready for ‚Äúanother shot upwards.‚Äù He further suggested technicals indicate overbought conditions are unwinding.
Yet, he still won‚Äôt completely embrace the asset.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt own bitcoin. I never recommended anybody to buy it. It seems to me that crypto is here to stay. There is no doubt about it as a facilitator, of a medium of exchange,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBitcoin, to me, is a speculative trade. I don‚Äôt see it as a bonafide investment.‚Äù
Rosenberg prefers gold, an asset he has owned for years.
‚ÄúI just say buy the gold,‚Äù Rosenberg said. ‚ÄúGold has 1/5 of the volatility that bitcoin has.‚Äù
Gold is up 8% over the past two months. However, it‚Äôs off about one percent so far this year._2<<

Often attributed to the Italians, it is believed that Florentines were actually created in the royal French kitchens in the late 1600s in honour of their Tuscan in-laws, hence their name. Admittedly a little confusing for us, but incredibly flattering for the in-laws!
Ingredients
Melted butter, to grease
200g flaked almonds
150g sour dried cherries, finely chopped
150g candied orange rind, finely chopped
75g (¬Ω cup) plain flour
75g butter, cubed
75g (‚Öì cup) caster sugar
115g (80ml/‚Öì cup) honey
200g good-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa), melted and cooled (see Baker's Tips)
Method
- Preheat oven to 160¬∞C (140¬∞C fan-forced).
- Line an oven tray with non-stick baking paper. Brush the inside of six 7.5cm metal egg rings (see Baker's Tips) with a little melted butter to grease and place on the lined oven tray.
- Combine the flaked almonds, dried cherries, candied orange rind and flour in a large bowl and stir to combine evenly. Combine the butter, sugar and honey in a small saucepan and stir over medium heat until the butter just melts and the mixture is well combined. Add to the almond mixture and stir gently with a large metal spoon or spatula until evenly combined.
- Spoon 1¬Ω tablespoons of the mixture into an egg ring to fill half way and use the back of a metal spoon to spread, leaving it a little uneven if you want. Repeat with more mixture and the remaining five egg rings.
- Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Remove from the oven and cool on the trays for 5 minutes before removing the egg rings. Grease the egg rings again with a little more melted butter and repeat with the remaining mixture in three more batches.
- Use a palette knife or the back of a teaspoon to spread a generous amount of melted chocolate over the underside of a florentine to cover. Place on a wire rack, chocolate side up and set aside for 1 hour or until the chocolate sets. Repeat with the remaining cooled florentines.
Baker's Tips
- The longer the chocolate cools the thicker it will become and the more defined the 'swirls' of chocolate will be.
- Non-stick egg rings are perfect to use to make these florentines, but they will still need to be greased.
- These florentines will keep in an airtight container or jar in a cool dark place for up to 2 weeks.

Hailing from Siena in the Tuscan region of Italy, panforte (‚Äòstrong bread‚Äô when translated to English) is a delectable combination of dried fruits, nuts, spices, honey and, if you are lucky, chocolate. It is believed to date back to the 13th Century and was originally a form of tax paid to a local monastery. Like many traditional recipes, there are many variations with each often being a well-guarded family recipe ‚Äì however I will share this one with you!

Baker's Tips
- Confectioner's rice paper sheets are available from Asian grocers, delicatessens and specialty food stores. Don't confuse it with Asian rice paper, used to make rice paper rolls.
- Before adding the hot syrup to the fruit and nut mixture, place a tea towel under the bowl to stop it from slipping when mixing.
- To make individual panforte, grease eight 8cm (base diameter) loose-bottomed tart tins with oil spray or melted butter and line the bases witha circle of edible rice paper. Divide the mixture among the tins and press down firmly. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
- This panforte will keep wrapped well in plastic wrap in a cool spot for up to 1 month.

Young Development
Thirteen ‚Äì Adolescent Development Represented in a Modern-day Film
Home life, family dynamics, and Tracy‚Äôs relationship with her mommy, dad, brother, her mom‚Äôs boyfriend.
‚ÄúHow many times can you let him bone you over, ‚Äù Tracy yells in her mother after obtaining her mother‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs clothing in the dryer. ‚ÄúHis clothes should not be in your laundry, inches Tracy shouts, in an apparent mood swing action brought on by her hatred for her mom‚Äôs partner; it‚Äôs a feeling swing since moments ahead of Tracy and her friend and instructor Evie were strutting about in their new tight slacks and hot tops, becoming frisky, and flirtatious. Mommy is busy doing a client‚Äôs hair in the kitchen (mom is known as a hairstylist whom works by home), and Tracy constitutes a big hassle over individuals boyfriend clothes.
The home a lot more pretty seamy and unsophisticated, which helps explain for what reason Tracy is really easily embroiled by the smutty, bad-girl stature of Evie. When mommy finishes carrying out the absorb dyes job on the customer‚Äôs hair, she says to the customer that in case the customer ‚Äúgets laid‚Äù due to quality with the hair, then simply mom will get a bonus for the brunette hair coloring job. Mom sneaks cigs in her room, and shows the audience that the lady really doesn‚Äôt always have the tools to be a good mother in the traditional sense.
The daddy is practically a nonfunctioning partner in the raising of his daughter, asking his daughter ‚Äúto cut myself some slack‚Äù when he has become asked to take Tracy for a couple of days by simply her mommy. Even in the opening launching of a chat with his little girl he stops his dialog to take a phone call. Clearly his little girl knows he doesn‚Äôt proper care very much regarding her circumstance or her life. The brother is definitely an impressionable teen, who may be both interested in his sibling and struggling to do anything to assist her.
NEUROLOGICAL TRANSITIONS:
Puberty and Self-pride: In Steinberg‚Äôs book (41), he covers at wonderful length all of the changes an adolescent goes through when puberty arrives. ‚ÄúGoing through growing up may lead to simple declines in self-esteem amongst adolescent women‚Ä¶ ‚Äù Apparently prior to conference Evie, Tracy indeed a new bit of a self-esteem problem, nonetheless it appeared to become related to the peer group pressure Tracy feels at junior secondary school.
‚Äú‚Ä¶ Puberty may be a potential stressor (41) that has temporary adverse mental consequences for females, but only when it is along with other adjustments that need adjustment, ‚Äù Steinberg asserts. The changes in such a case are the emotions that Tracy experiences in junior high school as she sees the gorgeous girls, like Evie, and just how cool they will dress, how sexy they look, compared with their self, a rather ‚Äúplain Jane‚Äù by simply any assess. The beautiful young ladies look over by her not with contempt, but with arrogance and a kind of young age shame, that says, ‚Äúwe appear so much sexier than you perform girl, you have to be ashamed. inches
The very girls also laugh in Tracy‚Äôs ordinary style of costume. It makes Tracy feel very uncomfortable, which in turn ties into Steinberg‚Äôs perspective that growing up itself will not cause the psychological anxiety on its own, but instead when it is coupled with the lack of self-esteem created by the juxtaposition of her very own image as being a cute girl in monotonous, old fashioned garments, contrasted together with the gorgeous ladies in provocative, revealing garments.
The audience recognizes Tracy, early in the film, throwing away some of her clothes, and putting her teddies off the bed. It may be meaning on the part of the director showing Tracy can be shedding her childhood graphic, even rebelling against her childhood, nonetheless it is also perhaps a ramification of her dissatisfaction with her your life, her family, her place in her expert group.
Growing up and Changes in mood: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Studies indicate (41) that speedy increases in many hormones connected with puberty ‚Äì such as‚Ä¶ female and numerous adrenal androgens ‚Äì in particular when the improves take place incredibly early in adolescence, might be associated with elevated irritability, impulsivity, aggression (in boys), and depression (in girls). inch This description of hormonal changes in the body during puberty can be witnessed during the portion of the film just after Evie offers Tracy a cell phone number and asks Tracy to call up her following school.
The audience sees Tracy jumping for joy, like she‚Äôd earned the lottery or her team awarded the Super Bowl, till hanging out with Evie. Evie, the teenage empress, the hottest lady in school, the lady all other women want to look like (a figure such as a movie star and lips and eyes that drip with sexuality), features agreed to ask naive small Tracy into the world of sexual intercourse, drugs, boys, fast-lane living, shop-lifting, and teenage fun and excitement that is serendipitous, natural, and also dangerous.
And then, somewhat later in the film, the moment Tracy gets home and tries to call up Evie, the phone call cannot be accomplished. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm apologies, your call up cannot be completed as dialed‚Ä¶ ‚Äù the taped agent message is usually heard. Following calling once again, Tracy has got the same message, and kicks the waste bucket with the food prep in a rage. This really is a classic mood swing, not merely of a rotten brat who have didn‚Äôt acquire her approach, but of any teenage girl going through a dramatic natural transition (puberty) and also entering a interpersonal and peer-group transition.
In Steinberg‚Äôs study (44), this individual notes that ‚Äúmost analysts agree that the impact of hormonal modify on disposition and habit in adolescence is tremendously influenced by environmental factors. ‚Äù Environmentally friendly factor in Tracy‚Äôs world is definitely her expert group and her change from one peer group (the ordinary girls she utilized to hang out with) to a peer group led by Evie. Evie‚Äôs group is sought after by Tracy (and as well the film shows the sexy, splashy advertising on the downtown roadways that excites young girls to covet those fashions, cosmetic makeup products, and styles, which will mesmerizes Tracy), because Evie is one among prettier young ladies, the more popular ladies, the girls who are wanted by boys, girls who have act older and do mature things like cigarette smoking and drugs and having sex and stealing from department stores.
As for Tracy, her adolescent changes in mood, on page 44 of Steinberg‚Äôs book, often ‚Äúparallel [her] changes in activities. ‚Äù When ever mom requires why Tracy is totally wasting some of her old clothes, Tracy blurts out, in a quick-tempered feelings swing, ‚ÄúI need new clothes. I‚Äôm stupid! Hello there! ‚Äù The ‚Äúchange of activities‚Äù means Tracy is currently running which includes hot young ladies and going out in places where boys can easily see and be scene, the shopping center.
Puberty and Family Associations: It‚Äôs already very clear that Tracy‚Äôs family is dysfunctional, and does not offer her anything that will help a teenage girl be lifted up out of the psychological absolute depths that puberty plunges her into occasionally. On page forty five, Steinberg alludes to studies which show that inch‚Ä¶ As kids mature coming from childhood toward the middle of growing up, distance together and their parents increases, and conflict intensifies, especially between your adolescent wonderful or her mother‚Ä¶ inches
This is very very clear as the audience views the continuing and developing conflict among Tracy and her mother. As the film progresses, more and more it really is obvious that there is zero interaction between Tracy and her mother. Tracy lies regularly to cover pertaining to the incorrect activities the girl engages in with Evie, then when Tracy‚Äôs mother tries to obtain serious, or impart motherly guidance, Tracy becomes upset and her mood converts to trend and belligerence.
PSYCHOSOCIAL COMPLICATIONS: When the film opens, the audience sees Tracy and Evie slapping the other person so viciously they hemorrhage from the oral cavity. This is a foreshadowing way of what will happen later, as Tracy continues her habit of cutting very little, a ‚Äúself-destructive behavior. inch When Evie slides out the window of Tracy‚Äôs bedroom to go and have sexual intercourse with a boy, Tracy then simply takes a scissors and reduces herself inside the wrist deeply. It would seem that she is depressed already, by confusion in her your life and the acceleration of her social changes with Evie; but it may be at this point that she would like to have sex too, wants to grow up as they say and be since ‚Äúmature‚Äù as Evie with her individual sexual encounters.
The desire to lower her very own self may be a result of depressive disorder that Tracy is suffering from, partly by puberty, and partly from her dysfunctional family placing. In Steinberg‚Äôs section, ‚ÄúDepression and Committing suicide, ‚Äù he point out (511) that it is ‚Äúnot normal to get adolescents to feel an extended or strong sense of hopelessness or frustration. inches Young people who have do indeed experience ‚Äúprolonged or intense‚Äù feelings to be frustrated (by family) and having hopelessness surrounding these people, ‚Äúare likely to be psychologically despondent and in want of professional help. ‚Äú
It appears that the deep cut Tracy inflicted on herselfHave you always wanted to go on a big trek? Or simply get outside more in the countryside?

Hillary Rodham Clinton on her first political thriller written with author Louise Penny.
Show moreThe former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has a new book out, ‚ÄúState of Terror‚Äù, a political thriller written with the award winning author Louise Penny. The two women were already friends before deciding to pen the novel which features a President who ‚Äúsmells of meat‚Äù and appears to resemble Donald Trump and a British Prime Minister who‚Äôs ‚Äúa twit‚Äù and seems to have a more than a passing resemblance to Boris Johnson. Anita Rani talks to the duo about their collaboration and some of the uncanny parallels between ‚ÄúState of Terror‚Äù and global politics today.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common virus ‚Äì Cancer Research UK estimates around 8 out of 10 people will be infected at some point in their lives. HPV spreads through sexual activity. In most people, it doesn‚Äôt cause any problems and goes away on its own, but HPV can increase a woman‚Äôs chance of developing cervical cancer. Gynaecological charity The Eve Appeal have found a ‚Äòworrying‚Äô trend in HPV kits being sold online by private companies, advertised alongside misleading information. Tracie Miles is a gynaecologist cancer specialist nurse at The Eve Appeal. Mercedes Gleeson is someone who has been open about her own experience with HPV.
Anita is joined by two guests who are trying to encourage women to get outside and go on adventures. Army Officer Preet Chandi is preparing for a solo, unsupported trek across Antarctica to the South Pole in November. She will be the first Asian woman to do this. Dr Geeta Ludhra set up a walking group in the Chilterns to encourage women from diverse backgrounds to get out on smaller scale adventures in the UK to connect with nature and feel the health benefits. headtopics.comRead more: BBC Woman's Hour ¬ª.

Our trainees write some brilliant blogs over at 'Trainees take on business' and a recent post on "The rise of the 'tap and go' cashless society" caught my eye.
The post would be an interesting read for anyone involved in the retail sector. I don't intend to repeat any of the facts and figures here, but it goes without saying that cashless payments don't come without risk. One of those must be the rise of cyber-crime.
As systems become smarter, so too do those intent on hacking them. Retail units and shopping centres are often used as examples of potential targets and the risk may come from something as simple as point of sale (PoS) systems.
In an article published this summer, we were quoted as saying that the number of UK retailers experiencing data breaches has doubled over the past year. Whilst some of that will be down to human error, there is a clear need to keep PoS and other software up to date and ensure that the relevant checks and balances are in place. Just last month, the clothing retailer Forever 21 confirmed there has been unauthorised access to data at some of its stores caused by the encryption on some PoS devices not being in operation.
On a larger scale, many retail units and shopping centres are likely to have building management systems that are open to the risk of cyber-crime. It is not uncommon for heating and other systems to be controlled remotely and, if control falls into the wrong hands, the financial and reputational repercussions could be significant.
Whether landlord or tenant, all those involved in the retail sector should be alive to the risk of cyber crime and, where relevant, ensure that the matters are dealt with adequately in property documentation.

Now showing items 1-1 of ...Residents have highlighted what is best about living in Merton and the priorities they want the council to focus on as we emerge from the pandemic and the council plans for the future.
During the spring, the council ran Your Merton ‚Äì its biggest ever conversation with people who live, work or study in the borough.
Thousands of responses were received, with more than 10,000 people visiting an interactive website to give their views on their local area, plus a series of focus groups and a borough-wide residents survey of 1,000 people, culminating in the biggest single resident engagement project in the council‚Äôs history.
Green spaces & communities are most valued by residents
The two things valued most by residents ‚Äì seen across all parts of the borough ‚Äì is the abundance of high-quality open spaces and parks, such as Morden Park, Mitcham Common and Wimbledon Park.
Additionally, residents felt the sense of community is a major asset in their local areas, a sentiment that has grown as a result of the pandemic and communities coming together.
Litter, traffic and parking are targets for the council to improve
Clear themes have also emerged from the biggest listening exercise in the council‚Äôs history about areas for improvement.
With more people spending more time in their local neighbourhoods, residents have expressed frustrations about issues closer to home, including traffic and street cleanliness, particularly littering and fly-tipping, which continues to be an issue in some areas. Parking charges were also a concern, as was the volume of traffic on the streets.
Ambitions for the future are better high streets & improved open spaces
When asked about their priorities for the borough, residents highlighted high streets and open spaces, reflecting changes in behaviour arising during the pandemic, especially a desire to spend more time in local neighbourhoods. Feedback shows that residents want regenerated high streets that can be community hub areas as well as shopping areas.
The Leader of Merton Council, Councillor Mark Allison, said: ‚ÄúI ordered the biggest conversation the council has ever held with residents because it was vital to learn how the pandemic had changed what people want, and ensure residents‚Äô views shape the decisions the council makes about Merton‚Äôs future.
‚ÄúYour Merton has shown there is so much that people love about the borough, especially our green spaces, which are among our greatest assets, and our strong community spirit and desire to look after those who need our help the most, which supported the borough through the darkest months of COVID-19.
‚ÄúBut I recognise that there are frustrations too. While keeping everyone safe remains my top priority, now people are spending more time locally we need a greater focus on combating the littering and fly-tipping of a minority. That‚Äôs why the council has already released ¬£250k to begin that work, while we look at longer-term solutions.
‚ÄúWe also need to listen to residents‚Äô worries about traffic and the environment, and we will be looking at ways to reduce the number of journeys made by car and tackle the climate emergency.
‚ÄúPeople told us that, as one of London‚Äôs greenest boroughs, Merton‚Äôs parks and open spaces should be at the heart of our ambitions for the future, along with revived high streets that are thriving community hubs where people can socialise and do business.
‚ÄúTurning these ambitions into reality will be a challenge, but I want to thank Merton‚Äôs residents for their feedback. We will now draw up plans to deliver the future our residents want.‚Äù
Residents can view the full results and feedback on our website: The feedback will now be analysed in detail, before the council publishes a new community plan for Wimbledon, Mitcham, Morden, Colliers Wood and Raynes Park in early 2022.Study: Gay and Bi Men Earn Less, Lesbians Earn More, Than Straight Counterparts
The tattered myth that gays are generally better off than their heterosexual peers took another hit with a new study that reconfirms gay and bisexual men earn less than straight men do.
Lesbians, on the other hand, earn more overall than heterosexual women.
The new paper, published today in the quarterly Journal of Population Economics, is the work of researchers from Anglia Ruskin University and was authored by university professor Nick Drydakis. It is a meta-study that surveys two dozen earlier papers to arrive at its conclusions.
"The papers cover the period between 1991 and 2018, and countries in Europe, North America, and Australia," the study's abstract states.
In addition to its main findings of a pay disparity, the study's abstract took note that "in data sets after 2010, gay men and bisexual men and women continue to experience earnings penalties, while lesbian women continue to experience earnings premiums" despite anti-discrimination efforts.
The continuing disparity "represents a cause for concern and indicates the need for comprehensive legislation and workplace guidelines" to address the gaps, the abstract added.
In terms of concrete numbers, the study found that "gay men earn on average 6.8 [percent] less than straight guys across all three continents," summarized British LGBTQ site Pink News, whereas the differential for lesbians is 7.1 percent more than straight women.
"But the pay gap is even larger for bisexual men, who take home a thumping 10.3 [percent] less than straight men," Pink News noted. "For bi women, the difference is 5.1 [percent]."
The numbers bring additional clarity to something researchers have been saying for years: That LGBTQ workers, overall, earn less than their straight, cisgender peers.
Research published in 2019 by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law found that "22% of LGBTQ people in the U.S. live in poverty," in contradiction to the persistent myth that gays are rich. By contrast, the study showed, the rate of poverty among heterosexual people in the U.S. is 16%.
But that data may not show the full extent of the problem as it exists in 2021. LGBTQ workers "have been especially hard hit throughout the economic recession that has accompanied the coronavirus pandemic," according to a "study by Human Rights Campaign and PSB Research," which showed that "17% of LGBTQ people polled lost their jobs because of COVID-19, compared to 13% of the general population," the Philadelphia Gay News reported last November.
"For LGBTQ people of color, the numbers were even more disproportionate: 22% reported losing their job because of the pandemic, compared to 14% of white LGBTQ people polled," the report revealed.Bienvenu et bienvenido to our Languages Day!
We so enjoyed celebrating the French and Spanish languages. The children and teachers watched a play in French and Spanish and the pupils took part in an Escape Room. Although principally aimed at Years 7 & 8, Year 4 were very pleased to join Years 7 and 8 as they watched the Spanish theatre production. The French students squeezed in writing to their French penpals as well!
It was very fun and I learned lots of new words. It was nice listening to people speak French.
Felix, Year 7
The Escape Room was a great opportunity to work as a team, and the play had some awesome tricks and was also very funny!
Davina, Year 7
It was very entertaining and immersive, I loved it.
Tobias, Year 8
I understood some of the play, which I didn't expect. I loved it when my friend ended up on stage!

The food that we buy only comes from Austria - whether that is beef, pork or ham from Sieghartskirchen in Lower Austria, tea and coffee from the city of Salzburg and the Salzburg regions of Pongau and Pinzgau, or wine and schnapps from Burgenland along with other predestined growing areas in Austria. We champion regionality!
Some 200 hens live on our farm and they have one thing above all else - plenty of space in open land, so they get to enjoy fresh air and a healthy lush green and area of land to scrape on and have some lovely "sand baths". That this freedom of movement that they enjoy is reflected in the taste is obvious. How about a breakfast with a fried egg, omelette or scrambled egg made using our own eggs? Give it a go!

Add all the ingredients to a tub and pour as much water over the nettles to cover them. Your hand should, with light pressing, be 1 cm below the water level. Leave it all in a cool place, around 6¬∞ C, for 3 to 4 days. Then strain the liquid using a cloth strainer and boil up. Add the sugar and bottle or fill a bag-in-box.
Method
Boil up the currants with a bit of sugar and put through a food processor. Add 1kg sugar for every 3 litres of fruit juice, boil up and bottle or add to a bag-in-box.
Tip: If you do not have a food processor, then just get a fine sieve (fine gauze) and pass the fruit through it. Boil up the fruit twice with some water and pass through the sieve again. Add 1kg sugar for every 3 litres of fruit juice, boil up and bottle or add to a bag-in-box.Light Box Advert

One of the major factors holding economic growth back in South Africa is power shortages. While Eskom, the public utility, has 45,000 MW of capacity, an estimated one-third of this is currently out of commission due to a combination of scheduled maintenance and unexpected breakdowns.
Power Cuts
The electrical system has very little room for error and often struggles to meet demand, with this often resulting in periodic and targeted power cuts. The latest round of load shedding started in November 2014, when a silo collapsed at the Majuba power plant. It continued as the country faced temporary fuel shortages, water shortages at hydro plants and the breakdown of vital components. During the first eight months of 2015, South Africa experienced 99 days of scheduled power cuts. For its part, Eskom has an estimated funding gap of R200bn ($17.3bn), and has fallen behind on the addition of much-needed new capacity because of strikes, higher-than-expected costs and technical issues.
Additional Capacity
However, the government has developed a plan for making up the shortfall. It is building two coal-fired plants, Medupi and Kusile, which when finished will each supply 4800 MW of capacity. The first 794 MW came on-line in 2015, with more to follow through to 2018. A feasibility study on a third plant has also been undertaken. In addition, three mothballed plants were returned to service in 2014, while the 100-MW Sere wind farm went into operation in 2015, and a considerable amount of other renewable energy capacity is coming on-stream.
A series of other projects are in the works that could increase capacity and diversify generation. The Department of Energy‚Äôs Integrated Resource Plan calls for coal-fired electricity to account for less than 15% of all new generation capacity added through to 2030. Renewables are set to provide 42% of all new generation capacity. The plan includes the construction of 9.6 GW of nuclear energy and 11.4 GW of renewables, including solar and wind, by 2030 (see Energy chapter). There are plans to install six nuclear power plants by 2030, although the long lead times involved in getting these up and running have caused some to question the viability of atomic energy in South Africa.
Effect On Business
There have been complaints from the manufacturing, tourism and retail sectors that the cuts make things difficult in an already strained economic environment. Businesses are unable to commit to fresh investments or expansion until they are convinced of a reliable source of energy. ‚ÄúWe will not have strong growth in investment until businesses can be assured of continuous supply of base load,‚Äù Goolam Ballim, chief economist and global head of research at Standard Bank, told OBG. Load shedding has been a particular problem for the minerals industry, which is a heavy user of electricity, and given the dominance of this sector the impact is felt across the entire economy. The effect has been compounded by the recent fall in commodities prices.
However, there is now widespread agreement that more power is needed in South Africa, and, while the funding requirements are certainly heavy, the planned new capacity should alleviate the pressure on the system once it comes on.By Drew Hayden Taylor

At about 3:30 on Saturday, March 26 I was released from prison. Really. It was great to smell the fresh air again, to see the horizon and not just those oppressive four walls. More importantly, it was great to know I was once again the master of my own destiny. True, some of my family had always suspected that someday I would end up in prison. How right they were. My crime‚Ä¶ I am a writer. God, I had missed freedom.
Perhaps I should mention I had been ‚Äòlocked up in the big house‚Äô for about three hours, give or take. And did I mention it was a women‚Äôs prison? And I was there to do a reading from some of my books. Not nearly as melodramatic, but more accurate. As a writer, you never know where you‚Äôll end up. That includes the Edmonton Institute for Women. The title of the establishment sounds quite refined and bookish, doesn‚Äôt it? And basically, the place looks like a large community college, surrounded by 10-foot fences topped with barbed wire.
I had been asked by the local library system if I would be interested in paying these women a visit. Evidently, the Native clientele of that establishment had a book club and had been reading my novel, Motorcycles & Sweetgrass, and I was at the top of their list for potential visiting authors. Who was I to say no to a ‚Äúcaptive‚Äù audience? Authors such as myself crave new experiences and this would definitely be one. So off I went to the great province of Alberta, not knowing what to expect.
So I began my adventure by going through security. During some sort of chemical swab test to see if I was carrying any type of illicit contraband, I was surprised to discover my wallet tested positive for morphine. Not a good beginning. Immediately I had visions of rubber gloves and cavity searches. Quickly, I tried to tell the security people that poppies don‚Äôt grow well in the forests of central Ontario. I don‚Äôt even like poppy seed bagels.
But the nonchalance of the woman behind the counter soon told me not to panic. She barely batted an eye. I found out later that false positives like this are quite common. It seems that practically every monetary bill in circulation has in some way come in contact with drugs, or with other bills that have been in contact with drugs. Evidently the money you have right now in your wallet probably has some sort of trace elements on it. So next, to be safe, she swabbed my cell phone. Luckily, my cell had led a more Mormon lifestyle and was drug free. Upon my return to the real world, I immediately sent my wallet into rehab.
After that auspicious beginning, the rest of the afternoon went surprisingly well. In the gym, where I held court underneath the volleyball net, the audience of about 24 ladies were attentive and intelligent. We all laughed, had a great conversation after the reading/lecture, and my impression of ‚Äúcaged women‚Äù changed substantially. Surprisingly, it‚Äôs nothing like the movies. Even one of the guards became unexpectedly delighted when I mentioned I had written for ‚ÄúThe Beachcombers.‚Äù I was told he had, at some point, started a Beachcombers fan Web site. All went well except when I tried to find a men‚Äôs washroom in a women‚Äôs prison. It‚Äôs just something you never really think about.
But as always, it wasn‚Äôt long before I soon put my own foot in my mouth. Asked for advice by a woman interested in becoming a writer, I told them my four rules for developing yourself as a good writer. The first one, possibly the most important, was and is: try to lead an interesting life. The more you‚Äôve done in your life, the more you‚Äôll have to write about. They all looked at each other and smirked. Next, I mentioned the second part of the rule. And keep in mind, I usually give this speech to high school students. I told them (again, for high school students) that if they plan to spend all of their time in one place doing one thing (I often use the basement as an example, playing video games for instance), they‚Äôre not going to have much to write about. So get out and see the world.
And this is where the real laughter started.
Looking back, they quite probably all had led interesting lives. Very interesting lives no doubt. And I had a hunch they were also quite probably going to be spending all their time in one place. Maybe playing video games, maybe not. And getting out and seeing the world would require a hack saw or helicopter.
Oh well, it did make them laugh.Property Attributes

Image Source:
Movie: Abhinetri
Rating: 2.5/5
Banner: MVV Entertainments
Cast: Prabhu Deva, taking on a role in ‚ÄòBaahubali‚Äô which was a massive hit, Tamannah has been really popular in the movie world and which has brought her into the making of ‚ÄòAbhinetri‚Äô which was delivered in three different languages which are; Tamil, Telugu and Hindi languages simultaneously.
After all the buzz that came with this movie, let‚Äôs see how it goes‚Ä¶
Story:
Krishna Kumar (Prabhu Deva) a happy man who works in Mumbai has dreams of marrying a polished city girl but with his grandmother being on her death bed, his father with the aid of his dying grandmother decides to pick a decent girl from the village for him to marry.
Krishna eventually marries Devi (Tamannah), his father and grandmother‚Äôs choice though unwillingly and in an attempt to hide her from his friends and the public decided to move to an apartment in the main city.
Settling in their new home, Krishna realized that Devi has been possessed by Ruby, the former homeowner whose dream was to become a star actress but committed suicide due to some ugly situations.
Find out what happened next and how Krishna lived with his wife Devi and Ruby at the same time.
Highlights:
Tamannah
Music
Drawback:
Weak story
Predictable narration
Neither comedy nor horror is appealing
Analysis:
In this drama, we saw a story of Krishna (Prabhu Deva) who was looking for a polished bride only to end up marrying a village bride, and the spirit of an actress who wasn‚Äôt able to fulfill her dreams as a star possessing the new bride.
Director A L Vijay after delivering movies like ‚ÄòNanna‚Äô and ‚ÄòMadras Pattanam‚Äô in such a great way has released a rather weak storyline with a predictable narration and a drama that has no comedy and no appealing horror which has been such a turn off here. After revealing the whole twist of the drama, there was nothing to catch you off guard because it became predictable.
Tamannah due to the success of ‚ÄòBaahubali‚Äô is a popular actress who delivers excellently as is displayed here in ‚ÄòAbhinetri‚Äô how she took on the dual personality role from a timid village to an aspiring star and delivered a great work. Prabhu Deva‚Äôs funny dances and his helpless husband role has also worked in this drama. Sonu Sood as a movie star is fine and also Sapthagiri as a comedian is good.
A film with catchy music, great cinematography, good editing, nice artworks and choreography. Shot with decent production values with good background values though with poor writing and narration with just good direction.
In the end, ‚ÄòAbhinetri‚Äô is a movie that neither has comedy nor effective horror elements. But has catchy music. A good movie though with some setbacks and few highlights.
Bottom-line: No Comedy No HorrorDelving into Ditherington

I‚Äôm slowly chipping away and deciding whether it‚Äôs buy or bye. This week, all three came from this reading list about motherhood and parents.
What Dementia Teaches Us About Love by Nicci Gerrard
Summary: After her own father‚Äôs death from dementia, author Nicci Gerrard set out to explore the illness that now touches millions of us, yet which we still struggle to speak about. What does dementia mean, for those who live with it, and those who care for them?
I used to say that we are made of our memories, but what happens when memories are lost?
I‚Äôm thinking: Yes.
When Death Takes Something From You Give It Back by Naja Marie Aidt
Summary: In 2015, Aidt‚Äôs 25-year-old son, Carl, died in a tragic accident. Her memoir is an attempt to formulate a vocabulary to express the deepest kind of pain, and articulates her greatest fear: to forget.
I‚Äôm thinking: Yes.
Things Nobody Knows But Me by Amra Pajaliƒá
Summary: When she is four years old Amra Pajaliƒá realises that her mother is different. Fatima is loving but sometimes hears strange voices that tell her to do bizarre things. It is not until she is sixteen that Amra learns the name for the malady that has dogged her mother and affected her own life: bipolar disorder.
I‚Äôm thinking: Maybe.
It doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre going to chip away any of these this time‚Ä¶
You know, one of the things I like about your Sample Saturdays is that it‚Äôs a lesson to all of us about impulse buying (which is one of my worst sins). The Kindle makes it so easy: I never use it for Australian books, but sometimes I rush in when an international title takes my fancy. But I usually buy the book instead of just getting a sample. I might make a NY Resolution this year to buy samples only in future!
I was always an impulse buyer on Kindle as well but then thought that if I‚Äôm in a book shop, I‚Äôd usually open a book I was considering and read the first page or so‚Ä¶ and samples are the same (and because they‚Äôre free, it satisfies the impulse!).
Yes, I think I should take up this strategy too‚Ä¶
The Aidt is a very striking and beautiful book. I gave up on the Gerrard, perhaps because I‚Äôd just read too much about dementia recently.
Have noticed the Aidt popping up on a few ‚Äòbest of 2019‚Äô lists‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm tracking with you on all these. I suspect my mum has first signs of dementia ‚Äì very mild as yet but would still be good to read the Gerrard book to help my understanding
Two dementia books I would highly recommend are In Pursuit of Memory by Joseph Jebelli (a clinical view) and Somebody I Used to Know by Wendy Mitchell (an inside view).
Although this might seem like a big undertaking, there is a free online course about understanding dementia run out of the Dementia Studies Centre at University of Tasmania and it‚Äôs accessed by people all around the world ‚Äì I found it to be extremely thorough and informative, and well worth the time. The next course starts in Feb 2020 ‚ÄìWho is this new DJ going to rock PDM rally in Lahore tonight?
Lahore is abuzz with a massive show of power by the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an opposition alliance of 11 parties led by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam.
It is a mix of ideologies, ethnicities, and politics. The spectrum may be wide, but the demand is concise: Imran Khan has to go, and his ‚Äòselectors‚Äô have to decide. And, to warm the blood of their supporters and workers, the PDM organisers have hired a woman, famous as DJ Kiran Butt, to fuel the rock concert-like atmosphere of these political protests.

More Safety Tips at Propanecomfort.comGlasgow, Scotland ‚Äì Thousands of climate activists marched through the Scottish city that hosted the United Nations climate summit on Saturday, physically close to global negotiators but separated by a vast gap in expectations, with frustrated marchers calling off climate talks. Rapidly rejected and demanded immediate action to slow global warming instead.
Despite complaints of rain and bursts, the atmosphere of protest in Glasgow was upbeat. Climate protests took place across Europe, including London, Paris, Dublin, Copenhagen, Zurich and Istanbul.
Protesters condemned government leaders around the world, saying climate talks so far have failed to produce the quick action needed. Activist Greta Thunberg on Friday condemned the talks, calling it ‚Äúblah, blah, blah‚Äù.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having these conversations, but don‚Äôt really have a policy to support them,‚Äù said Days Agazi, a London marcher at a Glasgow performance, shouting to the steady beat of drums.
‚ÄúAnd on top of that, real people have to be in the room,‚Äù Agazi said, echoing complaints that there is increasingly limited participation by the public at the Glasgow summit. ‚ÄúHow are we supposed to make good policy when its stakeholders aren‚Äôt even in the room?‚Äù
Marchers were holding signs with messages including ‚ÄúCode Red for Humanity,‚Äù ‚ÄúStop the big polluters,‚Äù ‚ÄúCOP26, we‚Äôre looking at you‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúI‚Äôm angry.‚Äù A sign asked, ‚ÄúIf not you then who? Now or never?‚Äù
Megan McClellan, 24, of Glasgow, said she suspected climate negotiators were listening.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very easy thing for them to ignore. They‚Äôre nice and comfortable‚Äù inside the summit center, she said, which is surrounded by a steel fence.
But her 30-year-old friend Lucet Wood from Edinburgh disagreed.
‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt really do anything about it, but they pretend they do‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôll put it off for 20-30 years,‚Äù Wood said.
Whether as a strategy to increase pressure on governments or to reject talks, Thunberg‚Äôs dismissal of the two-week summit ‚Äì with another week left ‚Äì has resonated inside and outside the summit venue. Government leaders and negotiators say they are as aware of the urgency of their action as the time is running out to curb pollution from fossil fuels before Earth‚Äôs temperatures rise too high.
Marcher Jason Cook, 54, came to Glasgow with two friends and all three wore helmets bearing the word ‚Äúblah‚Äù.
Cook, like other marchers, echoed Thunberg‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to hear any more blah, blah, blah,‚Äù he said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been one of several global leaders who have embraced Thunberg‚Äôs phrase as he defends the progress made by governments in increasing emissions cuts and climate financing promises.
Canada‚Äôs Member of Parliament and 16-time UN climate talks participant Elizabeth May joined the Glasgow protesters on Saturday.
‚ÄúOverwhelmingly, protest makes a difference,‚Äù May said. ‚ÄúMost of the people inside are here in their hearts and sometimes physically.‚Äù
Inside the sprawling United Nations convention venue, negotiators negotiated a seventh day of talks between nearly 200 countries, which could be passed to government ministers for political approval next week. A new commitment to cap global warming at 1.5 ¬∞C (2.7 ¬∞F), prompting countries to review their efforts more frequently to increase pressure for deeper cuts, and more financial support for poorer countries to adapt is to provide. to climate change.
Summit president Alok Sharma told reporters that he understood the frustration of the protesters.
‚ÄúI think we have made progress overall,‚Äù Sharma said on Saturday. ‚ÄúI think the people in the negotiating room have been creative.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe are reaching the point where the rubber hits the road, where we have to take tough decisions by government officials‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúI certainly don‚Äôt underestimate the difficulty of the task that lies ahead of us.‚Äù
Saturday‚Äôs march attracted many participants and ages, a day after the Future Movement on Friday saw thousands of youth protest outside the fence of the Glasgow convention. Thunberg‚Äôs mix of school strikes, blunt and impatient talk about government excuses, and mass demonstrations have fueled climate protests, particularly in Europe, since 2018.
The climate protest movement ‚Äì and this year‚Äôs worsening droughts, hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters around the world ‚Äì has brought home many of the accelerated damages of global warming and calls on governments for stronger and faster action to reduce fossil fuels. pressure is maintained. fuel emissions.
In central London, hundreds of climate protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square. Protester Sue Hampton, 64, said everyone is at risk and all generations need to press for action.
‚ÄúWe cannot let the youth here do all the work. We all have to do it together,‚Äù she said.
In Istanbul, climate protesters brought their children to a demonstration on Saturday, emphasizing the impact of global warming on future generations.
‚ÄúI want my children to live on a beautiful planet in the future,‚Äù said 52-year-old Kadriye Basut in Istanbul.
Danica Kirka in London, Seth Borenstein in Glasgow and Andrew Wilkes in Istanbul contributed to this report.[ad_1]
Weary cryptocurrency traders awoke to the sight of green in the markets on May 2 as bulls managed to bid the price of Bitcoin (BTC) above the crucial ‚Äòline in the sand‚Äô resistance at $37,500, while Ether (ETH) briefly traded at $2,800.
The rising price of both BTC and Ether has been accompanied by double-digit gains in multiple altcoins, leading some to speculate that the market is currently experiencing an oversold bounce following the recent downturn.
The leader of the pack for this most recent rally is once again Dogecoin (DOGE), which rallied 28% to an intraday high at $0.4446 following the June 1 announcement that the token would be listed on Coinbase Pro and renewed Twitter promotion from Elon Musk.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect the bullish turn for DOGE on May 31, prior to the recent price rise and ahead of the Coinbase Pro announcement. DOGE began to register green on May 31 and reached a high of 74 on June 1, just 14 hours before the system registered the NewsQuake‚Ñ¢ announcement of DOGE being listed on Coinbase Pro which was followed by a 45% rally.
DeFi projects gain traction
Cointelegraph Markets Pro data for Kyber Network (KNC) shows that market conditions for the project have been favorable for some time.
As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS‚Ñ¢ Score for KNC shifted into the green zone on May 31 and stayed elevated for the next two days before reaching a high of 74 on June 1 when its price began a 75% rally.
Another DeFi-focused project that was identified by Cointelegraph Markets Pro ahead of its recent price move is Kava, which has gained 36% in the past 24 hours and currently trades at $4.68.
As seen in the chart above, conditions for KAVA have been bullish for some time as evidenced by the sustained green VORTECS‚Ñ¢ score over the past week. The VORTECS‚Ñ¢ score for KAVA reached a high of 75 on May 31, roughly 48 hours before starting a 45% price rally.
The May 19 correction wiped out $1.2 trillion in value across the crypto market and while shockwaves from the historic correction are still reverberating throughout the market, a handful of DeFi token and altcoins are beginning to show signs of bullish momentum.
This suggests that cautious traders are slowly easing their way back into the market in hopes that the second leg of the 2021 bull market could be underway.

The beat is pacey, reminiscent of old school South African dance styles such as Shagaan Electro. The ears are fed heartily on the deep rhythms, punchy bass and percussion jumping and twisting with reckless abandon.
There‚Äôs a reason South African kids dance in such a crazy way‚Ä¶ SA dance music is just a cut above!
The lyrics are in Tsonga and English, although because it‚Äôs SA, Swahili and Zulu also enter the mix. The country is diverse, to say the least. Maybe that‚Äôs why the music is so cool!Good Design | The Art of Winning with LBB at Boxpark
What do you think of when you hear the phrase ‚ÄòThe art of winning‚Äô? Federa‚Äôs unearthly ability to create new angles on a tennis court? Or the feeling you get when you come back from a personal hardship only to feel bigger and better? This was the conceptual gauntlet thrown down to young illustrators and designers by creative directors Ansel Neckles and Stephanie McLaren from creative agency Twenty%extra in ‚ÄòThe art of winning‚Äô poster competition. The launch party for the exhibition was held at the super trendy location of Boxpark in Shoreditch , the world‚Äôs first pop-up mall. Nestled in between Nike-iD and Amnesty the Let‚Äôs Be Brief crew had set up the decks and the rum, providing the perfect backdrop for a sunny summer‚Äôs evening of music and art.
Taking a walk around the exhibition it was clear that the artists really had interpreted the brief in their own way. Entries ranged from a superbly surreal take on snakes and ladders peppered with all sorts of cryptic symbolism to the rousing message of ‚ÄòWinning is being in London right here right now‚Äô. They had entries from London to as far away as Belgium, with one of the artists even flying in especially for the event. I have to say I was blown away, not just by the high calibre of the entries but also by the wonderfully eclectic crowd that the event managed to attract. Melancholic summer beats pounded out over the sound system from Earnest Endeavors and the event was rounded off with a live P.A. from up and coming songwriters / MCs The Insomniax.
The day also saw the launch of Twenty%extra‚Äôs summer programme working with young people calledLet‚Äôs Be Brief. A creative talent agency in its own right, Let‚Äôs Be Brief spots the brightest up and coming young sparks and helps them harness their creativity through workshops in branding, marketing and advertising.
Knowing Steph and Ansel personally after having been an intern a few years ago myself on the Let‚Äôs Be Brief scheme, it was really great to see just how far the agency had come to be hosting such a fresh, innovative and well received event at a space like Boxpark. I for one hope it is the first of many similar exhibitions, so I can hopefully bring you more out of the box thinking and have some more free rum!
If you didn‚Äôt make it down to the launch event, don‚Äôt worry, you can catch ‚ÄòThe Art of Winning‚Äô until the end of July. It comes highly recommended on Good Design.Abstract
This paper describes a critical media analysis of antiracist messages from both teaching and research perspectives. Antiracist discourse of public media (yard signs and websites) was collected in two communities in the Northeastern United States in 2020 and are discussed here, first as a site of social construction of antiracism, and second as a model for pedagogy. As a critical media analysis, this study reveals antiracist messages on continuums from passive to active, low-risk to high risk, self-oriented to other-oriented, and detached ‚Äúnot racist‚Äù postures to actively antiracist stances. These continuums encourage interrogation of what it means to be antiracist as an individual and as a community. As a model for pedagogy, this study provides a flexible yet structured activity that asks students to observe messages where they live, interrogate the complexities of antiracism within their communities, and reflect on their own participation in antiracist work.

Jose and Cristina Chesa‚Äôs churro shop 180 Xurros is leaving its NE Broadway location, Portland Monthly reports. The cafe specializes in ‚Äúxurros‚Äù ‚Äî the name change specifies its Northern Spanish origins ‚Äî served with the traditional Spanish drinking chocolate for dipping. 180 will find a new home likely near the couple‚Äôs other popular Spanish restaurant, Ataula, in Northwest Portland. Ataula is a stalwart on Eater Portland‚Äôs 38 Essential Restaurants.
180 was originally the sweeter side of sister restaurant Chesa, quite literally: 180 sat next door to the contemporary Spanish restaurant. The Nightwood, a women-run-and-operated venue, took over the Chesa space in 2017; the group will now acquire 180‚Äôs turf, as well. The Chesas have not landed on a new location, but stay tuned for updates.
Meanwhile, farther south, another Portland restaurant is moving. Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar, the popular breakfast spot often attracting around-the-block lines, has decided to move into a larger space within the Embassy Suites, Portland Business Journal first reported. The move should be complete in November, with shorter wait times and the hotel lobby serving as a waiting room for the restaurant. Mother‚Äôs will remain open at its SW Stark location, with a twist: The restaurant will change its name to Mother‚Äôs Velvet Lounge and Cafe, and the restaurant will serve a limited selection of ‚ÄúSouthern comfort-focused‚Äù dishes, a press release reads. The menu will not change at the new Mother‚Äôs location, though chef-owner Lisa Schroeder plans a few menu additions for the future.

Road to Indy TV Rolls Out Season 8 with New Host Parker Thompson
PALMETTO, FL
Road to Indy TV, the broadcast production and social media arm of the Road to Indy Presented by Cooper Tires, will kick off its eighth season of exclusive content with a familiar face in the paddock holding a leading role. A race winner on the first two steps of the Road to Indy, Parker Thompson will bring his outgoing personality to a new position as host.
A multiple race winner in both the Indy Pro 2000 Championship Presented by Cooper Tires and the Cooper Tires USF2000 Championship, Thompson is currently tied with NTT INDYCAR SERIES driver Rinus VeeKay in third for the most podiums across the three ladder series at 36, and is tied in 10th for most wins at 12. He also leads the record books with the most top-five finishes at 67 and ranks second in most top-10s at 79.
While Thompson will be juggling his hosting duties with a season in the new Porsche Carrera Cup North America series, he will rely on his vast public speaking experience to set the stage for another step in his off-track career with a hosting role. Since founding his Drive to Stay Alive program, a texting and driving campaign to educate teenagers about the dangers of distracted driving, Thompson has spoken to well over 100,000 high school students and is an award-winning road safety advocate.
‚ÄúI am ecstatic to be the new host of Road to Indy TV and to remain relevant on the Road to Indy and INDYCAR,‚Äù said Thompson, 23, of Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. ‚ÄúWith the support I have received from Porsche Canada this year, it made sense for my career to focus on sportscars and tackling the IMSA sanctioned Porsche Carrera Cup North America. But I will be using the background that I learned on the Road to Indy for my championship campaign as a Porsche Junior Driver for Carrera Cup North America.
‚ÄúWhen the opportunity arose for me to remain on the Road to Indy as the host of RTI TV, it was a no-brainer! Those who know me, know that I love to talk! If I couldn‚Äôt drive this year, this position was easily the next best option. I can‚Äôt wait to get things kicked off this weekend and get the season underway!‚Äù
Thompson will see plenty of time in front of the camera as Road to Indy TV will produce over three hours of streaming content daily on race weekends which includes a dedicated pre-race show and race and post-race coverage of each series highlighted by special segments.
The shows will be available on demand as well as live on Apple TV, Amazon Fire and Roku. They will also be live streamed on the Road to Indy TV App (which launched in 2015), on RoadToIndy.TV and its social media platforms and on the respective series websites ‚Äì indylights.com, indypro2000.com and usf2000.com ‚Äì and social media outlets. [Note: Indy Lights races will not be live streamed in the United States due to live coverage by Peacock Premium.]
‚ÄúThere is a reason why Parker is a two-time winner of our Spirit Award, which recognizes a driver that embodies the heart of a champion as they aspire to reach their goals,‚Äù said Dan Andersen, Owner and CEO of Andersen Promotions. ‚ÄúParker is a class act on and off the track, and his passion for racing and making it to the top of the sport is always on display. He works hard and I know he will do a great job as the new host of Road to Indy TV.‚Äù
Thompson will kick off his new role this weekend at Barber Motorsports Park during Spring Training for all three series.
Watch Parker and all Road to Indy action with the Road to Indy Mobile App, and on RoadtoIndy.TV.Price:

But that‚Äôs nothing new, just as the ‚Äúend game of the BLM movement is nothing new.
The end game is the same as it‚Äôs always been, unfortunalty; BLM seeks acknowlegement of our humanity from a System and people who‚Äôve spent the last 300+ years denying our humnity. BLM seeks integration with a System and a people who‚Äôve only successfully integrated with us when we were in total subordination to their will and whims (just look at how Integrated we were during Chattel Slavery). BLM seeks reforms from a System that constructs and imposed reforms that put Black people in worse conditions than the conditions we were protesting in the first damn place (from segregation to mass incarceration, #NewJimCrow).
Of course, just as in the Abolitionist Movement and the Civil Rights Movement, the BLM movement has some radical and Pan-African voices and agendas within it, but they seem to be buried by the New Negros in favor of pushing Integrationist reforms instead of Revolution.
I and many others were active long before BLM, and we are watching and working to advance it from protest to Pan-African organization and development.
I don‚Äôt wish to see the BLM lost because it has provided many with a path into the larger struggle, but it‚Äôs up to us to make sure it dosen‚Äôt go the way of the CRM. It‚Äôs not too late to turn things around in the BLM movement, not yet.Description–¢–∞–π–Ω—ã–π –±—Ä–∞–∫12+

Story
Premiere to the 50th anniversary of the theater
Domenico CHIMAROZA
"SECRET MARRIAGE"
Libretto by Giovanni Bertati
By the play of David Garrick and George Coleman the Elder
"Secret marriage" is the only opera performed by Domenico Cimarosa and the only opera in the history of the world theater, fully "encore" immediately after the premiere on February 7, 1792, at the Court Theater of Vienna. She liked Emperor Leopold II so much that he demanded to repeat it completely in his chambers right away, until the actors were defrocked. Composer Domenico Cimarosa, being one of the leading representatives of the opera buff, probably did not know better success in his eventful life (1749 - 1801), for which he wrote about 70 operas, a considerable number of cantatas, mass, oratorios and instrumental works, served At the best imperial houses of Europe and even for two years he held the position of composer at the court of Catherine the Great.
"Secret marriage" is a typical Italian comic opera. Bright scenic sketches are represented by a multitude of ensembles: tertsets, quartets and quintets, and in the unfolded finale, the entire cast of actors involved in this work takes part.

The Marcus Ashley Gallery makes different art forms accessible to the public. As a beautiful form of self-expression, art has a transformative effect on those who appreciate it. Satiate your appetite for art by viewing the fantastic works of artists that embody several influences. For fans of realism art (that holds an undercurrent of fantasy), look no further than Michael Parkes art.
In Black Panther White Wings, the artist demonstrates how a powerful, often temperamental animal becomes tame in the presence of an angel. She sits in a playful position, beckoning the panther to come closer. Save for a pair of black stockings, the angel is stark naked except for golden ribbons intertwined in her fiery red hair that create a lovely contrast against her mighty wings.
The artist uses a striking balance of deep blacks and soft pastels to portray an ethereal composition. Parkes gives us a peek into an alternative universe where angels coexist with domesticated beasts. Black Panther White Wings is perfect for collectors who enjoy the extraordinary finesse of magic realism paintings.

The mortise for this plane is a little harder to make than side escapement planes since it is fully visible on both ends. There are more contact points the wedge must touch. Flattening the bed is also more tricky (at least for me).
After laying out the shape, saw the escapement and drill two holes to start the mortise.
Using floats, I work on a single side of the mortise first. This thinner wedge should mate flush at the top and bottom with no high spots in between. I use dial calipers to ensure that the mortise is vertical by comparing the top to the bottom.
Fit the wedge. Since you know that one side of the mortise is already correct, all of the work here will be done on the opposite side. (Note: I follow this same process with side escapement planes. I work to completion on the blind side first and fit the wedge by exclusively working on the escapement side.)
I make the mortise and fit the wedge at this stage. Fitting the wedge to the front of the mortise now is much cleaner than if you were to start working on the escapement. I won't have to worry about blowout at the bottom.
Working from both sides towards the middle, I use a forstner bit to bore a 1" hole straight through.
Roughly cut out the escapement at the bottom of the mortise and top of the mouth. This allows the wedge, once fit to the mortise and iron, to make contact in the mortise the way that it ultimately will.
Cut the wear angle for the iron and fit the wedge to the iron.
Flatten the the bed.
I often get asked what tools I use for the escapement. I wish I had a great answer.
I carve it.
and sand it.
You can take it from here, right? If not, check out Larry's dvds.
You make it look very easy. Well done.
Jim Marsh
What an excellent addition to the knowledge base on making planes.
Have you always carved the escapement? In some of the earlier reviews of your planes the escapement looked straight through. Or is there a size at which you decide to angle the escapement?
Lastly, I cant wait for your book! Just the info you have published so far on the use of these planes I have found invaluable.
I have always carved the escapement. The amount of offset has changed from 1/16" to an 1/8", but it has always been angled.
Thanks for reading. The book will be this blog x10.
Matt,
Great article (and plane). Keep them coming!
Best to the family,
Lee Laird
Love to watch you carve that escapement. Seems like it's be a perfect place for incannel gouges, but maybe it's just because I want incannel gouges to be the answer to everything since I don't think they get enough love.
Thank you very much for all your posts. I am currently doing the research to make my own set of wooden planes and these blogs have been very helpful, particularly the pictures.
Matt, thanks for putting this together, very informative. Could you do a follow up on how you layout the escapement taper? I'd really like to understand the relationship of sole size to the primary escapement "hole", and the relationship of the taper.Choose a service:

One of the main speakers at a conference I attended this week stated his case, including some lines about ‚Äúthe church shrinking these days.‚Äù Did he mean his local church, lowercase c? Or did he mean the great, grand, beautiful capital C Church, the one encompassing millions of believers the world over, the one that has lasted for generations and generations, withstood dark ages and bright ones, the one Jesus said he would build and nothing would prevail against? I don‚Äôt know, and the comment wasn‚Äôt clarified. But recently I read an article about why millennials are leaving the church, and my heart had the same reaction.
Whose church are we talking about here?
And, maybe more specifically, whose Bible are we reading here?
The great debate is whether we conform our churches (local) to the wind blowing through culture, conforming our language, tone, and practice to what the culture oracles demand; or whether we, against our natural drift toward sinfulness and selfishness, stand firm and build our local churches around the core tenets of the Word of God.
So maybe the question I want to really ask is this: whose Jesus are you following?

In this lesson, we will see how God called a man named Saul and gave Him a new life as His child. In the Bible story, we will see how Saul was changed, not in the way he looked (like in the picture) but in his heart. The story comes from Acts 9:1-31 chronic . . ..
‚Äì ‚ÄòTw: ‚ÄòHere
And sought the sizing pile, whereon
Struck dimly a cadaverous dawn
Through heads
Of:
That not unaided sprang the thought
Whereby the glorious fane was wrought,
But that by frost when dawn was dim
The method was disclosed to him.
‚ÄúYet,‚Äù said the townspeople thereat,
‚Äú‚ÄòTis
Who struck each arc, and made each mould;
And how the abbot would not hold? ‚ÄòTwas of some common kind
And now has faded out of mind.‚Äù

In TRNSYS16, Types are called after they have been initialized and before time has advanced in the simulation. They set the initial values of the outputs during the start time."

Literature is about evoking a world in the mind of the reader. If the author fails to do that‚Äîwhat genre writers call "world-building‚Äù‚Äîthen he has arguably failed the task. How we learn to read, in a post-industrial, highly textual society, is basically how we learn to think, how we learn to be. Psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman's work on how we think shows us that we have a lot of heuristics we apply to everyday situations‚Äîshortcuts, really‚Äîand we are often unreliable narrators, even to ourselves.
Wallace Stegner was no cognitive scientist, but he was a particularly astute observer of human nature. We can consider him a model reader, one who has a telescopic view of the bustling city below and the human lives it contains. Much as one would read a text, one can ‚Äúread‚Äù architecture. Recapitulation is grounded in the real streets, buildings, and institutions of Salt Lake City.
Philippe Hamon, a French literary theorist of the realist movement, asked, ‚ÄúIs there a specifically ‚Äòliterary‚Äô vision of the city, different from the vision of the architect, the painter, the public health officer, the photographer, the politician?‚Äù (‚ÄúVoir La Ville,‚Äù 1994, translation mine). Yes, there is a specifically ‚Äúliterary‚Äù vision of the city, and Stegner has perfectly captured what it is like to live through a city, within a city, and without (both outside and deprived of) it.
Though we can perhaps never directly know ourselves, literature gives us a heuristic for understanding motive, love, loss, and the effects of time. In this metaphor, we may have to invert the typical image of the author as fly-on-the-wall. Here, the reader is observer and the writer is the builder. The reader, through the book, can survey both her life and society at large in the metaphorical foothills, and the author is down in the valley, erecting hotels and tennis courts with his pen.
I like the way you think, Charly- BIG, really BIG! Your perspective is broad and wide as all outdoors. Stegner would be so impressed with you and so grateful for your admiration and loyalty. Thank you for sharing your wonderful thoughts!
I would add that you are "a particularly astute observer of" Wallace Stegner and would have to agree with Dawn that he would be grateful for your admiration. I look forward to reading some of his works. What would you suggest I start with?
@Kimara I'd suggest you start with Crossing to Safety. Even though it is his last published novel, it's possibly his best, and you can jump right into it.
Thanks, Charly, I will let you know what I think about the book. I am reading Anna Karenina now. When I am finished, I will read Crossing to Safety. I am really looking forward to reading something of Stegner, especially after everything you have written about him. Thanks!Here is Brian's Funko Story:
I began my collection about four years ago. I‚Äôve been an avid fan of Comic-Cons for some years and began to see more and more Funkos appear. I was determined not to buy any because I knew that the first Funko would be the start of a major collection.
Then, for Christmas one year, one of my fourth grade students gifted me my first Funko. The student knew that I was a huge Yoda fan, so he gave me the Dagobah Yoda pop. Once that seal was broken, I went Pop wild!
My collection is now over 300 strong. I have about 50 Star Wars themed Pops, but I love to get a little bit of everything. I find Pops at Comic-Cons, antique shops, and from K-Dog and Fish whenever I‚Äôm passing through Cottage Country.
My favourite Pop is V for Vendetta. It was among the first in my collection and I rarely see it anywhere. The pops that I‚Äôm always searching for are the original Ghostbusters 4-pack, the Gatekeeper/Zuul/Keymaster 3-pack, and Jaws eating Quint. I also hope to get my hands on some Muppets, original Simpsons and Friends Pops, and Indiana Jones. Whenever I‚Äôm reading books to my students that have connected Funko.
I stumbled on to K-Dog and Fish when passing through Bracebridge on my way to a cottage that I rent with my wife and her family. I was so excited and could easily spend a whole day in the shop. Last time I was there, I bought the giant Han Solo in the Millennium Falcon Pop, which I had always wanted for my collection.
I have no idea what the end game is for my collection, but for now I enjoy the search for my favourite pops and displaying them in my basement. Have Fun everyone!
Thank you Brian for sharing your story with us! We really enjoyed your visit to the Shop and the giant Millennium Falcon is so cool! Your collection is awesome! Thank you for sending photos and p.s. the V for Vendetta Pop is a wicked Grail, very jealous! We are so glad you found out about our Shop!!.

The call came in. Delta Company was in a Broken Arrow situation and could be completely destroyed, so a relief effort was assembled and they started climbing through rough terrain. Gordon Roberts was the point man when, all of a sudden, an unseen bunker erupted with fire. Finding himself alone, he moved forward toward the bunker, laying down suppressive fire of his own. When it was over, four bunkers were taken out by one man. Part 1 of 2...
Vietnam veteran Al Lipphardt has an instant connection with other veterans of any conflict. He says to truly understand a combat veteran, one must have been through combat because the experience is overwhelming..
Initial contact had been made with the enemy at a site known as Hamburger Hill. Two days after Gordon Roberts arrived in the A Shau Valley, the battle began to grow, and lasted ten days as a vast bunker complex was discovered and taken. The main lesson he took from this fight was to press hard after initial contact so the opposition can't set up and execute their plan.
Frank Aiken found his Montagnard allies to be somewhat lawless and wild, though he says they were good fighters and they were lucky to have them. The enemy was everywhere, trying to get through the wire at night and taking potshots at them on the roads. He joined the locals for meals, though he says you couldn't be sure what you were eating.
Dasher Wheatley was one of many Australian soldiers that fought with Lowe in Vietnam. Each had his own nickname, and each was strange in his own way. Dash sat with his fellow Aussies every day in the cafeteria while Lowe sat with the Air Force Bird Dogs. One day, Dash invited Lowe to sit with him and his ‚Äúmates‚Äù, and what happened as a result left Dash and the other Aussies laughing..
Dasher Wheatley taught Lowe many important lessons and he was always prepared for whatever situation befell the men. One day Dash filled up his canteens with water, added the purification tablets, put them away, and then drank water straight from the stream. Confused, Jim asked what he was doing, to which Dash responded in a way that proved just how valuable a soldier and great a friend Dash was to Lowe..
What Marine Captain Ron Christmas knew, as he assembled a relief convoy, was that action was reported in Hue. What he and others didn‚Äôt know was that the North Vietnamese Army had infiltrated the entire city.
The Ia Drang veterans were visiting North Vietnamese veterans of the same battle. When Bill Beck drew a diagram of his machine gun position in the battle, the North Vietnamese officer at the table turned white.
Ron Christmas tells the story of a Marine who kept getting wounded, and kept returning to battle because he couldn't desert the men that he considered to be his brothers. That, he says, is the true meaning of Semper Fidelis. Friday the Thirteenth when a North Vietnamese soldier fired an RPG at Ron Christmas. Dodging a direct hit, his legs were wounded badly enough to cause his evacuation. Unfortunately, he became lost in the medical system..
Marine Ron Christmas reflects on the basic principles of urban warfare, which he learned on the fly in the battle for Hue. He felt blessed in his later career as he received many rewarding assignments.‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sci-fi guy at heart and I‚Äôm always more interested in the speculative and the fantastical.‚Äù
That‚Äôs Ian Hardingham, coding mastermind behind Frozen Synapse and one founding half of Mode 7 Games. Given the distilled, hyper-focused nature of 2011‚Äôs tactical WEGO turn-based strategy, I‚Äôd asked him if he had any fascination with real-world firearms or special operations groups. Frozen Synapse felt very much the product of someone who had more than a passing interest in dynamic entry techniques, limited incursions and other CQC grit, but my hunch was wrong. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut having said that, I have an absolute love for the first Hidden and Dangerous game, and that‚Äôs actually one of the inspirations for Frozen Synapse that we seldom talk about.‚Äù
Illusion Softworks dropped their take on World War Two squad battles in 1999, the same year as Sierra Entertainment‚Äôs SWAT 3 and Red Storm Entertainment‚Äôs Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear. It was fascinating to discover that, despite two squad-based shooters with such heavy respective clout, it was a buggy and often frustratingly difficult underdog from Talonsoft that comprised some of Frozen Synapse‚Äôs DNA. ‚ÄúYou really had to coordinate four guys properly in that game to succeed,‚Äù Hardingham explained, the connections immediately apparent. ‚ÄúIt was such an amazing feeling when you got it right. I think that taking a complex simulation and being allowed to plan multiple agents within it is a really interesting form.‚Äù
That era seemed to offer a rich cache of these highly-tactical simulations. The previous year, the original Rainbox Six had broken ground with its pre-mission planner, allowing players to arm and initiate complex breach-and-clear manoeuvres with an element of control previously unseen. In an unspoken bond with Frozen Synapse, the planning phase could be agonised over far longer than the actual mission; fastidious timing and deployment of arms as enjoyable to set up as to enact. Rainbow Six and the SWAT series were watershed moments, antithetical to the endless wave of arcade shooters in difficulty and lethality. Hidden and Dangerous, in the eyes of Hardingham, was just as important.
I asked him what he thought about Full Spectrum Warrior, Pandemic‚Äôs breakout squad management sim that touted a similar level of lethality, combining the same tactical crunch as Hidden and Dangerous in a theatre then shockingly contemporary.
‚ÄúI played maybe an hour of it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI seem to remember finding it a little too contrived ‚Äì I like the gamespace in my games to really emerge from some simple fundamental rules.‚Äù
If there was one governing through-line in Frozen Synapse, it was certainly that. Simple fundamental rules. Fidelity by leanness. A few gun types, a two stances and a timer. The rest comprised of player-defined movement plots and firing vectors. Hardingham admitted the end product was pretty close to what he had started with, adding ‚ÄúIn general I hate badly-defined bloat in games. Your decisions should be clear and differentiated.‚Äù
It was the case in 2011, and once more in 2016. If you weren‚Äôt already aware, Frozen Synapse 2 is set for a soft-release later this year. Combining the tried-and-true combat mechanics of the original with an ambitious, faction-ridden open world, the sequel is looking to expand in certain areas. Hardingham related elements cut from the original were appearing in the sequel in some form.
‚ÄúOne thing which I took out of the original, which I‚Äôm looking to add in Frozen Synapse 2‚Äôs ‚ÄòAdvanced Tactics‚Äô mode, is ‚Äòreactive‚Äô orders ‚Äì allowing a unit to do something different depending on what an enemy does. I don‚Äôt think it has a place in the core modes, but I‚Äôm also interested in deepening the planning interface as a tertiary mode.‚Äù
He emphasised that it was still early days with the feature; the notion of appealing to the hardcore who wanted to tinker with unit orders on a granular level, suggesting orders can be initiated based on an enemy or friendly‚Äôs actions. If a friendly takes fire, a team mate might do x. If an enemy moves into a specific zone, your guys will do y. Not autonomy, but high-fidelity if-then logic.
A year after the release of Frozen Synapse, Firaxis deployed their XCOM reboot to critical acclaim. It was a big, bouncy rejig of the original; beveled edges and streamlined of cruft, XCOM was a strategy game for the everyman. But then, so was Frozen Synapse. The big difference, aside from movement and theme pedantry, was the idea of dice rolls governing encounters. I offered a penny for Hardingham‚Äôs thoughts on XCOM‚Äôs system versus outright determinism.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of one of the most fundamental questions of game design. There‚Äôs SUCH a lot going on with this issue. RNG takes away responsibility from the player; it‚Äôs unpredictable; it‚Äôs exciting ‚Äì unpredictable things often add fun to a game. Obviously you have to have at least some deterministic mechanics if you aren‚Äôt just making a slot machine, but the more responsibility a player has the more exhausting it is to play properly. I view RNG as like adding salt in cooking ‚Äì you have to have some, and you need to keep springling it in until you have the perfect mix.
While Frozen Synapse doesn‚Äôt have any RNG, the ‚ÄúDark‚Äù modes actually act as a proxy. Because you don‚Äôt know exactly where your opponents units are, you have to play with possibilities and make calls based on limited information. Which is often more fun.‚Äù
He mentioned he wasn‚Äôt a fan of ‚Äòpercent to hit‚Äô-style mechanics, and while it has its place, I remain inclined to agree. Where we did diverge slightly was on the idea of asymmetry in tactical engagements. I‚Äôve always enjoyed games where the sides aren‚Äôt equally matched of feature vastly different tools, forcing daring utilisation and irregular engagement. Think Jagged Alliance 2, fresh on the Drassen tarmac. Think Commandos 2: Men of Courage, four-odd soldiers against the Axis. But in concentrated kill-house environments?
‚ÄúThis is complicated,‚Äù Hardingham said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have a symetrical start-state for a game. That just feels very limiting to the design. I prefer to balance using concepts such as ‚Äòduplicate‚Äô ‚Äì where your score playing as Side A on Map 75122 is ranked vs all other people who‚Äôve played Side A on Map 75122 ‚Äì or bidding, where you gamble on how well you can do given a start-state, or ‚Äúboth-ways‚Äù, where you play as Side A then your opponent plays as Side A.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt personally though like games which are fundamentally about two very different kinds of sides being in combat. It often ends up feeling very contrived and unnatural. I want both sides to be using the same basic mechanics.‚Äù
He went on to illustrate the point with Frozen Cortex, Mode 7 Games‚Äô interesting tactical effort that drew from American football as much as it did Frozen Synapse. Hardingham noted being on offense versus being on defense is obviously pretty different, but the core mechanics beneath are the same, making everything feel much more organic.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so important to me that the game rules are laid on top of a simulation of some kind. I don‚Äôt want to design or play games which are just built up from a set of rules which are all created specifically for that game mode.‚Äù
One thing that dominated discussion on a few episodes of Visiting the Village ‚Äî essential development and culture podcast series by Mode 7 Games‚Äô Hardingham and studio co-founder, Paul Kilduff-Taylor ‚Äî was the rise of procedural generation for level creation and furnishing. It‚Äôs an enticing prospect particularly for smaller developers; procedural generation doing the heavy lifting in level design and freeing up resources elsewhere. But it‚Äôs more than merely a development fast-track in Hardingham‚Äôs eyes. Procedural generation is key to player proficiency.
‚ÄúWhen you use significant procedural generation, you remove the part of the game which is learning the levels,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúYou make the process of playing the game more about becoming generally good at that game, and less about being good specifically at that set of levels.‚Äù
Contentious as that perspective may be in other genres, tactical games do fare better. Peripheral awareness replaces physicality. Being able to assess new junctions or prospective points of contact. Ascertain effective range of engagement. In short, take in the surroundings, manoeuvre with aplomb and chew out your targets. Over the years, I‚Äôve gravitated away from economy-based strategy games ‚Äî hereditary Westwood and Blizzard fare ‚Äî because the economic puzzle has never really been a particularly interesting one. Another contentious perspective for a different time.
An interesting and largely forgotten experiment with procedural level generation was in Konami‚Äôs portable cyberpunk shooter Coded Arms. Nothing tactical by any stretch of the imagination, but its virtual training simulator conceit more than effectively sold the procedurally-generated levels. It was primitive and unrepentantly cubic and often led to strange design irregularities, but Coded Arms‚Äô cohesion of theme and mechanics wasn‚Äôt revisited until years later.
I asked Hardingham about how theme had the power to effect level design. Much like the original game, Frozen Synapse 2 is taking computer-controlled level creation into the big city. No longer constrained to comparatively claustrophobic kill-rooms, would a larger game world threaten interesting and unique locations.
‚ÄúThe vast majority of most levels are completely generated, and the ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù buildings fit in quite organically,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúThe way to nail that is usually in making the look of the game suitable. If the actual models used to represent game-important stuff ‚Äî for instance a wall in FS ‚Äî are defined largely by that thing, then procedural generation tends to work much better.‚Äù
The proof is not being able to tell whether early screenshots of Frozen Synapse 2 have been hand-crafted, or products of procedural generation. In any case, Mode 7 Games‚Äô brand of cyberpunk chess features almost no ancillary cruft. Its hacker-blueprint composite is the perfect fit for procedural generation, and the implications in the sequel ‚Äî an expansive luminescent webwork of atriums, offices and carparks ‚Äî appear to be a seamless, lean use of the technology.
Frozen Synapse 2 is set for a soft-launch some time before the year‚Äôs end, with the beta period predicating the date of full release. Rainbow Six meets Syndicate in a living, breathing world of Alpha Centauri-inspired factions; each as dynamic as the other. It‚Äôll be an interesting test of the games‚Äô larger systems; to witness the trickle-down interplay between the strategic and the tactical. And, of course, to see new twists on a tight combat formula.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exhausting to make,‚Äù Hardingham admitted, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôll be an awesome game.‚Äù

Ferrari unveils V12-powered One-Off BR20
New two-seater is based on the GTC4Lusso, but inspired by 1950s Ferrari
By John Howell / Thursday, November 11, 2021 / Loading comments
For most of us, the thought of owning even a used Ferrari is incomprehensible due to the size of the brave pill we‚Äôd have to swallow. So the thought of going to Ferrari and asking them to build you a bespoke car is up there with a trip to space onboard the good ship Bezos. Except it isn‚Äôt, because that‚Äôs in the hundreds of thousands and a bespoke Ferrari will set you back‚Ä¶well, only those involved can give you that figure. But it‚Äôs in the millions, and how many depends on how much you change of the original car, how many times you change your mind along the way and what materials you select.
The latest in the Prancing Horse‚Äôs One-Off series is the BR20. We don‚Äôt know what that name means, but it doesn‚Äôt relate to the number of one-offs produced so far. Some are never announced, so tallying them up is impossible, but the owner of this one has chosen to reveal their creation. And the date chosen to do so is the 11th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, central European time. A very specific time that alludes to a very specific meaning.
The BR20 is based on a Ferrari GTC4 Lusso, with a unique styling philosophy that ‚Äúcleverly references the magnificent Ferrari coupe?s of the 1950s and 60s, without the slightest hint of nostalgia.‚Äù Now, far be it for me to question such things, but isn‚Äôt that the very definition of nostalgia? Anyway, I can‚Äôt see anyone arguing that it is anything but stunning. It‚Äôs the work of a design team led by Flavio Manzoni, and, in the BR20‚Äôs flowing lines, flying buttresses and extended rear overhang, which is three-inches longer than the GTC4‚Äôs, we‚Äôre told there are many references to V12 models of the past. Those include the 1959 410SA and 1964 500 Superfast, as well as something as modern as the 2007 599 GTB Fiorano.
Inside, the GTC4‚Äôs seat count has been reduced from four to two, and those that are left are trimmed in brown Heritage Testa di Moro brown leather with silver-cross stitching. That also extends to parts of the door cards and the centre armrest and everything else that‚Äôs leather is a lighter shade of brown including the dashboard top roll and steering wheel. There‚Äôs also an oak rear luggage deck with carbon-fibre inserts where the rear seats would‚Äôve been.
The process of building a One-Off series can be a year or more, which is why demand massively outstrips Ferrari‚Äôs planned capacity of one to two cars per annum. It‚Äôs why you have to be invited to become a member of this exclusive club; you cannot simply buy your way in unless you have long-standing connections to the brand. Even then, no matter how wealthy you are, there are certain things you cannot do. Ferrari will not change any of the homologation points, such as the crumple zones and even the position of the airbags and their activation sensors. Nor can you alter the mechanicals if that will require additional WLTP certification. If you have the money, there are some homologated parts you can have resubmitted, such as the wheels and headlights. The BR20‚Äôs headlights are slimer and set lower than the GTC4‚Äôs, but their light output remains the same.
The design process begins with a quarter-scale clay model. If that‚Äôs approved, then a half-scale model is built, followed, eventually, by a full-sized representation. At each stage, the client of invited to view the design and, if necessary, take a literal hands-on approach ‚Äì with the aid of a scalpel or a handful of clay. There is one other rule, though. You must respect Ferrari‚Äôs history and tradition. I‚Äôd say that the BR20 does just that.

My goodness are they patient. They keep the children busy all day long with a new activity nearly every 30 minutes including swimming, arts and crafts, gymnastics, dancing, games and more. Carlos is absolutely wiped out by the time I pick him up at 3.
Everyone keeps asking me what I‚Äôm doing with my new found ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù I‚Äôve been plenty busy for sure. On Monday I ran 6 miles before running a bunch of mundane errands and picking up the house. On Tuesday I ran 8 miles, did more errands and then I went to the mall. I got my eyebrows waxed, bought some new eyeshadow at Bare Escentuals, and even treated myself to a few new things from Loft. Yesterday I received an email from Loft announcing a one day sale on scoop neck tees, 2 for $15. I couldn‚Äôt pass it up. I also picked up two pairs of crop pants. They are OK, better than jeans for this warm weather we‚Äôve been having.
I hate pants! There I said it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt want to walk around naked from the waist down. I have always had a problem finding pants that fit properly and flatter my figure. They don‚Äôt exactly make pants for woman with pear shapes. Yup that‚Äôs right I‚Äôm all hips and butt! Try getting skinny jeans on my lower half‚Ä¶ain‚Äôt gonna happen. I have no sense of fashion. I just try to keep it simple and neutral colors. I used to beg friends and family to nominate me for the TLC show ‚ÄúWhat Not to Wear.‚Äù
Enough of that. I had to have a filling removed and replaced this morning. I specifically made the appointment for today since I knew that Carlos would be at camp and I wouldn‚Äôt need a sitter. My dentist is great. I was in and out in 23 minutes. Now I am relaxing on the sofa, alone, just me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve sat here since I was pregnant‚Ä¶just joking. Sort of.
Sure it‚Äôs been nice to have some time to get things done around the house and errands I‚Äôve been neglecting. Everyone needs a little ‚Äúme‚Äù time once in a while. This opportunity is wonderful for him to spend pure, quality playing time with old friends and new ones too. I miss the little guy though. Soon enough he will be in school full time for the next 13 years if you count kindergarten. This camp is only for one week in June and one week in August. We‚Äôve got lots of local activities planned in between. It is shaping up to be a fun summer.
In my last post I talked about feeling a sense of freedom when I put away my scale and how I was recently reintroduced to the scale. I am working on my weight loss goals again. I still don‚Äôt have a clear cut plan, just trying to use the ‚Äútools‚Äù that have helped me to lose in the past and making small changes. I have decided to weigh in every two weeks for now so that I can gauge my success. I refuse to allow it to become a daily habit or a burden to my goals.
Fourth of July weekend is upon us. You know what that means ‚Äì picnics, barbecues, fireworks, swimming and desserts! I‚Äôm currently on the hunt for a healthy, tasty Independence Day inspired dessert because we also celebrate my aunt‚Äôs birthday on that day.
Here are some fun facts about the Fourth of July:
- Massachusetts was the first state to declare the Fourth of July an official state holiday (Yeah Mass!)
- The vote for actual independence took place on July 2, 1776 but it was on July 4 that Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence
- Founding Fathers John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826, ironically the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.
Many moons ago before I became a nurse I graduated from college the first time with a degree in History. I have always loved learning about early American History. I often wonder what our Founding Fathers would think if they saw what this country has become today. I won‚Äôt wax political very often, if at all here on the blog, but I think we can all admit that this country has been at war for a long time. Operation Iraqi Freedom began on March 20, 2003. It is all too frequent that I hear of local men and women who have lost their lives serving this country in the Middle East. I fear for the family members of friends who are currently serving in the military and are stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. I pray for them to remain healthy and return safely. My sincerest thanks to the American troops everywhere.

He has been a student for the past four years who has lived and studied in two different universities from two cities in Hungary. Throughout these times, he has made numerous friends and is happy to say coming to Hungary was one of the best decisions he has made since it has not only extended his horizon but also has opened new opportunities for his future. He is going to share his experiences regarding the application process, the preparation before arriving to Hungary, and his stay in Szombathely and Budapest.
You have been living in Hungary for four years now, studied one year of Hungarian in Szombathely first and later transferred to ELTE (Budapest) majoring in English. What was your main goal coming to study in Hungary?
I wanted to study abroad and see the world different from my own.
Where did you look for information about Hungary before coming here?
Mostly from Baidu and Tieba (popular Chinese search and knowledge sharing sites). There are also many agencies advertising themselves on the internet but large amount of the information (including university ranking statistics) they provide are fake. Also, there is not much information to be found about the university fees or they are usually outdated.
What added values do you see or have already gained by receiving education in Hungary and getting a diploma thru the Hungarian education system?
Quite a lot. The school is very international friendly, the teachers are prepared and the system is well constructed. What I mean by that is you can only pass the exam if you actually know the material, there is no escape from learning it properly. This prepares students to be able to solve problems in real life, instead of focusing on just being able to beat tests.
What is the biggest challenge while studying in Hungary? What about every day challenges? How did you solve these challenges?
Being able to communicate is very important. It was difficult to communicate in everyday life when I lived in Szombathely, in Budapest however is very different, the majority of people can speak English. I would recommend everyone to attend Hungarian courses for a semester. It would make your stay much easier in the long run. Secondly, at the Hungarian university we learnt a lot of literatures related topics, for instance, that we did not cover in Chinese high school. In order to catch up with that and being able to learn the new material as well, I spent studying more than 3 hours a day after class. Thirdly, I had some problem with my landlords which was the result of lack of communication between us and also to my roommates who regularly delayed paying the rent. I had to move twice, but in the end, I am really satisfied with my current landlord.
How did you find the housing?
I found it through Facebook.
Were you homesick throughout your stay in Budapest?
No, it wasn‚Äôt difficult for me. With the help of smart phones and the internet, it was easy to keep in touch with my parents and friends. Besides, I visited China twice a year for two months, so it felt more like extended travelling for me all the time.
What were your expectations before coming to Hungary?
My goal was to to become a fluent Hungarian speaker, to finish my degree, to gain some work experiences. Luckily everything mentioned above came true for me. I am now able to have an everyday conversation with native Hungarians. I am finishing my degree next year and got some work experiences from having a part time job at a local restaurant.
What are some of the things you are glad that you had done prior to coming to Hungary?
Language courses. There were courses that I took which taught me how to adopt to the western education system, how to write an essay, and how to prepare for a presentation. I found these very useful and it was a huge help when I had to write essays in English.
Are there specific things that you had help from external source?
Yes, I applied to my first university through an agency which is necessary for the first round. They assisted me on what documents I needed to prepare, how to prepare my insurance, the deposit and how to apply for visa. These information were hard to figure out on you own when you don‚Äôt have experiences.
What are the things you wish you had help from an external source but you did not?
Before leaving China, I didn‚Äôt think I needed any services from an external source but after I had arrived in Hungary there were things I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. For instance, having someone coming to the immigration office with me sorting the resident permit out would have been a tremendous help. Without any help, getting everything done took me half a year. It was the result of being unclear about what documents I needed exactly. Also, looking for a rental place alone was not easy. Having a local, who is more experienced in relation to what aspects I had to be careful about when choosing a house, to visit houses together with me would have made a big difference. Furthermore, it was a shame I didn‚Äôt have any acquaintances showing me around the neighborhood, introducing the location of shopping centers, libraries, and other places that students usually would visit.
How did you choose which school you wanted to come to?
My first school was not my choice. The agency informed me they do not have the opportunity to take me anywhere else apart from Savaria Egyetemi K√∂zpont. They promised me once I was in Hungary, they have the ability to change my school, however when I called them from Hungary, it proved to be not the case so I had to do the research and the application part on my own. It was fairly time consuming as ELTE took its time, sometimes it took two weeks from them to reply to my emails. I would find an agency who is able to help with speeding up the process useful.
What would have been another school you‚Äôd wanted to go to?
University of Szeged, because they also offered the course I wanted to take. Corvinus University of Budapest was also appealing but they did not offer English studies as a major.
Where else would you have gone to if you didn‚Äôt come to Hungary?
England was my first choice which I haven‚Äôt given up yet. I would like to apply to do my master‚Äôs degree there.
Are there any advantages coming to study Hungary over other Western countries? If yes, what are there?
The main advantage is that the tuition is much cheaper in comparison to England, Canada, US or Australia and the quality of education is still good. Also, in most cases in order to get accepted to a western university, students must take the IELTS or the TOEFL exams which are not easy. In Hungary though you can apply for an English language course for one year and after passing the English exam level B2, you can easily get accepted to the major you choose to take. This way BA diploma changes from a 3-year to a 4-year program.
Why do you think students are interested in coming to Hungary for their high education?
In Hungary the college entrance exam is easier because you can apply to the university which provides language courses. Therefore, the English level of a student does not necessarily have to be perfect from the very beginning.
Do you think students would want to stay in Hungary after finishing their studies? Why? Why not?
Some students want to have more international experience, so they decide to stay longer in Hungary or go to another foreign countries. In case of staying, students having related degree will be able to find jobs at Bank of China branch, etc. There are also students of course who decide to go back and build a career there.Description

By PAT KIMBROUGH ENTERPRISE STAFF WRITER Aug 22, 2021
HIGH POINT ‚Äî High Point Market guests will have a new way to get around the downtown showroom district at this fall‚Äôs trade show. The City Council last week adopted an ordinance allowing electric scooters in the market district starting seven days before the Oct. 16 ocial opening of the event. The devices will be restricted to a dened area where most of the showrooms are located, and would have to cease operations at the close of fall Market on Oct. 20. ‚ÄúThis is something we‚Äôve had requests for from market guests,‚Äù said Tammy Nagem, chief operating ocer of the High Point Market Authority, which asked the city to permit the use of scooters. ‚ÄúAs you all know, our greatest strength and our greatest weakness for this Market is, we‚Äôre 13 blocks wide. So, while we do provide a pretty extensive transportation system, on beautiful days, there‚Äôs nothing better than moving about the streets, and this would give an additional guest service for our marketgoers.‚Äù Electric scooters are not allowed in other parts of the city or in the downtown district outside of Market dates. Some cities, including Greensboro, have adopted ordinances that allow them in their downtowns. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of a pilot program,‚Äù said City Attorney JoAnne Carlyle. ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt work out, then we‚Äôll come back and consider either amending it or rescinding it.‚Äù Nagem said the market authority is working with a vendor who will provide 50 of the scooters for fall Market. 1/2

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be paid for by the market guests,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll scan their credit card on a QR code, and when they get close to the boundaries, they‚Äôll begin to beep and get slower. So they‚Äôll be notied that they‚Äôre coming to the edge of that.‚Äù Nagem said her agency is working with the city and the vendor to establish procedures regarding whether scooters can be used on streets or sidewalks. ‚ÄúThere are concerns with both, but also making sure our guests are educated about where to ride. We‚Äôre looking at 12 mph maximum (speed),‚Äù she said. The vendor will be responsible for collecting and charging the scooters each night during Market. ‚ÄúThis is just an extension of our guest service for folks coming to High Point, and we‚Äôll see how it goes,‚Äù Nagem said.

3:30 PM ‚Äì 4:45 PMI‚Äôm in the business of helping leaders become extraordinary; better than the average or common version of leadership many of us have to tolerate in our organisations and communities. Along that journey from good to great my clients often find that they have been making seemingly small but profoundly important mistakes, that once corrected can make a remarkable difference to their leadership.
Here are ten more common mistakes.
1. Not letting go
Being in control is a part of leadership although you can easily overdo it. Over controlling, micromanaging, perfectionism and autocratic leadership are symptoms that you‚Äôre too hooked on control, which can lead to your team not being able to perform at their full potential. You become the bottleneck to them getting more done when you have to direct, decide and determine everything they do. If the job of leadership is to get things done with and through others, a lack of empowerment is a significant barrier to better leadership.
2. Being too nice
Some leaders on the other hand are addicted to harmony and getting along with others. Whilst fitting in and going along are part of what‚Äôs required in teamwork and organisational life, leaders also need to be able to pushback, argue, debate, speak candidly and take a stand, even if it creates some heat and discomfort with others. People who have an overriding desire to be liked and accepted produce anaemic and weak leadership. It‚Äôs paradoxical really. Whilst we expect people to fit in and comply, and it‚Äôs a hurdle requirement to get your first leadership job, we are more likely to admire, respect and wish for leaders who are prepared to challenge the status quo.
3. Protecting yourself
We struggle with inauthentic leadership because we know we are not seeing the real person, the genuine article with all its flaws and shortcomings. A carefully constructed impervious leadership facade that says ‚ÄúI have it all sorted; I have all the answers‚Äù is not believable because we know it‚Äôs not possible. We all have fears, doubts, insecurities and weaknesses and any attempt to hide them inevitably distances the leader from others, causing them to appear aloof or arrogant. When a leader protects themselves in the way they are saying that they don‚Äôt trust us. Who wants to follow a leader that doesn‚Äôt trust them?
4. Failure to motivate individually
Leadership is about releasing the energy and commitment of others towards the outcomes or goals that you‚Äôve set. That means connecting their efforts to what motivates them, not what motivates you. If you don‚Äôt know a team member hopes, dreams and aspirations, or their fears, anxieties or concerns, you‚Äôre powerless to truly mobilise them and move them from where they are, towards where they need to be.<Saturday March 13th, 2010 ‚Äì Saukville, WI
It looks like Schlitz really is starting to happen! I didn‚Äôt know exactly what to expect on several levels concerning the initial run through of my one man show about growing up in Milwaukee called ‚ÄúSchlitz Happened! An Old Milwaukee Blatz From The Pabst‚Äù, but the overwhelmingly positive response it got gives me extremely high hopes. This is a winner!
It‚Äôs not a finished product yet by a long shot, but what‚Äôs there is very useable. I do know how to entertain an audience, and my lifetime of experience gives me a huge advantage of being able to go back into the archives and bring out polished standup bits which allows a freedom to experiment few others have. I can take chances because I have a backup plan.
The show was at the Railroad Station in Saukville, WI which wouldn‚Äôt have been in the top 50 places I would have chosen to get this started. Richard Halasz had booked a couple of previous shows there with Will Durst, so that‚Äôs a thumbs up for me. I like Richard and a reputable comedian like Durst wouldn‚Äôt work a place twice if there was anything shady.
I knew I needed to work the show through a few times, so where better than here to get a feel for it? The owners were all very nice people and we drew 146 people which is very respectable for a place that doesn‚Äôt do comedy on a regular basis. The club had posters up for a couple of months, but it was Richard that really dug in and didn‚Äôt let up on promo.
He mailed flyers and sent email blasts and got me a radio interview in Fond Du Lac and I really give him credit for doing a thorough job in promoting this along with the venue. It isn‚Äôt often a comedian does this good a job of behind the scenes detail work but he nailed it and totally followed through. Everyone was happy with the results and it was a big hit.
I brought my friend Russ Martin along, who was kind enough to film the show with his movie quality video camera, even though I don‚Äôt need anything that elaborate right now. I just wanted to get it on tape in case I ad libbed something that could be used in the future.
Gary Pansch also came out to support and he lit it up for a few minutes to get the crowd in a good mood. I went up and did an hour and five minutes, trying to squeeze in as many local stories and references as I could. I did some of my regular standup but it still had the local flavor to it. I added in a few things exclusively for this show and they went over too.
Was I thrilled with the show? No, not at all. Was the audience? Absolutely. They loved it, and that was my main concern. I wanted to feel it out a little first since I never worked there before, and didn‚Äôt have too much scripted. I wasn‚Äôt sure what kind of audience they drew, so trying to force a theater show wasn‚Äôt smart. This was more of a bar audience.
The sound system was popping and the stage lights were pretty bad, but other than that it wasn‚Äôt horrible at all. The physical layout of the space was nice, even though smoking is still allowed in Wisconsin bars. That was a killer, and my eyes were burning within the first ten minutes. This was a comedy show in a night club, NOT a one man theater show.
Still, the audience was both receptive and very polite. They weren‚Äôt pissy drunk and had the courtesy to sit and listen to the show. There were waitresses, but they were also polite and didn‚Äôt talk loud while taking orders or distract form the show at all. I was impressed.
I know how to read an audience, and could tell that I had a chance to do well right from the get go. I wanted to get to a lot more subtle and experimental material, but tonight was not the time to try it out. There will be other times, and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt force anything.
A few people showed up I hadn‚Äôt seen in thirty years or more. Robert Deglau and I went to the Jackie Robinson alternative open classroom school in sixth grade. We were both in the same homeroom and had an interest in radio. We reconnected by email a couple years ago but hadn‚Äôt gotten together before tonight. It was great to see him after all these years.
Jeff Phelps and I went to high school together at Messmer High School. He worked for the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel as a photographer for twenty-two years before losing his job last year in a purge that took a lot of other people with him. He is a real pro and takes amazing pictures, and I felt bad he lost his gig. Times are tough for people in many fields.
Jeff and I recalled the story of when Hank Aaron came to Messmer to speak. We loved sports and wanted to get an autograph so we skipped out of class and drove to a sporting goods store and each bought a baseball to get signed. We waited for Hank‚Äôs limo to pull up and as soon as we saw it we sprinted out the side door with our fresh white baseballs.
Nobody in the entourage expected us including Hank Aaron, and we politely asked him to sign our baseballs. There wasn‚Äôt much he could do but grab the pen and sign. We both had pens with us, and we had our whole plan of attack worked out way before we did it.
After Hank signed for us, someone in his entourage firmly said ‚ÄúOk, that‚Äôs IT. No more autographs.‚Äù Jeff and I smiled at each other and went back into school with our prize. We were the envy of the whole school, and we got to meet Hank Aaron before anyone else at school, including the principal. It was the only time I ever skipped out, but it was worth it.
One of the biggest mistakes I ever made in my life was selling that ball many years later when I really needed money. Boy, was I stupid. I think I may have gotten $60. Maybe $75 tops. I remember crying when I sold that ball, but at the time I really needed that cash. It‚Äôs a huge mistake, but too late to change it. Jeff kept his ball, and I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôd love to see it.
This is the end of my fourth solid year of keeping my little diary. It may not be good or even interesting, but at least I‚Äôve been able to keep it consistent. I‚Äôve had experiences all over the board, and hopefully I‚Äôve been able to entertain or inspire at least somebody.
I‚Äôm still a dented can, and always will be. I‚Äôm improving in many areas, but I still have many more that need a lot of work. Will any of this live on after I‚Äôm dead? Who cares? It doesn‚Äôt affect me at all. I‚Äôll be dead. Right now, I‚Äôm not and I hope whoever reads this at any time gets a laugh or two, or maybe some inspiration. Another year over. What‚Äôs next?

Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is a neurologic health problem that causes sensitivity to touch. This is a chronic illness that causes fatigue, sleep problems and is commonly found in individuals with an existing rheumatic disease.
Gout
Gout is a painful, and sometimes disabling form of arthritis. Symptoms often include painful swelling in single joints, especially the feet and in particular, the big toe. Gout is a treatable disease that can be combated by avoiding triggering food or medications, and taking the recommended medications.
Lupus
Lupus is a chronic disease that causes systemic inflammation affecting multiple organs, the skin, joints and can have mild to serious flare-ups.

A common type of degenerative disease that occurs in the joints is known as osteoarthritis. Almost every joint in the body can develop osteoarthritis, but the most common areas are the knees, hips, neck, hands or lower back.
Osteoporosis
Ordinarily, the body will continuously absorb and replace bone tissue, but an individual with osteoporosis either loses too much bone, makes too little, or a combination of both. When the bones become weaker, bones are more likely to break, most commonly in the hip, spine or wrist.

A 15-year-old horse has died of complications from West Nile virus in Riverside County, City News Service reports, marking the first equine victim of the mosquito-borne disease in California this year. The announcement was made today by the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
West Nile virus was first detected in the United States in 1999 in New York City, according to Steve Lyle of the CDFA. The virus can cause a range of illnesses from mild "flu-like" symptoms to encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be fatal to humans as well as horses.
The CDFA urged horse owners to keep their animal vaccinations current. While horses are susceptible to the virus, many infected animals will not develop any illnesses and eventually recover, Lyle said.
Signs of the virus in horses include stumbling, staggering, loss of coordination, muscle twitching, circling and the inability to stand, he said. Birds are the primary carriers of the disease. Mosquitoes that feed on infected birds can spread the virus to humans and horses, Lyle said. No evidence suggests the virus can be spread horse to horse or horse to human, he said.
In 2007, 28 cases of equine West Nile virus were documented. That compares with 58 cases the previous years. In 2004, 540 equine cases were reported, with more than 40% of those horses dying or being euthanized, Lyle said.Subversion

Late 18C Anti-Slavery Texts
View PDF
Introduction
In a well-known scene in the 1845 Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, a 12- or 13-year-old Douglass (then Frederick Bailey) purchased a copy of a popular school text, The Columbian Orator, compiled by the educator Caleb Bingham. ‚ÄúAmong much of other interesting matter,‚Äù writes Douglass, on the slave on the part of the master. (Chapter 7)
Douglass says he read the dialogue ‚Äúover and over again with unabated interest,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThe moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder.‚Äù
The Columbian Orator had been published first in 1797, its dialogue contributed by David Everett, a friend and associate of Bingham‚Äôs in Boston. Everett (1770-1813) was a young lawyer active in publishing in New Hampshire and in his home state of Massachusetts, and fairly consistently a radical opponent of slavery. He wrote his contributions to the Columbian Orator, in other words, in the print environment from which we have drawn the following abolitionist texts, most of which appeared in Boston‚Äôs Massachusetts Magazine in the early 1790s.[1]
Some of these materials seem to have been written locally, though many were reprinted from British, French, and other regional contexts. In many instances, the details and tropes which we associate with the later slave narrative tradition are absent or just being developed. ‚ÄúThe Desperate Negro,‚Äù for instance, explains the use of ‚Äúthe cart whip‚Äù on human beings, with the resulting wounds, as if they needed explication and clarification. Institutional politics are rarely addressed, the immorality of hypocrisy being the more common object of satire, as in ‚ÄúA Modern Anecdote.‚Äù Still more common is the depiction of slavery through the trappings of sentimental romance, featuring princes and princesses, as with ‚ÄúThe Wretched Taillah‚Äù or the French ‚ÄúPhedima and Abensar.‚Äù The African focus also speaks to a greater focus on the slave trade than on daily conditions of enslavement. Occasionally, the conditions of slavery were somewhat veiled by utilitarian or scientific concerns, as with the extremely popular ‚ÄúCure for Poison‚Äù credited to ‚Äúthe Negro Cesar.‚Äù The rudimentary and exoticizing nature of these small narratives speaks to the state of the political and moral discourse around slavery, as well as the strength of colonization projects, seeking to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù the enslaved to Africa. Nonetheless, recent scholarship, as we discuss below, explores how texts like these might illuminate the Atlantic world.
‚ÄúThe Wretched Taillah: An African Story,‚Äù appears to have originated in the Massachusetts Magazine (April, 1792), and reappeared in New York‚Äôs Weekly Museum (July, 1792) and in the New Hampshire Magazine (June, 1793).
‚ÄúThe Desperate Negroe‚Äù appeared in the October, 1793 issue of the Massachusetts Magazine, but originated in James Ramsay‚Äôs 1784 book-length Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies (see Chapter 4, ‚ÄúNatural Capacity of African Slaves Vindicated,‚Äù Section V, ‚ÄúAfrican Capacity vindicated from Experience‚Äù). The Ramsay excerpt appeared in London‚Äôs Westminster Magazine that same year (July, 1784) and in the influential Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine: and Historical Chronicle a month later (August, 1784); it was reprinted in the New London Magazine in November, 1786 (where Ramsay is credited with the anecdote) and in Philadelphia‚Äôs American Museum, or Universal Magazine in December, 1789.
‚ÄúThe Negro Cesar‚Äôs Cure for Poison‚Äù first appeared in The South-Carolina Gazette in May, 1750, and was frequently reprinted for decades after, in almanacs, newspapers and magazines. In some instances, portions of the various cures were credited to white authorities. To give just a sampling, the cure was reprinted in the Boston News-Letter in January, 1751, the New-York Evening Post in February, 1751, American Museum in May, 1789; the Virginia Gazette and Weekly Advertiser in July, 1789; in the Massachusetts Magazine in February, 1792 (the version we reproduce here), in Walpole‚Äôs New Hampshire Journal: or, The Farmer‚Äôs Weekly Museum in May, 1793; in Poughkeepsie‚Äôs The Rural Casket in July, 1798; in Boston‚Äôs Columbian Centinel in April, 1815.
‚ÄúA Modern Anecdote,‚Äù sometimes published as ‚ÄúBlack and White,‚Äù may have first appeared in the Massachusetts Centinel in 1788 (Oct 25 issue); it appeared in New York and New England papers through the winter of ‚Äò88-89, but reappeared in waves in 1790, 1793, 1794, 1800, and beyond.
‚ÄúPhedima and Abensar: an African Tale‚Äù appeared in the September 1796 issue of the Massachusetts Magazine. The story originated in the novel Lettres Africaines by the Swiss author Jean-Fran√ßois Butini, published in 1771. The story was quickly reviewed and excerpted in Paris‚Äôs influential periodical, Mercure de France, in November of the same year. By 1772, an English-language version appeared in London (The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure, October) and Dublin (The Hibernian Magazine, or, Compendium of Entertaining Knowledge, November), with a later appearance in the British periodical Weekly Miscellany: or, Instructive Entertainer (Sherborne, January of 1776). The Village Messenger of Amherst, MA, republished the text in July, 1797.

Christy L. Pottroff deftly argues that, ‚Äúcirculation‚Äù has long served as a key ‚Äúcritical category‚Äù for early American studies because ‚Äúthe term‚Äôs capaciousness‚Äù allows scholars interested in the print public sphere ‚Äúmany different entry points for thinking about information exchange‚Äù (621). After tracing the critical genealogies of key methods for examining circulation in early America, Pottroff considers the racialized dimensions of early American print circulation by inspecting materials from the archive of the United States Postal Service. In so doing, Pottroff uncovers not simply ‚Äúhow the circulation of information in early America worked, but also‚Äù explores how scholars might ‚Äúbe better attuned to the ways in which circulatory systems shaped and constrained information itself‚Äù (624). Pottroff‚Äôs essay explores the ramifications of an 1802 policy which ‚Äúdictated,‚Äù that no one other than ‚Äúa free white person shall be employed in carrying the mail,‚Äù a policy which Pottroff notes was adopted in response to the Haitian Revolution. For Pottroff, the policy demonstrates how the very idea of ‚Äúa networked African American community bound together by mobile black postal workers‚Äù was an ‚Äúinherently dangerous‚Äù idea to white politicians and civil servants (624). At the heart of Pottroff‚Äôs essay resides the keen observation that ‚Äúracial inequality and exclusion structured access to circulation‚Äù within the early American Republic (625); see, Pottroff, ‚ÄúCirculation,‚Äù Early American Studies 16.4 (2018), 621-627.
These federal prohibitions against carrying mail are but one nodal point within larger systemic attempts to prohibit African American participation in the print public sphere. State and local ordinances around the early Republic prevented African Americans from literacy acquisition, and white supremacist fears likely kept many literate African American writers from having access to mainstream publication networks for much of the early national period as well. Still, as Lara Langer Cohen and Jordan Alexander Stein have argued, ‚Äù (2); see Cohen and Stein, ‚ÄúIntroduction: Early African American Print Culture,‚Äù Early African American Print Culture, edited by Lara Langer Cohen and Jordan Alexander Stein (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012), 1‚Äì16. Complicating the matter even more is the fact that, as Leon Jackson has observed, ‚Äúscholars of slave culture and print culture have rarely shared agendas, nor have, more broadly, African American social, cultural, and literary historians and those within the community of book historians;‚Äù see Jackson, ‚ÄúThe Talking Book and the Talking Book Historian: African American Cultures of Print‚ÄîThe State of the Discipline,‚Äù Book History, 13 (2010), 252. All of which is to say that while the field of early American studies has mapped a portion of early African American literary production, much work remains to be done until we have a fuller sense of this rich and complicated literary history.
We have no direct evidence to indicate that any of the pieces in this collection were ‚Äúwritten‚Äù by diasporic Africans, but given that all of these pieces were published anonymously and circulated widely, we have no evidence to prove definitely that there was no African American involvement in their production or dissemination. What is clear is that these pieces do indicate African American participation in the circulation of knowledge within the early Republic. In some ways, they also gesture towards possible African American participation in early abolitionist networks as well. One way to approach the question of authorship in regards to these texts would be to follow the compelling insights of Nicole Aljoe‚Äôs concept of ‚Äúembedded narratives.‚Äù While Aljoe is writing about West Indian slave narratives, her injunction to change our reading practices so that we can register how many long eighteenth century white authored texts incorporate evidence of diasporic African voices and experiences has much wider ramifications as a reading methodology. Indeed, Aljoe argues that many texts which register the presence of diasporic African knowledge and cultural practices ‚Äúwere not separately published and were often embedded in other texts such as travel narratives, diaries, and journals or appear in records kept by legal, medical, and religious institutions‚Äù (13). Reading with Aljoe‚Äôs reframing in mind allows us to understand (for example) that while Cesar may not have prepared his cure for poison for publication, he is indeed the author of that knowledge and of that cure; see, Aljoe, Creole Testimonies: Slave Narratives from the British West Indies, 1709-1838 (Palgrave, 2011), 13.
Of all the texts gathered in this edition, ‚ÄúThe Negro Cesar‚Äôs Cure for Poison‚Äù may well have the longest and most promiscuous circulation. As Keri Holt argues, texts like Cesar‚Äôs cure exemplify how publications like ‚Äúthe South Carolina and Georgia almanacs‚Äù regularly contained ‚Äúdomestic advice [that] was acquired from slaves‚Äù which was subsequently reprinted in other venues; see Holt, Reading These United States: Federal Literacy in the Early republic, 1176-1830 (The University of Georgia Press, 2019), 65. The historian Kathleen Murphy has explored how eighteenth century white physicians often positioned themselves as authenticators of ‚Äúthe collective know-how of peoples of Amerindian and African descendent.‚Äù In so doing, she argues that cures like Cesar‚Äôs were not considered ‚Äútrue knowledge‚Äù but the product of ‚Äúrude Experience‚Äù until reframed by western science as proven medical knowledge. Murphy demonstrates how operant racist prejudices against ‚Äúremedies used‚Äù by people of color were maintained even when they were known to be effective; see Murphy, ‚ÄúTranslating the vernacular: Indigenous and African knowledge in the eighteenth-century British Atlantic,‚Äù Atlantic Studies, 8.1 (2011), 39. Lisa Wood charts how Cesar‚Äôs cure was reprinted in several British domestic manuals and home medical guides. For Wood, these reprintings are evidence of a cultural interest in linking ‚Äúthe material practices of cooking and curing (in the medical sense)‚Äù and part of an effort to promote nutritional health; see Wood, ‚Äú‚ÄòWholesome Nutriment‚Äù for the Rising Generation: Food, Nationalism, and Didactic Fiction at the End of the Eighteenth Century,‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Fiction, 21.4 (2009), 620. The geographer Judith A. Carney details the ways in which white planters both simultaneously relied on diasporic Africans knowledge of botanical cures even as they consistently feared ‚Äúbeing poisoned‚Äù by people they enslaved. Carney argues that ‚Äúenslaved medical practitioners‚Äù like Cesar often ‚Äúrelied upon pharmacopoeias of roots and herbs‚Äù to ‚Äútreat medical problems‚Äù in ways that continued to elude white physicians; see Carney, ‚ÄúAfrican Traditional Plant Knowledge in the Circum-Caribbean Region,‚Äù Journal of Ethnobiology 23:2 (2003), 170.
There are scattered other references to the other texts in this edition across the work of a variety of literary critics and historians of abolition and enslavement. Among these, we would recommend John Saillant‚Äôs work on ‚ÄúThe Desperate Negro,‚Äù which argues, ‚Äúthe meaning of Quashi‚Äôs narrative is that benevolence can characterize black-white relations, while slavery is essentially a violation of benevolence.‚Äù For Saillant, ‚ÄúQuashi‚Äôs beauty is joined to benevolence, while the violation of his beauty by the whipping his master plans is joined to slavery and its abnegation of benevolence. Quashi‚Äôs body, in his skin and even his thighs, is central to the narrative, while his master, a typical white character, hardly appears as a body;‚Äù see Saillant, ‚ÄúThe Black Body Erotic and the Republican Body Politic, 1790-1820,‚Äù Journal of the History of Sexuality, 5.3 (1995), 416. Mukhtar Ali Isani generatively examines how ‚Äúantislavery writing‚Äù often constructed ‚Äúliterary persona‚Äù of diasporic Africans by using ‚Äúa sentimental depiction of their African past;‚Äù see, Isani, ‚ÄúFar from ‚ÄúGambia‚Äôs Golden Shore‚Äù: The Black in the Late Eighteenth-Century American Imaginative Literature,‚Äù The William and Mary Quarterly, 36.3 (1979), 353. Similarly, Jack B. Moore in writing about the ‚ÄúThe Wretched Taillah‚Äù argues that ‚Äúshe was sentimentalized almost beyond recognition,‚Äù even as ‚Äúher story is in several ways a paradigm of the technique and content of early American stories about‚Äù diasporic Africans; see Moore, ‚ÄúImages of the Negro in Early American Short Fiction,‚Äù The Mississippi Quarterly, 22.1 (1968-69), 47. For readers interested in the relationship between capitalism and enslavement surfaced in ‚ÄúA Modern Anecdote‚Äù we recommend chapter six of Cedric J. Robinson‚Äôs path-breaking Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition (University of North Carolina Press, 1983) and Ian Baucom‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpecters of the Atlantic,‚Äù The South Atlantic Quarterly, 100.1 (2001), 61-82. Edward Derbyshire Seeber argues that Butini‚Äôs Lettres Africaines, ou Histoire de Ph√©dima et d‚ÄôAbensar was a major French anti-slavery text alongside Gabriel Mailhol‚Äôs Philosophe N√®gre (1764) and Jean-Fran√ßois de Saint-Lambert‚Äôs Zim√©o (1769): see Anti-Slavery Opinion in France during the Second Half of the Eighteenth Century (Johns Hopkins, 1937). Roger Mercier, in ‚ÄúLes Debuts de l‚ÄôExotisme Africain en France,‚Äù notes that Aphra Behn‚Äôs short and popular novel Oroonoko (1688) was translated into French in 1745, inspiring a wave of anti-slavery fictions.

Prior art Search
A leading commercialization company operating in the US wanted to optimize their costs on searching prior art and other closely related material related for their client‚Äôs inventions. Intrust Global started working with this company and helped them in establishing a robust and highly optimized backend operation for delivering high quality search reports. After building confidence with client, today Instrust provides help in preparing disclosure forms, search report formats, and invention analysis. Instrust was able to define a highly optimised delivery model specific to client needs with a quick turnaround time and high quality work products.
Visualisation of Inventions
The client is a licensing firm that helps small and medium sized inventors in commercializing products and take them to market along with patent filing. For showing the working of the invention and its utility, the firm requires a low cost yet animated video of their client‚Äôs invention so as to market it to potential licensees. When the client approached Intrust Global, we had little idea on how to capture and engage client virtually without face to face interaction for developing a video of a product to be patented. The challenge was that the video was for commercialization of the invention and therefore should have marketable components. We started work on this front and within a span of few projects, we were able to define processes that fully overcame the challenges of personal interaction. Today, Intrust Global delivers these services to the complete satisfaction of the client.
Patent Portfolio Analysis
A high end technology company wanted us to analyse a large patent portfolio for aligning their business strategy. They wanted to license out the patents that did not align with their restructured business. The portfolio, however, had a high value technology patents that were critical to the company and a good technology understanding was key to the patent portfolio analysis. At the same time, they did not want to undertake major expenditure on this activity on account of financial constraints. They approached Intrust Global for help on their portfolio. The precondition was that they would interview the team performing portfolio analysis for their technology understanding. The technologies were extremely complex and were intermingled with standards, that is, some of the patents were standard essential patents (SEPs). After a few discussions, we were awarded the work of patent portfolio analysis. We prepared the patent portfolio analysis reports along with in-depth technology analysis of each of the patents. The first set of deliverable was shared. The client was so happy and confident with our deliverable that we received four portfolios for evaluation from them.
In trust has a technology team that is well qualified to work on high end technology portfolios. We ensure that high quality work and complete client satisfaction.
Office Action Responses
A large law firm in the US wanted to quickly respond to a number of office actions that had piled up on their desk. When they receive an office action, they would usually forward it to their respective clients. Normally, the clients after analysing the office actions would decide whether to move ahead on it or not. The process normally takes a long time. Inadvertently, all the clients requested the law firm to move ahead with the prosecution of their respective filings. Unfortunately, the law firm was fully occupied with another case and had very few hours left for them to devote on office actions. At the same time, they were reluctant to outsource it fearing about the quality of office action response. When we spoke to the law firm, they narrated their problem to us. We offered our help and the law firm after approval from their client gave us the first office action as a test case. We analysed and prepared a response to the office action and sent it to the law firm. They simple forwarded it to the client. The work was much appreciated by the client and the law firm. We continue receiving office action from them whenever they are confronted with a work overflow situation. Our ability to quickly turnaround an office action with highest quality has ever since been largely appreciated by our customers.Since Mike has been nice enough to come to our meetings ‚Äî and visit us at the fair ‚Äî I thought you might like to see his interview on the Cameron TV station.

Back on topic, we have spent a 2nd day in Italy today. The first time on the trip we have spent consecutive nights sleeping within the same national borders!Venice for Verona at around 1pm having spent the morning walking through the narrow streets and soaking in as much of the history and magic of the city as possible.
It is impossible to describe how completely bewildered yet enchanted Venice has left me. If it were possible to form a romantic attachment to a city, Venice and I would be starting some some of affair right now.
Anyway, enough of the hyperbole and cliche. We decided to shun the motorways and highways of Italy for some country roads on our hop from Venice to Verona. We experienced some great rural scenery and some colourful Italian driving! I could (and maybe will) dedicate a whole post to the crazy and apparent random nature of Italian driving. I haven‚Äôt had the pleasure of driving in Italy yet, but part of me is looking forward to the experience and the other half is saying it would rather climb a mountain in 2nd gear behind a coach!Chris for wine, and I think we handled our tasks well, even if our waiter interpreted a glass of sweet white wine as a glass of rich red.

April 17, 2019
Contact: Cassidy Walter
515-252-6249
JOHNSTON, IOWA ‚Äì Today Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw emphasized that approval of small-refinery exemptions (SREs) for the 2018 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blend levels would irreversibly undermine the RFS. Speaking alongside Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, Shaw made his remarks at a press conference at Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, an ethanol plant near Council Bluffs.
To be granted an SRE, a refinery must demonstrate ‚Äúdisproportionate economic harm‚Äù in complying with the RFS. Shaw pointed out that in recent weeks refineries could have complied with their obligation by purchasing compliance credits, known as RINs, for as little as eight cents.
‚ÄúGiven the current circumstances, granting any of the 2018 small-refinery exemptions would fundamentally undermine the RFS and break President Trump‚Äôs promise to protect the 15-billion-gallon RFS,‚Äù Shaw said. ‚ÄúAt a time when you can avoid blending a $1.30 gallon of ethanol by instead buying a RIN for eight cents ‚Äì a price even Texas Senator Ted Cruz found acceptable ‚Äì how can there be disproportionate economic harm?‚Äù
SREs granted under the Trump Administration have already accounted for over 2.5 billion gallons of RFS demand destruction.
‚ÄúThe bottom line is this: If you grant SREs under these circumstances with eight-cent RINs, then what the EPA is really saying is that they will always grant SREs and the hope of a true 15-billion-gallon RFS is dead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is not what Congress intended or President Trump promised.‚Äù
After noting that farm income, corn prices, and US ethanol use all dropped in 2018, Shaw concluded by noting there is still time to turn around the Trump Administration‚Äôs record for rural America.
‚ÄúThere are a handful of steps they could take that would provide an immediate boost for farmers,‚Äù Shaw said. ‚ÄúFirst up are the small-refinery exemption decisions. We‚Äôll be looking closely at those decisions to see if President Trump is beginning to take positive steps for rural Iowans.‚Äù:.

WWWE Files: The Beeping Cabbie Sets the Wicked Witch Off Again
Here's today's police report.
April 12, 2011: 2:50 PM and 7:58 PM.
Two Easton police officers, Patrolmen Daniel Bonham and Andrew Ocetnik, visit the Wicked Witch's home twice in one day. That beeping cabbie is bothering her again, and at the ungodly hours of 2:50 PM and 7:58 PM. This time, she's filing charges, damn it!
When she complained before, both the cab driver and one of her neighbors heard her make racist remarks. Officer McConagle claims that, even when she spoke to him, Mezzacappa's vocabulary "was tinged with hints of racial bias."
On her blog, Wicked Witch Mezzacappa denies she's a racist. She uses the old "my best friend is black" argument, and then calls her neighborhood a ghetto.
Mezzacappa: That Beeping Cabbie Does It Again
6 comments:
What a charming woman! How'd you let that one get away?
Hey Tasha, it isn't just you. Tricia's neighborhood issues go way back and are no secret. Ten years ago, a woman who lived on Ridge Street filed a private criminal complaint against her for harassment. While the harassment case was pending, the woman and Tricia got into it. The woman assaulted Tricia and was arrested. That incident was reported in the Morning Call on 10/24/01. A year earlier, Tricia got into it with a former boyfriend. She was charged by Wilson police with disorderly conduct for fighting and pleaded guilty on 12/21/00. Here's Tricia's explanation, which she published recently on another blog: "An ex-boyfriend started a fire on my living room floor and threw me out of my own house, landing me face down on Ridge Street. He was arrested and I was charged as well for domestic fighting." I'll bet the guy's side of the story would be interesting too.
I wonder if he kicked her pig.
Besides being a bit unhinged ...it also seems like she is spoiled, demanding, egocentric, non-cooperative, having exaggerated self-opinions and having no tolerance for anyone having a different opinion than herself.
It appears the EPD have been professional and polite despite her abundant amount of apocryphal calls.
And she's still a worthy option to Bob Freeman. Incredible.

Kenzaburo Fukuhara, Pool/AFP/File MANILA ‚Äî Malaca√±ang said on Thursday the public should leave President Rodrigo Duterte "to his own devices" in dealing with China as authorities tried to resolve the massing of some 240 Chinese ships in Philippine territorial waters. Diplomatic initiatives are exempted from freedom of information and need not be announced to the public because "the President must make the right decision, no matter what," said Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque. "Kung ano man ang ginagawa ng Presidente, hayaan na nating gawin niya iyon sa isang pribadong pamamaraan,‚Äù Roque said, when asked how the President would use his friendship with Beijing to counter Chinese incursion in the West Philippine Sea. "Let's leave the President to his devices. Napakita naman niya na in the past 5 years of his administration, we have moved from a position of antagonism with China to a position of friendship," he said in a press briefing. (Whatever the President does, let us allow him to do so in a private manner... He has shown that in the past 5 years of his administration, we have moved from a position of antagonism with China to a position of friendship.) Duterte forged friendlier relations with China when he assumed power in 2016, temporarily shelving the maritime disputes in the South China Sea in favor of economic aid and investments from Beijing. The Philippines remains "committed to the codification of a Code of Conduct," said Roque, which the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China are negotiating to manage tensions in the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday 2 new formal protests had been lodged against Beijing, days after Manila summoned Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian to press for the withdrawal of its vessels at Julian Felipe Reef, which is within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. The Philippines last month described the presence of over 200 boats believed to be manned by militias as "swarming and threatening", while the United States, Japan and other countries have voiced concern over China‚Äôs intentions, prompting rebukes by Beijing. In a Twitter post, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin said, "they really are fishing everything in the water that belongs by law to us." A Philippine government task force said the vessels, which are about 60 meters in length, can catch a ton of fish a day. It said 240 were in various areas in Philippine waters as of Sunday, including 9 at Julian Felipe. Asked during his briefing when the vessels are likely to leave, Roque said, "Hindi ko po masasabi ‚Äòyan." "Pero inaasahan po natin na yong malapit na pagkakaibigan natin, magiging dahilan kung bakit sila aalis nang mas maaga," he added, referring to China and the Philippines. (I cannot say. But we expect that our close friendship will be the reason why they will leave earlier.) China's embassy in Manila and the foreign ministry in Beijing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chinese diplomats previously said the Julian Felipe Reef is part of its traditional fishing grounds, and that vessels were taking shelter from rough seas and did not have militia aboard. Manila rejected the claim. Since coming to power, Duterte has criticized US foreign policy and sought to improve ties with Beijing, but China's maritime assertiveness has put him in a difficult spot at times. Tough on US, soft on China? Palace says Duterte being good neighbor to Beijing The Philippine navy planned to deploy 3 more ships in its waters. "We have to understand that to say that one area is ours, we have to be there," army spokesman Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo said. Retired Philippine Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, an advocate of Manila's sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea, warned that the swarming of Chinese boats at the Julian Felipe Reef may be a prelude to occupation and building of naval base there as Beijing did on the Mischief Reef in 1995. ‚Äì With a report from Reuters Video courtesy of PTV Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Viber Read More:Internasjonal trefest i Bergen

The outbreak of COVID-19 has changed the educational landscape worldwide. In an unprecedented move, schools had to be closed indefinitely. This challenged stakeholders to embrace a new pedagogy with greater dependence on distance learning through home schooling and more interactive online teaching.
Almost overnight, a variety of online and communication tools were adapted to accommodate and migrate millions of classrooms online, challenging educators, students, parents, consumers, and producers to collectively embrace a new pedagogical normal on a global scale. The socio-economic impact of COVID-19 still raises many questions and concerns about the future and more particularly, education.
Over the past few weeks, we have been engaged with our event partner, BERNEXPO AG, exhibitors, and stakeholders, mitigating the risk of holding a large-scale event this November. Considering various issues such as global CDC and government advisories, travel restrictions, visitor safety guidelines, and other related factors, it was jointly concluded to postpone Worlddidac & Swissdidac to 22 ‚Äì 24 November 2021.
The new date allows us to organise and hold a safe and successful event for our exhibitors, visitors, partners, and stakeholders alike.
19th Worlddidac Award & Future Talk dates remain the same: 3 ‚Äì 6 November 2020
We are happy to announce that the 19th Worlddidac Award and the Future Talk conference will still be held in November 2020. These events, planned on a smaller scale from the very beginning, allow for implementation in compliance with all recommended safety rules.
The Worlddidac Award gala evening on Tuesday, 3 November 2020, marks the beginning of the three-day conference series, taking place from 4 ‚Äì 6 November 2020. At Future Talk 2020, leaders, global decision-makers and enthusiasts with a dedicated interest and passion to create Impact by Education and Make a Difference will join efforts and generate visible contributions to support the recent UN-launch of the Decade of Action towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Agenda 2030.
The conference is under the Patronage of the Swiss Government (SBFI) and lead partners are UN agencies: UNESCO-UIL, UNESCO-UNEVOC, UNIDO.

Why we make ClicBot?
We believe every one child is a inventor, they are always curious and thinking very creatively, in one word, Children‚Äôs imagination is unstoppable. For example, thinking to add wings to a car, and that‚Äôs about the planes first thought, then been created.
But however not every child get the chance to realize their imagination, they are lack of opportunities and platform. To be specific, like a tool, an environment, supportive parents and their time, good lessons, and so on.
So slowly and slowly, The child became afraid of creation, and don‚Äôt want to face their imagination anymore. It could end up like: Well, maybe I‚Äôm not a creative person.
The reason? They are creative, but they are short in recognition of their creation, because they don‚Äôt have things to present. Without the stimulation, there won‚Äôt be anymore creativity. We are burying the seed of creativity, and children‚Äôs dreams.
That‚Äôs why we make ClicBot, we want to give them a tool, a platform to make their imagination come true, then they can show their works to parents, friends and everyone online to gain recognition and feeling of achievement.
Slowly, they become confident: Yes! I‚Äôm very creative. And goes into a positive circulation. This can change a child‚Äôs life. When they encounter something in the future, they realize that: "it‚Äôs not someone that tell me what to do and how to, I will need to think about it and solve the problem with creativity". Order fulfillment Lead facilitates the day-to-day order assignments and tasks of the Order fulfillment team.

We thought Google waved goodbye to the Pixel 3 Series just a few days ago as it rolled out the November security patch to the Pixel 4 and newer devices. As it turns out, the Pixel 3 Series aren‚Äôt dead just yet; they‚Äôll receive one final update sometime in the first three months of next year, in 2022.
The Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL were released back in October 2018, and they had the 3 years of guaranteed Android updates and security patches. Luckily, the Pixel 3 Series are promised by Google to receive one final update that will include a plethora of bug fixes, much like what the company did with the original Pixel and Pixel 2 Series.
Sadly, the next devices to no longer receive any security patches are going to be the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL devices in May 2022, and the Pixel 4 Series sometime in September ‚Äì although if history is anything to go by, the Pixel 4 Series will also likely receive another final update either in December or in early 2023.
Here is the list of devices and their ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù update schedule by Google.
The Pixel 3a Series have a revised update policy, and it‚Äôs currently unclear when support for them will be cut off completely as they were released at a different time. It‚Äôs currently unclear if the devices will even receive Android 12L, which will improve even more bug fixes, new features, and better support for foldable devices (via GSMArena).
In case you‚Äôre interested in the Google Pixel 6 or the Pixel 6 Pro, we have just posted our review on YouTube. You can visit our dedicated pages to find out more about the specifications, color options, storage, camera features, and more, or watch the review video to see how they performed during our testing.

X-CalSupport for the energy rehabilitation of 1,180 homes in Barcelona
Motivation
CEVASA, Compa√±√≠a Espa√±ola de Viviendas en Alquiler SA, a Spanish rented housing company, operates two large private housing developments with more than 1,180 rental homes built in 1975 in Barcelona‚Äôs Avinguda Meridiana.
As part of efforts to reduce energy consumption and improve user comfort, CEVASA commissioned ERF to study the possibilities for improving its construction operation, in particular the thermal envelope and installed systems. The results from this study persuaded CEVASA to draft a construction project to implement improvements to the building envelope, and the company also commissioned ERF to assist in the task of obtaining public subsidies for the rehabilitation of buildings.
ERF carried out the following tasks:
- Initial assessment of the energy rehabilitation
- Energy characterisation and certification of existing buildings (tool: CE3X). Processing of energy label formalities.
- Cost-benefit analysis of proposed improvements to buildings and energy classification of improved buildings (tool: CE3X).
- Detailed assessment of the energy rehabilitation.
- Adaptation of proposals.
- Simulation of buildings using the HULC unified tool to ensure compliance with technical building codes (HE0 and HE1).
Results
The existing buildings had heating demand of 64 kWh/m2 per year and were energy class F. Thanks to the improvements finally implemented, heating demand will be reduced to 44 kWh/m2 per year and the buildings‚Äô energy classification will rise to Class E, with overall savings of 31%.
The improvements finally implemented on the thermal envelope were:
‚Ä¢ Exterior insulation of fa√ßades: application of 8 cm external insulation (SATE solution).
‚Ä¢ Exterior insulation of roofs: waterproofing and application of 6 cm insulation.
‚Ä¢ Improvement of glass and carpentry: installation of double glazing (4/16/4) and new carpentry to reduce consumption and noiseNew Release Blog Blitz Begins!

 defense system was strong, and that Iran could legally pursue such aggression in international courts.
He was quoted by ISNA news agency as saying that Tehran welcomed ‚Äúdefusion of tensions‚Äù in the region.
‚ÄúWe do not want rise of tensions and its consequences.‚Äù
Last year, Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 accord between Iran and world powers that curbed Tehran‚Äôs nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions. Relations in the region have worsened significantly since then.
Trump said on Sunday he was not seeking war with Iran and would be prepared to seek a deal to bolster its flagging economy, an apparent move to defuse tensions.
Trump has suggested that he backed off a military strike against Iran because he was not sure the country‚Äôs top leadership had intended to shoot down the drone. However, an Iranian commander said Tehran was prepared to do it again.
‚ÄúEveryone saw the downing of the unmanned drone,‚Äù navy commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi was quoted on Sunday as saying by the Tasnim news agency. ‚ÄúI can assure you that this firm response can be repeated, and the enemy knows it.‚Äù

"Thanks is not enough for John's and Bonnie's efforts on our behalf. John orchestrated a complex arrangement including three schedules and a distance Ma & Paws does not normally travel. Our three-month old Westie pup (Fergus) was treated calmly and lovingly during the five plus hours of travel. These people and their service are tops and I recommend them to anyone looking for premier transport service!" - Janet Wagester
"I am always happy to trust my faithful canines, Sophie and Colonel, to the care of Ma & Paws. The owners have not only expertise in canine care and training but also compassion and genuine liking for animals. When I return from a trip and reclaim Sophie and Colonel, Ma & Paws always provide a detailed report on their time with my furry friends. Under the care of Ma & Paws, the dogs don't have to endure long days in a cage as in a kennel, but are treated as guests in a comfortable home. mA & pAWS also has very competitive rates compared with kennels. Sometimes, I think Ma & Paws takes better care of my dogs than I do!"

Not wanting to leave our puppy at the local Animal Hospital while on vacation, we called on the at home care service provided by Ma's and Paws. They took a huge worry off of our shoulders and provided a loving, twice daily service of our Dachshund, Frida. Every day of our vacation we received updates and even pictures of our dog from Kim. We recommend this company to friends and family for their pet care while away. Thanks Ma's and Paws!

For anyone looking for a pet sitter you've found the right website! Ma & Paws is top notch! We can't praise them enough! Friends of ours recommended them to us right after we got our puppy and we've been using Ma & Paws now for more than 4 years. They are an extension of our family whom we've entrusted our most important four legged family member with on in home visits and boarding. They are dependable, loving, trustworthy pet sitters who go above and beyond in all they do! Not to mention they are very accommodating for we've had numerous last minute things come up and John and his crew have always managed to help our family. So look no further choose Ma & Paws pet sitting!

I have been with Ma & Paws since April 2016. Being in the Northwood to Elmore area is a different area, and more of a challenge to find people, but when one dog caretaker had to stop taking care of my dog, John was able to find Clair quickly so I didn't have to worry about my dog having to spend long days alone, and she has been a Godsend for us. She treats my dog like he's one of her own, and brings him treats at times. With my work, it is still possible to be a dog owner and know that my dog has some relief both physically and just enough energy expenditure to avoid any destructive behavior when he is home alone. I have the best Jack Russell any dog owner could expect to have. He's my buddy and hope to have him with me many more years. Ma & Paws makes that possible. I also get a picture every once in awhile of my dog that is a welcome sight, knowing he's a happy boy with them. I have met my dog walkers each one of them. It's very nice to have the ability to text Clair and be able to tell her anything new she needs to know it. She always responds promptly. The fee is reasonable and appropriate for the service. Ma and Paws is a wonderful service and I hope to stay with them for a long time.

Ma and Paws was recommended to us 3 years ago by our neighbor. We have been using their outstanding services for both visits in our home and boarding for up to 2 weeks at a time. They are professional and dependable and I know they care for our dog as if he were their own. We never worry when we are away and are frequently updated with pictures and fun comments from our dog! We feel blessed to have found them and would highly recommend their services.

Super people that treat your pet like you treat your pet. I recommend them highly.

First-rate pet sitters. These folks treat your pet like their own. They love their job and it shows. I thoroughly recommend Ma & Paws.
Linda Szilagye said on Oct 1, 2017 11:58 PM
We are at ease when we are out of town because Ma & Paws does such a great job with our cat, Minnie. Lynn is usually the person who cares for her. She adores Minnie. Lynn is trustworthy and kind.
Meredith C said on Oct 1, 2017 11:55 PM
Ma & Paws has been taking care of my two dogs for about five years now. They have been a God send! They usually come 5 days a week to walk and feed my dogs, but also have taken care of them during weekends and holidays. Ma & Paws is extremely reliable, and treats my dogs like their own.
Kate Kelley said on Oct 1, 2017 11:52 PM
Excellent Service! We love using Ma & Paws. They are always accommodating when we have to change our schedule and Kim always checks in to let me know how my dog is when she sees her. She goes above and beyond, leaving little treats for us and pictures! Great local Business. Very trustworthy. Would highly recommend!
Jo Anne Gray said on Oct 1, 2017 11:48 PM
In the last week Ma & Paws has been a God-send for us! Their services have been excellent, everything we ask them to do is done, and our dog is so happy to see Kim. She sends us pictures each time she comes, and we just love it! We appreciate the professionally-run and trust-worthy business that John & Bonnie have built, and the peace of mind we have while we are away. A huge feature for us is that our dog can stay in her home when we go, and still be taken care of the same way we would. They are outstanding, and we can't say enough to recommend them highly to everyone!

On short notice I called Ma & Paws Pet Sitting. John altered his schedule to meet me and our pups. We have a 5 1/2 month Labradoodle who cannot be left alone. He introduced us to Jean who is perfect. We were able to go out and I was comfortable knowing my girls were well taken care of.

We are new to the Toledo area and needed a pet sitter for our young dog at short notice. Ma and Paws came to our rescue. They are professional, reasonably priced and available. We use them consistently and our sweet lab loves her friend Jean...it's a treat when she visits. And we feel secure knowing our pup is in good hands.
Sandy and Chuck Traugott said on Sep 30, 2017 1:36 AM
After utilizing Ma and Paws home services for two years, we will never board our dog again! They are very conscientious and treat your pet with the same love and kindness our dog receives at home. They follow all instructions we leave and even provide daily updates and photos while we are away. Our lab is in love with Kim, and we always come home to a happy dog.
Kevin Kirkwood said on Sep 27, 2017 5:07 AM
Love the service! Owner and dog sitter came to meet us and truly love dogs! It's so nice when we leave town to have them to trust that our lab is well cared for! Communication is key for their business and they are always checking in! Highly recommend them!
Carol said on Sep 25, 2017 0:14 AM
We have two small dogs who like to stick close to home. Kennels give them horrible stress to the point of making them physically sick. Kim has eliminated that problem for the dogs. She sends us a brief report on them after her visits along with a photo of the dogs. We have not been to the vet for a sick visit since Ma and Paws have started caring for the dogs in our absence.
Ronald and Gina Thompson said on Sep 24, 2017 5:50 AM
Ma and Paws has been a lifesaver for us!! Love the services. It's wonderful knowing our pet is in good hands when we travel. Thanks for all you do!

Valorie said on Sep 24, 2017 1:03 AM
I just love having Kim come to my house to take care of Samson while I am at work. It really gives me piece of mind knowing he gets some play time and a restroom break mid day. Samson loves Kim, she is his second mom. I am so glad I contacted them. I highly recommend this service.

Ma&Paws is great! So are John and Bonnie.19% of skiers and snowboarders continue in the sport long-term. Millennial and Gen Z participants ski and ride less than prior generations.
Resorts have responded by developing a variety of "hardware" methods to combat these issues: state-of-the-art learning centers; ticket, lesson and equipment deals; increased attention to beginner equipment and employee incentives.
While these tangible efforts are encouraging, conversion has emerged as the predominant roadblock in the industry's ultimate goal of growing the sport. There are also issues of perception, inclusion, expense and time poverty.
Growing participation is a top priority for ski areas. Outlined below is a timeline of initiatives that have taken place in the last 20 years. That being said, there is still plenty of work to be done and there is no ‚Äúsilver bullet.‚Äù The solution requires consistent work by every segment of the ski industry, pulling together to reach a common goal. Each and every product, promotion and new skier that is converted is a step in the right direction. Simultaneously, NSAA continues to review the data and is working to develop new findings and tools to assist members with this challenge.
2000: The Model for Growth was introduced as a method for critically analyzing the future of the ski/snowboard industry.
2002: A panel of key ski school managers and probe learning programs and experiences to understand specifically what techniques and procedures worked best from a teaching and conversion standpoint. A panel of recent consumers was separately convened. The ideas and recommendations generated by the professionals and consumer groups were synthesized into a detailed Conversion Cookbook.
2003: Beginner Research Findings
2004: Findings from the NSAA test sites
2006: The Way We Grow
2008: Future Demographics Series Supplement
2009: Learn to Ski and Snowboard Month introduced as the ‚Äútrial component‚Äù of the Model‚Äôs Trial and Conversion formula.
2011: Conversion Cup Challenge introduced. The Challenge is a competition among member ski areas that awards the ski area with the best conversion program. Conversion being the process of turning beginner skiers and riders into repeat customers, and ultimately lifelong enthusiasts of the sport.
2013: NSAA endorses PHIT America. PHIT America is dedicated to increasing physical activity and fitness to improve the health of America.
2015: The Beginner Conversion Study is launched. It is a multi-year research project providing the industry with critical information about the behavior of first-time skiers and snowboarders. The research is based on surveys of new skiers and riders over a period of time. The study was paused in 2019.
2017: The Path to Growth was published. NSAA analyzed decades of research data and identified eight key challenges facing the future of the ski industry, including demographics and participation. The booklet provides ski area operators a tool to better understand the concerns and areas of opportunity for action.
2018: Conversion continues to be a challenge. Collectively we have inched forward and convert 19% of beginners compared to 15% in 2000. There are many resorts and ski areas who have done substantial work on this front. An updated Conversion Cookbook is now available to ski area members with discussion and strategies for areas to consider as they develop their conversion efforts. The Cookbook will be updated in 2020.
NSAA's Growth Committee convened in October 2018 to work on a long-term, sustainable model for growth. The ski area experts on this committee are tasked with helping the industry reach a goal of a three-year average of 60MM skier visits by 2025/26. Tactics include brainstorming new ways for inclusion, identifying ways to reach skier segments other than beginners, and how to change skier behavior to increase capacity and conversion.79 Results in category Data

If you spend any time on the bookish internet, then you‚Äôve heard the term ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù applied to books. Books are deemed problematic for all sorts of reasons: transphobic language, blatant racism, cultural appropriation, harmful and/or offensive tropes or stereotypes, ableism. I am 100% in favor of pointing these things when they appear in books. Authors from non-marginalized communities (especially white authors) writing about characters from those communities have gone uncriticized for far too long. It is a win for readers everywhere that more and more people are speaking up about racism, transphobia, sexism, and other -isms as they show up in literature. We‚Äôre never going to fix it if we don‚Äôt talk about it. But, respectfully, may I please request that we all retire the word ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù from our vocabularies?
I don‚Äôt want anyone to stop talking about the ways in which authors fall short. I‚Äôm just tired of the word itself. Problematic doesn‚Äôt actually mean much anymore. I‚Äôd argue that the term has mostly become a tool of virtue-signaling, rather than a useful way to engage with literature and relay critical information about a book.
Most reviewers (especially own voices reviewers and people from marginalized communities) follow a claim that a book is problematic with a list of reasons. A review that starts with the word ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù will morph into a thoughtful and detailed explanation of how a book by a white author appropriates Native culture in harmful and offensive ways. But we all know what internet culture is like: fast-moving and not overly concerned with details. After seeing the word ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù signaling that a book has done something wrong, how many people read the much more important substance of the review?
I don‚Äôt know the answer, and I don‚Äôt have any data to offer. But I do know how easy it is to skim over things on social media without actually engaging with them. If I see the word ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù and immediately categorize that book as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go near it,‚Äù what have I learned? I don‚Äôt know if the book is deeply, irrevocably terrible, or if the author has made some misguided choices they might learn from and address in future works. If it‚Äôs a popular book that I know a lot of people will be reading, I haven‚Äôt gained any new knowledge that will help me explain to others why I‚Äôm not recommending it. Knowing a book has been dubbed ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù doesn‚Äôt provide any useful tools for me as a reader, reviewer, or citizen of the bookish world.
I want to know if a book is transphobic. I want to know if a book badly misrepresents queer people, and if so, how. I want to know if a book contains unnecessary racial slurs. I want to know if a book‚Äôs plot relies on a white savior narrative, or perpetuates harmful stenotypes about disabled people, or uses mental illness as a ‚Äúplot twist.‚Äù I want to know if the only Black character is a loud, ‚Äúsassy‚Äù woman with no agency of her own. These are problems I‚Äôve seen over and over again in books, and they‚Äôre worth noting, both as a warning to readers who may want to avoid those books, and in the hopes that, by calling them out, authors will pay attention, and do better.
So why bother using the word problematic in the first place? Obviously, racism is problematic, but it‚Äôs more than just that ‚Äî it‚Äôs racism. I don‚Äôt see any reason to preface a statement that a book perpetuates racism in x, y, and z ways with the ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù label. Problematic is a catch-all phrase that allows readers to signal they‚Äôre some kind of woke. But it doesn‚Äôt leave much room for nuance, and it‚Äôs not a useful way to make publishing more just and inclusive. And isn‚Äôt that why so many of us bother pointing these things out, especially in the work of authors we love? I am always working to be a more thoughtful and observant reader. Humans are fallible and imperfect and make a lot of mistakes. When I criticize a book, it‚Äôs because I want that author to do better. I want other authors to learn from that author‚Äôs mistakes. I want to get to a place where everything that currently falls under the ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù umbrella is simply no longer tolerated, because enough of us have been loud enough to make authors, editors, and publishers understand that if a book is racist, or ableist, or transphobic, or Islamophobic, it won‚Äôt sell. I know. We have a long way to go. But that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm out here using precise language while shouting about books.
It‚Äôs easy to say a book is problematic, and it‚Äôs easy to feel good about yourself afterward for noticing. It‚Äôs a lot harder to pinpoint exactly what it is about a book that‚Äôs a problem. And it‚Äôs much scarier (especially, I‚Äôd imagine, for people of color, trans people, and others who are more likely to be attacked on the internet for telling the truth) to call a book‚Äôs problems by their names than it it is to just wrap the whole thing in the vagueness of ‚Äúproblematic.‚Äù
I know that dismantling systems of oppression ‚Äîin publishing or literature or anywhere ‚Äî is lifelong work. But if all of us readers who care deeply about the world and each other, who crave inclusive, thoughtful stories and who believe in uplifting all voices, speak up precisely and carefully when an author doesn‚Äôt get it right ‚Äî well, that‚Äôs a place to start.Reliable online pharmacy

By Kang Yoon-seung
SEOUL, Oct 22 (Yonhap) -- The Navy received an upgraded destroyer on Friday, after more than a year of refurbishment aimed at bolstering anti-submarine and other capabilities, the state arms procurement agency said.
The 3,200-ton Gwanggaeto the Great destroyer was handed over to the Navy, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said, as South Korea seeks to strengthen subsurface operations amid renewed tensions over North Korea's recent test of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile.
The destroyer was sent for the upgrade in April 2020. It is now equipped with a towed array sonar system designed to strengthen anti-submarine capabilities, the administration said.
The upgraded destroyer is also armed with a combat system developed with indigenous technologies, which will allow the military to save time on maintenance work and cut related costs.
On Tuesday, the North fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile from the vicinity of Sinpo, where its main submarine shipyard is located. It marked the North's eighth known major missile test this year.

-Facebook have refused to remove the controversial Raoul Moat tribute page despite complaints from David Cameron. Is the website providing a forum for healthy discussion?
Facebook have refused to surrender to growing pressure to remove the ‚ÄòR.I.P Raoul Moat You Legend‚Äô tribute page from the social networking site, despite complaints from the Prime Minister.
David Cameron told the Commons he could not understand the wave of sympathy for Moat, who shot three people and killed one, before going on the run and turning the gun on himself last week.
It is absolutely clear that Raoul Moat was a callous murderer, full stop, end of story, he said.
A spokesman for the website defended the decision to support the tribute page, claiming it is part of the healthy discussion available on Facebook, enabling people to debate topics of interest, and does not violate its terms.
Raoul Moat has dominated public debate over the last week and it is clear that there are lots of different and opposing opinions, both about Moat himself and about the investigation which surrounds him, the spokesman added.
More than 21, 000 people have already logged on to the page, with an overwhelming majority offering their support for Moats rampage in Rothbury, Northumberland branding him a legend and misunderstood, while criticising Northumbria police in the crudest possible way.
And, the tributes go further than facebook, with scores of people flocking to the riverside spot where he shot himself, turning it in to an outlandish tourist attraction complete with a plentiful array of flowers and sympathetic messages.
Do you think this glorification of Raoul Moat can be justified? Do you agree with facebooks decision to condone the celebration of a murderer?
Perhaps you think this tribute page represents a frightening uprising against the authorities and the law? Or alternatively, do you agree with facebook that the page facilitates healthy discussion?

When you start wondering ‚Äúwhere can I find a wife? ‚Äù it‚Äôs not hard to become perplexed. There are so many several answers for this older question. It almost allows you to feel like most likely asking The almighty if However give you a kid, instead of trying to find your future loved one in the forearms of your man.
Various people, whom are married for years, have no idea what to do as soon as they start thinking about if they should get married or perhaps keep internet dating. Some people also wonder if they should even marry. Unfortunately, a lot of people don‚Äôt pay attention to the direction their matrimony is going. They fall into the trap of believing that since they are married awhile, they‚Äôre already in a mature and serious relationship.
This is bad. When you‚Äôve been married a very long time, and points aren‚Äôt working out, it‚Äôs a bad thing. You should put some critical time and effort in making factors work. Many older couples have discovered that single a lot more good. Internet dating sites can be a smart way to meet man, and having an active and enjoyable marriage with somebody else can be quite fulfilling.
But if you aren‚Äôt a more youthful couple, an individual know what to expect from your marital relationship. You don‚Äôt know very well what your biblical principles are, and you may not feel comfortable within your marriage with your husband. This can cause constant be concerned and insecurity. So , how would you avoid this case without offending the husband?
The key is to make your relationship using your husband even more honest with one another. You need to begin by simply learning what their beliefs happen to be about matrimony and sexuality. Don‚Äôt base these philosophy on the things you hear from others. You need to rise love and compassion for each other and find out the own Bible truths.
One important point to bear in mind when you want to recognize how to find a wife is that there always exists temptation. In the event you learn to withstand temptation, you can stay healthy and fulfilled in the marriage. You will never stay completely happy and satisfied in a romantic relationship where you are constantly tempted. If you would like to remain completely happy and happy as a wife, you have to learn to resist attraction. If you only resist, you find a bride could wind up having a bad relationship and a man with no dignity for you.
Another important indicate keep in mind is that you shouldn‚Äôt starting your future partner‚Äôs view of marriage on your own. Just because the friend or perhaps your colliege has hitched and has youngsters doesn‚Äôt signify you should basic your displays of marriage troubles example. Godly wives ought to follow the sort of their mothers. If your mother taught you to honor the husband, to publish to him, to appreciate him, for being his good friend, to be his lover, to be faithful, to publish to his will, and also to serve him, then you should follow her example. You should always put the relationship using your husband to start with.
Thirdly most important point to remember the moment learning how to discover a wife is that you mustn‚Äôt marry young. God wishes a partner in his your life from small. He made the woman Adam‚Äôs friend so that he might have a wife. So , if you want to have a wife, have a tendency wait. If you would like to stay in the faith and produce a good relatives in the long run, you must marry small.
The fourth most important stage is that it is not good when young men marry grow women. This may not be only because the young ones are certainly not match to the women nevertheless also they just do not bring an adequate supply of wealth and children. God produced women to be indie and to discover their own put in place the family unit. They are to not be put into a situation where they have to depend on their husbands. A young female should not be provided over to a man just because this individual promises her a great many stuff.
The fifth and last important point is that it is not the best thing when a Christian man d√©confit a non-believer. The almighty does not wish people who walk in this world with out a strong opinion in The lord. A person who features god but acts like he does not is not merely one who is a believer. It is very easy for you to marry without a stable faith in God. There are many cases of this nowadays nowadays and the consequence is that a large number of marriages end up in divorce.
If you want to start acting such as a real Christian then I encourage you to get married to someone without any intimate relations before you get married. Should you get married and start developing a serious marriage with your loved one then you will get into trouble. An absolute Christian for no reason sleeps with any girl before he starts getting a serious romantic relationship with her. There are many folks who think that it is fine to get started having a physical relationship using a woman before getting married. Beware of such teachings as these are the teachings for the antichrist.When it comes to canines we all like to be top dog, but there can be major benefits to sharing the spotlight ‚Äì especially when you‚Äôre sharing it with an adorable fluff ball with a zest for life and zero remorse for its actions. (Yes, I‚Äôm talking about kittens.)
Newsflash: the rivalry between puppies and kittens is over. Having a kitten in the house can be downright delightful ‚Äì almost as delightful as snacking on yesterday‚Äôs trash.
It‚Äôs time to rethink the relationship between puppies and kittens and start capitalizing on the benefits.
Here are just a few of the reasons you might want to share your human, and your household, with a kitten.
1. You have a built-in snuggle buddy.
We dogs love a good nap, but kittens put our relaxation game to shame.
With a kitten in the house, you‚Äôll have a snuggle buddy who values naptime even more than you do.
2. You‚Äôll never lack a playmate.
When they‚Äôre not napping, kittens have boundless energy.
Whether you‚Äôre playing ‚Äúknock things off the counter so the dog can eat them‚Äù or chasing each other around the backyard, you‚Äôre in for some serious play.
3. You‚Äôre never alone.
Does your human work? Well, kittens don‚Äôt.
With a kitten in the house you always have company, even during those pesky 9-5 hours.
4. Your grooming game will improve.
Kittens know how to keep clean, and they‚Äôll keep you clean, too.
It might even mean fewer dreaded baths from the humans!
5. You have someone to blame when you get into trouble.
Is it the nicest thing to do? No. But kittens make great scapegoats.
Who knocked the vase off the coffee table? Probably the kitten‚Ä¶
6. You have an ally against the things that scare you.
Sure, the scary things aren‚Äôt going to disappear, but with a kitten around you never again have to face the vacuum alone. Or the thunder. Or the fireworks.
And you can always send the kitten out first to check if something is safe.
7. You‚Äôre not the only one who looks silly when your human dresses you up.
Hey, I don‚Äôt get it with the costumes, either. But if you don‚Äôt like them, I have some good news for you.
With a kitten in the house, you can always console yourself that at least you wear the costumes and clothes better than the kitten.
8. Their food tastes way better than ours.
It doesn‚Äôt matter how expensive or ‚Äúall-natural‚Äù your dog food is; the kitten‚Äôs will always taste better.
Let‚Äôs just hope the human leaves it in a spot you can reach‚Ä¶
You‚Äôll learn to celebrate your differences.
Puppies and kittens are different, sure. But those differences don‚Äôt amount to much when you both love the same human.
And table scraps. We love those, too.
9. Life will be full of surprises.
You never know what a kitten is going to do. One moment they might be napping in the sun and the next they might be high on catnip surprise-tackling you from behind.
Things are never boring with a kitten around.
10. You‚Äôll still always be your human‚Äôs favorite.
Yeah, kittens are pretty cute, but no matter how adorable they are, rest easy.
You can still know deep down inside that you‚Äôll always be the favorite.
As you can see, there are major benefits to having a kitten in the house. I‚Äôd keep listing them, but I think I hear the litter box calling my name‚Ä¶How to block slots on opentable

There is a fascinating series of youtube videos leading us through the whole process, from early sketches to final casting. The subject of the sketches is one of John Lovewell‚Äôs descendants, who surely must resemble one of his ancestors, though we can‚Äôt be certain which one, or which of several, he happens to favor.
Captain John was Thomas Lovewell‚Äôs great-great-grandfather, which is to say that he was one of sixteen relatives who contributed to Thomas‚Äôs DNA profile. In turn, Thomas is the great-great-grandfather of several members of my generation, making each of those great-great-grandchildren 1/16th times 1/16th, or the 1/256th part of Captain John Lovewell‚Äôs genetic makeup. While not exactly a drop in the bucket, that is still some serious genetic dilution. Yet, lacking pictorial evidence of Captain John Lovewell‚Äôs appearance, what else can we do but look to one of Captain John Lovewell‚Äôs descendants, cross our fingers, and hope for the best?
When I showed a picture of the clay model of Captain John to attendees at the Lovewell/Davis reunion in June, I commented that the sculpture somewhat resembles Thomas‚Äôs sister Hepsabeth. The line got a chuckle, but I was only half-joking. Photographs of the artist‚Äôs model and Thomas‚Äôs sister do both convey a hungry, rather careworn look.
The fact is, we don‚Äôt know what Captain John Lovewell looked like. His fame was not widespread until after his death, so there were probably no life-drawings or other likenesses made of the man. Descriptions of him emphasize his obvious valor and his skills as a ranger and a leader. It might seem an indictment of our superficial times if we suggest that we would also like to know if he were tall, with chiseled features, or short, rotund or doughy. Not that looks necessarily count for that much, except that our leaders are often tall, because we tend to look up to people figuratively as well as literally. They are also generally trim, but not always. One of Colonial America‚Äôs most famous rangers, Benjamin Church, managed to become the hero of King Philip‚Äôs War and Nathaniel Philbrick‚Äôs excellent book ‚ÄúMayflower,‚Äù all while maintaining the ‚Äúconsistent panda-bear shape‚Äù of John Goodman (Who, besides having the heft to stand in for Church, also has the chops to play the heck out of the part).
Occasionally we are tipped off to the body-contour of even certain minor historical figures within Thomas Lovewell‚Äôs orbit, as when Washington County Deputy Sheriff C. M. Murdock informed readers of the Western Observer that he offered to make the trip to Lake Sibley in place of Excelsior Colony president ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù Lewis Walker in May of 1869, because he felt confident that the horse would have suffered a more grueling ordeal under Walker‚Äôs weight. If we suspect that reporters from a Jewell County newspaper were offering a clue about his size when they wrote of a ‚Äújolly‚Äù White Rock blacksmith and dry-goods salesman named Thomas Shuler, we would be correct. Thomas Lovewell‚Äôs granddaughter Orel Poole wrote a monograph about Shuler, one of her grandfather‚Äôs dearest friends, and reported him to be a portly man.
Thomas Shuler was also president of the Old Settler‚Äôs Association in 1900, and would have given the welcoming address which famously eulogized Thomas, who, according to legend, was feared to have perished while prospecting in Alaska. Athough Shuler fell ill at the last minute and Lydia Charles had to fill in for him, the amusing vaudeville routine which ensued, with a very-much-alive Thomas Lovewell spotted in the crowd at the last minute, was probably cooked up by Lovewell and Shuler, who really does seem to have been jolly.One Pair Of Earrings, Two Ways To Wear.

MediaTek and AMD announce RZ600 series Wi-Fi 6E chips
The chipset will power next-generation AMD Ryzen-series laptops and desktop PCs.

Low stock and high pricing are the results of the ongoing chip scarcity, which affects everything from PCs to Cameros. It isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon, unfortunately. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told shareholders during a shareholder meeting to disclose the company‚Äôs third-quarter financial results that he doesn‚Äôt expect the shortfall to end until 2023 at the earliest.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the worst of it right now,‚Äù Gelsinger told CNBC. ‚ÄúEvery quarter next year, we‚Äôll get marginally better, but supply-demand equilibrium won‚Äôt be achieved until 2023.‚Äù Intel has stated that processor shortages are causing a drop in laptop sales and cautioned that finding good PC discounts this holiday season may be difficult.
To some extent, the other heavyweights of the semiconductor industry concur. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a similar earnings call in August that supply chain challenges will remain for ‚Äúthe great majority‚Äù of 2022. For almost two years, Nvidia‚Äôs graphics cards have been in such limited supply that secondary market prices have skyrocketed as scalpers, cryptocurrency miners, and the occasional PC gamer compete for the few GPUs that are still available on the retail market.
In the PC industry, Intel and Nvidia‚Äôs main rival agrees, but they are significantly more hopeful. AMD CEO Lisa Su projected that the chip shortage in the second half of 2022 will be ‚Äúless severe‚Äù after being ‚Äútight‚Äù in the first half, speaking at the Code Conference in September.
It doesn‚Äôt end there, though. Qualcomm, ARM, Samsung, and Apple executives all believe that the chip shortage will last until at least 2022, with varying degrees of pessimism for longer forecasts. Industrial powers are attempting to improve supply through increased manufacturing, while politicians strive to assist them to different degrees of success. However, the general assumption appears to be that high pricing and limited supplies will continue to be the norm for practically everything that contains a chip in the coming year.
The forthcoming Intel Core i9-12900K CPU continues to be the subject of leaks. Even though the chips haven‚Äôt been formally revealed, a Reddit member was able to purchase a few of them earlier this week.
Micro Center‚Äôs retail page now includes information on the flagship Alder Lake CPU (via The Verge). According to the description, the chip will cost $670 and will begin arriving on November 4, 2021.
The Core i9-12900K offers a 3.2GHz regular clock and a 5.2GHz turbo speed, according to the listing. It has 16 cores, 24 threads, and 30MB of L3 cache, according to reports. The spec sheet lists a thermal power of 125W, DDR5 memory support, and PCIe Gen 5 capability. Intel Z690, Intel H670, Intel B660, and Intel H610 motherboards will all support the flagship processor.

- Do not rely on your own search engine results: Perhaps you are like many web leaders: They google themselves their homepage and believe that the search engine reveals to you the relevance or visibility of your page on this way. You are looking for your company name or your products and look forward to seeing your own website on the first page. If you visit a page more frequently, Google makes search results as the search engine detects already existing relationships and adapts recommendations individually. Such a search has little to do with what a potential customer is looking for and Google recommends.
- Know what your customers are looking for: Agencies that optimize search engine websites are easy to find in Google under the search term SEO Agency. However, many website owners in companies who are looking for a Google Search Optimization solution do not call their problem a SEO issue. The normal web-person responsible has the problem that the homepage in Google does not look good. If the SEO agency has forgotten on its own website, for such problem formulations (eg My website is not well found in Google) to prepare a response, Google will not rank this agency very high in the search query.
- The language of your customers speak: Transfer this example to your own situation: Ask yourself whether you and your prospective customers speak the same language or - in other words - use the same (search) terms. Your colleagues with customer contact from the call center, the customer support or the sales department can give an indication of this.
- Use tracking tools: If you are already monitoring your website with an analysis or tracking tool, such as Piwik or Google Analytics, you will find additional valuable information. The tool will show you what people were looking for before they were taken to your page by Google. Be careful! These terms are only those where your page is already successful.
- Do a workshop: Use colleagues to collect all terms that customers use to describe their problems and search queries. Form cluster and try to find priorities. You should take into account that a search term - or keyword or keyword - can consist of one or more words. Top priorities include your key services and their translation into terms that your prospective customers use when searching. It is best to have a workshop with all the customer contacts, or ask your new customers by telephone: What did you look for to find us?
- Use targeted SEO Tools: Now you have to find out which concepts you have not yet thought of. You can expand your list of relevant search terms by finding out what terms the other competitors are successful with. Use professional SEO tools like Searchmetrix or SISTRIX. They show which search terms or conceptual combinations Google is particularly prominent in listing your competitors' pages. If you believe that the search terms should lead to your solutions, then add them to your keyword list.
- What is the competition doing? The SEO tools all work similarly: You start by entering the domains of the competitors and you can display the terms with which the competitor is displayed in Google 1, 2, etc. Some tools (such as SISTRIX) even show how often the term is searched for, and how much other websites are already trying to get a good ranking. It is not advisable to analyze your competitors' Google placements without special tools, since Google does not only customize your searches, but you also have to search for terms that have not yet occurred to to lead wisely {+ add-on as desired}

Monday, 12 Aug 2013
Following my plea for help, fellow beauty blogger, and nail art master Michelle from Ordinary Misfit sent me a detailed email with her tips and tricks!
Here is the link for her blog Ordinary Misfit Blog which has so many stunning designs!
She was kind enough to allow me to share her tips and tricks on my blog, to help my followers‚Ä¶ I have already started trying some of the tips, especially the gift card one! I love it! I have a Guess one that was too pretty to throw away, so it is now part of my stamping kit üôÇ
So, here are some of her tips‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt use the scraper that comes with the set. Mine was/is metal and I find that I can‚Äôt scrape it properly on a metal plate without either scratching it or scraping off too much polish. I now use a plastic gift card or bank card. I actually have a Pavilion gift card I now use and works like a charm. I find it scrapes enough polish off but doesn‚Äôt take the polish out of the design.
I also keep the card at a bit of an angle. This seemed to help quite a bit.
Picking up the image. I usually end up pressing straight down and lifting straight up. Some people recommend a rolling motion but I prefer to just press and pick up. This prevents smudging. The only exception is is the image is too big for the stamper. In which case it doesn‚Äôt really matter üôÇ
Transferring the image to your nail. Here I use the rolling motion. I line up the image by using the one side of the nail as a guide. (If it is a full image design I line up the edge to the edge of my nail. If it is a single image I use the side of my nail to guide to get it where I want it to go.) I then press the stamper onto my nail and in one motion roll it over my nail. This does take a few practice runs but once you get the hang of it you will just get it and never struggle again.
Another trick is the polish. Not any and every polish will be suitable for stamping. At Dischem, essence sells stampy polish. They work like a charm. Sinful colours black and white also work really well. Tip Top Armour plate or Aluminium work great. Essence ‚Äì Fame Fatal is also great. You will need a polish that is a little thicker (not always) and also completely opaque in one coat. Once you have a few that work great you will quickly realise what it takes. I actually try quite a few of my polishes every now and then. Sometimes they will surprise you üòâ
Here is her post about stamping:
Thank You MichelleIf you‚Äôre selling your home, you might wonder if there are common repairs needed after a home inspection. Most buyers, after all, won‚Äôt commit to purchasing a place until there‚Äôs been a thorough inspection by a home inspector‚Äîand rest assured, if there are problems, this professional will find them!
So if your home inspection turns up flaws that your home buyer wants fixed, what then? To be sure, repair requests after an inspection are a hassle, and liable to cut into your profits. So for starters, make sure to read your inspection contract carefully to make sure you don‚Äôt get locked into mending something you don‚Äôt want to fix.
‚ÄúAs a seller, you should never sign an inspection contract until you fully understand its obligations, particularly where it concerns your responsibility for fixing things,‚Äù says Michele Lerner, author of ‚ÄúHomebuying: Tough Times, First Time, Any Time: Smart Ways to Make a Sound Investment.‚Äù
What fixes are mandatory after a home inspection?
And rest assured, there‚Äôs no need for you to fix everything a home inspector thinks could stand for improvement; a home inspection report is not a to-do list. Basically inspection repairs fall into three categories: ones that are pretty much required, according to the inspector; ones that typically aren‚Äôt required; and ones that are up for debate. Here‚Äôs how to know which is which.
Home inspection tips for sellers: Common repairs required after a home inspection
There are some fixes that will be required by lenders before they will release funds to finance a buyer‚Äôs home purchase. Typically these address costly structural defects, building code violations, or safety issues, sometimes in the attic, crawl spaces, and basement, and those related to the chimney or furnace.
An inspector will also check whether your septic system and heater are in good condition and verify whether there‚Äôs a possible radon leak or the presence of termites (homeowners tend to have many questions on these topics). Other conditions of the home that an inspector may report on include those related to the roof, electrical systems, and plumbing lines and the condition of your HVAC system.. This might be preferable since you won‚Äôt have to oversee the process; you can move out and move on with your life.
Home inspection repairs that aren‚Äôt required
Do you have to fix everything on a home inspection? Cosmetic issues and normal wear and tear that‚Äôs found by the inspector usually don‚Äôt have to be fixed.
‚ÄúSome inspection contracts will expressly state that the buyers cannot request any cosmetic fixes to be made and can only ask that structural defects, building code violations, or safety issues be addressed,‚Äù says Lerner. Furthermore, ‚Äústate laws may also impact your liability as a seller for any issues uncovered during an inspection.‚Äù
Be sure to check your local ordinances to know which fix-its that are found during an inspection legally fall in your realm of responsibility.
Do you have to fix everything on a home inspection? Home inspection repairs that are negotiable
Between fixes that are typically required and those that aren‚Äôt is a gray area that inspection fixes found by the inspector,‚Äù she adds.
However, in a normal market, you won‚Äôt be able to draw such a hard and fast line related to an inspection.
Work with your real estate agent to understand what items you should inspect and then tackle‚Äîand where you might want to push back. Don‚Äôt have an agent yet? Here‚Äôs how to find a real estate agent in your area.
Just remember: you‚Äôll want to be reasonable when it comes to repairs because you may have already put a lot of time into the selling process, and it‚Äôs likely in your best interest to accommodate some fixes rather than allowing the buyer to walk away. Also, depending on the magnitude of the requested fix, it‚Äôs not likely to go away. Now that it‚Äôs been uncovered by the home inspector, you‚Äôll need to disclose the issue to the next buyer.
How to negotiate home fixes
Here are two sneaky but totally effective ways to handle this home hurdle that‚Äôs been uncovered by your inspector:
- Offer a home warranty. ‚ÄúI sometimes keep a $500 one-year home warranty in my back pocket as a token to ease concerns found during a home inspection,‚Äù says Kyle Springer, a Realtor¬Æ with Coldwell Banker in Bowling Green, KY. That can come in handy if there is an element that doesn‚Äôt truly need fixing but is still worrying the buyers, such as an aging HVAC unit.
- Barter for something of value to the buyer. Often sellers will suggest their real estate agent ask the buyer‚Äôs agent if the buyers want appliances or furniture if they have no plans to move them. Springer advises sellers to wait to make that offer until after they get the list from the inspector, because they may be able to beg off certain fixes in exchange for items such as the washer and dryer.
A home inspection can turn up all kinds of issues, but nearly all can be addressed quickly, pleasing buyers and sellers alike.View

VA Video Connect: Life-changing Treatment for America‚Äôs Veterans To help Veterans access vital physical and mental health services, the VA launched VA Video Connect, a telehealth program enabled by a partnership with Sprint-sponsored mobile data.
A vital service for America‚Äôs Veterans
Since 1989, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been helping veteran service men and women access the vital medical services and mental health treatment they need. Mental health struggles like anxiety are common among military Veterans, but the most frequently diagnosed condition is PTSD. Approximately 11-20% of Veterans of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have PTSD, while 30% of Vietnam Veterans are believed to have had PTSD in their lifetimes.1
There are more than 18.2 million Veterans in the United States, over 9 million of which are supported by the VA each year. But for many of its patients, a lack of access is a major barrier to treatment.2
Video telehealth enhances the accessibility of Veteran‚Äôs healthcare by bringing services closer to Veterans and their caregivers, some of whom live hours away from a VA facility and/or have disabilities that make travel difficult. And Sprint plays a big part in making it happen.
Veterans‚Äô accessibility issues limit treatment
Veterans need treatment, but not everybody has the time, accessibility, or capability to attend regular face-to-face appointments.
‚ÄúOne of the biggest challenges in providing healthcare to our Veterans is access to care,‚Äù says Dr. Teri Carper, a clinical psychologist at the Orlando VA Healthcare System.
‚ÄúWe see a lot of men and women who have families and full-time
jobs, who don‚Äôt have the flexibility to come sit with us at a time that‚Äôs convenient for all.‚Äù
For example, United States Veteran Jonathan Held, a patient of Dr. Carper‚Äôs, suffers with diabetic neuropathy, which limits his mobility.
‚ÄúI can drive, but once I‚Äôm at my destination, my mobility is limited,‚Äù says Jonathan.
‚ÄúAnd to make it to my appointment at the hospital on time, I‚Äôd have to leave at five in the morning.‚Äù
So, to help Veterans like Jonathan get the treatment they need without leaving home or disrupting their daily activities, the VA launched VA Video Connect, a user-friendly telehealth program accessible on any smart device, tablet, or computer.

VA Video Connect
A major cellular carrier has waived the data fee for Veterans who are using VA Video Connect to get their healthcare from the VA.
Often when Veterans connect with Wi-Fi, it can be spotty, so in those instances we have Veterans switch to data.* Dr. Teri Carper Psychologist at Orlando VA
A digital bridge between doctor and patient
VA Video Connect enables veteran access to gold-star, evidence-based treatment from the comfort of their own home, or wherever they may be, using their laptop or mobile device.
But after going live with its telehealth program, the VA found one issue remained: inconsistent Wi-Fi connectivity. They discovered that not everybody‚Äôs internet connection was reliable enough to support a disruption-free session. Many Veterans needed an alternative way of connecting‚Äî and it needed to be free of charge.
By partnering with Sprint, the VA is now able to offer free, reliable mobile connectivity to its veteran patients for use across all VA Video Connect sessions.

* Note that data used over a VPN session will incur charges due to technical limitations.

VA Video Connect
They do get better. It‚Äôs a no brainer to offer this to all our Veterans who are in need of mental health services. Dr. Teri Carper Psychologist at Orlando VA
Free remote treatment with Sprint
VA Video Connect is a life-changing program, and one which Sprint is delighted to help make accessible to as many Veterans as possible.
To produce a high-quality video session, this solution uses approximately 1264kbs per second. Veterans could use a significant portion of their monthly data for a single video visit.
With this solution, the VA can help Veterans save in data fees by using Sprint‚Äôs network for free instead of their personal mobile data allowance.
‚ÄúFor some Veterans, using personal data to connect would be cost prohibitive,‚Äù says Dr. Carper.
‚ÄúSo, removing that barrier to care is fantastic.‚Äù
More importantly yet, VA‚Äôs telehealth solution has received incredible feedback from veteran users.
‚ÄúI no longer have to get up at 4:45 in the morning and face the stress of Orlando traffic,‚Äù says Jonathan.
‚ÄúI just brush my teeth and comb my hair; and here I am. I love it.‚Äù
Crucially, the VA‚Äôs research has found no difference in treatment outcome compared to in-person therapy sessions‚Äîso Veterans are able to get the same high standard of care, wherever they are.

I then went on to play at Arizona State University where I was part of the 2007 PAC-10 Championship team. I graduated from ASU in 2011 and was fortunate enough to continue my playing career in the National Football League as a wide receiver, and kick returner for 4 seasons.
After my playing days wrapped up I knew I wanted to get into coaching. I have coached at the High School level for 4 years and have also coached at the college level. I coached at Phoenix College and also Oregon State University.
I am very excited about joining the San Tan Charter family and building a top-notch football program. I believe this football program is ready to take the next step into the AIA conference where we expect to compete for a Championship. We will have a professional program that prepares our student-athletes for life after high school.

As Bollywood star Kareena Kapoor turned 41 on Tuesday, the actress shared with her fans a glimpse of how she is celebrating the special day.
The actress treated her fans with her and her husband Saif Ali Khan's adorable selfie from their ongoing beach vacation at an undisclosed location.
The couple, along with their two kids, left Mumbai a few days back in order to ring in Kareena's birthday at the location.
Kareena Kapoor introduces her 'third baby' to the world. No it's not what you think it is
In the image, Saif can be seen hugging Kareena as they both enjoy the scenic island view. "21-9-2021," she captioned the Instagram Story.
Kareena and Saif have been happily married since October 2012. They both are doting parents to two sons -- Taimur and Jeh.
The couple started dating while working on the 2008 release 'Tashan'. The two had already featured in two films -- 'LOC Kargil' and 'Omkara' -- together before they came close on the sets of 'Tashan'.
Several Bollywood stars took to social media to wish Kareena including her sister Karisma Kapoor who shared adorable throwback photos from their childhood.

Benedict XVI appealed for cooperation among believers of the three main monotheist religions, when he met with members of the American Jewish Committee.
‚ÄúJudaism, Christianity and Islam believe in the one God, Creator of heaven and earth,‚Äù the Pope told his guests at an audience in the Vatican today.
‚ÄúIt follows, therefore, that all three monotheistic religions are called to cooperate with one another for the common good of humanity, serving the cause of justice and peace in the world,‚Äù he added in his address delivered in English.
‚ÄúThis is especially important today when particular attention must be given to teaching respect for God, for religions and their symbols, and for holy sites and places of worship,‚Äù the Holy Father said.
‚ÄúReligious leaders have a responsibility to work for reconciliation through genuine dialogue and acts of human solidarity,‚Äù he added.
In his intervention, Benedict XVI recalled the recent celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council‚Äôs declaration ‚ÄúNostra Aetate,‚Äù a document that marked a positive turn in relations between Jews and Catholics.
Common patrimony
This celebration, the Pontiff said, ‚Äúhas increased our shared desire to know each other better and to develop a dialogue characterized by mutual respect and love.‚Äù
‚ÄúIndeed, Jews and Christians have a rich common patrimony,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIn many ways this distinguishes our relationship as unique among the religions of the world. The Church can never forget that Chosen People with whom God entered into a holy covenant.‚Äù
Benedict XVI concluded by hoping that the visit of the Jewish representatives to Rome ‚Äúmay confirm you in your endeavors to build bridges of understanding across all barriers.‚Äù
The American Jewish Committee was a great promoter of relations between Jews and Catholics during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II and have been as well at the start of Benedict XVI‚Äôs pontificate. Its representatives often visited John Paul II in Rome.
Last Aug. 19, representatives of the group expressed satisfaction with Benedict XVI‚Äôs visit that day to a synagogue in Germany that had been destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.
Among the American Jewish Committee‚Äôs aims, according to its Web site, is ‚Äúto strengthen the basic principles of pluralism around the world, as the best defense against anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry.‚ÄùAlibaba Purchasing Daraz- Is This the New Rise of Online Retailing in Bangladesh?3 min read
With a surprise, Alibaba- the Chinese tech giant, broadened its footprints in Bangladesh after acquiring Daraz-one of the most popular marketplaces in South Asia. This is totally a game changer for the online retailing landscape of Bangladesh.
Launched in 2012, Daraz has become one of the most popular selling and shopping platform in Pakistan, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka along with Bangladesh. Till now, Daraz is working with approximately 500 brands, 30,000 sellers, and more than 5 million consumers.
The acquiring of Daraz is the second wave of international expansions of Alibaba. Through this deal, Alibaba aims to enter into the online retaining field if South Asia.
The company was initially focused on India. There, Alibaba financed (Ant Financial) Paytm and Southeast Asia with Lazada. However, this year they spread their wing to the countries with a vast population but increasing use of internet use and shopping.
Daraz started its journey with Pakistan. This country has a total population of over 190 million. This purchase of Daraz trails a fintech invest from Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba. Ant Finance runs Alipay as well as other financial services of Alibaba.
Just like Pakistan, Bangladesh has a high potential for e-commerce and online retailing. Therefore, it was expected for Alibaba to eye on Bangladesh.
With this addition, now Daraz can leverage the leadership of Alibaba and experience in logistics, technology, mobile payment, and online commerce to grow further in the five countries of South Asia.
Alipay first bought 20 percent stakes of bKash on April of this year. According to Kamal Quadir, CEO of bKash, and Douglas Feagin, ‚ÄúThe investment of Alipay on bKash opens many opportunities, and it also demonstrates the confidence a world-class e-commerce site is placing on Bangladesh.‚Äù With the rising use of the internet, the 160 million population of Bangladesh has piqued the interest of the Chinese e-commerce-commerce titan.
Right now, the worth of the e-commerce market of Bangladesh is about Tk. 2000 crore. The prediction of e-Commerce Association of Bangladesh indicates that it will be a billion dollar by 2021. The e-CAB leaders on a conversation with the Daily Star said with the entry of the largest online trading platform of the world, Alibaba, the target of 2021 might be reached a lot earlier. The former president of e-CAB, Razib Ahmed says, ‚ÄúThe arrival of Alibaba proves that the e-commerce of Bangladesh has a huge potential.‚Äù
Through the online survey of the market experts, more than two million online customers are active in Bangladesh. All thanks to this deal, may be now- these Bangladeshi clients of Daraz and Alibaba would be able to buy the products directly from the massive marketplace of Alibaba without paying the high customs duty and shipment charges.
Razib Ahmed- one of the main e-commerce expert personal in Bangladesh, advised the other existing online entities not to feel discouraged or threatened by the arrival of this Chinese e-commerce giant. He told them to be united and work together in improving the internet marketplace.
This is a massive opportunity for Bangladesh. The outlook of the online retailing of Bangladesh will be revolutionized with the help of Alibaba.
Of course, the total merchant and customer number will expand significantly from the existing number, said by the public relation and communication manager of Daraz Bangladesh, Shayantani Twisha.
Let‚Äôs hope the online retailing opportunities and the economy of Bangladesh will be elevated in the future with the side-by-side business of these two big companies.>>.

Social class is indeed just money + time, or perhaps occupational status + time.
It is possible to be poor and upper-class, in the same way it‚Äôs possible to be a black person who is a British citizen.
Citizenship is to wealth and occupation as race is to social class.
In other words, you don‚Äôt just become a member of the lower class just because you lose your wealth, your lineage must live in poverty for multiple generations to be lower class.
Similarly, you don‚Äôt just become white because you immigrated to Europe, your lineage must have lived in Europe for many generations to be white.
So ultimately, social class is a biological concept to be studied by taxonomists.
We‚Äôre all animals, but the animal kingdom can be subdivided into different classes, such as mammals and reptiles.
Mammals can be subdivided into different orders, such as primates vs rodents.
Primates can be subdivided into different families such as hominids vs Cercopithecids.
Hominids can be subdivided into different genera such as Homo vs Pan.
Homos can be subdivided into different species such as modern humans vs Neanderthals.
Modern humans can be subdivided into different races such as Caucasoids vs Negroids.
Caucasoids can be subdivided into different ethnic groups such as British vs French.
And finally, the British can be subdivided into different social classes such as Upper Class vs Prole.
Of course these subdivisions are largely arbitrary, and at the narrower levels, may be much more cultural than genetic. Perhaps, as a commenter once hinted, the only way to objectively prove them is to do a hierarchical factor analysis of all the inherited traits of everything to ever live, but such a task is beyond anyone‚Äôs capability.Event planner Tony Antonio has created a handy tool that can help you plan your Shrinking Events Ticketing and Shredming Events Event in advance.

Abstract
For solo piano, duration 8 minutes. This work was premiered on 10 December 2015 by Joseph Houston, at St John's Smith Square, London. "Darling Eve is lost in the evil garden, unaware of the vile danger all about her. In failing to notice the blackest raven glide by, she incites, in the Devil, anger." ¬© Simon Holt.Every market day is full of activities in dozens of different places, from early morning to late night. In total, there are hundreds of different events each market, far more than an individual market visitor has time to experience. Although it may feel like you miss a lot, the wide range of events also has a positive effect: Even if you have visited the market 20 times, there is always something new to experience every year!

So important to keep having this discussion especially when there will be many large investments in infrastructure in the coming months. We are going to be saddling the next two generations with this debt so these investment decisions need to be long term and sustainable. As always one-off investments are very hard to get right. Allowing multiple smaller investments mitigates bias and risk.

Highlights include
- Around 40 new, grid-scale generation and batteries projects required to 2035; We have some of these announced already.
- Generation of around 95% renewable by 2035, moving to 100% by 2050 is achievable;
- Smart grid made up of millions of smart appliances and smart EV chargers plus many small scale solar photovoltaic and battery systems in 2035, easing the need for more generation and network investment;
- Around 1.5 million light electric vehicles on our roads in 2035, near 100% in 2050;
- Current coal and gas use for process heat to be around 50% electrified by 2035 with significant uptake in low temperature process heat;
- Average, two car (one an EV in 2035) household sees total energy bill cut by 25%/$1631 in 2035; and,
- Electrification and renewable generation including Solar PV can provide over 50% of the non-forestry emissions reductions required to achieve net zero carbon by 2050.
We have been advocating for the government to allow customers to redirect their Winter Energy payment to a small solar system which has more of a long term benefit while increasing jobs and reducing people‚Äôs overall power costs in winter and summer. It also encourages consumers to use power during the day to warm houses which has been shown to reduce the load at peak times.
The Winter Energy payment of $20 per week (Its currently double this) would cover payments for a 3kW system that would produce $1000 worth of savings per year at today‚Äôs average kW rate of .26 cents per kWh. After 10 years the system will be paid off the system would produce $1000 savings for the owner for the next 15 years minimum.*
We are also working with Raglan Local Energy providing an easy way for the community to buy, sell, and gift clean, local energy. This new way of selling energy locally is paying local generators (Home solar customers) 12 cents per KWh as a feed-in tariff. We will have more actual data from our customers in a later article.
We are looking forward to a renewable energy future, it would be great to see the Government do the same

EGFR is a member of the receptor tyrosine-kinase family and has an important role in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overexpression of EGFR may lead to cell proliferation, promotes angiogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis, and also inhibits cell apoptosis. Acquired T790M mutation is the primary resistance mechanism to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), used as first-line treatment in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with stage IV NSCLC, with EGFR exon 19 mutation, with TKI in first-line and multiples liquid biopsies performed at progression, who developed the T790M resistance mutation at more than three years after the diagnosis and received treatment with osimertinib.‚ÄúThe memory of places tends to bleed into my writing‚Äù
We keep on publishing Q&A with the winners of the 2021 Ruritania prize.
The full versions will feature the issue 8 of Panel, but for now ‚Äì enjoy some bits of our interview with Eleanor Updegraff, 2nd place winner, with the story ‚ÄúMarina‚Äù.
Eleanor Updegraff is a freelance writer, editor, and literary translator. She holds a B.A. in English literature, German and Russian from Durham University and is now based in Carinthia, Austria, following several years in Vienna. Her creative and critical writing has appeared online and in print.
Q: What‚Äôs your personal experience with Central and Eastern Europe? Did you live here or spend a long time here?
A: I moved to Austria in 2015 and have lived here ever since ‚Äì a few years in Vienna, followed by two in the more rural surroundings of Carinthia. Before and since moving here I have also travelled a bit in the region and find it endlessly fascinating; there is always more to see.
Q: How do your travels and your experience in Europe affect your writing?
A: I am very affected by place, so my current surroundings, or the memory of places I‚Äôve felt deeply connected to, tend to bleed into my writing. This can be in terms of physical geography ‚Äì natural landscapes, urban environments ‚Äì but also the people I encounter, the culture I experience, the spirit and atmosphere of the place as a whole. I work as a translator, so am very inspired by language and its use in everyday life, particularly in porous border regions ‚Äì where I live in the south of Austria, Slovenian has an often unseen but very powerful presence, which itself comes with a significant backstory. That leads into what is perhaps one of the most important aspects of this region for me: the past and our relationship with it. Everywhere has a history, of course, but here the past seems to bubble just below the surface. It‚Äôs a theme I often explore in my writing, including "Marina".
Q: You write in different genres. How does it help, if it does, to develop and strengthen your own voice as a writer?
A: I think that writing is one of those wonderful disciplines in which you can hone your craft by expanding, rather than narrowing, your focus. It can be incredibly refreshing to try exploring a certain theme or idea in a different genre, or even to blend several together ‚Äì language is a living thing, after all, so the structures in which we tend to use it should be just as adaptable. I have always read widely across different genres, but since allowing myself consciously to write across them too, I have definitely felt a stronger sense of my own voice, even though on the surface it may seem different depending on whether I‚Äôm working on fiction, narrative non-fiction, criticism or even literary translation.
Q: What do you think is the most important thing any writer should keep in mind?
A: Writers are always told to learn to deal with rejection, but I think something even more essential is to find someone who will champion you. Not necessarily to the outside world, but just on a personal level. They could be a friend, a partner, a family member, a mentor ‚Äì anyone who can offer constructive feedback and will believe in your work. Another thing I always try to keep in mind (because it‚Äôs something I personally struggle with) is a wonderful piece of advice I once read: ‚Äòtrying to edit while writing is like trying to drive with the handbrake on‚Äô. In other words, it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect on the first draft. The best writing happens when creativity is given free rein; there will always be time for editing later. item "2012 Range Rover Evoque Dynamic 3 door Coupe" is in sale since Monday, July 22, 2019.

Recent CommentsInciting Violence is Okay If You‚Äôre a Democrat
US Rep. Democrat Maxine Waters of California is facing fierce criticism after inciting violence by encouraging protestors gathered in Minneapolis to ‚Äòget more confrontational‚Äô if Derek Chauvin was not convicted of murder for the death of George Floyd.
‚ÄúWe got to stay on the street, get more active, more confrontational,‚Äù she said during an interview with Unicorn Riot.
The jury found Chauvin guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter. But there‚Äôs no telling what may have happened had the jury acquitted him.
Like former President Donald Trump, Waters has a reputation for brash and provocative comments.
In 2017, she described the Trump Administration as a ‚Äúbunch of scumbags.‚Äù In 2018 when the Trump Administration implemented its zero-tolerance policy for illegal border crossings, she encouraged Americans to surround Trump officials in public and ‚Äúharass them.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe need civility in this country, but the idea that you‚Äôre asking people to go forward, that becomes very dangerous and it becomes a risk inside our country as well,‚Äù said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) at the time.
Earlier this month, Waters told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) to ‚Äúrespect the chair and shut your mouth,‚Äù when he exceeded his allotted time frame during a conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Last weekend, Waters paid a visit to protestors gathered outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department over the killing of Daunte Wright. ‚ÄúWe cannot be still,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe cannot be satisfied, until we get justice.‚Äù
Critics have compared Waters‚Äô encouragement to protesters this week to Trump‚Äôs speech on January 6th. That is when he told supporters to ‚Äúfight like hell.‚Äù Democrats then blamed Trump for inciting a riot, the most popular social media site in the country banned him, and the House impeached him.
‚ÄúWhy is Maxine Waters traveling to a different state trying to incite a riot? What good can come from this?‚Äù tweeted Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO).
Author‚Äôs Note: In yet another example of hypocrisy, Democrats seem to have no problem inciting riots and violence. At the same time, they blast Republicans for imaginary acts of inciting violence.

If your Democrat anything goes. They are losers. Hateful people and don t give a shit about America and it s people. or black life s. they only use back people. to do harm to America.
Waters is just another wind bag wagging her fat piehole. It doesn‚Äôt say much for Calf. Voters who keep putting her in office.
Get mad max out. She‚Äôs worthless.
This woman is if you want to call her that should be remover from office now.
Just a piece of crap üí©!
Wow! I had no idea republicans were such delicate snowflakes. ‚ÄúAuntie Maxine said mean things, I feel threatened‚Äù.
As great trump supporters from all over our great Nation have repeatedly said,‚ÄùF your feelings‚Äù.
Until there is equal justice for everyone, our citizens must remain in the streets and make sure the establishment is uncomfortable enough to make changes in our system.
A call for confrontation is not a call for violence, I can confront the status quo verbally, via protests, or blogs. Unlike ‚Äúfight like hell‚Äù, Maxine‚Äôs calls are for action. Only the right wing outrage machine would clutch their pearls so tightly to think that it was a call to violence.
It is interesting how quickly the bash a police officer over the head w a fire extinguisher and spray bear repellent crowd is so suddenly worried about violence. Talk about hypocrisy.
Maxine Waters is a disgusting, intolerant, hypocrite. She blasted Pres. Trump for the exact same thing she is doing. I guess she thinks she is above the law. She needs to be removed from Office for trying to incite violence. Pelosi needs to step up and condemn Waters rhetoric. Why is Pelosi allowing Waters to do this but Trump was impeached for the same thing. Democrats think they are privileged. But they are actually just condescending asses. Because of Waters threats, the jurors need to be asked if they thought their life was in danger if they didn‚Äôt vote to convict. If they answer yes, than Waters needs to be charged with Jury tampering, obstruction of justice, and threatening the lives of jurors.
You got a better chance of finding slo Joe ‚Äòs brain
Kate, the jury was sequestered when the comments were made. Don‚Äôt let facts stand in the way of a good rant. There was no call for violence, only a call to confront institutional racism and injustice.
The jury was not sequestered during the trial. The judge told them not to watch tv or read anything about the trial. Hence the judges remarks about Waters opening up the door for an appeal.
Waters is a hypocrite, plain and simple. And this kind of behavior really really should land her in jail. The fact that it doesn‚Äôt is lamentable for our entire nation.
Mad Max is the perfect example of a home-grown bigot, racist, trouble-maker, hypocrite, crook, and, most of all, a POS!
She hopped on a plane to Milwaukee purposely to interject herself into a volatile crowd. Her purpose was not to attempt to calm the crowd down and wait for the verdict; instead she whipped them up She got police protection when she landed there, inciting the crowd to become ‚Äò‚Äômore confrontational‚Äù. After she stirred them up, she conveniently flew back home.
Home is a multi-million mansion in a predominantly white neighborhood (I mention this only for two reasons: her district is black and she doesn‚Äôt reside in it [why?], an obvious racist, she has chosen to live in a white neighborhood. BTW, where did her money come from? When asked, she resorted to the worn out race answer. In recent years she has been voted as the most crooked member of Congress. Yet her hold on her Congressional seat stays strong!
M&M is a SCUMBAG ~ Surround her house and all chant ‚ÄúTRAITOR‚Äù
You seem to confuse support for a movement with encouraging rioting. While the country took a step forward by convicting the murderer Derek Chauvin, in the past week 3 more Blacks were killed by police. A 13-year old ‚Äúman‚Äù (as Tucker Carlson called him) was shot in the chest with his hands in the air. Another Black man was ‚Äúmistakenly‚Äù shot with a gun instead of a taser (one is orange plastic and weighs 6 ounces, the other shiny black metal and weighs about a pound). And a 15-year old Black girl fighting against grown women in the street, who called the police for help, was shot 4 times by a policemen within 10 seconds of him arriving. Blacks, whether in Congress or on the street, have every right to urge support for their cause, and I wouldn‚Äôt begrudge any white people who support their cause either. It‚Äôs not the same as urging supporters to attack our foundations of Democracy, or to go into mostly BLM protests and turn them into riots.
Ex-President Trump spent 6 months whipping his white racist extremists into a frenzy, urging them to attack the Capitol and interrupt the business of the Senate, hoping for the ability to turn it into emergency rule. And yet, he‚Äôs not in jail. And, what, about 50 or so members of the House and Senate are STILL claiming, without any proof whatsoever, that the election was stolen and Trump really won. They are trying to claim that the Jan 6th rioters were ‚Äúpeaceful family men‚Äù even though several policemen were killed and around 50 injured. The crown of Democracy, our peaceful transfer of power, now has the Trump stink on it. What‚Äôs even worse, is that it was just a blatant grab for money by Trump, and his supporters were betrayed by Trump‚Äôs lies. But don‚Äôt worry, Trump and many of his followers will go to prison for their insurrection. The FBI already has about 500 of them, probably some who used to follow your website. These days ‚Äúconservative‚Äù is generally synonymous with ‚Äúracist‚Äù, whether it‚Äôs attacking BLM, demonizing Democrats that support the rights of minorities, or Republicans that make excuses for the right-wing racist extremists.Artwork of the Month - October 2012

About the Artist
The British landscape artist and printmaker, Rigby Graham grew up in Leicester attending the city's College of Art and Design in 1949. Throughout his career he travelled widely, capturing the spirit of a place through his painting and printmaking. His desire to travel developed young, visiting France, Switzerland and then Ireland when only sixteen. In the mid-1950s he visited the Bailiwick and this painting of Chateau de Pezeries painted in 1982 shows that these islands were a draw long after that initial visit.
It was in the late 1950s that Graham began to be interested in printing and graphic design, teaching in the Printing School of Leicester College of Art. He found success as an illustrator, creating illustrations for publications such as Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus.
Graham's ability to turn his hand to various artistic genres and mediums continued to develop and while visiting Sicily began work as a muralist. During the 1960s and 1970s most of his work focused on book illustrations. He did continue to paint however, basing himself for short periods in Corsica, Crete and Ireland. Islands, large and small attracted Graham, the coastline and the unique quality of each one providing ever-changing visual possibilities.Bathroom

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The. But the embassy refused to identify the buyer or disclose the sale price of the sprawling beachfront compound in the upscale Tel Aviv suburb of Herzliya..
The Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, has called the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to move the embassy ‚Äúshort-sighted and frivolous,‚Äù but he has said he would not move it back to Tel Aviv if elected president in November.
The U.S. Embassy has only said the buyer submitted the ‚Äúhighest and best offer.‚Äù Under the deal, Ambassador David Friedman, a driving force in the move of the embassy, will continue living at the estate until the spring of 2021, with the U.S. government leasing the property until then.
The Israeli business newspaper Globes has identified the buyer as Adelson, a strong supporter of both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It said the price was over $80 million, making it the most expensive residential real-estate transaction in Israeli history. Representatives for Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate, did not respond to messages seeking comment.
A congressional aide said the State Department has confirmed public reports of the sale to Adelson. The aide said the ‚Äúbiggest question‚Äù now is how much rent will be paid by U.S. taxpayers while Friedman remains at the property. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private information.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has submitted several requests for information from the State Department about whether the sale followed regulations, the aide said.
Among the questions: whether a real-estate broker was used and an independent appraisal of the property was conducted. The panel also wants to know whether the agent had any political ties.
Federal regulations often provide wide discretion for such arrangements and it‚Äôs unclear if the rental agreement violates any regulations, the aide said. But if the rent being charged is above or below market rate, it would raise concerns, the aide said.
Senators from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have requested a briefing from the State Department, according to a Senate Democratic aide, who requested anonymity to discuss the situation.
The State Department has said the buyer was selected solely on the basis of having submitted the highest and best offer. The selected buyer and the unsuccessful bidders have been notified, the department said.
However, the State Department also said it is not at liberty to comment on the details related to contracts underway with private entities.
The Trump administration moved the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, shortly after recognizing Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital. The move is one of several steps the administration has taken in favor of Israel, and led the Palestinians to cut off ties with the White House.
Nearly all foreign delegations have their embassies in Tel Aviv because of Jerusalem‚Äôs contested status. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future state. Israel‚Äôs annexation of east Jerusalem, home to the city‚Äôs most sensitive religious sites, is not internationally recognized.

Federman reported from Jerusalem. Associated Press Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.The international Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway is scheduled for a trial first-ever freight deliveries to nearby Russia sometime in September by a Turkish logistics company.
‚ÄúThere is currently transportation of over 40 million tons of freight between Turkey and Russia,‚Äù the Anadolu Agency quoted Islam Shakhbandarov, a member of the board of Pacific Eurasia Logistics, as saying on Friday, who pointed out that 80 percent of bilateral trade is conducted by sea and only 20 percent by land.
‚ÄúTo date, rail transport has not used for transportation between the two countries. The cooperation we will make with Russian Railways Logistics will contribute to both the region's countries as well as trade, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises in Turkey,‚Äù Shakhbandarov added.
The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway is 826 km (513 mi.) of tracks that run from Baku, Azerbaijan through the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, before ending in Kars in eastern Turkey. Russia lies just north of the Georgian and Azerbaijani borders, making overland trade with southwestern Russia possible.
The BTK cuts the delivery time for goods traveling between Europe and Asia to two weeks, down from what otherwise would take a month by rail and 40-45 days by sea. The line has been dubbed the Iron Silk Road, referring to the ancient and famous trade and transportation corridor known as the Silk Road.
Shakhbandarov expressed confidence that the BTK will positively impact trade within the South Caucasus region. Trade between Turkey and Georgia is, according to Shakhbandarov, projected to increase to 500,000 tons in two years.
‚ÄúSome 140,000 tons of freight were carried in a year and a half. Our aim is to increase this figure to one million tons in a year and to five million tons in the medium term,‚Äù Shakhbandarov said. ‚ÄúOne of the fastest ways to reach these goals that Turkey and Russia set in trade is through the development of logistics alternatives and supply chains.‚Äù
Shakhbandarov said that these measures will make a significant contribution to the employment in those regions and Turkey‚Äôs export, as well as allow cargo coming from Russia‚Äôs far east seaports such as Vladivostok move westward, ultimately linking the Russian railway grid to that in Turkey for the first time.
BTK first gained access to Russia‚Äôs eastern ports when officials from the state railway services of Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey signed a trilateral memorandum of understanding in Ankara in May.
There are currently five seaports and two cargo terminals operating in Russia‚Äôs east, which are linked to railways in Vladivostok and Birobidjan that traverse the world‚Äôs largest country and cut through Kazakhstan.
The BTK railway, which went into operation in 2017, forms part of China‚Äôs mega-logistics project known as the Belt and Road Initiative. The global network of railways, roads and sea lanes will connect east Asia and Africa with markets in Europe.Greetings! My partners and I got this homework.

Our data is paired end reads from mother, father and daughter (R1 and R2 of each), by mapping the 3 sets, compare to a proper reference genome and with the right strategies find sites with strong evidence of polymorphism. Utilize VCF for analyzing SNPs, indel, MNP, complex (multiple internal alternative alleles), and the number of the 5 genes with the most polymorphic sites. Including results only when probabilities of a false positive are 1 on 10000 of the Qual column on VCF
Ok.. we found this link with the steps.. \ the workflow is on the link ()
Step 1, step 2 and step 3 are completed by now. Can someone please give a brief explanation of why each step is made in stage 1? (stage 2 is pretty clear though). And how to utilize our data.
Thanks..
Identify DNA polymorphic sites
*This page includes description about analyses of DNA polymorphic sites of father-mother-child sequencing samples:
step 1: load data - the data are loaded from local files, set "fastqsanger" format and "hg19" database on the starting page
step 2: check quality of all sequencing files - use FastQC tool (version: 0.63) to check quality of the sequencing
step 3: mapping - use BWA-MEM tool (version: 0.1) to map sequence to reference genome (choose hg19 as reference), paired end
step 4: add or replace read groups - label each group (the mapping file) using AddOrReplaceReadGroup (version: 1.126.0)
step 5: merge 3 individual mapping files - use MergeSamFiles (version: 1.126.0)
step 6: filter - using filter tools: Filter (version: 1.126.0, remove low quality mapping), MarkDuplicates (version: 1.126.0, filter out duplicated mapping), CleanSam (version: 1.126.0)
step 7: identify polymorphic sites - using FreeBayes tool (version: 0.4) to identify polymorphic sites base on hg19 genome
step 8: filter out false positive sites - using VCFfilter (version: 0.0.3) to select sites where the chance of a false positive call is 1 in 10,000 or better.
step 9: extract workflow and download final vcf file for further analyses.
Stage 2 - analyze data of polymorphic sites based on vcf file
step 10: load data - set format as "vcf", genomic database as hg19
step 11: identify number of snp, mnp, del, ins or complex - using VCFfilter tool (version:0.0.3 ) to select different types of polymorphism (for example: -f "TYPE = snp", select snp only), then using Filter tool (version: 1.1.0) to find duplicated polymorphisms
step 12: identify genes with polymorphic sites - using ANNOVAR Annotate VCF tool (version: 0.1) to annotate the vcf file in step 10
step 13: count polymorphic sites for each gene - using Group tool (version: 2.1.0, by gene name) to count number of polymorphic sites for each gene
step 14: sort results in step 13 using Sort tool (version: 1.0.3, by descending).* ...................................Is equity release taxable?
08/05/2019
There‚Äôs one question that we hear often when it comes to retirement planning: is equity release taxable? Let‚Äôs find out where you stand and what you should look out for.
Is equity release taxable?
Whether you choose to take the funds as a lump sum, or drawdown the cash in smaller chunks, you don‚Äôt have to pay tax on the funds released from the equity in your home. That can come as a big relief to people who are approaching retirement and searching for ways to enhance their savings pot.
But tax isn‚Äôt the only thing to consider when you are contemplating equity release.
What about the interest on equity release?
With equity release you pay interest on the amount you borrow. Typically this is added to the loan and settled once the arrangement terminates. Because this interest is compounded it can add up fast, especially if the rate of interest is high. If you live for many years beyond your equity release, you could find yourself repaying far more than the sum you originally released.
Traditionally this interest is repaid once the borrower dies or moves into long term care accommodation. The lender will sell your home and deduct their share from the proceeds. However, there are now equity release products that allow you to repay some or all of the interest while you are still occupying your property.
Questions about equity release? Ask us anything.
Equity release could impact your benefits entitlement
A key point to note is that triggering equity release could impact your entitlement to state benefits. That‚Äôs because the money generated by your equity release could push you over the allowable income or capital thresholds that are used to determine whether you qualify for benefits.
The affected benefits are those that are means-tested. That includes pension and savings credit, council tax reduction, income support, care funding, income support and jobseekers allowance.
Equity release: a small part of a big picture
The conversation surrounding equity release includes far more than your tax liabilities. With many different options to consider, making the wrong decisions can be costly. Given that equity release is most likely part of your retirement planning, failing to study your options wisely isn‚Äôt worth the risk.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always best to talk to an independent financial adviser before committing yourself. As independent wealth management experts ‚Äì not to mention members of the Equity Release Council ‚Äì Prydis is uniquely placed to talk you through your options and help you find the best equity release products for your specific circumstances.

I see from the Robofab docs that
RFont.update()doesn't do anything outside Fontlab. So how do you trigger an equivalent UI refresh in Robofont?
(BTW, note that many existing Fontlab scripts call
RFont.update(). For forward-compatibility, perhaps it makes sense for
RFont.update()to have the same effect on the Robofont UI.)
there is a
myFont.update():)
that is posting a font is changed notification to all the subscribed objects
see
(just seeing that the
glyph.update()is not listed in the docs, will add this as well)
OK, then here's an example illustrating my confusion:
import robofab.world f = robofab.world.CurrentFont() g = f["A"] for n in range(0,54): g.rotate(10) f.update()
I expect this code to rotate the A glyph 540 degrees in 10-degree increments, and that each step would be visible in the UI (because I'm calling
update()after each
rotate().)
Instead I only see the final state (a net rotation of 180 degrees). In other words, the code behaves as if
f.update()doesn't exist, and then the UI updates itself after the script exits.
So is there a flaw in
f.update(), or a flaw in my understanding of what it does?
mmm, when there are several requests to update a view close after each other, cocoa will ignore previous request and refresh / update the view only once.
but you can force the view to update / refresh:
import robofab.world f = robofab.world.CurrentFont() g = f["A"] collectionView = f.document().getGlyphCollection() view = collectionView.getGlyphCellView() # get the glyph cell view for n in range(0,54): g.rotate(10) g.update() view.display() # force the view to redisplay
hope you like the animation :)
I see what you mean Frederik, but I still think this is a flaw, for two reasons.
- The discrepancy between the behavior of
update()in Fontlab vs.
update()in Robofont reduces the portability of Robofab scripts and makes it harder to create modules that can be shared between environments. Robofab becomes incompatible with itself.
If Robofab-in-Robofont has some extras compared to Robofab-in-Fontlab, that's OK, because can ignore those if I need to. But I wouldn't expect major subtractions either.
RFont.update()is critical and frequently used in Robofab-in-Fontlab. Once I add extra code to make
update()work in Robofont the way it did in Fontlab, then I can't use that script in Fontlab anymore.
- More broadly, an environment like Robofont that's built with a focus on scripting should always defer to the scripter. For instance, if I'm making valid
update()requests in the script, why should Cocoa "ignore" them? OK, Cocoa thinks it will be slow. But why does Cocoa get to have an opinion? If it runs slow, that's my problem. Maybe I have my reasons for wanting it that way. It should be WYSIWYG ‚Äî What You Script Is What You Get. There should never be situations where lines of script are getting silently ignored.
(BTW, the animation is very exciting of course, but
update()has a real practical function, which is to give visual feedback during multi-step operations. It is an excellent debugging and status-reporting tool.)
I can't answer for RoboFont, but I can explain what is happening at the lower levels in defcon and defconAppKit. I can also give a little background on the history of the update method.
First, the background: the update method in FontLab is purely a UI refresher. When you make a change to the data, the data is changed but the UI is not. For many scripters, this creates a pretty big problem because if update isn't called, the UI is out of sync with the data. That's bad. If you look at the RoboFab docs and examples, you'll see lots of things like
# don't forget to call update!Those are there because we had lots of complaints. The update methods weren't part of RoboFog's scripting API and that's what we were trying to mimic. Almost all of the scripters were familiar with that API (and things happening there automatically) and that made the update calls quite foreign and a source of many complaints. We spent a lot of time trying to make the updates happen automatically, but we never got any responses to our requests to FontLab for information about the optimal times to refresh. For a very short period, we had update happening automatically whenever any data was changed. This was known as the OMG THIS IS SO SLOW version of RoboFab.
To make the RoboFab API consistent, we implemented the update method in the base objects as:
def update(self): pass
It has been that way in NoneLab for a long time.
When I wrote defcon, I wanted to do things in a modern way that allowed for code to be much more flexible and much faster. defcon uses the observer pattern (concept: implementation:) for keeping data and representations in sync in an abstract way. When you make a change to a defcon object, the object posts notifications through a font level notification dispatcher. Other objects that have subscribed to
(object, notification)pairs will receive the notifications. It makes everything very lightweight and very fast. The various defconAppKit (an extension of vanilla) views use the notification system to be alerted of font object changes. When particular notifications are posted, defconAppKit notices and schedules things to be redrawn the next time Cocoa gives the views permission to redraw. Cocoa does this following its own rules. There are ways to hack into Cocoa to force it to redraw at a precise time, but those are frowned upon. I think this has more to do with the general drawing system that OS X uses than it is that Apple thinks that their code is much faster than everyone else.
It's interesting that you say that this need to update the UI immediately is so critical. In all my years of working on and with RoboFab in FontLab I've never seen a script that needed to update the way that you describe. Do you have a lot of these kinds of scripts?
Because
.update()is a method that was added to RoboFab to work around FontLab UI bugs, I don't think that it's fair to assume that it should work the same way in an environment where those UI bugs don't exist.
If you want to match the behavior of FontLab's
.update()in RoboFont, you can put a test in your script for the enviroment the script is running in (
robofab.world.inFontLabor
robofab.world.inRoboFont) and use
view.display()if the script is running in RoboFont.
I thought of a way that this could be done in the font and glyph objects. Here is the font object version:
def update(self): document = self.document for windowController in document.windowControllers(): window = windowController.window() contentView = window.contentView() contentView.displayIfNeeded()
(Not tested, but it should work. I think. Maybe.)
Is this a good idea? I don't know. It could slow down lots of scripts for the sake of one script.
works!
but it will never make it into RF, sorry :)
import time def update(font): document = font.document() for windowController in document.windowControllers(): window = windowController.window() contentView = window.contentView() contentView.displayIfNeeded() f = CurrentFont() g = f["A"] s = time.time() for angle in range(0, 360, 15): g.rotate(angle) update(f) print time.time() - s s = time.time() for angle in range(0, 360, 15): g.rotate(angle) f.update() print time.time() - s
(with a font window open, glyph window open and Space Center open)
For such a simple task it takes one 1 sec more to update.
>>> 1.04617500305 >>> 0.0473890304565
So this is not a good plan unless you realllllyy like coffee or having days with 25 hours or when the sun is turning half speed....
if this is the case you can install a script during startup that add an observer to a
fontChangednotification and updates all the possible windows and views.
My understanding of why
RFont.update()exists & how to use it was gleaned entirely from the Robofab docs & examples. Some Robofabbers may use it more, some less. But it is part of the standard Robofab-in-Fontlab scripting idiom. If you followed the Robofab docs, your scripts rely on it.
(Tal, since you ask, one example of a script that "needs to update the UI immediately" is EVB's accent builder example on the Robofab site. () And I try to learn from the master.)
As a matter of policy, having
update()do nothing in NoneLab makes logical sense because there is no UI to update.
Likewise, my comment is also one of policy: now that Robofab is in another UI environment, how should
update()behave? Does it matter that it behaves differently than it did in the previous UI environment?
Ben says no, because
update()was designed to accommodate FL and I can test for FL in the script. A fair point, but there's another dimension to the problem. The
update()command gives Robofab-in-Fontlab a nice modular division between the Robofab layer and the Fontlab UI layer. Everything gets encapsulated into the
update()command. I don't have to worry about the specifics. Maybe this was an unintentional result, but to the extent that one of Robofab's goals is to insulate me from the FL object model, I always thought it was deliberate.
Above, Frederik showed me how to work with view objects and
view.display()to do my updates. That's fine as far as it goes, but it lacks modularity. I've got a script that would be happy if it could just be in the business of manipulating Robofab objects. Now it has to get into the business of manipulating Robofont UI objects too.
As a scripter, it's not that I mind manipulating UI objects. It's just that ideally, I'd like to avoid mixing UI stuff with data stuff, because it won't scale. For instance, what happens when folks start releasing scripts with new UI widgets? Now my data-manipulation script has to get updated to work with those widgets too. (Tal, perhaps your proposed approach is forward-compatible in that way.)
Nor am I saying that Robofont or defcon does it "wrong".
Again, it's a policy question of how to expose the Robofont UI to scripts, whether to be consistent with FL, or whether to invent a 3rd idiom (i.e., require Robofab-in-Robofont scripters to take more of an interest in Robofont UI objects).
Matthew:
With all apologies, I don't think that this is a policy question.
I think that we can agree that
.update()in both FontLab and RoboFont and Glyphs (for all I know) updates the UI. Code with
.update()works in both FontLab and RoboFont, with the result that at the end of a script, the UI is updated for the font or glyph that it is called on.
In FontLab, it happens that if you call
f.update(), FontLab will refresh the UI for each incremental change if it is called in a loop. This, from a speed of the application viewpoint, is a really dumb thing to do, as it slows everything down to molasses speed (see Frederik's timing and Tal's comment about when RoboFab was too liberal with
.update()‚Äî and, if you've used UFO export in FontLab through RoboFab before the
.update()s were taken out, you know that doing so could mean a nice coffee break). The only use of this 'feature' of FontLab, which you mention, that I can see would be for testing one's script. After the testing stage, one would just want their script to run, and run as quickly as possible. Frederik has demonstrated code that one could insert into a script for testing, much like how one inserts several print statements when testing a script, then takes them out when things are working.
You pointed to Erik van Blokland's build accent script, which calls
.update()so that FontLab will refresh the UI and show all the built accents. This script will work the same way in RoboFont, as
.update()will also update the UI. Things work well in both applications. I believe, that what Tal, and for that matter, I, am curious about, is a example where a script depends on showing the UI update for each point in a loop, not just needing to update when all transformations are finished.
I think that we can agree that FontLab isn't always the most consistent of applications, and that a view of consistency of RoboFab meaning that it needs to behave, bugs and all, 100% exactly like RoboFab in FontLab, even if the end result is the same, is both impractical and akin to asking every single web browser to behave just like IE6.
The end result of a
.update()is the same, which is all I think one can expect and ask for. If
.update()'s end result was different in different applications, this would be a problem for RoboFab, but this is not the case here.
Fair enough. At the moment, I don't have another script in my back pocket that illustrates the need for incremental UI updates. If I come across one, I will post it. Like I say, mostly I have used the feature for status reporting and debugging.
As for
update(), my only remaining question is when it actually makes a difference in a Robofont script. For instance, this code snippet (adapted from the EVB script) works the same way with or without the calls to
update().
from robofab.world import CurrentFont f = CurrentFont() for k in ["A", "B", "C", "D"]: f[k].mark = 100 f.update()
from robofab.world import CurrentFont f = CurrentFont() for k in ["A", "B", "C", "D"]: f[k].mark = 100

thanks for proving it yourself! ;)
as stated in the documentation
.update()only tells the UI that your object has changed.

off topic:
I've just edited your post and added
<pre>bla bla bla</pre>for none-editors and none-admins
Matthew:
My guess as to why it's working the same way (Frederik can confirm) is that RoboFont is smarter about updating the UI than FL is. You'd want to use
.update()in the case you want to be absolutely sure the UI updates, and/or your script needs to run in both RoboFont and FontLab, and need it in there to force the FontLab UI to update.
Best,
Ben
Thanks Ben. You impliedly make a good case that my goal of having FL & RF compatible scripts is impractical. There is something to be said for just rebuilding Robofont-optimized versions.
As for
update()in the middle of a script, my idiomatic use for this technique in Fontlab was when I was working with Robofab pens, specifically scripts that attempted to do pen operations on hundreds of glyphs at a pull. Of all Robofab operations, I found that pens were the most likely to awaken the FL crash monster.
The traditional behavior of FL when it encounters a script error is to hang. So relying on a UI update at the end of the script to show me status didn't work, because it never got there. So I got in the habit of calling
update()during the loops. This was slower, but when FL would hang, I could at least see how far it had gotten, giving some clues about why the script was failing, and whether the error was due to my own abuse of Robofab (which I could fix) or Fontlab's arbitrary refusal to continue (which I could not).
Clearly, Robofont has a better work ethic about finishing scripts.
Matthew:
Two quick things: I don't think that
.update()will slow down RoboFont, as you demonstrated it's smart about updating when need be, so having this in for FontLab won't impact RoboFont.
Second, sometimes a quicker way to do what you wanted with update in FontLab is to just have a print statement for each iteration of a loop. You'll get a running list of what's been done, so you'll know what happens before a crash, even if the glyph your script is working on isn't visible in the font window.
Best,
Ben
a quick tip if you a really, really want to debug in FL:
redirect the stdout and stderr to a file instead if printing it into FLs output window, cause can FL can quit unexpectedly.
import sys f = open(u"/Users/frederik/Desktop/FLlog.txt", "w") savedstdout = sys.stdout savedstderr = sys.stderr sys.stdout = f sys.stderr = f print "hello world" f.close() sys.stdout = savedstdout sys.stderr = savedstderr
This will also work in RoboFont off course!! your scripts will still be exchangeable.
another tip:
visual debugging is in most cases a bad idea.... or you should make a .png, .pdf that you can review afterwards. Use DrawBot or the tinyDrawBot extension (will released when 1.2 is out)
In all my years of working on and with RoboFab in FontLab I‚Äôve never seen a script that needed to update the way that you describe.
UFOCentral also relies on this technique, no? When I used it the other day, the glyphs and layers flashed before my eyes as I exported them. (Though I understand that UFOCentral is superfluous inside of Robofont.)
The macro point is that stdout/stderr is useful for debugging only when you can describe the status accurately in text. For instance, plenty of times in FL I've used a pointPen to copy an outline from one font to another, only to find out it's been turned into crumpled space junk along the way. But as far as Robofab or FL was concerned, the pen operation reported no errors.
Therefore, to rely on stdout/stderr only, you'd have to add in an extra step where you programmatically compare the expected and actual result, so the status can be reported accurately ("oops, you got space junk"). Sometimes that's easy to do (e.g., making a straight duplicate) but sometimes not (where there's a transform happening in between).
Either way, you're adding new debugging code, which a) will slow your script (no big deal) and b) may itself have bugs in it (very big deal). For complicated pen operations, your debugging code would have to essentially reimplement the pen. Or you'd need to do something ritzy like apply your pen operation into the actual target glyph, and then also a buffer glyph, and compare the results. But it creates a spiraling need to debug the debugger. So what is the advantage of visual debugging? Like stdout and stderr, it works without creating collateral complications.
Anyways, the vagaries of FL need not be hashed over here. My FL scripts all work fine ‚Äî I've already absorbed those slings & arrows. When I get to the point where Robofont's
update()is causing a more-than-theoretical problem, I will report back. In text.Patrick Blackburn is a Directeur de Recherche (Director of Research) for INRIA at LORIA (Nancy).

After our analysis about the vulnerability disclosures this week on AnandTech, and continuing discussions on Twitter, TechTeamGB, a Great Britain based Youtube technology channel, invited Senior Editor Ian Cutress on the Thursday show to discuss the recent news surrounding the AMDFlaws website, the ramifications of the announcement, the company behind the announcement, and what it means to the community at large.
Through the 96 minute discussion, Ian vocalised a lot of what has been covered on AnandTech already, and discussed some of the more esoteric claims in the wild that may or may not have elements of truth in them. This show was broadcast before posting our interesting call with CTS-Labs, the company behind the vulnerability disclosure, but has a number of snippets that are mirrored in that article.
A small Q&A from the TechTeamGB audience happens at the end of the show. The show is hosted by TechTeamGB Host, Andrew McDonald.

DrizztVD - Friday, March 16, 2018 - linkI have a tiny bit of experience in the computer security field. It usually irritated me how people would find ways to believe things that happen to help their pockets at the same time. You'd commonly hear a guy in the office saying something like: "I broke the system's security wiiiide open". Then, our red team guys, who would actually get paid to infiltrate a company right rough to the CEO's emails, would usually have a much more muted response. They know: only 1% of claimed "blow security right open" exploits actually end up suiting their needs. They run 1000s of exploits over more than a month to crack the system. Do you know what they do with the opened system then? They use it to build an internal employee/manager map so that they know who has the most valuable information in the company. Then, they will do a phishing attack on non-technical personal who have access to the end prize (CEO emails, or company account access, etc.) Any red team attack is 80% social engineering. ReplyWi-Fi
Wi-Fi is everywhere, but not all Wi-Fi is created equally secure. This page will deal with Wi-Fi in 3 places:
- At The Ohio State University
- At home
- In public places (restaurants, public libraries, car dealerships, etc.).
Be sure to keep reading to learn the basics of Wi-Fi encryption and why strong passwords are so imporant.
Using Wi-Fi at Ohio State
Ohio State provides wireless network services for Ohio State students, faculty, staff and guests.
- Osuwireless: Secure Wi-Fi to be used by students, faculty, and staff
- WiFi@OSU: open Wi-Fi network for guests and visitors
- eduroam: Secure Wi-Fi network that can be used by students and staff at Ohio State when they travel to other participating universities
It is important to understand how to set up Wi-Fi for use at home, at school, and in public places. A safe configuration is one where your data will remain private and protected when transmitted wirelessly. Ohio State provides a safe configuration for osuwireless that can be used by all students, faculty and staff.
Ohio State users should use the encrypted Wi-Fi, osuwireless, if possible. This network requires users to sign in with their university username and password.
Using Public Wi-Fi
At your favorite coffee shop (where he/she who controls the pumpkin spice controls the universe), you begin to settle into your hot beverage and homework. Without even thinking, you connect to the shop‚Äôs free, open Wi-Fi and begin to study. Suddenly, you remember that you have to pay your utility bill (not a big deal, since these days we can pay for everything online). You mosey over to the bank‚Äôs webpage and sign in to check your account‚Äôs funds. Then you finally post the payment by entering your debit card into the utility company‚Äôs payment process page.
You've just made yourself vunerable to an attacker who can now access your banking details, and you suddenly no longer have funds for that utility bill. How ‚Äúfree‚Äù is that Wi-Fi now? protections to their users (seriously, do you ever read those disclaimers?)..
Public Wi-Fi is susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This is where an attacker can sit between you and the Wi-Fi access point, intercepting all the data that is sent and received. These malicious actors can ‚Äúsniff‚Äù out passwords, account numbers, credit card numbers, etc.
In a public space, we don‚Äôt recommend users connecting to public Wi-Fi access points unless they are trusted and managed appropriately (such as osuwireless, which is secure and only available to the university community). Instead, please consider using something like a personal cellphone or cellular hotspot. This ensures that your data is protected through your carrier and that there are no third parties intercepting your data. If you have no choice but to use public Wi-Fi, we recommend these mitigating actions when using public Wi-Fi:
- Always choose secured public Wi-Fi over unsecured.
- Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to protect your privacy
- Don‚Äôt log into password protected sites (such as banking, social media, school, etc.)
- Don‚Äôt shop online
- Turn off automatic connectivity on your device
But the bottom line is in a public space, we don‚Äôt recommend users connecting to public Wi-Fi access points unless they are trusted and managed appropriately
Using remote.
- Disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS).
- Use the best/latest encryption available.
- Keep the router‚Äôs firmware updated (turn auto-updates if available).
Wi-Fi Encryption: Simplified
Wi-Fi encryption is what keeps your data safe. Encryption, through algorithms and complicated mathematics, is the method to code plaintext data into unintelligible gibberish (known as cipher text) that is:
- Reversible by only the intended recipient and
- Completely secure (ideally); almost certainly more secure than unencrypted data.
To encrypt literally means to ‚Äúput into a tomb‚Äù (that is designed to prevent intrusion/looting unless your name is Indiana Jones).
Encryption keeps people from reading plaintext data and helps ensure that your data is not seen by unauthorized outsiders. Examples of plaintext data include:
- Passwords
- Credit Card numbers
- Tokens
- Pretty much anything you‚Äôd wish to protect
Cryptography can be a very complex subject. This example is a very simplified explanation of what cryptography does. Imagine writing a saucy letter to a love interest. You don‚Äôt want anybody else to know the content of the letter, so you devise a method to write a secret code in a way that the other person can undo and read intelligibly. This method is not shared with anybody else (think of this as your Wi-Fi Password). The purpose is to be able to communicate without allowing outsiders to decode and understand the details of the letter.
When using Wi-Fi, use the strongest encryption available. Currently, WPA3 is the strongest encryption available, but only on some late-model routers. On the rest, WPA2 + AES is acceptible, and we recommend using it. The rankings of encryptions based on strength are as follows:
- WPA3 (Strongest!)
- WPA2 + AES
- WPA2 + AES/TKIP (TKIP is used when AES cannot be used)
- WPA2 + TKIP (TKIP is used when AES cannot be used)
- WPA + TKIP
- WEP (WEP is little better than completely unsecured)
- None
Wi-Fi passwords are important, too! (Ohio State.The Knowledge Resource Centre (KRC) or Library of CSIR-NBRI provides services and facilities to meet the S & T knowledge requirements of the Institute‚Äôs R & D activities. KRC operates with the following objectives to:

In designing my entities, I could not find the following data types (from available drop down list) for a field:
1. Lookup
2. Currency
Could someone advise me on where to look for the above mentioned data type?
I would appreciate your quick response.
Isaiah A.
Lookup type is available in legacy CDM migrated databases only, in new environments and CDS your entities have relationships now (see the tabs when designing an entity). The currency data type shows as an option in both versions for me.
Hi IsaiahA,
In my testing, I could find the Currency and the Lookup Data type:
If you need any further help on this, please post back.
Edited: Removed the old articles.
Regards
Hi Michael_Shao, the 'Lookup' data type cannot be chosen in new CDS databases, it is only available in the legacy migrated environment databases. You cannot find 'Lookup' data type in the dropdown in new environment databases.
Hello,
Please create a lookup relation in the relationship tab for the entity in the new environment. It will automaticaly create a lookup field for you.
Thanks
Hi DaveB,
Thanks for the remidings, I checked in the wrong environments. Apologizes.
In the new environment, the lookup type could be managed under the newly created entites, click into the entity, under relationship tab, click new relationship:
The currency is still listed under the fields.

Long ago, when I worked for a corporation, I knew that something wasn't right, something wasn't natural, and it involved what Henry David Thoreau had written over one hundred and fifty years ago - that the mass of men, live lives of quiet desperation. This was a conundrum swirling around what I label organic man and machine man. Machine Man, is a entity wedded to a high-tech, industrial world. The mind-altered machine man is the corporate mentality indoctrinated and dedicated to bottom-line profits. The mass of men fall into this category. But I survived the drones of manufacturing in this regard, escaped, and finally arrived at a point where I could return to the order of natural man.
Man's time does not exist in the atom, although he is intimately linked to atomic vibrations linked to their own clock - their own creation and destruction. In a sense, our solar system is an atom, the sun its nucleus. The galaxy is an atom, its nucleus a great swirling mass of electric plasma. And the universe: well, if we follow this logic then there must be multiple universes with power centers, the same as the solar system and galaxy. Man rushing to his mechanical clock has nothing to do with these celestial configurations. Man's contrived time permits him to catch the early train to the city. Natural flowing cosmic time says forget about that timing contraption on the night stand; get out of bed because the sun is up. There is something more profound about man than the division of daylight and darkness into increments to which he must march. How many people dread the alarm in the morning? How many look at their watch, the digital display, or lately, a read out on their cell phone, and think about the cosmic connection? How many marvel at the Fall leaf colors and ponder or are aware of the earth's pole tilt that makes this display possible as it moves around the sun - very, very few. How many work a night shift and constantly violate the natural order by disrupting their circadian sleep cycle?
Finding the meaning of Time is like finding the meaning of Meaning. The pursuit becomes abstract thought. Living in the desert country of the American southwest literally forces a person to adjust to a different clock. If you are retired in the southwest you discard man's Time and your life gradually revolves around the big red ball rising and setting on the landscape; you have switched to cosmic Time. The Hopi sitting on his adobe roof watching the sunrise - this is abstract thought intimate with cosmic Time.
Would a mechanical clock mean anything to a primitive sleeping in a cave or in the jungle? No, he or she, although unaware, is tuned to the cosmic timetable of the Mayan calendar. This calendar is cosmic the same as a place in England called Stonehenge. That's what the ending of the Mayan Great Year and 2012 is about. These two celestial clocks are tuned to the stars and probably share the Mayan Great Year that began in 3114 B.C.E. in Mesopotamia and ends in the year 2012.This page is one of several used in this demo site as an example for you to edit.

Project: Moovina
Category: Restaurant
Where: Jakarta, Indonesia
Series: Ambach System 900
Partner: Kasirano
Sophisticated and trend-setting, Moovina is the place to go when visiting Jakarta. In the heart of Plaza Indonesia, the most famous shopping mall of the city, Moovina is a dining and entertainment space that offers different settings, each one with its own clearly defined style for the ultimate customer experience. Le Jardin is a chic, welcoming oasis. Dolce is an Italian caf√© for a quick meal that offers pizza, pasta, salads and desserts. The Mezzanine is a seductive, fascinating French restaurant with an open kitchen and lounge space.
The Brief
- The Mezzanine serves an average of 180 meals per evening, and for events and private parties can serve up to 400 people.
- Chef Richard Gillets provides a rich and varied menu that mixes French dishes with Vietnamese grilled specialties and the kitchen had to accommodate this mix of cuisines.
- A sturdy, reliable and flexible kitchen was needed that can produce high productivity with exceptional quality.
- The need to cope with the restrictions imposed by the building‚Äôs regulations, permitting delivery of the kitchen equipment only after 10 o‚Äôclock in the evening.
- The necessity to provide on-site training for the correct use of the equipment, hygiene and maintenance.
The Solution
- Ambach worked closely with both the Moovina food and beverage Manager William Di Nardo and local distributor Kasirano, to come up with the ideal solution.
- Ambach proposed the System 900 Series to provide the solution for the required combination of high production, durability and quality.
- The experience of Ambach meant that we were able to combine units and custom modules into a one piece work top, that catered perfectly for the needs and cooking style of the chef, using both gas and induction.
- All cooking ranges were supplied complete with all wiring and piping, so that all equipment had a single point of connection for water, gas and electricity.
- To be able to transport the equipment by elevator and escalators, the whole range was completely dismantled and the upper and lower frames detached from the work top.
- Ambach supplied accurate documentation for each range assembly and our experienced technicians visit Jakarta regularly to conduct training on the correct use of the equipment, its cleaning and maintenance.It includes Windows OS and is powered by a quad-core Intel Atom processor, Intel HD Graphics, with 2GB RAM and 32GB of storage, plus built-in connectivity including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

Photo Credit :.
"The main problem now is lack of confidence among investors and this is getting reinforced every time by either data or events like S&P cutting rating outlook," said a senior RBI official who is not authorised to speak on record to the media.
"When risk aversion is high, the success rate of intervention is low and that is why we are seeing rupee at such low levels despite intervention," he added.
The rupee fell as much as 0.5 per cent immediately after S&P's move but has recovered much of that loss.
Still, it is down nearly 6 per cent since February, recording most of the drop in March and April as foreign investment dried up. It had touched a record low of 54.30 to the dollar in December.
India's balance of payments slipped into the red for the first time in three years in the December quarter as dollar inflows shrunk and imports soared.
It could worsen given India's need to import 80 per cent of its oil, high crude prices, and unhappy foreign investors.
Foreign investments into Indian stocks have swung into negative with an $545 million outflow in April from a robust $7.1 billion net inflow in February. Foreign direct investments fell to $2.2 billion in February from $5.7 billion in May 2011.
"Symbolic Significance"
These are some of the concerns that UBS took into account when it said it expects the rupee to test 56 per dollar this year.
"If we are right that the exchange rate takes its cues more from the capital account side till better fundamentals emerge then regulatory risk must rise in importance," UBS wrote in the note.
"In this respect (the) negative outlook on India sovereign credit by S&P may not have much immediate impact, but has great symbolic significance."
That leaves RBI in a bind. Selling dollars to defend the rupee without policy reforms provides only temporary respite and further reduces its reserves.
India's foreign reserves fell to around $295 billion on April 20 from about $321 billion on September 2, after the RBI sold dollars to prop up the currency.
The RBI is officially agnostic about the level of the currency but steps in to smooth volatility and took several administrative and market moves to defend it in late 2011.
The RBI has sold $20.14 billion in the spot market from September to February besides intervening in the forwards.
The country's foreign exchange cushion is dwindling. S&P figures India has reserves to cover about six months of current account payments, down from eight months in 2008 and 2009.
"We work only reactively when it comes to the currency. The proactive measures are to be taken by the government. Surely it will be a problem for us to control the currency if they (government) don't do so," said a second RBI official.
However, if S&P's move forces New Delhi to get its act together, then funds could return quickly, given India's robust long-term growth prospects.
New Delhi, embroiled in several corruption scandals, has put off foreign investors with recent plans to retroactively tax indirect investments and target tax havens. The Congress party-led government's bargaining power to push through key reforms like raising fuel prices and allowing foreign supermarket chains was further weakened after recent state election defeats.
"Economic activity is going on - we do not have lock-outs in factories. But government is not facilitating as it is too busy fire-fighting corruption, scams," said the third RBI official.
(Reuters)
The current account deficit is widening and a weak global investment climate coupled with policy paralysis in New Delhi, sticky inflation and slowing growth have increased the aversion of foreign investors to India, pushing the capital account into the red.!)

A day at the Beach‚Ä¶or at least some hours, combined with a little sight-seeing
We arrived late in the morning and were a bit disappointed about the cloudy sky in the middle of June. However, the clouds disappeared soon, and did not come back for the next four days. After having settled in our apartmhent in the quiet Calle Armagura (in a residential area, but within walking distance to the city center), we went shopping for groceries, which is quite easy with bakeries (my recommendation: ‚ÄúPanaderia Pasteleria Las Palmeras‚Äù ‚Äì great ‚Äúbaguette rustic‚Äù), greengrocers and supermarkets just around the corner. After a quick lunch our first aim was the city beach ‚ÄúMalaguena‚Äù ‚Äì after a rainy spring the opportunity to get to a beach is irresistible for central Europeans!
We combined the beach trip with a first glimpse at famous spots, like the Plaza de la Merced,
featuring the birth place of Picasso and his bronze statue, sitting on a bank in front of it:
Then we passed the nice, small alleys in the old town,
some street art,
a nice fountain,
and the cathedral:
We walked through the nice Parque de Malaga (see this nice little movie of the Parque de Malaga walk), passed the tourist port of Malaga and finally got to the beach:
Due to its vicinity to the city center, the ‚ÄúMalagueta‚Äù beach ‚Äì although not really nice, but rather dusty ‚Äì is frequented by lots of locals as well as tourists. However, the color of the water is alluringly turquois and blue, and people get in despite the rather low temperatures:
The evening was dedicated to the first taste of the well-known Spanish Tapas, and all the Tapas places that we tried during our stay were excellent. The choice of good Tapas Bars is huge, just check out Tripadvisor.
Nerja: ‚Äúbalcony of Europe‚Äù, cave and beach
We had managed to get a really good price for a rental car, and so we decided to explore some places nearby. We chose Nerja, and this turned out a great choice. First we visited the famous ‚ÄúBalcon of Europe‚Äù through the archway‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and were rewarded with an excellent view of the coast.
There‚Äôs a great 360¬∞ view:
And colorful flowers on the way:
Though the small beach next to the ‚ÄúBalcon de Europa‚Äùterrace looks tempting‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶we first visited the
‚ÄúCueva de Nerja‚Äù
the famous Nerja cave, the biggest stalactite and stalagmite cave I ever saw. Just have a look:
Sometimes concerts take place in the biggest of the cave halls, which must be really amazing.
Nerja Playa Burriana
After the cave we finally went to the nearby ‚ÄúPlaya Burriana‚Äù beach, a lot bigger and less crowded than the one at the ‚Äúbalcony of Europe‚Äù.
You can chose to rent sunbeds and umbrellas, or just have a lie-down on the sand. And watch the blue sky above the cliff‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and the waves, when they knock down even big guys.
Castillo de Gibralfaro
Our final day in Malaga was dedicated to the attractions in the city: we climbed the steep way up to the castle of Gibralfaro, enjoyed the great view from up there:
We walked the pathways on the fortress walls:
And here as movie: Castle walk
The castle is huge and provides many views of the walls and the city below:
‚Ä¶ and watched the squirrels in front of the castle entrance (courtesy of Andreas Braun):
On the way back to the city center we passed through the nice garden of Pedro Luis Alonso:
Coming into the modern tourist port, we passed the amazing cube of the Malaga Centre Pompidou:
and walked under the artfully shaded Passeo del Muelle Uno:
And finally, we visited the
Cathedral de Malaga
It looks already huge from the outside‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and in fact it is really huge inside.
Overall, Malaga is a nice place for an extended weekend stay, and could be easily combined with a longer stay somewhere on the Costa del Sol, like Marbella or Nerja.
And here‚Äôs my favorite recipe from Malaga, a typical dish: Patatas bravas
for 4 persons:
Potatoes:
4 medium sized potatoes
2-3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
salt and black pepper to taste
-> Peel and clean the potatoes, cut into small cubes (1-2 cm), mix with the olive oil, salt and pepper. Put the potato pieces on a baking tray and bake for approx.. 20 minutes at 250¬∞ C.
Garlic Aioli sauce:
1 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 egg yolks
4-5 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Salt and a little bit of black pepper
-> Place the 2 egg yolks in a bowl, pour slowly the olive oil in while constantly stirring. The result should be a creamy mayonnaise. In a mortar, crush the garlic cloves until paste-like texture. Add the garlic paste, lemon juice, salt and pepper ‚Äì ready!
Brava Sauce:
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 spanish pepper or spicy green chillies, de-seeded and diced
Knife point smoked paprika (if you like the smoked taste)
1 cup tomato puree
1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
Salt, black pepper, sugar
Heat a small nonstick frying pan, add the olive oil and gently fry the garlic and the diced pepper. Add the smoked paprika (if you like), sasilt, pepper, a bit of sugar and the tomato puree. Let it simmer for 10-15 minutes. Place the potatoes into a shallow bowl, topped up with Brava Sauce, on top of this Aioli and a little bit of freshly chopped parsley as decoration. Enjoy!

Find yourself. Know yourself. Artists create, they write or paint, dance or sing. The desire to create pushes and demands. But the vocation, if allowed, creates you. It is a rendering. With time, you become what is meant. You are the creation. The vocations makes you.
So, what happens when you are called to a vocation AND have the heart of an artist? Supremacy lies with which force? The police officer or the pianist? The teacher or the soprano? The mother or the ballerina? The doctor or the writer?
When you are the Master‚Äôs creation, the Master rules supreme. Submit. Allow. Be rendered. And in the force of that creation, the sparks for you own creative flow arise. If it is in you, it will rise. Fruition.
Pause and savor the vocation. The call to serve. To help. To be clever. To be smart. To lead. To care. To listen. And, carved between heart beats and inhalations, liver margins and patellar reflexes, you offer solace and shelter. When the rhythm flows, your own creative urge emerges.
Honor the vocation by being creative. Stay open. Listen for the whispers. Acknowledge the flow. Identify the signs and name them. Claim them. And render your own world into your creation.

Miscellaneous
I suggest you try this quick and easy cake recipe, for which you do not need a mixer. It comes out delicious and fragrant, suitable for lovers of honey cakes. Source here.
You need:
for countertop:
3 eggs
200 g sugar (I put 150 g)
1 teaspoon baking soda
150 g honey (about 1/2 cup)
200 ml cream
280 g flour (2 cups)
1/2 walnut kernel, optional (I didn't put)
for cream:
500 ml cream
sugar to taste (I put about 3 tablespoons on top)
vanilla
optional, ground walnut kernels
a shape 24 cm in diameter, lined with baking paper
In a bowl, beat the eggs with the sugar and baking soda with a spoon, then add the honey and cream. After stirring a little, add the flour, mixing until the lumps disappear. Pour the dough into the prepared form, then bake in a hot oven over medium to low heat. Attention: the countertop grows quite strong when baked and tends to brown quite a lot, due to the honey in the composition. Therefore, it will be checked from time to time, and if the surface is browned, but inside the countertop is raw, cover the tray with foil or baking paper, and reduce the heat. The worktop is ready when, at the touch of a finger, the surface recovers immediately.
Move the top on a grill and leave to cool.
Mix the cream with the sugar and beat lightly until it dissolves. Vanilla is added.
After the countertop has cooled, cut it to thickness in 2 or 3 and assemble the cake on a plate. If desired, sprinkle with ground walnuts, go straight here.
Decorate according to preferences
and leave to cool for at least 2 hours.

Pour the sunflower oil and water, then add the wheat flour mixed with baking powder and poppy seeds. At the end, add the egg white foam. Mix well.
Pour the dough into a tray lined with baking paper. Bake the dough at a temperature of 180 degrees for about 30 minutes. We do the toothpick test.

Beat the butter and add it to the cold pudding. Mix well until you get a smooth cream.
Pour the juice from the cherry compote into a pot. Add water and boil the juice. After it boils, take it off the heat, add the jellies and let it dissolve. When the jelly starts to harden, add the cherries.
Cut the cold top into two equal parts. Spread vanilla cream on the first half of the dough. Pour the cherry jelly on top and cover it with the second top. Melt the chocolate in a bain-marie and pour it over the second counter.
We put the cake in the fridge for a few hours, after which we can cut it and serve it with our loved ones. Good appetite and increase cooking!
Pandispan with cherries and poppy seeds - Recipes

10 g granulated gelatin (1 sachet)
almond essence (optional)
200 ml cream for whipped cream 38%
10 g granulated gelatin (1 sachet)
200 ml cream for whipped cream 38%
Method of preparation :
Cherry jelly : Hydrate the gelatin in 50 ml of cold water and leave it to boil the cherries. Peel the cherries and put them in a saucepan with the sugar, over medium heat, for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes, then add hydrated gelatin. Mix well, then porridge them with the vertical blender.
Wet with cold water a round shape of cake (d = 23 cm), then cover it with cling film, pour the soft jelly and refrigerate for about 30 minutes (until the jelly hardens).
Cream : we hydrate the gelatin in 50 ml of cold water for 10 minutes, we mix the cream cheese a little with the powdered sugar, we add the yoghurt with cherries, the cherry jam, mixing lightly, then the cream for whipped cream, foam, hydrated and melted gelatin without boiling it almond essence (optional).
Divide the obtained cream into 2: one part we spread it over the jelly, we place a layer of biscuits, the rest of the cream and we cover with biscuits. Put the cake in the fridge in the evening until morning or for at least 4 hours, then turn it upside down on a plate. The biscuits are softened by the cream, so they should not be passed through milk or juice.
decoration : mix the sour cream foam for the whipped cream, then add the sugar. We form motions over the cake with the help of the spirit. At the top of each whipped cream we put a cherry.

ingredients required are:
7 eggs, 7 tablespoons sugar, 7 tablespoons flour, 1 handful of cherries, vanilla essence.
Preparation:
Separate the 7 eggs. In the mixer bowl, beat the egg whites with the 7 tablespoons of sugar in a row. When we have finished with the sugar, we start to add, one by one, the 7 yolks and at a certain moment we add the vanilla essence to taste. After we have incorporated the yolks, we start to put in the flour, little by little mixing lightly, with movements from the bottom up with a wooden spoon or plastic pallet. We do this until all the flour is finished. The composition for the countertop is ready, it can be put in a tray covered with baking paper. On top put the washed cherries, cleaned of seeds and over which I threw a flour powder (this will keep them on the surface of the countertop). Put in the preheated oven at approx. 160-170 degrees until the countertop is baked. The toothpick test can be done. Remove from the oven, powder with powdered sugar and leave to cool. Cake not cut immediately after removing from the oven no matter how good it smells :)):

8 to 10 Feet on Center, can be held to any size with summer pruningWhiting, Ind. ‚Äì December 8, 2015 ‚Äì When summer rolls around, Oil City Stadium will be a good place for Eastern Illinois baseball fans to receive a glimpse of the program‚Äôs future.
Panthers‚Äô catcher Zack Forney has been added to the 2016 Oilmen roster, becoming the third member of the school‚Äôs current freshman class to agree to play for Northwest Indiana‚Äôs Midwest Collegiate League club.
Eastern Illinois, a Division I Ohio Valley Conference program, is attempting to rebound from a 13-36 season that led to the departure of longtime coach Jim Schmitz. First-year head coach Jason Anderson believes the group of freshmen ‚Äì which includes Oilmen Forney, Jordan Flint and Jimmy Govern ‚Äì has the approach needed to help change the team‚Äôs fortunes.
‚ÄúNone of them like to lose,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre very focused on winning and they‚Äôre willing to do whatever it takes. That‚Äôs the kind of culture that we‚Äôre trying to establish as a team. These guys epitomize it. Every player has something that they have to work on. These guys really attack that hard and they want to be as good as they possibly can as fast as they can.‚Äù
Forney, a graduate of Cary-Grove High School and native of Cary, Illinois, was an all-conference player a year ago. He considers himself a defensive catcher and is continually working to polish his defensive game.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs accurate and he‚Äôs got a pretty good arm,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get him stronger over the course of the year, which is what we typically do with most freshmen. He doesn‚Äôt give up too many stolen bases.‚Äù
Forney spoke with EIU catcher Josh Turnock and pitcher Hunter Clark about their experiences while playing for the Oilmen during the 2015 season. Their recommendation coupled with the fact that it allowed Forney to stay close to home made the decision to play for the Oilmen an easy one.
Before the summer season begins, Forney and his Eastern Illinois teammates have a tall task at hand as they look to climb the OVC standings. The spring season gets underway on Feb. 19 at Southern Mississippi, while conference play cranks up against Austin Peay on March 3.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working our tails off,‚Äù Forney said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a lot of hard work. The culture is really changing and it‚Äôs a good program to be a part of right now. The culture is going to help give us a push to win a lot of games.‚Äù
Whether it‚Äôs in the spring at Eastern Illinois or in the summer sun at Oil City Stadium, when Forney is behind the plate, he plans to take the reins.
‚ÄúI take pride in being able to control the game,‚Äù Forney said. ‚ÄúControl the pitchers, control the running game with my arm and by trying to block every ball possible. I have to keep pitchers in their rhythm.‚Äù
The summer will provide a pivotal test for the EIU freshman trio, as they endure their first year of playing nonstop baseball from August to September.
‚ÄúIt wears your body down,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to get as many reps as possible during the summer. It gets them away from the college coaching staff and gets them into the hands of the summer coaches for a different perspective. It‚Äôll be good to let them play ball and hopefully get a taste of winning.‚ÄùThe call log is a list of all voice messages and calls that you have sent and received.

Straight Outta Compton‚Äôs box office debut was even bigger than originally thought.
The N.W.A. biopic brought in $60.2 million in its opening weekend, topping the $56.1 million estimate Universal initially reported Sunday. Even that first figure was enough to give the film the top spot at the weekend box office.
With that newly adjusted number, Straight Outta Compton now sits as the fifth biggest August opening ever, and the largest R-rated August opening in box office history. The film also earned the biggest opening ever for a musical biopic, with more than double what the previous record-holder, Walk the Line, opened to in 2005 ($22.3 million).
Compton‚Äôs box office numbers added to what‚Äôs already been a big year for Universal, which this weekend became the fastest studio to cross $2 billion domestically.

The Achilles tendon is not only the strongest, but also the largest tendon in the human body. The main function of the Achilles tendon is to transmit power from the calf muscles to the heel and the foot.
It‚Äôs because of the Achilles tendon that we are able to stand on our toes when walking, running, or jumping. Even with all of its strength, the Achilles tendon can be exposed to injury. Due to its limited blood supply and the high tensions placed on it, the Achilles heel can be left vulnerable if harmed.
Possible conditions that may arise due to injury of the Achilles tendon include tears, ruptures, tendinitis, peritendinitis, tendinosis, tendinopathy, and bursitis. When trying to diagnose if one has issues with their Achilles tendon, a podiatrist will commonly check for any pain, swelling, or discoloration around the heel or lower leg area. Different treatments for issues concerning the Achilles tendon vary, but may include over-the-counter or prescribed pain relievers for intense discomfort, alternating ice and heat therapy, custom-made orthotics,.Nick Lachey And Jessica Simpson Are Having A Gas Together
J-14 magazine caught up with Jessica Simpson to discuss the smelly habits she shares with hubby Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge burper!‚Äù, Jessica laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got lots of gas. I love burping and farting. I just think it‚Äôs funny.‚Äù The couple‚Äôs odor causing body functions have even become a game. ‚ÄúNick and I have farting contests all the time. It‚Äôs just something we do!‚Äù Simpson said. ‚ÄúThe second time we were together, he just ripped one and it was like‚Ä¶ this is normal to us. We laughed so hard.‚Äù
Nick Lachey Can‚Äôt Match Wife‚Äôs ‚ÄòNewlyweds‚Äô Success
March 16, 2004 ‚Äì With the success of Jessica Simpson‚Äôs re-released ‚ÄòIn This Skin‚Äô, her hubby Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees admits he‚Äôs frustrated that he hasn‚Äôt been able to attain the same success from ‚ÄòNewlyweds‚Äô. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been frustrating,‚Äù he told Details magazine. ‚ÄúFor Jessica, the show has translated into musical success. For me, it‚Äôs been a little bizarre. I‚Äôm now more recognized as the start of a reality-television program than as a musician.‚Äù
This headline is so misleading ‚Ä¶. Nick is only saying that things have been a little ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù. This is kind of a transitional phase for him. I can‚Äôt stand the fact that people keep trying to pit these two against each other professionally. There is always a little healthy competition, but lets get real here ‚Äì A win for Jess is a win for Nick ‚Äì THEY ARE A PACKAGE DEAL!
Jessica better grab all she can while she can. As self-centered as she‚Äôs coming off in this second season a lot of people I know including myself have stopped watching. She‚Äôll be fading away in a couple of years.
yeah, I stopped watching this season too. I used to really like her, but now she‚Äôs coming across as too spoiled and annoying. where she innocently made ditzy remarks the first season, it seems like she‚Äôs almost faking it this season.
I can‚Äôt agree more! When she started crying about her hair stylist, I was like, WTF??‚Äô, ‚ÄòAnd that stupid ‚ÄúI broke my kidney‚Äù comment? PUH-LEASE. Last season, she was funny, and they were cute‚Ä¶Now she tries to hard and has let the fame go to her head. Nick might end up getting tired of it, if she keeps acting this way =(
this is unfortunate, because I really think that Nick is more talented singer than his wife, he just hasn‚Äôt picked the right songs. His songs all pretty generic and sugary. I hope that he‚Äôll be rightly recognized for his musical talents soon, he deserves it. As for Jessica, she‚Äôs an idiot, and her fame is temporary. Newlyweds isn‚Äôt as popular this season as the last, so her days are numbered. I wonder how long the marriage will last? Competition puts considerable strain on a marriage.
Word has it that her success is definitely putting a strain on the marriage despite Lachey‚Äôs denial that it is on Access Hollywood last month. Personally, I don‚Äôt blame the guy for trying to make the marriage work, really. I think he‚Äôs finally waking up to a reality that the show is really corny and it‚Äôs making him feel very retarded for participating this show and letting his wife Jessica and her dad talked him into it. I won‚Äôt be surprised that Nick will walked out of that stupid show very soon and telling her to take a hike. NOW THAT WILL BE GREAT NEWS TO MY EARS!!! *LOL*
We‚Äôll see how strong their love is. She‚Äôs a big spender and he‚Äôs kind of tight (cheap). At the same time she brings the money now. Money can be a big problem in marriages, not to mention the career competition. Hmmm.
I totally agree! I wasn‚Äôt paying attention when she first started crying, so I thought she was upset about the song she was singing or something-when I found out it was her hair stylist I wanted to kick her! instead of crying about it she should have just gone to a REGULAR hair place like everyone else! so annoying!THE HAUNTED PALACE: A Lovecraft In Poe‚Äôs Clothing
The Haunted Palace is often lumped in with Roger Corman‚Äôs cycle of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations for American International Pictures. That‚Äôs primarily the doing of A.I.P., who insisted on drawing the title from a Poe poem and opening and closing the film with a few quotes from said poem. However, the film actually finds Corman taking a brief break from Poe by adapting the H.P. Lovecraft novella ‚ÄúThe Case Of Charles Dexter Ward.‚Äù The result isn‚Äôt that different from the approach of Corman‚Äôs Poe films but does offer some
interesting textural differences in storyline and style.
The Haunted Palace starts in a rousing fashion with an opening reel that depicts the villainy and burned-at-the-stake demise of Joseph Curwen (Vincent Price), a wicked sorcerer who puts a curse on the town of Arkham before he goes up in flames. Many years later, his descendant Charles Dexter Ward (Price again) inherits his mansion and travels to Arkham with his wife Ann (Debra Paget) to see it.
The townspeople are secretive and unfriendly, with the exception of kindly Dr. Willet (Frank Maxwell), but Ward presses on with his task. He soon discovers that the Curwen family bonds can have a supernatural power ‚Äì and not only does Joseph want his old black magic resumed, he also wants revenge on the
descendents of the townspeople who executed him.
The results feel like Corman applying the gothic-shock approach he developed on his Poe films to Lovecraft material. Beaumont‚Äôs script is solidly plotted and weaves in clever references to a number of concepts from other Lovecraft tales (Arkham, the Necronomicon, etc.) but it drags a little during the midsection. Also, the state of special effects technology circa 1963 and the budget/schedule work against Corman‚Äôs attempts to portray Lovecraft‚Äôs eldritch horrors ‚Äì one big creature effect during the finale falls noticeably flat ‚Äì so Corman and Beaumont both devote more time to doing the kind of ‚Äúold dark house‚Äù and undead spirit-type horrors from the Poe film
cycle.
That said, The Haunted Palace is a solid programmer if viewed on its own merits. Corman had a confident grasp of horror film technique by this point and shot the film entirely on sets to get a surreal, stylized look that is quite effective: the foggy Arkham streets and skeletal forest have a particularly striking look.
As usual, Daniel Haller‚Äôs impressive sets have the right sort of gothic grandeur and Floyd Crosby‚Äôs cinematography weaves wonders from shadows and fog. Ronald Stein composes the score here and achieves a doomy feel that is subtler than the Les Baxter scores from the early Poe films. Corman harnesses their talents and effectively and uses their work to craft some wonderful sequences, including the breathless opening reel and a great scene where Price and Paget are surrounded on the street by Arkham‚Äôs mutated citizens.
The Haunt
ed Palace also has one of the best casts for a Corman production of this era. The supporting cast is packed with a number of familiar faces, including Leo Gordon and Elisha Cook Jr. as important men in the town and a wonderful, subtly ominous turn from Lon Chaney Jr. as the caretaker of the Curwin house.
Paget is also compelling and sympathetic as Ward‚Äôs long-suffering wife. That said, it is Price‚Äôs show all the way: he gets to not only play a dual role as Curwen/Ward but also gets to portray Ward being possessed by Curwen. He handles the shifts of persona like a pro and brings a palpable sense of delight to Curwen‚Äôs wickedness.
In short, The Haunted Palace is a second-tier entry within the list of the Corman/Price collaborations‚Ä¶ but that duo‚Äôs second-tier material is worth a lot of horror filmmakers‚Äô first-tier material from the same era. If you enjoy their collaborations in the Poe arena, you‚Äôll find this little sidetrip into Lovecraft territory worth taking.Primary 3 English. Countable nouns & Uncountable nouns . Countable nouns.

Liberia has been taken over by multinational corporations that are exploiting its resources at the expense of Liberians, especially the country‚Äôs working class that serves as cheap labour to these foreign companies..
The author refreshingly re-engages with the public discourse, rumours, gossips and local idioms of corruption in her native Liberia in a way that strips it of its taken-for-grantedness in popular discourse, and subjects it to a much more rigorous analysis. The book expands the focus of corruption to interrogate its embeddedness in social life and routine forms.) 43 (1): 51‚Äì71.

This series has a lot of history, since this will be their 172nd regular-season meeting. Packers have the series lead at 96-68-7 but that shouldn‚Äôt affect the game too much since the Lions and Packers split the season series last year, with each team winning on the road.
Fans might remember one their most historic meeting back in the 1993 playoffs, when Packers Sterling Sharpe caught the winning 40-yard touchdown pass with 55 seconds to play to take home the trophy.
The Lions have not forgotten that forsaken day, but have put bad memories behind them. They have had a lot of success last year and it was all due to how they handled the pressure. Another guy, Aaron Rodgers, will have to deal with that pressure again Sunday when they try to get their second win against those Lions. Rodgers got sacked five times and had three fumbles (with one lost) in Green Bay‚Äôs loss to the Vikings last week.
Ziggy Ansah might not play for the Lions because of an ankle injury, so Haloti Ngata, Devin Taylor and Kerry Hyder will have to shoulder more of the pass-rushing load, but they should be able to handle it. The Lions won‚Äôt have starting running Ameer Abdullah back in the line-up due to a season-ending foot injury that he incured in a Week 2 loss to the Tennessee Titans. That will be a great advantage for the Green Bay Packers for holding up against the run after the first two games, will allow the Packers to focus on disrupting the Lions‚Äô effective passing attack with applied pressure.
Lions QB Matthew Stafford won‚Äôt have Calvin Johnson anymore, but the Packers secondary won‚Äôt have cornerback Sam Shields either who is out with concussion, so he‚Äôll have to use the big-play potential of Golden Tate, Marvin Jones Jr. and Anquan Boldin as well as the speedy check-down back Theo Riddick.
Key matchups will be Lions WR Golden Tate vs. Packers CB Quinten Rollins. Tate, is fast, and is the Lions‚Äô leader in receptions for the last two years. But he is off to a slow start this season with just nine catches for 54 yards, so he needs to pick it up. He had two drops last week against Tennessee, but a more favorable matchup Sunday should come his way since starting cornerback Sam Shields be out. Rollins has so far played quite well as a rookie, and has two pass breakups this year.
Another good matchup to watch for Lions DT Tyrunn Walker vs. Packers LG Lane Taylor. Walker has started of the season kind of strangely with six tackles, but no sacks in two games. Last week, he played fewer snaps than backup Khyri Thornton. But this week Walker will have a favorable matchup against Taylor, who is a first-time starter. The Packers has cut long-time Lions nemesis Josh Sitton before the season to give Taylor the job instead, so that should play into Walker‚Äôs hands.
Players to watch out for are RB Dwayne Washington. He‚Äôs replacing Ameer Abdullah‚Äôs who out with a foot injury, and that means new energy at running back position for the Lions. Theo Riddick will start this week and get most of the snaps, but Washington will be looking to get the No. 2 role. Riddick had a career-high 11 carries last week, but he‚Äôs much better suited to play a receiving role out of the backfield. Washington has shown his critics a lot of potential despite playing limitedly so far. He‚Äôs playing in a lot the Lions‚Äô goal-line sets, and if he gets on a streak, there‚Äôs no reason why the Lions won‚Äôt put him in more clutch situations in their running game.
We think Aaron Rodgers will be very eager to bounce back from a lousy game and will try to come up big at home, but the Lions might be able to put a stop to that confidence by shutting key offensive plays to squeak out a win away from hom.Was there anything unappealing about the Roman idea of immortality?

A.
Cravath and ABC, led by the high-profile child welfare litigator Marcia Lowry, are seeking class certification in the lawsuit Elisa W. v The City of New York, so that remedies they seek for the 19 children named in the case would apply to the more than 8,000 children in the city‚Äôs foster care system.
‚ÄúThis filing demonstrates ‚Äî often in the actual words of city and state employees ‚Äî just how wide the gap is between New York City‚Äôs policies and its practices for the treatment and protection of foster children,‚Äù read an ABC statement provided to The Chronicle of Social Change. ‚ÄúFurthermore, the filing demonstrates how Governor Cuomo‚Äôs Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) fails to oversee ACS and keep the City‚Äôs children safe from harm while in care.‚Äù
A spokesperson for OCFS said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. ACS referred The Imprint to the city‚Äôs Law Department, which has argued on behalf of the city in the case. [UPDATED Wednesday, July 31, 2019]*
‚ÄúLooking to the court to manage the challenges of foster care is a simplistic approach to a complex system, particularly when ACS has proven itself fully capable of meeting those challenges. In the face of foster care increases nationally, ACS has successfully reduced the number of youth in foster care to the lowest level in decades,‚Äù read a statement e-mailed by a Department spokesperson.
‚ÄúCherry picking facts from a relative handful of cases going back years, second-guessing decisions made by Family Court judges, and drawing comparisons between states that even the federal government recognizes are unwise, the plaintiffs seek to paint a picture of a system in crisis when a fair review of the facts tells a story of remarkable progress and achievement benefitting many thousands of families.‚Äù
Marcia Lowry in front of the Page Belcher Federal Building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Lowry‚Äôs A Better Childhood filed lawsuits against Oregon and Indiana this summer.
Elisa W. was initially submitted in the summer of 2015, accompanied by a scathing report on the fate of kids in ACS‚Äô care from the city‚Äôs then-public advocate Letitia James, who joined the plaintiffs in the litigation. The group quickly reached a settlement with Governor Cuomo‚Äôs office that October, over strong objections from the city, advocates for foster youth and birth parents, and, ultimately, the judge overseeing the case.
That judge, Laura Taylor Swain of the Southern District Court of New York, tossed out the settlement a year later. By then, James, who is now the state‚Äôs attorney general, had already quietly withdrawn from the contentious suit, as reported by Politico at the time. James‚Äô office did not respond to a request for comment.
The city, and legal advocates for parents and foster youth ‚Äî groups that face off in court over tens of thousands of child abuse and neglect cases each year ‚Äî found rare agreement in opposition to the settlement. This reflected a divide in the field of child welfare nationally over the utility of landmark class actions on behalf of youth in foster care, a strategy Lowry pioneered decades ago with another pro bono New York firm she founded, Children‚Äôs Rights.
‚ÄúThe fact that we are united in opposing the state‚Äôs position in this proposed settlement is, I think, the headline in many ways today, and should be a significant message ‚Ä¶ about why it is that we feel that the proposed settlement and in fact the lawsuit is wrongheaded,‚Äù Sue Jacobs, the president of the legal aid firm Center for Family Representation, told Politico in 2015.
‚ÄúWe represent collectively over 90 percent of the cases of families in the child welfare system in the five boroughs, so that when the public advocates or plaintiffs in the lawsuit suggest that they in fact speak for those children and families, we are here to say, not so much,‚Äù she said.
Since that time, ABC said that it has had an opportunity to sift through more than a million pages of records. The class action renewal filed today focuses on an alleged disconnect between policy and practice when it comes to ACS‚Äô management of more than two dozen contracted providers in the city.
‚ÄúA core revelation of the brief is that the Improved Outcomes for Children (IOC) model, wherein ACS delegates day-to-day care of children to 27 Contract Agencies, is not working, and the city knows it,‚Äù the statement from ABC said. ‚ÄúACS conducts only cursory case reviews, has no minimum requirements for agency performance, no minimum requirements for training of agency caseworkers, and fails to impose consequences when agencies have consistently poor performance outcomes.‚Äù
The motion leads with a quote from 2014 written by then-Commissioner of ACS Gladys Carri√≥n, who appears to cop to a lack of oversight and accountability for the dozens of nonprofits that ACS contracts with to provide foster care services:
‚ÄúConcern that agencies are in it for the $. ACS goes from initiative to initiative without paying attention to fundamentals or
Letitia James was the New York City Public Advocate when A Better Childhood filed the Elisa W. lawsuit against the city‚Äôs child welfare agency. Now she serves as New York State attorney general.
deepening the work,‚Äù reads a brief excerpt presented without context from an unidentified document ABC says it acquired during discovery. ABC claims that the statement was shared with Sheila Poole, the head of the state‚Äôs Office of Children and Family Services, which oversees ACS‚Äôs work.
Julie Farber, ACS‚Äô deputy commissioner for Family Permanency Services, supposedly confirmed the point in an internal communication sent after the suit was filed in 2015: ‚Äúthe capacity of ACS to provide truly robust support to the [Contract Agencies] in order to accelerate permanency for children in foster care‚Äù is ‚Äúmissing.‚Äù
ABC singled out six points in which it alleges failure by ACS and its contractors:
- Matching children with appropriate foster care placements
- Concurrent planning for both family reunification and contingency options for finding foster youth another permanent home
- Ensuring permanency for foster youth in general
- Providing the right services for at-risk birth parents and other caregivers
- Providing special attention to children in foster care longer than two years
- Maintaining timely and adequate case documentation
Oversights related to these elements were ‚Äúpresent in each of the 19 children‚Äôs case files,‚Äù and ‚Äúcontributed to the children‚Äôs extended stay in foster care and increased their risk of harm while in care,‚Äù said ABC‚Äôs statement.
A city source pointed to ACS‚Äô recent improvements on key metrics: The total number of children in foster care for two years or more dropped 38 percent from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, while the total number of days all children spent in foster care declined by 19 percent. Over the last two fiscal years, ACS also increased the number of newly certified foster parents by 32 percent, turning around a previous six-year decline in the number of new foster homes recruited.*
A Better Childhood also slammed New York‚Äôs state child welfare agency, OCFS, for failing to appropriately monitor the city.
‚ÄúLong before this lawsuit was filed, OCFS had ample knowledge of ACS‚Äôs poor performance,‚Äù the motion states. ABC describes a ‚Äúlaissez-faire attitude towards ACS‚Äôs failings,‚Äù citing e-mails between OCFS leadership after it received a negative report on the city‚Äôs work with contracting agencies.
A Better Childhood has filed a series of major cases against foster care systems nationwide in recent months, including against the state-run systems in Oregon and Indiana. The Imprint reported last July that the firm had received significant new financial support from a secret funder, allowing it to hire new attorneys and staff, open an office in Manhattan, and file new cases nationwide.
The firm was founded in 2014 after Lowry left another firm she started, Children‚Äôs Rights.
ACS is now led by David Hansell, who was appointed in early 2017, shortly after Carri√≥n‚Äôs resignation. The foster care population in the city has shrunk dramatically in recent decades, from a high near 50,000 youth decades ago, to less than 8,500 today.

Firslty I'm not sure if this site is the right place to be posting this, but I desperatelyt need some advice that might help my wife.
Just over 3 years ago my wife went for a routine Mammogram at one of the mobile screening units in Cornwall.
After the screening she told me that while she was having her left side done she was in extreme pain, and was yelling for the operator to stop, but she caried on regardless.
Now since that day my wife has been in a lot of pain around one of her ribs. The pain is mainly concentrated at the sternum and where the rib meets the spine. You can also see a deformation around the rib, which has been explained to us as displaced cartiledge from the Mammogram.
My wife was a teacher before her Mammogram, and hasn't been able to work since. We have to sleep in seperate beds now due to her restless nights, and pain waking her up at night.
We have been to see various doctors who just seem to think it is in her imagination, but i know my wife, and she is most definatley suffering.
I am at my wits end as to what to do to help her, and it is breaking my heart to watch her suffer. Especially when it was caused by somehting that is meant to help.
I should point out that my wife is very slightly built and doesnt have a lot of fat tissue on her body.
Does anybody know of anyone who has suffered from these Mammograms, and perhaps still is?
We desperately need some help with this, but the doctors seem to think that this couldnt have happened due to a Mammogram, but I know it did.
We have lodged a complaint, and have someone looking into this for us, but 3 years later and the pain contiunues.
I would appreciate any help or advice on this matter.
Kind Regards

It‚Äôs been round for some time (ask your ancestors) and on the floor, it‚Äôs so simple as taking your footwear off. However is barefoot operating good for you? A decade into the barefoot increase, right here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve realized to this point.
BACK WHEN IT BEGAN
The current pattern in barefoot operating was sparked by writer Christopher McDougall‚Äôs declare that we have been ‚Äúborn to run‚Äù (barefoot in fact). His 2009 e-book of that identify offered thousands and thousands of copies and resulted in an explosion of runners taking over the pure fashion. The Barefoot Runners Society sprouted in the identical yr, and to again all of it up, Nature printed analysis exhibiting how barefoot operating was much less more likely to trigger damage.(1)
The biomechanical change in gait, foot angle and strike sample after we run barefoot is believed to extend foot energy and pure sensitivity in addition to enhance tendon elasticity and operating financial system.(2) (3) (4) There‚Äôs additionally the enchantment of being actually in contact with nature (image white sandy beaches and leafy trails).
It‚Äôs a compelling argument which has inevitably excited as many critics as followers. As ordinary shoe wearers, most of us have developed a operating gait and musculature to go together with cushioned footwear. In comparison with our forebears (or the ultra-running Mexican Tarahumara tribe) we‚Äôre typically heavier, fatter, and taller ‚Äì not precisely a recipe for fulfillment. So what does science say?
IS BAREFOOT RUNNING GOOD FOR YOU?
The central declare of the barefoot motion is that operating with out footwear reduces damage. The primary examine to correctly take a look at the speculation produced thrilling outcomes ‚Äì barefooters expertise fewer accidents!(5) The reality, nevertheless, was an uncomfortable one. It turned out that the barefoot runners in query ran half as a lot as their shoed counterparts. Per kilometer there was no distinction in accidents sustained.
However that‚Äôs not the entire story. Barefoot operating causes us to strike the bottom with the entrance of the foot. It is a pure response to the heavy impression of touchdown on the heel with out cushioning. Adopting this forefoot strike sample reduces each peak knee extension and stride size.(3) (6)
By retraining to land on the forefoot, frequent accidents to the hamstring, plantar fascia, and knee are decreased whereas Achilles tendon and calf accidents are elevated. (5) (7) (8) For these with repetitive knee problems, barefoot operating could provide aid, supplied the pressure on the Achilles and calf is nicely tolerated.
Do you know?
Each 100g discount in shoe weight equals a 1% saving in operating financial system.
DOES BAREFOOT RUNNING IMPROVE PERFORMANCE?
Touchdown towards the entrance of the foot has different benefits. This foot strike sample prompts the plantar (sole) floor of the foot and Achilles tendon, returning elastic power with every stride.
As well as, whereas standard trainers contribute to muscle weak point by artificially stabilizing the foot, barefoot operating enhances foot energy by activating these muscle tissues. Merely strolling in minimalist footwear is as efficient at rising foot energy as particular energy coaching.(3)
Working financial system can also be improved with barefoot operating, although it‚Äôs unclear what contribution is made by foot energy, elastic power or just saving on shoe weight.(9) (10) (11) As for precise efficiency, the proof is unclear ‚Äì although many runners understand an enchancment after coaching with out footwear.(8)
What are barefoot footwear?
Barefoot footwear or minimalist trainers are designed to attenuate ‚Äúinterference with the pure motion of the foot.‚Äù (12) They‚Äôre categorised based on flexibility, heel-toe drop, weight, stack peak (sole thickness on the heel) and movement management / stability expertise.
In essence, the extra versatile, flat, gentle, skinny and easy the shoe, the extra ‚Äúpure‚Äù the motion.

For those who are not familiar with the paylines, fixed means that the players cannot change the number of active ones, meaning that at least 30 coins are used in each round.
The Ways to Win system seems to appear in every single slot machine lately, which is the reason why WMS decided to take a step back from it, and bring back the good old fixed paylines. However, they improved the sound effects, 3D animations and overall graphics quality.

Why do businesses need digital marketing?
Digital marketing helps businesses stay a step ahead of their competition. Businesses want to reach as many people as possible, and this is significantly easier to achieve on the web than it is in person. Digital marketing is less expensive than traditional advertising.
How can I.
What are the 5 D‚Äôs of digital marketing?
Digital marketing revolves around these 5Ds: digital devices, digital platforms, digital media, digital data, and digital technology.
Why digital marketing is bad?
A fragmented approach compromises your scale and the individual insights you can collect and decision against, and leads to media inefficiencies and flawed measurement. The marketing funnel is fractured. Brand marketers treat the prospect/customer funnel in a very broken way.
How do small businesses do digital marketing?
Here are some of the ways small businesses can use social media marketing to drive growth and gain new customers: Sharing interesting and relevant content. Engaging audiences in conversations. Using social media for customer service, including answering questions and addressing complaints.
Do small businesses need digital marketing?
To successfully do that, a small business needs to identify what its target customer needs so it can fulfill those demands. Effective digital marketing helps small businesses learn the online habits of customers so they can better target ideal customers..
Is digital marketing a tough job?
They feel that digital marketing is tough if you require quick results. Actually the result of digital marketing, like every other form of marketing, is not completely in the control of the marketer. However, with patience and keenness to learn, digital marketing can be an extremely rewarding experience and career..
Is Digital Marketing Easy?
Digital marketing is one of the most needed skills of today‚Äôs time. While there are more resources for learning digital marketing available on the internet than you can ever imagine, it is easy to get overwhelmed by them.
Who should use digital marketing?
Another reason why digital marketing is a must for most modern brands is that it allows companies to foster better customer relationships. Whereas most traditional marketing provides one-way communication with the consumer, digital marketing allows for two-way communication in real time.
What are the types of digital marketing?
Digital marketing can be broadly broken into 7 main categories including: Search Engine Optimization, Pay-per-Click, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing, Email Marketing, Mobile Marketing, Marketing Analytics.An interesting thing happened to me a while ago. The weekend started out great, but by Sunday afternoon I was feeling anxious.
The first thing I do when this sort of thing happens is start going through a mental checklist of possible causes. Sometimes your mood can be affected by things that are easy to fix and don‚Äôt actually have anything to do with your mental state at all.
Was I hungry? No.
Thirsty? No.
Tired? No.
Lonely? No.
Had anything concerning happened recently? Not in the least. Life was good.
Had I been eating or drinking caffeinated products? YES! I‚Äôd had a couple of chocolate baked goods as well as caffeinated soda over the weekend.
Larger doses of caffeine make my heart race and my body feel jittery. I have several relatives who have mentioned having similar reactions, so I‚Äôm guessing that at least some of it is due to genetics. Even fairly small amounts of caffeine have been known to make me anxious because my tolerance for that drug is so low.
When I avoid every source of caffeine, I am a much calmer person.
This won‚Äôt work for everyone, of course. There are many causes of anxiety, and your ancestors may not have given you a lovely oversensitive-to-caffeine gene like mine did. Haha.
It is a simple thing to try if you‚Äôve been struggling with anxious thoughts, though. Avoiding caffeine is pretty easy once you figure out where it likes to hide. The only sneaky place I‚Äôve found it would be in some over-the-counter pain medicine. Certain brands include caffeine to make their medicine more effective.
Other than that, caffeine generally isn‚Äôt hidden in food or drinks. If it‚Äôs chocolate, coffee, or non-herbal tea, it probably has caffeine. If it isn‚Äôt, it probably doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd recommend cutting it out of your diet for a week or two to see if it helps.
The worst thing you can discover is that it isn‚Äôt a trigger for you!Saturday Morning Pam-toons. The Wages of Righteousness.

The Wear Rivers Trust is currently looking for volunteers to help tackle the issue of invasive non-native species in the River Wear.
The Wear Rivers Trust is working to tackle three of the worst invasive non-native species (INNS) in the Wear catchment: Himalayan Balsam, Japanese Knotweed and Giant Hogweed. These have been increasing in the area for many years following their introduction to the UK in the 19th Century. All three species grow in large clusters which smother native vegetation and leave riverbanks vulnerable to erosion during winter dieback.
The Trust is currently looking for volunteers in Durham to help remove these non-native species. Some volunteer work includes:
‚Ä¢ Performing walkover surveys to monitor the spread of INNS
‚Ä¢ Assisting on task days focused on treating patches of INNS
‚Ä¢ Becoming trained pesticide operators
‚Ä¢ Providing expert knowledge
If you would like to find out more about the WINNS project or how you can get involved, you can visit the website or contact the Trust via the following details:

Betty Luceigh
March 27, 2016
The pencil moves as it touches paper‚Äì
or is it the paper that moves when it touches pencil?
Is one intentional as the other waits,
or are both driven by a greater intention
to move simultaneously as they connect?
If I were holding the pencil motionless
and you were pushing the paper past it,
would you be the creator of the marks made?
Or does my simple participation with the pencil
still define me as co-creator?
If I hold the pencil and you hold the paper
does anyone hold each of us?
Am I, like the pencil, being moved by another,
and you, like the paper, moved as well?
Who then would be first to engage the motion
to record our intimate mark?
We humans have an agreement left unchallenged
that because I hold the pencil, I move it,
and because I move it, I have a thought to record.
But perhaps the thought was not a random sequence
of neurons firing within me to push the pencil,
but one sent by Creativity
holding me holding the pencil,
holding you holding the paper,
connecting all of us
to offer its expression.
And is it so in all matters of existence?Bacarat casino games

by Phillip Day
ISBN: 1-904015-24-7 (410 pages)
Since the publication of Charles Darwin‚Äôs On The Origin of Species in 1859, it has been widely taught that mankind is nothing but an evolved animal and that life is essentially meaningless. Today, however, science is being forced to reconsider man‚Äôs origins in the light of stunning discoveries in the realm of molecular biology and the information sciences.
In this spectacular new book, researcher Phillip Day reveals why mankind‚Äôs greatest scientific discovery is also the most controversial, and what the implications are for every person seeking answers to the four awesome questions of life: Who Am I? Where did I come from? What am I doing here? And where am I going when this life is over?
‚ÄúEither God exists or he doesn‚Äôt. Both alternatives are frightening.‚Äù ‚Äì Anon.
THE ORIGINS SERIES UPDATE: Origins ‚Äì The Greatest Scientific Discovery is the first of a six-part series. Origins II ‚Äì Holy War is now out. So is Origins III ‚Äì The Predicament of Man. Origins IV, V & VI TBA.

It does sound harsh but you need to keep in mind we had been a neighborhood of drug addicts, recovering drug addicts, and these form of punishments turned rites of passage for many people,‚Äù mentioned Howard Josepher, seventy six, who within the ‚Äô60s was one of many first members of New York Metropolis‚Äôs Phoenix House, which was a Synanon-type program when it was established.

If anything, the way the courts seem likely to handle these issues in the close to future could make him crazier. The recent push from the bench, emanating from the Supreme Courtroom, to increase the First Amendment rights of companies might upend the core principle that a regulatory company just like the FDA can stop drug corporations from spending whatever it takes to put their spin on what their products can be utilized for. That may not only permit promotion for off-label uses; it could ultimately threaten strict government control of the label itself.

What Are Stock CFDs?
These are agreements between a trader and a broker based on the difference of the entry and exit share value. There are no limits to trading time, as you don‚Äôt need to conduct direct transactions on the stock market. Unlike traditional stock trading, working with CFDs is more convenient and can be done fully online from any place on Earth.
The performance of this instrument directly depends on the underlying asset price movement.
Why should I
Choose CFDs?
Unlike typical buying stocks when you benefit from only the increasing share values, buying and selling stock CFDs empowers you to earn even in a falling market.
You don‚Äôt own these shares, which opens vast opportunities for trading. Choose any stock you want or even several ones and increase earnings significantly.
You can trade 24 hours per day as in the Forex market.
The market liquidity is very attractive for beginners and seasoned traders.
How to Trade Stock CFDs?
Choose one or more stocks you‚Äôd like to trade. Ground your decision on the knowledge and the latest news about the market and the company.
Choose a strategy (intraday, swing trading, position trading, etc.) or create yours. There are fees to keep your CFDs positions overnight, so consider them in the strategy.
Watch the upcoming events of this company, find analytical forecasts and conduct your own analysis to find out whether stock prices will skyrocket or fall.
Leverage your trading to get the most of trading with lower capital. Set protective orders to keep your finance safe.
Generally, stock CFDs can be used for the trader‚Äôs advantage as other derivative instruments. If you‚Äôre keen on fundamental analysis and have all means to predict the price growth or decrease, try yourself in trading stock contracts for differences with A1 Capitals!

2019Time flown like yesteryear
Looking at these photos of my past, it was so fleeting. A fleeting moment in time where worldly boundaries doesn‚Äôt meet. Knowing bar none, it was a memory down the lane where people seems like a saint that I look upon them as a stargazer that never wither. A fleeting moment of time that whiz by a thousand years of a lifetime that felt like a yesteryear.
Oh my, I wish the test of time that flees from my intelligence thoughts never wane as I age. The emotional intelligence never crease to amaze me but failed to instill the intelligence influence that I long to tap my enterprise since young. I never knew why the world seems so big yet so small, so round yet so flat but knowing all people‚Äôs mind which has a different perspective views having their stories interwoven before their generation time that has never shared or has been spared a thought that has elapse like yesterday.Extra

‚ÄìAn unexpected dynamic within the debate about income and wealth inequality is the effect of income taxes on the management and how that affects the way the corporations are run. When income taxes were much higher for the wealthy, there was less incentive to grow a corporation which meant there was less incentive to squash competition. As income tax rates decreased, there has been a stronger incentive to either acquire competitors or drive them out of business. One consequence has been another strong incentive to drive down internal costs, particularly employee compensation. This second or third order effect helps explain a new dynamic behind the rich getting richer while the poor are getting poorer.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs more, between 1993 and 2012, the top 1 percent saw their incomes grow 86.1 percent, while the bottom 99 percent saw just 6.6 percent growth, according to Saez‚Äôs research.‚Äù ‚Äì The Atlantic
‚ÄúWhen Gains At The Top Hurt Those At The Bottom‚Äù ‚Äì The Atlantic
Pingback: Data That Matters July 2016 | Pretending Not To PanicMine Nayuka has gained much popularity through work such as 'Arasa-chan,' a four-panel comic that frankly depicts the romantic issues of age 30-ish women, as well as her regular column that sympathizes with the female audience of the same generation. She currently lives with a ten-year old Persian Chinchilla named 'Pussy.' A self-professed lover of 'beautiful women and beautiful things,' we interviewed Mine-san about the beauty and charm of cats.
A white and fluffy cat
- How did you first meet Pussy?
"My friends always told me that I looked like the kind of person who should own a white, fluffy cat. Moreover, I always used to fantasize about a situation in which a man presented me with a cat as a gift. So I coaxed my boyfriend at the time to get me a white, fluffy cat for my birthday. So that's how Pussy came into my life."
- Was it your first time to have a cat?
"I had wanted to own a cat since I was a little girl. My parents were cat lovers, too. Because they love cats so much, they told me that it would be too sad to deal with when it eventually dies. Therefore, it was out of the question. When I turned nineteen, however, I moved into an apartment that allowed cats. That when I got Pussy. I naturally liked taking care of animals because I used to have some goldfish. However, I think the cats are the best."
- Is there a reason for your obsession with cats?
"I love cats just because I love beautiful things. I think cats are more beautiful and noble than dogs. I think my fondness for cats is similar to how some people obsess over dragons and unicorns. It is almost like the longing for an imaginary animal. That's what I feel when I look at cats."
- Have you made any new discoveries by living alongside Pussy?
"I thought we'd get along right away, but he was hiding for a while when he first came to live at my house. I would notice that his food was slowly disappearing, but I didn't actually see him. It took about a month before he got used to me. And you know, cat pupils close vertically, right? I didn't know that so I was shocked when I saw it for the first time. I actually took him to the vet right away because I thought he was ill (laughs). I took him to the vet again when his fur got hair balls because I didn't know what to do. Even though he has long hair, he hates being brushed. These days I just cut those hair balls when I find them."
A bossy roommate
- Please tell us about Pussy's character.
"He always gets angry when we have guests. He'll never get used to them, it seems. He doesn't like being touched. Since he is my first cat, I thought that this was how all cats are. But after asking other cat owners, I realized that it's rare for cats to be as violent as him. He gets friendly when I give him some distance or am doing nothing. But still, he won't play with toys and he doesn't sleep with me in bed."
- So what kind of relationship have you and Pussy developed?
"He is my roommate and superior. I sense that he thinks something like, 'Yeah I recognize you as a person, but I am better than you.' - like he is my boss or something. I wouldn't like it at all if I actually had to share a room with my boss (laughs)."
- Do you think that Pussy understands the things you say?
"Oh, I don't know. When you read cat comics, you see cats monologuing about their feelings. Like they want to play or they are jealous of other cats. I always wonder how authors can know what cats are feeling. I have no idea whatsoever about what Pussy is thinking. When he gives me a threatening growl, I can tell that he is angry, but that's about as far as I can get. I would never understand all the workings of his mind."
- Because you have lived with the same cat for ten years, he must have met a lot of your friends and lovers. Can you gauge their personalities based on the way they communicate with Pussy?
"Hmm, I think most of my boyfriends were well-liked by Pussy. Most of them were cat lovers. I think cat lovers like to stay indoors, which matches my tastes. When someone says he is a dog person, I know that our values will never match. Dog lovers are all communicative and have many friends. I'm not good at dealing with that kind of person. The famous movie directer, the late Itami Jyuzo, was also a cat lover. He dismissed dog lovers in his essay titled 'Women!' (laughs). Cat lovers are sourpusses, they will go to extra trouble to deny dog lovers."
The love of the noble and the beautiful - women and cats
- Do you think your own personality is cat-like?
"I think I am more of a dog. I like being at the bottom of the pyramid. I love being given orders to go get the bone. I like being bossed around. Some people think I am more of an arrogant cat-like person because I love beautiful and noble things - and I expect women to act as such. However, unless a woman looks good, they won't be able to maintain their nobility. And I do love a proud, noble person. Another thing, I don't like heartwarming photos of cats. I have no interest in them. So I found this twitter account called 'SpaceCats,' and I went, 'Yes! This is what I've been looking for!' I like cats that are so noble they can 'conquer the galaxy.' So, Pussy doesn't have to be lovey-dovey or touchy-feely. She doesn't have to come into my bed to snuggle. She doesn't have to act like a bitch."
- As much as you love and want to touch your cat, you also want to keep a comfortable distance in your relationship. Is this the same way you feel about people?
"Though I said I love beautiful women, that doesn't mean I want to date them. While living life and having sex and all the daily things I can do with men, I just want to see beautiful women every now and then. That's a good distance. Maybe I am deifying cats and beautiful women."
- Have you ever felt like making a comic about a cat?
"Not for now. I wanted to have a cat in 'Arasa-chan,' but I couldn't figure out how to treat it within the context. That was surprising to me. Particularly given my style of work, animal stories are kinda hard - since I can never end a story in a heartwarming way. If I ever depict a cat, it won't show the ordinary life of a cat, but more like a major spectacle - like a war story or something. I don't mind reading stories that are written from a cat's perspective, like "I am a Cat" by Natsume Soseki, in which a cat observes the foolish lives of human beings."
- What's the best thing about living with a cat?
"It's not that something got better since I started living with a cat, but rather, the first nineteen years of my life without a cat were not so good. I was missing the 'cat factor' in my life. Once there was a cat, I became a whole person. A cat is my object of faith. Some people say cats help them avoid loneliness, but cats can never erase that loneliness. People become unstable if they don't have any faith. I guess anything could have done the job. However, considering my obsession for beautiful and noble things, a cat is what it took for me."Eye and/or military trauma can benefit from this time of treatment in a relatively short period of time. It is also important to note that EMDR therapy in Phoenix is also used for people who may have experienced a recent traumatic episode such as witnessing or experiencing a car accident, school shooting, domestic violence, etc.
Why We Experience Trauma on a Loop
When we experience a traumatic event such as early childhood sexual, physical and emotional trauma, military trauma, car accidents, violence or even domestic abuse, it can override the body‚Äôs natural ability to cope and process the event. This can result in these disturbing experiences remaining frozen/stuck in our brain. Unprocessed events/memories are then encoded in our brain with all the feelings, emotions and sensations; which are then stored in the limbic system of your brain in a ‚Äúraw‚Äù and emotional form. This limbic system preserves traumatic memories in an isolated memory network that is linked with emotions and physical sensations, which are also disconnected from the brain‚Äôs cortex where we use language to store memories. When this happens, events in the present can remind us of the traumatic episode such as a smell, tone of voice, place, color or even TV show. These triggers may lead us to behave as if the incident is recurring.
The limbic system‚Äôs distressing memories can be repeatedly triggered when you experience events like the problematic experiences you have been through. Often the memory itself is long forgotten, but the painful feelings such as anxiety, panic, anger or despair are constantly triggered in the present. Your ability to live in the present and learn from new experiences becomes repressed. Phoenix EMDR therapy at NewPoint of View Counseling can help.
Why EMDR Treatment?
EMDR therapy helps you to reprocess these traumatic events so that new learning can occur. Your EMDR therapist will use bilateral stimulations either through tapping, eye movements or headphones to aid in the processing, helping you to create connections between your brain‚Äôs memory networks, enabling your brain to process the traumatic memory in a very natural way, similar to what happens during REM sleep.
What to expect during an EMDR Therapy Session?
Your therapist will ask you to identify disturbing events/incidents that continue to upset you or cause negative emotions in the present. Your therapist will help you to identify thoughts, feelings and sensations associated with the incident while performing a series of bilateral eye movements (left ‚Äì right eye movement) while focusing on the traumatic memory. Your therapist may use other bilateral stimulations including alternating bilateral sound using headphones and alternating tactile simulation using a handheld device that vibrates or taps to the back of your hands.
It is believed that EMDR induces a fundamental change in the circuitry of the brain, similar to what happens during REM sleep. This helps people process, integrate, and understand their trauma within the broader context of their current life.
Clients often report memories feeling more distant, being less disturbing and no longer evoking the negative sensations such as anxiety, panic attacks, nervousness, bad dreams, isolation, depression and self-loathing prior to engaging in EMDR treatment.

- My ideals, purposes, aspirations, and desires, something created by my mind or will, like the rules of baseball. This utterly fails to account for why it is always wrong to disobey or change the rules.
-.
As I said before, you absolutely can get more out of less, and evolution in fact proves this. We can show that morality is a mixture of nature and nurture, no god required. Amazingly, scientists appear to have discovered the physical conscience as well. As for how nature or society can obligate a human to act a certain way, we may as well ask how nature can obligate fish to swim or birds (not the invention of god but the evolution of dinosaurs, by the way) to fly. We may as well ask how the training of a K9 officer obligates dogs to sniff out drugs. We may as well ask how the young male bonobo is obligated to not kill the infant bonobo (he knows he would be beaten for doing so). A fish can choose not to swim, a bird can choose not to fly, a dog can choose not to point out drugs (I assume), and a bonobo can choose to kill a baby, but because it is in their nature to swim, fly, and obey trainer or society, they rarely do so. Similarly, a human can choose to kill another, but it is normally our nature to avoid that because of our empathy.
A far worse problem for these arguments from morality, however, is that morality has changed, even in Christianity. In the Old Testament, beating slaves within an inch of their lives was acceptable (Exodus 21:20-21) because they were not seen as people, and women were treated as property for largely the same reason. Now, we recognize that all humans are people capable of suffering, and that it is wrong to cause it. Indeed, most of us have also recognized that (most?) animals are also capable of suffering and it is therefore wrong to torture them. If a religious view were true, especially the Christian religious view, we should have expected Christians to be the first to realize blacks are people, too, and therefore worthy of being more than slaves or at best servants. If a religious view were true, especially the Christian religious view, we should have expected Christians to be the first to realize that homosexuals are people, too, and therefore worthy of dignity and love. Instead, in both cases, Christians have been one of the groups holding on to their right to persecute, and for religious reasons. I trust I need not prove that the Westboro Baptist Church exists, but I will point to this article to show that Christians used Christianity to persecute black people as recently as a few decades ago.
In short, if you are going to argue that morality comes from your god, you need to answer why slavery was once morally acceptable to your god and now is not. Pointing to the culture of the time isn‚Äôt good enough, because that implies that you accept the atheistic position of morality coming from nature and society. A god as good as Christianity claims could have created at least one society that did not require slavery and even forbade it. Indeed, looking to India, we find a religion that specifically forbids violence and injury: Jainism. Surely that is a far greater moral starting point than a list of rules from a god who sometimes orders genocide, and Jainism is hardly newer than Judaism.
4 thoughts on ‚ÄúThe Argument from Conscience‚Äù
Asimov said, ‚ÄúNever let your conscience get in the way of doing what‚Äôs right.‚Äù
I think that‚Äôs deeper, and more profound, than Kreeft‚Äôs entire ramble.
I certainly agree with that.
Of course, Kreeft would just say, ‚ÄúThat means you accept an objective morality, so you must accept a lawgiver!‚Äù and take it as a triumph. That‚Äôs why I pointed out that nature obligates fish to swim.
The hilarious thing about that response is that it doesn‚Äôt automatically imply objective morality. I would rather take it as an implication that you should at least entertain skepticism regarding what you hold as moral truths.
Hmm, I can see that.When you need electrical services done right, call My Buddy the Plumber.

Just the other day, I got a comment from someone named "Zohaib malik" on that post as follows: "We request you to definitely the actual web page where one can study along with fascinating home elevators comparable subjects. [Buy psychedelics online]"
(The bracketed part, obviously, was a hotlink to where readers could buy psychedelics online.)
"Home elevators"? "To definitely the actual web page"? I don't know what kind of mushrooms Mr. Malik was canning to create such a word salad, but I recommend he lay off of them right away.
The world is full of idiots.
But I can relate: crackpots only wish to can psychedelic mushrooms.
Home elevators are groovy. :-)
I didn‚Äôt realize that elevators had more than one subject? Hum....
Robots like Mr. Malik don't take psychedelic durgs.
That was a spam bot. They post to comment sections in blogs hoping to get a few peeps to follow, or some extra love from the Google algos in page ranking. Best to delete and block their IP address so that they can't keep doing it.
We get this sort of spam on our website every day. Every one has a link to other products which I never click on.
These are from today, for example: (spelling errors are the authors, whether human or robot.)
Nice post. I learn something new aand challenging on sites
I stumbleupon on a daily basis. It will always
be interesting to read through content from other writers and usse a little something from other web sites.
Nice weblog here! Additionally your website so much
up fast! What web host are you the use of? Can I get your affiliate hyperlink for your host?
I desire my webwite loaded up as quickly as yours lol
The internet is filled with much uncertainty. One has to wonder what is spam , who is trying to hack into your life and is this necessary or true? I sure like that cool 60's vibe photo.Contents
How do you pronounce Kraken Mare?

- (UK) IPA: /Ààk…πak…ôn Ààm…ëÀê…πe…™/
What is the Kraken in mythology?.
What movie is release the Kraken from?
When ‚ÄúClash of the Titans‚Äù was remade as a big-budget 3-D movie in 2010, Liam Neeson as Zeus gave the dramatic order, ‚ÄúRelease the Kraken!‚Äù Even before the film was released, the trailer inspired countless Internet memes mocking Mr. Neeson‚Äôs over-the-top reading of the line.
Is the Kraken real yes or no?
The Kraken, the mythical beast of the sea, is real. Giant squid live in the dark depths of the ocean, and very little is known about them to this day.
Is the Kraken Poseidon‚Äôs son?.
What does the Kraken eat?
And Scylla also finds her way into the kraken myth, for she too was tentacled, snatching Odysseus‚Äô men and eating them alive. The kraken, though, is happy to make do just eating fish.
What does the Kraken symbolize?
The Kraken tattoo could represent many things depending on the person wearing it. Most would think it‚Äôs a sign of power and fear. Most notably, the Kraken is tattooed as emerging from the sea wrapping its tentacles around an unsuspecting ship. Sailors are screaming in terror while the Kraken is pulling the ship under.
How big is a kraken?
The kraken had very large eyes, and fins protruded from the upper part of its elongated central body. When younger, krakens resembled a pale squid. Their massive tentacles could crush the hull of a galleon. The average kraken was about 100 feet (30 meters) in length and weighed about 4,000 pounds (1,800 kilograms).Description
Deep-cleansing oil wash for all skin types / 4 oz
The Kristina Holey + Marie Veronique Pure + EO Free Oil Cleanser is the perfect first step in the extraordinarily soothing, skin-health-restoring regimen developed by celebrated facialist Kristina Holey and renowned formulator Marie Veronique. (To learn more about this very cool collaboration, visit our blog.)
Kristina and Marie both love Marie's Replenishing Oil Cleanser, a beautiful oil based wash that dissolves hardened oil, debris, sunscreen, and makeup to decongest pores and deep clean without disrupting skin's natural protective barrier. Many an oil-cleansing fan is devoted to it. So, taking a beautifully simple "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach, Kristina and Marie started with that star cleanser as a base and made some very slight changes designed to address the most sensitive of skins: they removed the essential oils and put in some elderberry extract ‚Äî a multifunctional ingredient that prolongs the shelf life of the cleanser.
And you still get all the things we love about the original cleanser:
- The carefully chosen blend of oils, rich in Omega-6 fatty acids (which, by the way, acne prone skin tends to need more of), that thin sticky sebum deposits and allow oils to flow to the surface where they can lubricate skin's surface instead of causing a ruckus underneath
- The mild cleansing agents (decyl polyglucose and sucrose cocoate) that provide greater cleansing power without irritating skin
- The pre/probiotic complex that helps reduce irritation by supporting the health of the skin microbiome
The result: a super-calming, fragrance free deep clean.
If your skin tends to be dry, this may be all you need; if that's the case, we suggest removing it with a warm, wet muslin cloth or softer bamboo pads, like MyHavtorn's. If you like a ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù feeling or your skin tends to be balanced to oily, we suggest following this up with the Gentle Gel Cleanser or Balancing HypoTonic.
Actually, we suggest following this up with the Balancing HypoTonic no matter what, because that's one of our favorite products. It's marvelous.
How to Use
Ingredients
APRICOT KERNEL OIL improves barrier function by supplying nutrients needed by the stratum corneum.

In the old days, families used security alarm systems to scare away invaders with sound and alert the police. Sometimes, criminals could find ways to avoid setting off the alarm, or the police wouldn‚Äôt arrive in time to make the arrest. Today, surveillance cameras provide the solution of capturing the robber‚Äôs activity on video so that even if he gets away, you have at least captured his face and actions. In addition to protecting your home from intruders, there are many ways you can use security cameras in an integrated control system, such as checking in on children, monitoring house staff or babysitters, keeping an eye on the pool, driveway, or play area, and managing your entry system. Read on to learn more.

Going to Disney World for vacation? You can make sure your home is safe and in good condition at all times with an app on your phone. Use your smartphone to view various cameras around your home or let the system update you with text message alerts. If a person hops the fence and enters your backyard, you‚Äôll know it with real-time updates and video clips of the intruder. You‚Äôll be able to determine if it‚Äôs a stranger, or just a neighbor or mail man, and then act accordingly. If you are busy riding space mountain, you can play the recorded video later at your convenience.
Video surveillance solutions not only help protect your home, but they also assist with daily activities. When the doorbell rings, pull up the video outside your front door and check who it is. If it‚Äôs a friend, the delivery guy, or your spouse who forgot their keys, simply press a button and let them in with your automatic keyless entry system.
It would definitely waste a lot your time if you had to sit and watch hours of video to find the recorded action you are looking for. Motion sensors help.
With HD video, mobile control, and real-time image capture, you can keep your home safer and stay in control of all the happenings around you.

KUCCPS is set to review the Minimum entry requirements to universities and colleges. This follows the realization that majority of students are locked out of their dream careers for failing to meet certain subject grades.
According to Experts, some subjects required for certain courses are highly weighted, yet they are not relevant in training, while in other cases, some subjects relevant to the training are omitted or less emphasized.
Because of this, there have arisen several complaints since students have been missing their dream courses. Subject clusters which dictate minimum mandatory requirements for various programmes were last reviewed three years ago.

Latest: September 2021 TSC Internship Interview Merit Lists Per County
KUCCPS Chief Executive Officer Mercy Wahome said the review was necessary since the last one was done in 2017.Universities vice-chancellors, academic registrars and representatives of the professional bodies are expected to meet today at Kenyatta University to discuss proposals on entry requirements to the various courses.
A similar stakeholder meeting will be held for middle-level colleges next week, which will discuss admission criteria for reviewing of diplomas and certificates.
Wahome said that KUCCPS had been using the degree cluster document, as the criteria for placement of government-sponsored students to universities.
‚ÄúOver the past placement cycles, KUCCPS received concerns and suggestions from training institutions and other stakeholders on the need to review the criteria,‚Äù she said.
Responding to the concerns, Wahome revealed that an Independent Criteria Review Committee (ICRC) was established to receive, collate and analyse the proposed changes for degree and TVET programmes.

‚ÄúThe committee looked into each cluster for the degree programmes and the respective minimum subject grade requirements and taking into account the requirements provided by professional or regulatory bodies and proposals from the training institutions,‚Äù reads the letter addressed to VCs and Academic Registrars.
Speaking during a media engagement workshop last week, Wahome said regulatory bodies, training institutions and in some cases employers have raised questions over the minimum entry requirements used for some courses.
‚ÄúIt has been a difficult time because regulatory bodies want this, the training institutions also say this requirement ought to be adjusted this way and this puts KUCCPS at a difficult spot,‚Äù Wahome said.
Teachers and students pursuing agriculture-based courses, who are currently required to have C+ in Biology and Chemistry, may be the greatest beneficiaries if the placement criteria are revised.
In the new proposals, however, this requirement has been reduced to a C plain for both subjects. Agriculture (C+) has also been introduced as an alternative to the C plain in Biology.Boucle earrings

We weren‚Äôt able to get all five of the boxes in the Grumpy Grandeur series because the trail leading to the mountain summit was closed for the winter rattlesnake hoe-down. But we did get three boxes, and it was a beautiful day. I also checked on the two boxes that I‚Äôd placed in the same area ‚Äì they were doing pretty well with several visitors, although the actual container holding the first stamp was gone. Strangely, the stamp itself was just sitting right in its hiding spot. Weird!
After boxing Volcan, we found a couple more letterboxes ‚Äì one near Dudley‚Äôs Baker and another near the Wild Animal Park. It was a great day, a mellow drive, and I‚Äôm glad I finally got out. It had been too long since I‚Äôd gone letterboxing!

A team of researchers from the Freiburg University Medical Center and the Cluster of Excellence CIBSS has shown that a severe inflammatory response can develop in the central nervous system of Covid-19 patients involving different immune cells around the vascular system and in the brain tissue. The team, led by Professors Dr Marco Prinz and Dr Bertram Bengsch, has published its results in Immunity.
‚ÄúEven though there was already evidence of central nervous system involvement in Covid-19, the extent of inflammation in the brain surprised us,‚Äù lead author Henrike Sali√© is quoted as saying on the Freiburg University website. And lead author Dr Marius Schwabenland is quoted as saying: ‚ÄúIn particular the many microglial nodules we detected cannot usually be found in the healthy brain.‚Äù
Using a novel measurement method, they determined different cell types as well as virus-infected cells and their spatial interaction in previously unseen detail.
‚ÄúEven compared to other inflammatory brain diseases, the inflammatory responses triggered by Covid-19 are unique and indicate a severe disturbance of the brain‚Äôs immune response,‚Äù Dr Prinz is quoted as saying.

+49 (721) 981 912 06After exacting revenge on one team that has tripped them up along the way, the Toronto Maple Leafs still have another score to settle Friday when they pay a visit to the San Jose Sharks.
The Leafs will enter off a 6-2 road victory Wednesday over the Los Angeles Kings that was an impressive answer for the 5-1 thumping the Kings delivered at Toronto on Nov. 8. That defeat was one of the few blemishes over the last month as Toronto has gone 12-2-0 since Oct. 27.
The impressive 14-game run has come after the Leafs were forced to do some soul searching following a four-game losing streak that was part of a bigger stumble when they lost five of six over the first two weeks of the season. During that slide, Toronto lost at home 5-3 to the Sharks on Oct. 22.
John Tavares and Pierre Engvall each scored a goal and had an assist in a four-goal second period for Toronto on Wednesday, while Auston Matthews also found the back of the net in the period.
Matthews was playing in just his second game when the Leafs and Sharks met earlier in the season and did not make much of an impact in 22 minutes of ice time. He missed the first three games of the season as he finished his rehab from offseason wrist surgery.
He appears back on track with 17 points (eight goals), while Tavares leads the team with 18 points (nine goals). But the Leafs have not been an offensive juggernaut lately, even if their month of success and their scoring eruption against the Kings seem to suggest otherwise.
"We've played good hockey on the road here of late, but we haven't gotten the goals, so we've really had to grind it out to the very end," Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said. "It's nice to have a nice cushion and leave (Los Angeles) with lots of positives."
The Sharks are just 3-4-0 since Nov. 11 but have won their last two games, including a resounding 6-3 decision at home over the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday. It has been an up-and-down season in San Jose, highlighted by the fact the team lost three consecutive games after the victory at Toronto made them 4-0-0 to open the season.
Timo Meier's blast from the high slot through traffic Wednesday broke a 3-all tie with fewer than nine minutes to play, while Logan Couture and Jacob Middleton each scored empty-net goals in the final 1:04.
"You could just see how happy and excited the guys were for each other," Sharks head coach Bob Boughner said. "That goes a long way. It starts with competing, sticking up for each other, and acting like a family."
Nick Bonino also scored a goal for San Jose. It was his first goal in 19 games with the Sharks and it came in his 700th career game.
"That was one of the happiest goal piles I've been in," Bonino said. "The guys were pretty happy for me, so I felt like I could exhale finally."
Sharks center Jonathan Dahlen did not play Wednesday, missing his second consecutive game because of an upper-body injury.

Many reported missing simple things such as face-to-face meetings (39 percent), office celebrations (35 percent), and after-work happy hours (34 percent).
And it hasn‚Äôt been any easier for people who have recently started a remote position.
A mere 4 percent of new hires said the virtual onboarding process wasn‚Äôt difficult, compared to in-person training. Many attributed this to not knowing how to connect with their colleagues.
Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Volley, the survey also found 63 percent felt less engaged with their team, as the average employee felt disconnected by August 2020.
Only 14 percent of respondents said they‚Äôre more confident when it comes to socializing with their colleagues.
About the same number (16 percent) believe sudden in-office gatherings wouldn‚Äôt be awkward, as 82 percent of respondents who would find it uncomfortable have avoided attending them solely for that reason.
Additionally, two-thirds said they work directly with someone who they wouldn‚Äôt be able to pick out of a lineup and recognize by name only.
So how can teams address this? Three in five find something lacking in the quality of communication with their co-workers, and 77 percent agree better communication leads to better work culture.
‚ÄúThe two main challenges with remote work are lack of communication and loneliness,‚Äù said Josh Little, Founder & CEO of Volley.
‚ÄúWe hear those concerns every day. It‚Äôs why people go searching for a solution like Volley ‚Äì to improve communication and increase connection.‚Äù
As the average employee switches between three work communication tools throughout their day, only 13 percent said they‚Äôre not overwhelmed by the number of messages in their inbox.
More than three in five (64 percent) percent find chat and email communication more difficult than face-to-face meetings, as 72 percent believe it‚Äôs not only what you say, but how you say it that matters.
Though nearly all workers (91 percent) retype messages and emails for clarity at least once a day, 87 percent experience miscommunications weekly, and nearly half (47 percent) said this occurs four or more times every week.
While dealing with the challenges of chatting and emailing, only 15 percent have seen their time spent in meetings decrease since the pandemic.
In fact, more than seven in 10 (73 percent) default to video calls whenever they‚Äôre looking to communicate something important.
‚ÄúThe data shows that the existing communication tools aren‚Äôt cutting it,‚Äù continued Little.
‚ÄúThey were built for an old world with different needs. Today‚Äôs teams need a new way to communicate that gives them the richness of face-to-face interaction in an asynchronous format. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre focused on.‚Äù

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to examine the effects of different lactate elevation protocols on the determination of the lactate minimum (Lac(min)) point.
METHODS: Eight highly trained racing cyclists each completed four continuous ramp lactate minimum tests using the following blood lactate elevation protocols: 1) continuous ramp maximal aerobic power (RMP(max)) assessment, 2) 30-s maximal sprint, 3) 40-s maximal sprint, and 4) two 20-s maximal sprints separated by a 1-min recovery. Each blood lactate elevation protocol was followed by a 5-min active recovery leading into a continuous ramp test commencing at a power of 60% of RMP(max), using a 6 W x min ramp rate, lasting 15 min.
RESULTS: Peak [La](b) values were significantly higher (P > 0.05) after the RMP(max) compared with all other protocols and higher in the 40-s versus 30-s sprint. However, by the start of Lac(min) ramp, [La](b) after the RMP(max) was no longer higher than the 40-s sprint, but Lac(min) [La](b) was similar for all protocols. This resulted in no differences in the total decline of [La](b) measured as a percentage from the highest to the lowest value. At Lac(min) point, there were no significant differences in power (P > 0.05), but heart rate was higher in the RMP versus 2 x 20 s and VO(2) was significantly higher after the 40 s compared with the 2 x 20 s protocol.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the determination of lactate minimum power in cycling is not dependent upon the lactate elevation protocol.

And this Fisher State Fair Scones recipe is authentic, delicious, and memorable.
It was always a sizzling day at the end of summer, the state fair. An adventurous summer was winding down, a new school year on the horizon. Friends had scattered far and wide. School shopping had commenced, supplies neatly stored in a new backpack, waiting for that first day following Labor Day. It was the last hurrah to summer, the state fair.
It was the same every year. The anticipation of the state fair. Like a ritual of summer.
A Walk Down State Fair Memory Lane
The rides were always first, but when I‚Äôd exhausted all my ride tickets, I headed to the exhibits. In addition to the sheep and horse exhibits, it was the women‚Äôs pavilion where I spent hours. From blue ribbon pies to baked goods, tatting, and spinning.
But then‚Ä¶ the aroma of fair food would inevitably permeate the Pavillion. Down through the funnel cake booths and around the BBQ tent was the most delicious food booth ever. At least to me.
Standing in long lines was never a problem for those warm-from-the-oven scones, oozing with sweet raspberry jam.
And those are my state fair memories. What are yours?
For many, a quintessential component of summer is the state fair. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ hard to miss. It‚Äôs exciting, nostalgic, entertaining‚Ä¶ all wrapped up into one summery bundle.
State Fair Corn Dogs vs Pronto Pups?
In our State Fair article series, I‚Äôve written a post on a perennial favorite corn dog or Pronto Pup recipe.
By the way‚Ä¶ do you know the difference? Corn dogs vs Pronto Pup?
Turns out‚Ä¶ only the batter differentiates the two. Corn dogs are, as you know, coated with corn batter while Pronto Pups are made from pancake or waffle batter. Getting hungry yet?
State Fair Scones
Let‚Äôs talk about scones. I was determined to find the scone recipe used at the fair I‚Äôd enjoyed so much as a kid.
What I found was much more than a recipe! It was a story, an American story of extraordinary success and forgotten history, and abandoned dreams.
Fisher State Fair Scones Story
In April of 1911, two brothers, O.W. Fisher and O.D. Fisher had a dream of milling high-quality flour.
By June 1 of the same year, the Fisher brothers celebrated the official opening of Fisher Mill and began milling operations on Harbor Island, nestled between what is now downtown Seattle and the nearby neighborhood of West Seattle along the Duwamish Waterway off Elliot Bay.
Where once the man-made Harbor Island was void, soon after a mill with towering cylinders of cement that reached the sky dominated the landscape. The Fisher Mill was one of the first industrial businesses to open on Harbor Island and soon after, became the largest flour mill in the Western United States.
In fact, the Mill became so prominent, it milled 3 million pounds of wheat‚Ä¶ every day. That‚Äôs the equivalent of the annual average production of 2,500 acres of wheatland‚Ä¶ every day.
To promote the Mill‚Äôs high-quality flour, they came up with the idea of creating a scone they could serve piping hot and sell at the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition or World‚Äôs Fair in San Francisco.
Incredibly successful, the president of the Washington State Fair, William H. Paulhamus, petitioned the Fishers to sell the very same scones at their fair and to sweeten the deal, offered to donate raspberry jam from his own farm in Oregon.
The deal was struck. And in the same year, in a corner booth under the grandstand, they began to sell their now-famous state fair scones.
One hundred and five years later, their scones are still sold at state fairs.
In 2015, at the Washington State Fair, in the same grandstand booth, 1.6 million scones, piping hot, dripping in honey butter, and layered with freshly made raspberry jam.
On Sept. 15, 2011, they sold their 100th millionth scone, from the very same location ‚Äî the Washington State Fair in Puyallup ‚Äî where it all began. On average, 1.5 million scones are sold each year.
A spectacular story of innovation, hard work, and American opportunity. The Fisher company would go on to purchase media outlets, eventually owning 20 television and numerous radio stations, forming Fisher Communications, in the beginning, to promote their flour. Fisher would be sold to Sinclair in 2013 for $373 million.
And the Mill? It still stands as a testament to commerce and ingenuity, a beacon still dominating the landscape of Harbor Island where it all began more than a hundred years ago.
Fast Forward
The story doesn‚Äôt end there. In fact, there isn‚Äôt an ending, at least one that you might expect. And, it isn‚Äôt happy.
Today, the Mill is but an eerie tomb, abandoned, a sprawling catacomb of another day, an era gone by. A structure that stands like a museum, frozen in time. A building now owned by King County and left to wither and waste away. A facility rumored to be designated as a solid waste disposal.
‚ÄúAround every corner, on every wall, are reminders that this is a boneyard of industry, a place where old Seattle optimism and audacity got old and curled up to die. Graffiti, spray-painted pictures of angry faces and adorable animals, and everything in between is on every wall of every room.‚Äù (KOMO).
And that, my friends, is the story of American greatness and a forgotten history.
But the scones live on.

Hi there! The ingredients list shortening, but the directions read to, ‚Äúcut in butter‚Äù. Which one to use? Thanks!
Hi Christine! Thanks for that catch. It is shortening. Although when I‚Äôm out, I do substitute butter (which I always have on hand). The texture is a bit different. I must have been thinking about that when I wrote the instructions. I‚Äôve updated the post. Thanks again!
I have enjoyed scones at the fair my whole life. This recipe really brings back the experience! This will be a regular at our house.

On December 25, 2020, I drove to pick up a woman and her mother. When passengers ask Lyft to take a taxi, they can drag the ‚Äúlocation pin‚Äù in the app to the exact location where they want to board the bus. The pick-up location for this ride is not a place where I can drive, although I can reach within 25 feet. When the two got into my car, my daughter told me that I was not where she put the pin. She called me every name in the book and asked me to ‚Äúcall Lyft‚Äù to get a refund. The mother dramatically began to say her daughter‚Äôs name over and over again, surprised at her doing this and begged her to apologize. The daughter refused to let it go. I cancelled the trip. I remember how my mother said her daughter‚Äôs name over and over again. I keep vivid memories of the worst-behaving passengers. I think that keeping the images of these faces will increase my chances of survival. Some people think this is a symptom of PTSD.
Two months later, I checked my Facebook feed and saw the woman‚Äôs face in my ‚ÄúPeople You May Know‚Äù section. This scared me. How did she get there? What if she is following me and wants to complain about the positioning pin again? I don‚Äôt want to be friends with her on Facebook, nor do I want to be friends with her in real life.I can‚Äôt help hearing her voice in the car, it seems Facebook Also paying attention. Google It may also have been tracking the ride.
Thirty years ago, Hansen said, ‚ÄúBefore there was so much monitoring or computer information on people, when a problem appeared, everyone was very concerned about it,‚Äù he said. Now, people have been ‚Äúwishful thinking that even if they provide a lot of information, they will not be used to deal with them, or will not be used to deal with them too much.‚Äù He said that they have never clearly understood how shared information is. easy. Based on my experience as a driver, when viewed through an app like Lyft, it is easy to treat other people as abstract and unreal and treat them accordingly.
I provide basic services to many passengers. For different reasons, they could not drive by themselves, and I acted as an enhanced service animal, albeit temporarily. Passengers may not be able to use public transportation, or they may have medical conditions that prevent them from driving. It‚Äôs nice to know that I‚Äôm helping people go to work or just to get out of the house.
However, in order to make the most money in the shortest time, you must go to the bar to pick up people. Therefore, drinking is a catalyst for many Lyft rides. A friend sitting next to you in the bar tells you that you have had enough drinks and it has been replaced by a ride-hailing app, allowing you to drink as much as you want, because there is always a driver to pick you up and tap a few on your phone. Some of these rides are painful to me.
My super-applied theory is still the best explanation. I have to explain what people say and do in my car when they feel that there is no one worthy of recognition around them. And the problem is not as obvious as the stains left by Instant Pot‚Äôs sweet and sour meatballs sprinkled on my back seat. They are things like privacy and medical issues, my own responsibility for what passengers do, and a sense of upholding our human dignity.Officers searching for a missing woman from Ramsbottom have found a body.
The body was found in the River Irwell in Bury at around 1pm on Wednesday, April 1.
Formal identification is yet to be carried out, but officers believe the body to be that of the missing 58-year-old woman Valerie Weston.
She was last seen at around 10.50pm on Monday, March 30 at her home on Chapel Terrace in Ramsbottom by neighbours who had spent the evening with her.
It is believed that she had gone missing from home some time after this.
There are no suspicious circumstances and a file will be prepared for the coroner.
Inspector Andrew Carter, of Lancashire Police, said: ‚ÄúOfficers are supporting the family at this difficult time and our thoughts are with them.‚Äù
A large police presence was at the river yesterday including four police vehicles, a search helicopter and an underwater search unit.
Neighbours in the Irwell Vale neighbourhood have spoken of their shock.
One resident said: ‚ÄúThere was a flood warning issued for the River Irwell on Monday night.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if she got the message and then went out to check the level of the river. The river was really high.
‚ÄúWhen the family came home the door was open and there was a cup of tea out and she wasn‚Äôt there.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know her well apart from top say hello to. We don‚Äôt know for definite what‚Äôs happened. It‚Äôs just a mystery and the neighbours are really upset.‚Äù
Another neighbour on Chapel Terrace described Valerie Weston as a ‚Äòlovely neighbour and a beautiful person‚Äô.Today‚Äôs raging topic in the lefty blogosphere: is Mark Halperin merely a wanker? Or is he already Galactic Wanker of the Year a mere week into 2010?
The proximate cause of this conversation is his Time article, ‚ÄúA Report Card on Obama‚Äôs First Year.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what he says Obama did well: work with Congress, handle foreign policy, focus on the long term, take executive action, and steer clear of scandal. Not bad!
But here‚Äôs where he did less well: managing his image, creating administration stars, wooing the great and good, changing the tone, and managing the White House policy process. Hmmm. As pretty much everyone has commented,
the good stuff is all substantive, while the bad stuff, with one exception, is all about optics and atmospherics. Do these lists really add up to an equal amount of good and bad?
Obviously not, although I think it‚Äôs worth defending Halperin in one narrow way: the world is what it is, and if the world is full of people who think that optics and atmospherics are a big deal, then optics and atmospherics are a big deal. Deal with it. Aside from that, though, the real question is whether Halperin is merely reporting this stuff or if he actively approves of it. Take this passage, from his bit about Obama failing to change the tone in Washington:.
What to make of this? On the one hand, Halperin fails to mention that Obama agreed to let tax cuts make up 40% of the stimulus bill and still couldn‚Äôt get any Republican support. On the other hand, he pretty clearly lays the blame for this on weak Republicans who have become slaves to the most extreme part of their base. But then, on the third hand, he whipsaws back and suggests that it‚Äôs all Obama‚Äôs fault anyway, because, well, he‚Äôs the president. If he wants to be successful, then one way or another he needs to figure out a way to make Republicans play ball.
But is Halperin saying this is how things ought to be, or is he merely reporting that, like it or not, this is the way things are? Beats me. It gets harder and harder to tell at places like Time these days. In any case, maybe Halperin should follow up with a list of five things the media and the Beltway glitterati are doing better than you think ‚Äî and five things they‚Äôre doing worse. That would be some serious link bait.- Python Programming

Simran C.
Worst customer service ever. My appointment was for 10:15 and no one got started on me till 11. I came here for dipping powder manicure but they absolutely had no idea about the colors or how to do it. Some of the colors that I picked were missing and I had to go with what was left. Once my nails were done, they looked worse than what I came in with. When I requested to do a re-do or change the top coat, I was denied that service and told "nothing can be done now". If you have a service listed, please familiarize yourself with how it is done. I spent 2 hours 30 mins in this salon with unpleasant results at the end.
Pablo Cardenas
They have a variety of colors to choose from, the music is calming and they're very kind and careful so they don't hurt you. I will be coming back here to get another pedicure
Shelley F.
I had horrible cuticle damage and they took such care making it better. Really nice salon.
Karen D.
The ladies here that did our pedis were lovely! They made us feel very welcomed and made my toes look so pretty.
Claire C.
I called pretty late around 530pm and they fit me in for a mani dip and regular pedi. They sat me down right away and offered a water or a sparkling water. They already had the water warm and ready after calling five min prior. The chairs were brand new so comfortable and the massage chair made it even more relaxing. After I was done they waxed my eye brows. Everything was perfect! I give them five stars for excellent customer service, the ambiance was beautiful, they really care and make sure you're happy before you leave. I'll definitely be coming back! Thank you all for accommodating me and for all you're hard work and dedication to making your customers happy.
Jin K.
I will start with the positive: they accept walk-ins, I called and made an appointment though for 3:30pm. Vivian was my nail tech. She's very nice and friendly. She offered me a beverage. She tried her best to do my full set because I have an appointment for work at 5pm. They did give me a discount which I will give the reason why they had given it to me in the first place. The negative: my appointment was 3:30pm, I did arrive a bit early but didn't mind the wait. They didn't start on me until 4:15pm. The phone kept ringing and Vivian had to answer it multiple times even though there were other techs there who started on their clients after me. Because she had to answer the phone and also taking other workers' clients payment, it delayed me a lot. Originally I was getting French ombr√© but wasn't able to get it because no one there at the time could do color powder acrylic. So I decided to do solid gel color. There was a teen next to me who had dipped powder on her real nails, one nail tech had misunderstood what she said and so she started cutting off her real nails thinking she wanted a full set... poor girl was very shy but was very mad that her real nails got cut off anyways back to my nails: they are uneven, already chip or cracked (got a gap on each thumb ) within less than an hour. Sigh
Courtney D.
Just had a regular manicure. Was planning to just go with a natural subtle pink. She asked me if I wanted a design so I said sure why not. Showed her a picture of a design with swirly lines and she did so good!
Gracie H.
If you aren't currently going to Smiley Nails- you should. Ngoc did an amazing job applying dip power to my nails. She was so attentive to details and the outcome was beautiful. Even the customers sitting next to me complimented my nails and the fine work Ngoc had done. The entire staff is wonderful here, they're extremely accommodating and really do a thorough and great job. The salon is always clean, it has capacity for lots of visitors, and they have their own private parking lot right out from in downtown Walnut Creek which is practically unheard of. Go to smiley nails- you won't be disappointed. Thanks Ngoc and team!
Lucy N.
Best Nail Salon I've ever been to; hands down. I work near by, found the place on Yelp and called for a last minute appointment. I'm Vietnamese and come from a family of nail salons. I love and appreciate professionalism, genuineness, and skills. My new favorite! Needless to say Ngoc did my nails and I didn't get the name of the technician who did my pedicure, but both were amazing and did a beautiful job! I will be back frequently. Thank you Co Ngoc!
Kate S.
I will never go to another nail salon...ever. I mean it. The technicians were amazing, and what I loved the most was that they had a mother hen watching and making sure everything was perfect. I got a great pedi, and my daughter got exactly what she asked for.Tiger Cub Graduation - Three Candle Ceremony

Washington, D.C. ‚Äì Today, the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) began accepting grant applications. Tom Ben√©, President & CEO of the National Restaurant Association released the following statement about the launch of the federal relief program:
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs launch of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund provides long-awaited hope for tens of thousands of restaurants who are on a long path to recovery. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has done admirable work in creating a totally new relief program in just two months, and we appreciate our strong partnership with them.
‚ÄúThe question on the minds of many is what happens when applications outpace the available funds. Restaurants are operating in an uncertain environment, with continued needs to restore customer confidence in their safety and to bring workers back into the economy. We will continue to work with policymakers to secure a comprehensive set of solutions, including additional funding for the RRF.‚Äù
The restaurant industry has been the hardest hit during the pandemic. Between March 2020 and April 2021, restaurant and foodservice sales were down $280 billion from expected levels and 110,000 restaurants have closed permanently or long-term. For nearly 15 months, securing industry-specific recovery grants has been the primary goal of the National Restaurant Association.
Because funds are limited, the Association encourages all eligible applicants to apply as soon as possible. While priority groups will have 21 days of priority access, applications from all eligible applicants will not be ruled ineligible if they apply during the prioritization period. The SBA will coordinate the time of submission to determine the order of grant distribution.

- Updated Association FAQ document
- Step-by-Step Guide to Applying for the RRF
- SBA video tour of the Application Portal
- An archive of past webinars with our state partners and SBA. The Multicultural Foodservice and Hospitality Alliance and the SBA Administrator hosted a discussion on how the 21-day priority period works for socially and economically disadvantaged-owned businesses.Titleist

He is most popularly known for directing big Hollywood films like Snow White and the Huntsman in 2012 and Ghost in the Shell in 2017. Sanders has also directed several television advertisements like The Life for Halo 3: ODST. The director even won two Golden Lions at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival for it. Snow White and the Huntsman was Sander‚Äôs first feature film. It was released in 2012 and did decently at the box office.
According to reports, Sanders passed up on the offer to direct the fifth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. After that, In 2017, he got the opportunity to direct Ghost in the Shell which is a film adaptation of science fiction manga of the same name. Scarlett Johansson was the main character in the movie. Scarlett Johansson had received major criticism for playing a role of an Asian character. The audiences complained about the lack of representation in the movie. Besides Sander‚Äôs average professional career, he is most well-known for his scandal involving actress Kristen Stewart, who had worked with him back in 2012‚Äôs Snow White and the Huntsman. Now we‚Äôll see who he is currently dating.
Who Is Rupert Sanders Dating?
British director Rupert Sanders is reportedly dating Alexandra Keating. She is the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating. Her exact birthdate is unavailable, but Alexandra was born in 1985 and is 36 years old.
Sydney-based artist Oliver Watts confirmed the relationship. He seems to be a mutual friend of the couple. In fact, it was his painting that sparked the rumours of the two being in a relationship in the first place. The pair apparently sat for a painting by Watts. It was a portrait he made when they went to enjoy a sailing trip around Sydney‚Äôs Rose Bay together. The painting even made it to the 2020‚Äôs Archibald Prize.
According to reports, Oliver talks very highly of the couple. He explains that his painting portrays ‚Äòa tender conversation piece of a couple‚Äô. He claims that Alexandra is happy that Rupert is her boyfriend. Watts went as far as to title the painting as ‚ÄòAlexandra Keating and Rupert Sanders on a Yacht in Sydney‚Äô.

The hard-working young woman even made it to the 30 under 30 list by Forbes in 2015. She made it to the prestigious list after co-founding a publishing platform called DWNLD. The business venture is a mobile service that allows users to turn content from a site into an app. Following its launch, the company was able to raise approximately US$2.8 million after its establishment in 2015.

The Biggest Rupert Sanders Scandal
Instead of being famous for being a good director, Rupert Sanders is more popular for being a highly controversial one. The British director made headlines and broke the internet in 2012 when he was caught cheating on his wife with young actress Kristen Stewart. The two probably met on the sets of Rupert‚Äôs first feature film as a director Snow White and the Huntsman in which Kristen was starring in a major role. The two were in an intimate embrace in the famous paparazzi picture. It was especially embarrassing because both the celebs were cheating on their significant others at the time. Rupert Sanders was cheating on his wife of 10 years, and the mother of his two children, British Vogue model Liberty Ross and actress Kristen Stewart was cheating on her Twilight franchise co-actor and boyfriend Robert Pattinson.
Both celebrities issued public apologies to the audience as well as their significant others. Following the scandal, Rupert and Liberty finalised their divorce in 2014. His reputation took a major hit during this time, but it is safe to say that he has bounced back from that now.

Here‚Äôs how to get your Ring video doorbell synced up with your lightsNovember 22, 2021
Investing in a few smart Wi-Fi plugs is one of the easiest, most inexpensive ways to get your smart home set up. However, if you‚Äôve already jumped on the bandwagon and purchased a few Ring products like the Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 or even a security camera to keep an eye on your home, you‚Äôll want to make sure you can get other devices in your home connected all under one roof (or in this case, app). These are the top smart plugs that work with the Ring app to ensure that all your devices communicate without any glitches.
Rain or shine
Ring Outdoor Smart Plug
Staff Pick
There‚Äôs no doubt that the Ring Outdoor Smart Plug, which just so happens to be our top ranking outdoor smart Wi-Fi plug, will work like a charm with the Ring app. It‚Äôll also help you get any outdoor lights and appliances synced up with your Ring doorbells and cameras, so everything works like a breeze.
$30 at Amazon $30 at Best Buy $30 at Home Depot
Full control
Leviton DZPA1-2BW Decora Smart Plug-in Outlet
Turn floodlights, lamps, or fans on or off with the help of this Z-Wave Hub-compatible smart plug. Installation is easier than ever and doesn‚Äôt require toying around with wiring. Just plug it in, set it up, and you‚Äôre ready to go.
$30 at Amazon
$31 at Best Buy
$75 at Home Depot (2 Pack)
Permanent fixture
GE In-Wall Smart Outlet
Though technically not a smart plug, this outlet from GE replaces the one you already have, so whatever is plugged in can be turned on or off from the Ring App. Just keep in mind that you‚Äôll only be able to control one of the outlets from the app while the other remains on always.
Candlelit
GE Plug-In Dimmer
If you don‚Äôt want to mess around with wires, this plug from GE not only lets you turn your lights on and off, but you can easily dim them from the Ring app to create the perfect evening lighting when you‚Äôre watching a movie or eating dinner.
From $41 at Amazon $43 at Lowes $65 at Home Depot
Shine a light
Leviton DZPD3-2BW Decora Smart Plug-in Dimmer
This smart plug is much like the Leviton Decora Smart Plug-in Outlet, but with dimmable magic powers. Plug in your favorite reading lamp to be able to turn it on, off, and get just the right amount of brightness.
$36 at Amazon
$36 at Best Buy
Not every smart plug works with the Ring app
There‚Äôs no shortage of smart plugs out there that can help you get your lights, fans, and appliances working with Google Home or Alexa. But if you own a few Ring home security products and want to make sure everything is synced and can communicate adequately in the Ring app, your best bet is the Ring Outdoor Smart Plug. Not only does it come with two outlets that you can control independently, but you can keep this plug outside without fearing a few raindrops.
If you want an affordable smart plug from a reputable brand that will blend into the walls of your home, then you can‚Äôt go wrong with the Leviton Decora Smart Plug-in Outlet or Smart Plug-in Dimmer. Both picks will work smoothly with the Ring app and enable you to turn any devices plugged into the outlet on and off. With the dimmer, though, there‚Äôs the bonus of being able to adjust your lighting‚Äôs brightness.

They are most abundant in arid climates and range in size from 20mm to 100mm in length. The larger species tend to be nocturnal while the smaller brightly colored species are diurnal. These creatures are also commonly called windspiders, windscorpions, red romans, beardcutters, haircutters, hunting spiders, and sunspiders.
Besides the Middle East, they can also be found in Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and North America (mainly in the desert southwest).
Despite their appearance and their strong bite, camel spiders are not likely to harm humans. They once were considered venomous and extremely dangerous but it is now thought that the only risk of injury resulting from them is caused by shock or infection following a bite. There is no evidence of venom in any part of their body.
When active during the day they avoid the hot patches of ground by running from one shadow to another. In the case of humans (and other large animals) that have a moving shadow, the camel spider repeatedly moves into the shadow. This gives the impression that the animal is chasing the person (or animal) thus camel spiders' moniker "the hunting spider".
Although they may seem fierce and intimidating they perform some good to mankind by keeping scorpion, spider and insect populations in check. They have also been known to eat lizards, mice, small birds, and other smaller animals. They have voracious appetites and will often gorge themselves until they nearly pop.

Companies spend too little time really understanding what makes their people unique and how this impacts their everyday work experience. In fact, many employees are faced with strong pressures to change who they are in order to meet the expectations of their job, manager, team, or culture. This pressure can cause great strain, disengagement, and eventual turnover.
You can successfully improve engagement when you address disengagement at the individual level. Once you understand an individual, you will realize how he/she actually fits into the workplace, on the team, and in a specific role. And, you can learn how he/she has become disengaged by exploring how environmental pressures in the workplace are impacting that individual.
Curious to know how your employees really feel? Review the results of the Predictive Index Employee Engagement report to learn more about the factors that motivate and frustrate 3,000 employees across 20 different industries.
Four environment pressures of employee disengagement
There are many environmental pressures that individuals face which can impact overall employee engagement at your company. We‚Äôve boiled them down to four specific pressures ‚Äì job fit, manager impact, culture, and team dynamics.
1. Job fit ‚Äì Misalignment between someone‚Äôs natural tendencies and key job responsibilities
Job fit is truly the most important element in all of human capital management (HCM). The disengagement forces are at play here when someone is a poor fit for the job. One way to avoid this when hiring or promoting someone is to understand the person‚Äôs personality and behavioral characteristics so you can determine if there‚Äôs alignment between the person and job role. No surprise, when you hire the right person for the right job you‚Äôll find they have higher performance, higher job satisfaction, they stay longer, and are generally more engaged. In addition, due to the rapidly changing work environment, jobs often take on new roles and responsibilities. What a person was hired to do on day one may very well shift over time. So while it‚Äôs important to hire right, it‚Äôs equally important to keep a close eye on how the behavioral demands of the job role might evolve. It‚Äôs possible that if the role changes too much, it could be a stretch for the behavioral characteristics of the employee.
2. Manager impact ‚Äì Misalignment between manager and staff
As the saying goes, people don‚Äôt leave companies, they leave managers. While not always true, it‚Äôs true most of the time. And after all, if a manager is not focused on inspiring their employees to be their best, they are not managing at all. Managers need to adapt their management style to each employee‚Äôs needs, drives, and behavioral preferences in order to have maximum impact, engagement, and productivity out of each employee. To do this successfully, you have to understand what your employees‚Äô needs and drives include. Yes, this is easier said than done ‚Äì management is hard work. Remember the golden rule ‚ÄúDo unto others as you would have them do unto you?‚Äù Well, that does not apply to good people management. If you‚Äôre a manager, here‚Äôs a new golden rule: ‚ÄúDo unto others what motivates, excites, and engages them.‚Äù
3. Culture ‚Äì When employees feel like what the culture expects of them isn‚Äôt who they really are
Everyone dreams about a perfectly aligned culture ‚Äì one where the decisions, actions, and behaviors that people take at all levels in an organization are rewarded and valued by the leadership and the overall organizational culture. Does this utopian company really exist? No, there really is no such thing as a ‚Äúperfectly aligned‚Äù culture. That said, a major disengagement force is at play when people work in a culture that expects them to be a lot different than who they really are. When they feel this burden, it‚Äôs a recipe for feeling like a disconnected misfit and ultimately provides a good reason to leave.
4. Team dynamics ‚Äì When an employee feels like he/she is unlike the team
Feelings of not belonging on a team how learn how these can be used as an advantage to take the greater team forward versus something that divides them. If you think you have some people who are black sheep or potential black sheep, you need to uncover and unlock their value instead of so quickly deciding they don‚Äôt belong.

Our engagement kit will teach you how to decode your employees and their work experience in order to make disengagement a thing of the past.gkciet.ac.in GKCIET Jobs 2021 Notification for West Bengal Govt Jobs.

While we‚Äôre only talking about the overlap between audience segmentation and discrimination in social media advertising here today, this practice is very broad and has been around for a long time. (Probably forever.) Audience discrimination is present in every industry. And while it‚Äôs not acceptable in any sector, we are going to narrow our focus and evaluate its impact in social media marketing, specifically as it relates to our work, and how those in our field can move toward positive change today.
It‚Äôs not news that, historically, many brands deliberately excluded demographics they didn‚Äôt want associated with their products. Similar to the way in which redlining was used as a method for (literal) gatekeeping to refuse people of certain races from obtaining mortgages, brands use audience targeting to manipulate who can obtain their products or services. Especially in mid-20th century America, many brands in the luxury goods and financial services industries (and, let‚Äôs be honest, probably a bunch of other industries) specifically targeted only white consumers as they were ‚Äúworried [targeting non-white consumers] would cheapen or denigrate the value of their products in the marketplace with white consumers.‚Äù Of course, this still happens today. It‚Äôs just sneakier. (Akin to the news that‚Äôs going around now about Louis Vuitton sending Gucci purses to Snooki from Jersey Shore. Sneaky.)
Before Facebook changed its targeting options in 2019, it had a controversial targeting option that was literally called ‚Äútarget by exclusion.‚Äù (They weren‚Äôt even trying to euphemize that one.) A 2016 ProPublica investigation found that Facebook advertisers could (and did) create housing ads that allowed posters to exclude Black people. Somehow, it took three years for this to culminate into actual change. In March 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development sued Facebook for violations of the Fair Housing Act, in allowing advertisers to segment audiences by age, income, gender, and other factors for housing ads. This later expanded to include ads relating to jobs and financial services as well. As a result, Facebook no longer allows advertisers to target any ads based on age, gender, or zip code.
And if you‚Äôre wondering how tight these requirements are, wonder no more: We tested it. Multiple times. Unintentionally. After attempting to run an ad broadly referencing housing to people in certain zip codes (cities in comparable population size to the one we were advertising, AKA where we thought audiences would be most likely to be converted), we were required to remove all audience targeting before the ad could run. I can confirm that Facebook now has many, many hoops that advertisers need to jump through before they can run an ad even briefly alluding to housing, jobs, or financial services. Which is a good thing! Inclusivity win!
But this also got me thinking: The murky, grey overlap between audience segmentation and discrimination must extend beyond these three areas. In our own work, how can we ensure our targeting is used for good, instead of perpetuating centuries of blatant discrimination that set the foundation for inequities that are still going strong today?
Look, this question isn‚Äôt anything new. Scholars, marketers, and activists have been scratching their heads about this for decades. Studies have been conducted. Conversations have been had. Tweets have been tweeted. The long-short of it, from what I‚Äôve researched? Well ‚Äì and don‚Äôt roll your eyes when I say it ‚Äì it‚Äôs complicated. And it comes back to definitions.
According to our friends at Oxford, the definition of ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù is: ‚Äúmaking or showing an unfair or prejudicial distinction between different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex.‚Äù To me, it seems like the key part here is ‚Äúunfair or prejudicial.‚Äù That‚Äôs what separates your everyday, run-of-the-mill audience targeting and downright discrimination. Are you segmenting your audience todeliberately exclude certain groups based on prejudice? If so, that‚Äôs a sign that you should reevaluate your audience segments and the perceived purpose behind them. (And maybe reevaluate your moral compass.)
One great way to know that you‚Äôre on the right side of history is if you use audience segmentation as a way to include marginalized groups, rather than exclude them. This means reaching out to (and representing in your advertising) groups that historically have fallen between the cracks when it comes to representation in marketing and advertising. When you compare your existing demographics with your target audience, always ask: Who are we missing? For example: A study from the Association of National Advertisers found that, while Hispanic Americans make up 18.1% of the national population, only 3.6% of advertising spend is targeted at them. I‚Äôm just gonna say it: That‚Äôs racist, folks. When it comes to including marginalized populations in our audience segments, marketers can always do better.
The distinction between segmentation and discrimination is very murky. And complicated. And this observation isn‚Äôt going to solve it with a clean-cut answer. But the bright side is that, from what I‚Äôve seen, it looks like the conversation regarding inclusive and ethical audience targeting is just getting started, and positive changes are being made.
My three rules of thumb when I‚Äôm checking those elusive audience targeting options in Facebook Ads Manager? Expand your network to include untapped marginalized groups. Always ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and understand your purpose when defining audience segments. And, if you think it might be discrimination, well, it probably is. CPA/ABV

I was probably thinking of a Crane Fly when I drew it. Below are a couple of pics I shot close-up of a Crane Fly in my house -- a very welcome guest!
Google Images has better and more detailed photos of them. I suggest you take a peek. You"ll want to remember them as your friend.
Many people are afraid of them because they look like giant mosquitoes with large stingers, but PLEASE DON'T KILL THEM. They are mosquito eaters. They don't sting, nor do they pose any threat to humans at all. If you have them in your home, welcome them! It means you probably have mosquitoes for them to eat.
A few years ago, my daughter contracted a very serious case of West Nile Virus. Even though cases of West Nile are usually mild and benign, the one my daughter had was very serious, complete with encephalitis. I'll never again think of mosquitoes as a mild annoyance, and I'm so glad to have Crane Flies as an alternative to pesticides!
very nice piece, margaret. and thanks for putting out the word...in arkansas we called them "skeeter eaters."

I normally get DH to put them outside again, because the cat likes to chase, catch and chew them! I had no idea that's what they are for - thanks for enlightening me!
I really love your skill at drawing... and I really should spend more time practising. It's easy to get hung up on people watching me though.
I think the aplliqued fabric squares are simply stunning... maybe that's why I am obsessed with fabric and stitching again? The need to "feel" textures for their soothing quality.

PS I love when you visit - it always makes me think!! 'o)

The struggles that patients face and the historical significance of disbelief surrounding the disease are discussed in-depth by Nathalie Wright.
‚ÄúUnrest has recently been shortlisted for an Oscar. The power of documentary film is that viewers are confronted by what is unseen ‚Äì or ignored; it is a medium that conveys something words cannot. Maybe, finally, [ME/CFS] patients are beginning to be seen.‚Äù

One thought on ‚ÄúTime for Unrest: Why patients with [ME/CFS] are demanding justice‚Äù
Thank you for promoting this important story. It is the first mainstream press article to ‚Äúfollow the money‚Äù back to the origin of the Policy of No Research: the disability insurers.
Good luck to your new CRC. Are you aware that this is the second time that NIH has established three CRCs for ME? The first three were quietly shutdown in 2003 just as they were starting to produce useful results such as ‚ÄúAbnormal impedance cardiography predicts symptom severity in chronic fatigue syndrome‚Äù (Peckerman et al , 2003).

Given Andy James‚Äô status as a prolific and renowned guitar teacher, it should come as no surprise that this all-instrumental LP represents a balls-to-the-wall metal masterclass.
Exodus is precision-targeted at the Internet‚Äôs shredheads. We‚Äôre talking ten tracks that span an impressive range of approaches to heavy music. Variety is the spice of life ‚Äì and there‚Äôs plenty of variety on offer here.
Naturally, ultra-dense clusters of high-speed notes are a primary feature on Exodus ‚Äì but personally, I‚Äôm a bigger fan of massive grooves. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed; opening track Ever After and Made Of Stone, Hurricane, From The Dark, and Victory all delivered on that front. Days Gone By drops in some almost obligatory but nonetheless passionate 6/8 epicness; A World Once Lost cranks up the dials labelled Thrash and Shred; Gone is a cool ballad; Never Back Down is another solid thrasher; and closing song Exit Through Ashes is a sombre synth-and-guitar ballad, no drums or bass required.
Spontaneity was a big focal point for Andy James while making Exodus ‚Äì and this album‚Äôs vibe and energy are vastly superior to the other releases in his solo back catalogue. Throw in the fact that Andy James did everything himself this time around, and you have a package that effortlessly delivers a message. Andy James knows his shit ‚Äì and behind his technique lies a rare degree of musicianship and intelligence.

by Gavin Godfrey
01 Sep 2021
Sometimes, when you perform a home inspection, you'll find yourself standing in an older home that may be in desperate need of an aesthetic renovation, but is a home that is entirely perfect by any other measurement. Other times, you find yourself standing in a beautiful home that you feel confident will pass any inspection you care to undertake, but then you find a serious issue that absolutely needs to be addressed before any purchase can be made, as we found during this home inspection in St. Lucia.
The walls of a home can hide many machinations that degrade over time, which can prove to be a significant problem years after you've bought a new home. While you may not be able to just visually inspect these issues due to the solid drywall in the way, tools like a thermal imaging camera help make the job much easier.
When we made an inspection of this St. Lucia home with a thermal imaging camera, we found that the electrical cables inside the wall cavity were undergoing a serious issue. We weren't able to narrow it down any further than general wiring issues, such as overloaded electrical cables, though we did recommend our clients engage a licensed electrician to undergo further inspections before buying the home, saving them the heartache of buying a property that could require major electrical work in the future.
You don't want to find yourself staring down a small electrical fire in a few years because you didn't get a home inspection now. Instead, for any home inspection in Brisbane, contact the leading inspection team,Every day during Cocktail Week, Eater will be deploying maps of the city's best destinations for a particularly classic cocktail.

Ever since I've started taking the sea moss daily my bowel movements have increased, my mood has overall improved, I have more energy throughout the day and I'm getting rid of a lot of mucus.
Demetrice M.Demetrice M.
I tested positive for Covid-19 and I was told to take Tylenol for pain and that judging from my bloodwork I would get worse and have to be put on a respirator. I went home, quarantined in my bedroom, the pain was horrible, breathing was very hard. Third day, I started taking the sea moss gel, eating fruit, and drinking plenty of alkaline water. I'll admit, it was touch and go for a while, but I noticed that when I took the gel, about 15 minutes later, I would start coughing, phlegm would come up, and I could sleep through the night. About the beginning of the second week, I was up and walking (slowly, but still) and I could sit up in bed without feeling weak. This is the third week, and I've tested negative!

Yesterday I was sneezing like crazy, runny nose, congested...feeling sick. I took the sea moss last night before bed for the first time and when I woke up this morning my nose was dry, congestion gone and I have not sneezed all day. So long of the short, I think your sea moss is LEGIT and I am going to place an order for my father. Happy customer!

I was born in Camden and spent my school years in North London. I went to Birmingham University aged 17 in 1970 and read Psychology, where one of the lecturers, David Fulker, turned my attention towards behavioural genetics. My PhD in this subject using Drosophila was carried out jointly in the Departments of Psychology and Genetics in Sheffield under the supervision of Kevin Connolly and Barrie Burnet. After spending one year in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh as a Demonstrator, I moved to Brandeis University in Boston in 1978, where I worked with Jeff Hall on the neurogenetics of sexual behaviour in flies and initiated a project on circadian clock genes in the context of courtship.
I continued this collaboration back in in Edinburgh and then Leicester with Jeff and Michael Rosbash (also at Brandeis) into the 1980s and 1990s, and was involved in their pioneering molecular analyses of fly circadian rhythm genes. This work was to win them the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 2017 which they shared with Michael Young at Rockefeller. My current research interests are focused on tidal, circadian and seasonal rhythms, aggression and the effects of electromagnetic field on behaviour, working predominantly with Drosophila and Eurydice, an intertidal marine organism. My lab is funded by multiple grants from BBSRC, the European Union and the Electromagnetic Field Biological Trust. Within the department I collaborate extensively with Dr Ezio Rosato (see below) on biological rhythms and Prof Flaviano Giorgini using fly models to study Huntington‚Äôs and other neurodegenerative diseases. Outside the department my main collaborators are Dr Michael Hastings (LMB, Cambridge), Dr David Wilcockson (Aberystwyth) and Prof Rodolfo Costa (Padova). cpk at le.ac.uk

I studied Evolutionary Biology at the University of Rome Sapienza and completed the degree with a dissertation on the phylogeography on the common mole. During my undergraduate studies, I was one of two European students funded by the Science Foundation Ireland to do a summer internship at the National University of Ireland of Maynooth, where I worked on a project on horizontal gene transfer in plants. In 2009, I was awarded a PhD fellowship from the Irish Council for Research and Engineering to work in the lab of Davide Pisani. During my PhD, I used computational methods to reconstruct the origin of vision (we identified the pattern of gene duplication that lead to the origin of opsin) and the relationships between non-bilateria metazoans. After my PhD in 2013, I spent two months in the department of Zoology in Oxford in the lab of Peter Holland to work on the pattern of evolution of opsin in insects.
During my PhD, I started to be fascinated by the problem of body plan formation and how the genomes encode for morphology. Therefore for my postdoc, I decided to learn some Experimental Biology, and so I moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), to work in the laboratory of Eric Davidson. At Caltech, I worked on the evolution of photoreceptors cells and on the gene regulatory network controlling the formation of neurons in the sea urchin larvae.
In 2018, I was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship, and so I moved back to Europe. After spending one year and a half in the School of Earth Science in Bristol as part of the Paleobiology group, in October 2019, I accepted a proleptic position in the Department of Genetics and Genome Biology at the University of Leicester.
In my lab, we combine experiments in different model systems (e.g. sea urchin, flies, ctenophores and cnidarians) and computation approaches (single-cell and phylogenomics) to understand two main problems 1) the evolution of the neurogenic gene regulatory network and 2) the molecular assembly of vision. rf190 at le.ac.uk

I am a Senior Research Associate and my work has been focusing on the molecular basis of circatidal rhythm in the intertidal crustacean Eurydice pulchra for more than a decade. The work has been continuously funded by BBSRC in collaboration with Aberystwyth University (Dr DC Wilcockson), Bangor University (Prof SC Webster) and MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge (Dr MH Hastings). Unlike terrestrial organisms where the circadian ~24 h solar cycle dominates, intertidal organisms are exposed to a prominent ~12.4 h component that reflects the ebb and flow of the tides, as well as semi-lunar (spring and neap tides), lunar and solar cycles which is reflected in their endogenous circatidal rhythms of behaviour and physiology.. However, the molecular control of tidal behaviours is poorly understood. We have been using Eurydice pulchra to address a long-standing question whether the circatidal rhythm shares the same molecular components of the circadian clock, the whether the tidal cycle is distinct from circadian oscillator (Wilcockson and Zhang 2008, Zhang et al 2013, O‚ÄôNeill et al, 2015). lz8 at le.ac.uk

I have been in the fly lab for a few years. During my PhD I studied diapause in D. melanogaster, a seasonal character that allows flies to escape winter in time. I was particularly interested in natural populations, which experience different environmental stimuli as winter approaches. I analysed several genes carrying polymorphisms which allow flies to anticipate the changing of seasons. After my PhD I have been managing two Marie Sklodowska-Curie Initial Training Networks: INsecTIME and CINCHRON. These networks involve 15 laboratories in Europe and Israel, with coordination and management in Leicester. The main focus of the networks is chronobiology in insects. vz12 at le.ac.uk

I am in the third year of my NERC funded PhD and interested in how Drosophila change their behaviour and biology in response to extreme environmental factors such as temperature. I look into the diapause phenotype in response to the cold, short photoperiods experienced in winter, whereby flies halt their ovary development so as not to waste valuable resources on non-viable progeny. I also look at the locomotor response of flies under varying environmental conditions with a particular focus on the use of more ‚Äònatural‚Äô experimental conditions than traditional laboratory studies.

Lighting Designer Suzan Tillotson on the Challenges of LEDs, Urban Lighting, and More
Metropolis sat down with the lighting expert and founder of her eponymous, award-winning New York lighting consultancy to discuss the state of lighting design.
Suzan Tillotson, thought leader and founder of the lighting design firm Tillotson Design Associates, talks to Metropolis about collaborating with architects, the pitfalls of LEDs, and persuading municipalities and the public to demand more sensible lighting schemes.
Avinash Rajagopal: You work with so many different architecture firms. Can you talk about what you bring to their projects?
Suzan Tillotson: We do work with some of the best architects in the world; it‚Äôs sort of daunting. They come to us with their vision, their projects. What we do, first off, is listen. We try to get to the essence of the architecture. What‚Äôs the real story?
Because the budgets are so challenging, maybe you can‚Äôt use the most expensive fixture, or it becomes a fluorescent strip light in the end. But there‚Äôs still that premise, the goal, the strong idea, of what the architects are trying to do. We try to be the police for that‚Äîwe are the lighting police‚Äîand really try to hold on to the spirit.
The hardest part of lighting is predicting it. What‚Äôs ‚Äúsparkle‚Äù to you might be ‚Äúglare‚Äù to me. And like a painting, it‚Äôs not done until it‚Äôs done. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to have long relationships with architects: because there‚Äôs a trust that‚Äôs built, and they know that we care. It‚Äôs a huge responsibility, and we know the architects are extremely dedicated to their work. It‚Äôs our job to make it what they envision, not what we envision.
AR: Tell us about your work on the recently opened Bloomberg headquarters in London, which was designed by Foster + Partners.
ST: That project was extremely unique in terms of the public realm. If you go to London, you see these beautiful heritage buildings with ugly streetlights mounted to them. The design of this building was so beautiful, the materials were so gorgeous, and we did not want that. That became one of our main goals.
We wanted to be a good neighbor, be soft and not brightly lit or too showy. We wanted to create some sort of iconic image and let the building light itself. The interior lighting is designed to light the facade.
It‚Äôs in a very congested area, the financial district in London, and they had really high light levels for the center of the street that they had to maintain. A lot higher than New York. I‚Äôd say four times higher.
London‚Äôs no different from any major city in the U.S., and we often come up against the city agency, the department of transportation, like we did in L.A. with the Broad museum. Sometimes it will be one person saying that they want this much light. It‚Äôs not on paper anywhere and they just write it in by hand, and you have to go by it as if it‚Äôs gospel. It‚Äôs awful, even though you know intuitively that it‚Äôs way too bright, the context of the neighborhood tells you it‚Äôs too bright.
In my opinion, you can have a beautiful public space outside at night‚ÄîLincoln Center is one example‚Äîand the lighting levels don‚Äôt have to be high. Outdoor spaces are no different from indoor spaces: You need variety, you need a definition of the perimeter, you need some sort of unique identity to make it feel like home.
AR: Are those high levels because of concerns about safety? Do you have to tell cities, ‚ÄúHey, more light doesn‚Äôt mean safer‚Äù?
ST: Exactly. We learned from an East River waterfront project that, actually, the standards that New York City had for waterfront parks were just way too high‚Äîten times too high‚Äîso you couldn‚Äôt even appreciate the waterfront. Our mockups with SHoP Architects proved that the lower light levels along the water allow you to appreciate the water. I‚Äôm pretty sure the city changed their standards from 2 foot-candles to 0.2 foot-candles because of that project. The more sensitive developers and owners are looking hard at what makes a public space feel good. It‚Äôs not about light levels at all; it‚Äôs about the quality of the light.
My job is to furnish light at night: I am extending the day and trying to create space after sunset. It‚Äôs kind of a contradiction, so I am trying to do it responsibly.
You need less, not more, just because we have LEDs. These lights are being shipped by manufacturers that don‚Äôt care about glare, don‚Äôt necessarily care about optics. The life of these things is long, so we are going to be stuck as citizens of the world with these bright, glaring lights for 15 years. I see it as a big crisis.
AR: In general, how do you feel about the use of LEDs now?
ST: We‚Äôve been using them for a long time because we never shy away from being the first. But it has not been without a lot of bumps. Fifteen years is a long time to test a system, but most LEDs have barely been around for 15 years.
Our biggest issue has been the change in the technology. We will spec a light, it will go through design for a year, sometimes two years, and then take three years to build the project. By the time you install that, it‚Äôs already obsolete, in terms of the lumens per watt. We will find that what has been shipped could be way brighter than the test we did here in the office‚Äîor the color will be completely different across batches from different companies. It‚Äôs been really hard to do what I think is our signature work: beautiful, homogenous, uniform lighting.
That‚Äôs been our biggest struggle‚Äîhow to get good, high-quality, reliable LED systems with the longevity they promise that still look good. It‚Äôs a tremendous battle.
AR: LEDs have also led to a lot of experimentation on digitizing lighting and connecting it to automated systems. Your work at [ad agency] R/GA a couple of years ago was groundbreaking in this regard. How is this idea of changeable light and digitized light developing?
ST: What I‚Äôm most excited about, and I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll get there‚ÄîR/GA was close, Ketra is doing exciting things that are close‚Äîbut I would love for lights to automatically respond to the sky. I‚Äôd like to see more of that, more healthy lighting in interiors that changes with the sky.
On the street level, what‚Äôs super exciting‚Äîand where Europe, I think, is ahead of us‚Äîis that the lights do the same thing. Say you have a big football stadium, and the game is over, and people are walking away out to the parking lots, and there are a lot of homes in the neighborhood as well. That stadium lighting shuts down, hopefully, at 11 p.m. so people can sleep. You can have a gradation of the street lighting as well, so the low-level residential areas amp up slowly during ball time, so then there‚Äôs not such a contrast, and the residential area doesn‚Äôt feel pitch-black when the stadium is on. It prolongs the lamp life for sources; it makes everything healthier for everyone.
AR: So much of what you have talked about speaks to a tension or misunderstanding between natural lighting and artificial systems. How can we get to a more harmonious place?
ST: This has been our battle. The IALD [International Association of Lighting Designers] works hard on it, the IES [Illuminating Engineering Society] works hard at this, but we are few in numbers. Even with your magazine, we are preaching to the choir, because everyone reading Metropolis is going to care about these issues and be somewhat aware.
It‚Äôs the general public [we need to reach], the people that go to Home Depot or Lowe‚Äôs and replace the lights in their home with LEDs. They are all too bright or they will be too blue, or they will be six different colors. Now it‚Äôs so cheap to get all these little lights for your driveway. You didn‚Äôt need them before, you never had them, but now you can have them, and they last forever, so we just have all this extra light that we didn‚Äôt need and doesn‚Äôt even look good. I don‚Äôt know the answer. We‚Äôre trying our best to make hours in the day to speak, go to conferences, educate as much as we can. It‚Äôs not just an issue for us; it‚Äôs for the whole world. We have a lot of smart people in America who are recognizing it‚Äîarchitects, master planners, landscape architects. They are getting out there and hiring lighting designers, and slowly but surely, change is happening.

.
Odysseus and his men proceed with their journey, taking Circe‚Äôs advice:
.
‚Äú‚ÄòCome here,‚Äô they sang, ‚Äòrenowned.
Fortunately for the protagonist, he survives this brush with deadly temptation and lives to fight again. But what about those of us who aren‚Äôt epic heroes with a loyal crew and helpful advice from a powerful goddess?
Like me, for example. Last February I was visiting family in Southern California. After taking in the USS Iowa, my brother and I retired to nearby Long Beach for dinner. Since we were footloose and fancy-free that night, we decided to attend the cinema. So we walked across the street to the cineplex and got in line for tickets. While waiting we scanned the movie posters. We‚Äôre a couple of fuddy-duddies who are hopelessly out of the loop. We hadn‚Äôt heard of anything, but it appeared to be the opening night for some film called Deadpool. Huh. Never heard of it. It was sold out anyway, so we ended up in some period piece with Leonardo DiCaprio dressed in a bearskin and sleeping in a horse.
A few months later on a business trip I ended up watching Deadpool. It was on a Korean Air flight, and the version I watched was compliant with Korean restrictions on broadcasting nudity. At any rate, a plumber‚Äôs crack that appeared during the flesh-tearing opening sequence was digitally blurred. I don‚Äôt know how much sex was cut out since I never saw the original cut, but there was enough foul-mouthed violence left to sear my conscience. I exited the plane a shaken man. If only there was a way a good Mormon could watch what their peers are watching while tied to a post!
Wait, there is! Er, make that was. By now I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard that a California judge has sided with Big Hollywood and issued an injunction against Provo-based
pirate streaming filtering service VidAngel. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt even know what VidAngel was or did until recently. It‚Äôs not available where I live, and it wasn‚Äôt until friends and family from back home started posting clips with that guy from Studio C on a popular social media site for middle-aged parents that I learned something was at stake‚ÄìMormon enjoyment of previously forbidden fruit!
From the comments here it‚Äôs clear that VidAngel has discovered a rich seam:
we love watching filtered movies. Without the filtering, we WILL NOT watch most of them
The world NEEDS your service.
We love the service Vid Angel provides. Without Vid Angel filtering we will not view many movies our family would enjoy.
It has opened my family up to seeing some absolutely incredible movies that have had some stuff that we just haven‚Äôt wanted to see or hear. WE LOVE AND WANT VIDANGEL TO CONTINUE
Well, you get the idea. VidAngel is offering a path to
citizenship legitimization of the taboo through filtering, and apparently there is some pent-up demand for such a service. I think I can get that. We‚Äôre social creatures, and pop culture no doubt features heavily in discussions around the water cooler. I grew up without a TV in the house, so I know what it‚Äôs like to not be able to discuss the latest The Simpson‚Äôs episode with your friends on Monday morning. Not being able to join in such discussions because of one‚Äôs religion is as awkward as showing up to after-work drinks and ordering an orange juice. So, yeah, I can see where VidAngel offers a service that opens new vistas to Mormons who take the prophet‚Äôs counsel to the young men seriously to avoid R-rated movies and entertainment that is immoral, suggestive, or pornographic.
What does surprise me a little, however, are sentiments like the one expressed in the Trib‚Äôs coverage:
‚ÄúViolence in a war movie doesn‚Äôt bother me,‚Äù he said, but nudity or strong language does.
Which brings me back to Deadpool. Today I came across a conversation among acquaintances in which one participant casually noted that the family had watched it on VidAngel, taking in stride the warnings that deleting certain scenes affects the plot. I must admit that I raised an eyebrow. This family may not yet have featured in the Ensign, but they probably should. They are the kind of people I aspire to become. I am a slacker who doesn‚Äôt let rating get in the way of an evening‚Äôs entertainment. And yet here they were‚Äîfiltering Deadpool! A send-up of the comic book movie genre, for heaven‚Äôs sake, full of gratuitous violence! What is left that is virtuous, lovely, or of good report once it‚Äôs been scrubbed? Damning the torpedoes and (secretly) indulging in Deadpool strikes me as human enough. Filtering the same movie so your kids can watch it too strikes me as, well, bizarre, to be honest.
Setting aside the merits of a particular film, the VidAngel episode has me wondering aloud on the internet‚Äîhaving already outsourced our standards to an America-centric ratings board, is the Mormon embrace of filtering an indication that we‚Äôre ready to get out of the principled judgment business altogether when it comes to deciding what kind of media we will consume as a God-fearing people? At the risk of appearing to ride around on a high horse, I have to ask: Is our moral calculus really as threadbare as the simple notion that if we take out the ‚Äúbosoms, blood and bad words‚Äù then what was bad becomes good? Especially if we‚Äôre basically ok with the blood?
So please school me and expand my horizons with new vistas‚Äìwhat am I missing about the virtues of streaming Big Hollywood through a filter into our homes as opposed to simply being selective about what is streamed unfiltered through our walls?
I tried to destroy your world via the Deplorable Word, but VidAngel filtered it.
Usually I read without commenting, but I have to publicly agree with you here, dear author! I‚Äôve considered using VidAngel, but I‚Äôve never been able to take the plunge. If I can‚Äôt bring myself to watch it with all the inclusions, why is it suddenly ok once edited (I realized the irony in this as I watched a lot of rated R movies on network TV as a kid. Thanks to Christmas Eves and Saturday afternoons, I‚Äôve seen Die Hard, Lethal Weapon(s), Eddie Murphy movies‚Ä¶ Stephen King movies‚Ä¶ but I digress)?
In full disclosure, I‚Äôve never even seen Titanic (ok, I saw the last 20 min, but that‚Äôs it and it wasn‚Äôt by choice). When it came out, all my friends said ‚Äúoh, when this line is spoken, everyone just leaves the theater for a few minutes and then we go back in and miss all the bad stuff.‚Äù What? This makes no sense. I paid to see the movie‚Ä¶ why is it ‚Äúreally good minus that one part‚Äù? This is how I feel about VidAngel as well.
Before we talk about your post, can you please add some garment-appropriate clothing to the figures in the painting?
Jadis FTW.
A quick story ‚Äì when I lived in Rexburg, a certain store touting flicks that were cleaned was still alive and kicking. I had a friend brag to me that he watched ‚ÄúGoodfellas‚Äù from there, and the movie was only about 20 minutes long. He also let us borrow ‚ÄúWedding Crashers,‚Äù of which there were huge cuts in the movie that made the movie not make much sense. I imagine ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù being in that same vein ‚Äì there‚Äôs so much that would have to be cut that it really would defeat the movie.
I‚Äôm really not a high moral-standard movie viewer, though I do have high quality-standards for what I do watch. But it‚Äôs been fascinating to me to see the reaction on a certain social media site from the many ardent supporters regarding this directive, especially because it really brings out some wonderful conspiracy theories and persecution complexes. If I have to hear about big bad Hollywood not liking their movies to be scrubbed one more time, I might scream.
I guess it doesn‚Äôt compute with me because it seems very hypocritical. The movie has the 3 B‚Äôs (boobs, blood, bad words), and so I can‚Äôt see it. But I want to! Ah! Let‚Äôs take those out! Then everything is OK! That seems so simplistic and reductive. There‚Äôs no reason to not know exactly what content is in movies in 2016 (hello IMDB guides), and you do have a fast forward / mute button on your remote. Is it ‚Äúfor the kids‚Äù? So why are they watching it in the first place?
I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I just need to go repent and quit hardening my heart to the joy that edited Deadpool will bring into my life or something.
It is helpful to note that the case against VidAngel isn‚Äôt about the filtering, but the fact that they don‚Äôt pay for the rights to stream to viewers. Here is the court document
The people who want ‚Äúscrubbed‚Äù movies by and large are moral children. They do not want to have to master their own thoughts, words, and deeds; they want an external force to constrain them because they do not want to have to do the work of self-control.
And hey, I totally get the impulse, because for a long way I was like that about work. I needed to create an invisible taskmaster standing over me. With a lot of personal struggle, though, I became something of a self-starter. (Not much of one, but a lot more than I used to be.)
Forgive me for referencing Garfield, but necessity isn‚Äôt the mother of invention‚Äìsloth is. People always will look for ways of not having to do work. This very much applies to spiritual things as well as secular ones.
VidAngel has solved a thorny problem for me. My wife and I have very different attitudes toward ratings and content for movies. Using VidAngel has assuaged her reluctance to see a number of the movies that have been on my ‚ÄúAfter She Dies‚Ä¶‚Äù watchlist. Now we can watch movies together!
Ethical dilemma, John: To steal or to see boobs in movies? (No third option.)
Brief follow up with John‚Äôs comment above, I guess you can still get streamed filtering via clearplay which overlays its edits with Google Play. I didn‚Äôt know this until I read about the judge‚Äôs decision, so it‚Äôs not about filtering per se as much as it‚Äôs about filtering for only a dollar per movie.
Some of the most profound, impactful movies are R, maybe because many of the themes that invoke the passions often involve violence or intense, F-bomb leaden feelings. Without some mechanism to present them to orthodox Mormons and others I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll stick with Hallmark entertainment Kitsch. Yes, Son of Saul edited is probably not as impactful as the non-edited version, but it‚Äôs better than nothing, which is what a not insignificant population will get from it if there‚Äôs no means for viewing an edited version. It‚Äôs not as if editing scrubs it down to ponies and flowers. The point is still made, even if it‚Äôs muted somewhat, which is better than the point not being made at all.
From what I understand about ClearPlay, one of the ways they have been to continue their business model is from more compliance with the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, that someone can personalize the playback of movies, skipping or muting content from playback of video on demand or DVDs. Basically, you buy the movie through GooglePlay or the DVD/Blu Ray + special DVD player yourself, use the FilterStick + subscription service to get the filters needed, and it will fast forward / mute as needed, following the FECA more closely.
I have heard from a few with connections to the industry that they haven‚Äôt been targeted because they aren‚Äôt a threat (like VidAngel was), but legally, it seems like they are more within the lines than VidAngel?
I would love to be able to say that I choose movies based on their quality or message, rather than some arbitrary rating, but the truth is that I sometimes watch movies that I know are going to be spectacles, with little to no redeeming value, just because I sometimes enjoy the spectacle. I can perhaps assuage any faint guilt with the knowledge that people aren‚Äôt really getting hurt in violent scenes (although people often are), but it is hard to argue that people aren‚Äôt being objectified in many scenes (both sexual or violent). The lizard brain wants what the lizard brain wants.
All that said, I‚Äôve stopped watching football (American-version) because I feel like a Roman spectator now. And I dearly loved football. So maybe I‚Äôll slowly grow out of spectacle as well over time.
Kyle, not a hard decision. Seeing the human body doesn‚Äôt bother me. Stealing does.
But, your dilemma is a false one. There is (as has been mentioned above) still ClearPlay, which both filters streaming movies from google play that have been paid for, and have players that you can use for you own physical copies to filter them.
Realize that filtering isn‚Äôt the issue because ClearPlay has been following the law and running for over a decade now, and that the Studios sell their movies to TV and Cable to be filtered all the time.
The issue is rights and who has or hasn‚Äôt paid for them.
No to nudity/swear words, yes to theft! ‚Äì Mormons
I don‚Äôt feel particularly strongly about this, but the post and comments feel like trading one moral high-horse for another. I think if someone wants to filter out a few f-bombs so that they can enjoy a movie that they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt, good for them. It‚Äôs not something I would do, mostly because I‚Äôm lazy, but I have muted the TV before when my kids were watching and I knew a bad word was coming. I agree it would be weird to vid-angel a show like Deadpool, because so much would have to be skipped over, but my objection there is not one of artistic superiority but instead of utility (i.e., why watch a movie so clipped it no longer makes sense?).
If you want to watch the cussing and sex, good for you. If someone doesn‚Äôt but still wants the rest of the content, good for them. If it works for them, why would I care?
jimbob, I think it‚Äôs not just an aesthetic / artistic integrity objection. It‚Äôs partially your utility objection‚Äìit doesn‚Äôt make any sense‚Äìbut also, it‚Äôs partially this: when you‚Äôve taken out the boobs and the bad words, does that really mean that the rest of it is fine? Can you redeem a suggestive plot by just editing out certain words and images?
Or to put it in the terms of the old Mormonad, if there‚Äôs a bug in your ice cream sundae, do you really pick it out on go on eating, or do you just decide to maybe get another desert? (Or, the third option, maybe the bugs are supposed to be there, like roasted or chocolate covered grasshoppers or something, and you decide that your okay with it).
Yeah, well, at least I‚Äôm transparent about it!
Everybody needs to get over themselves‚Ä¶ watch the movies you want to watch‚Ä¶ and don‚Äôt watch the ones you don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ and use your own values and moral compass to guide you‚Ä¶ and don‚Äôt judge others who view differently from you‚Ä¶
The only thing that really chaps me about VidAngel is seeing the company dress up its copyright violations as morally pure. The court points out (and John Jeppson has mentioned here) that people can get scrubbed versions of movies that are licensed and legal from ClearPlay. There‚Äôs nothing to stop VidAngel from doing their business legally if they are willing to make a deal with the studios.
VidAngel seems to have been conceived, or at least marketed, as a righteous cause (see the name). That makes it a scam, morally speaking. Most popular culture is not high art; most of it is closer to dreck. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs evil, but there‚Äôs certainly nothing angelic about helping people spend their time with watered-down dreck. It‚Äôs a business, not a moral cause.
I see what you did there!
Preach!
That‚Äôs a good point, Loursat.
Maybe it‚Äôs not so much a problem with outsourcing as with line-drawing. We humans don‚Äôt like fuzzy ambiguous principles, and love black and white rules. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt watch stuff that‚Äôs not uplifting‚Äù is really fuzzy. So when the president of the church says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt watch stuff that‚Äôs not uplifting; maybe avoid stuff that‚Äôs rated R‚Äù we latch onto ‚Äúdon‚Äôt watch rated R stuff,‚Äù and take it to mean everything rated R is totally off limits, and everything that‚Äôs not rated R is totally fine. And the natural next step from there is to ask, when something rated R comes along that we want to see, what could we do to make this not rated R? And the line-drawing that the MPAA makes between PG-13 and R suddenly becomes our standard for what is morally acceptable entertainment.
Note: yes, I‚Äôm aware that the no rated R rule hasn‚Äôt really part of the For the Strength of Youth standards for a long time. But it persists, largely because it‚Äôs still an easy shortcut.
This is a conversation my wife and I have had quite often. She has asked me the same thing: how does taking the bad stuff out of movies make it good?
My response is usually this: how many movies that we watch are ‚Äúgood‚Äù?
I suspect that most movies we watch are more neutral than anything. We talk of movies as if there are strictly good or bad. But there‚Äôs a whole lot of middle ground, and as members of the Church, we each tend to live somewhere in that grey area.
I think of services like VidAngel (may it rest in piece) and ClearPlay as useful services that help us take bad movies bak to neutral. Would I let my kid (or myself) watch Toy Story if it was full of bad language? No. The message would still be good, even if it did have a handful of f-bombs in it. In reality, Toy Story is a neutral movie ‚Äì not really good nor bad. It‚Äôs just entertaining. Editing services help us reduce the ‚Äúbad‚Äù in movies to move them to neutral. Granted, some movies would require too much editing to make it to neutral, but most aren‚Äôt in that realm.
As for the blood vs nudity vs language thing ‚Äì that honestly seems to stem from both a principle and societal place. We). Not saying it‚Äôs right, but that seems to be the argument I hear most often about it from other members of the Church.
Well, not all popular art is dreck. Toy Story is really good. And not only that, but Toy Story<Toy Story 2<Toy Story 3.
Art matters!
Over the years there have been many movies I dearly would have liked to see but have not because of inappropriate content. I don‚Äôt rely on their rating, I use IMDb as a guide but one rule I adhere to is when in doubt skip it; it‚Äôs impossible to ‚Äúunsee‚Äù anything. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd use a filtering service like VidAngel even if I lived where it‚Äôs available.
@ Loursat. In their defense, my understanding of their situation is that they did try to approach the studios and were rejected, which is why they went to their current business model. There may still be some disingenuousness on their part as evidenced by the fact that they‚Äôre not just switching over to the clearplay model (taking out their monopoly on that approach and driving filtering prices down), which seems bullet proof legally.
If a person would watch a Big Hollywood movie that is rated G, PG, or PG-13, why is an R movie that they have modified to meet one of the other standards necessarily any different from a movie that originally received a lower rating? A G-rated movie (good) could be made R (bad) by making Queen Elsa drop the F-bomb three times during ‚ÄúLet it Go‚Äù. Why would deleting those three F-bombs not then turn bad back into good? It‚Äôs no secret that much of the content that leads to R ratings is not required for telling the story of many movies, which may indeed be virtuous in some way. Skilled directors have been dealing with difficult subjects without showing boobies or corpse-slashing since moving pictures began.
I‚Äôve used Vidangel quite a bit for movies that obviously have redeeming qualities but which also contain content I have no interest in. So no, I haven‚Äôt seen Deadpool.
Vidangel also provides the benefit of really telling you what‚Äôs in a movie relative to rating standards, since you can look at the filters and their effects before renting the movie. This can show you the difference between a movie that got the R for thee casual F-bombs and one that borders on NC-17 for graphic sexual violence.
‚ÄòWe).‚Äô
The notion that watching violence is fine because it doesn‚Äôt drive you to kill people, while seeing something sexy is off limits because it might tempt us to be unchaste makes no sense to me. Seeing something suggestive doesn‚Äôt drive me to commit adultery, either. It might provide a way for temptations short of actual adultery, but the same is true of watching violence, it can open you to temptations short of actual murder, not the least of which is simply being callous to the well-being of others. The idea that we are more affected by vulgar language or something sexually suggestive than by graphic depictions of violence is just crazy, and more than anything else, it reveals a societal addiction to violence and anger that is so prevalent that we can‚Äôt even see it.
Here‚Äôs the problem I have with basing a decision on whether a movie is morally acceptable or not on the presence of swear words or nudity or drug use, or whatever: that approach doesn‚Äôt actually engage in any moral reasoning about how those things are being treated or portrayed in the movie. Honestly, if that‚Äôs the approach, then we shouldn‚Äôt read the Book of Mormon or the Bible, since they both contain graphic depictions of violence and sex.
Real moral reasoning would require us to engage with what the movie (or text) is actually saying about those things. Sometimes they are used to make a very important point. Sometimes they are portrayed as great moral wrongs. Sometimes they are glorified. Sometimes they‚Äôre just gratuitous and don‚Äôt serve any purpose. If something morally objectionable is portrayed as morally objectionable, that‚Äôs a very different thing from it being glorified. And if it is just gratuitous, it‚Äôs a judgment call about whether the movie (or text) has other redeeming qualities that outweigh it.
‚ÄúThe people who want ‚Äúscrubbed‚Äù movies by and large are moral children. They do not want to have to master their own thoughts, words, and deeds‚Äù
Wow. There‚Äôs some condemnation for you!
There are a lot of movies out there that have a few ‚Äúbad parts‚Äù in an otherwise acceptable movie. Sure, you can just watch the movie and ignore the bad parts, but doing that does make the bad parts seem more acceptable over time, and I would think good parents would be leery of)
Interestingly, VidAngel structured their approach to operate in the space allowed by recent Supreme Court copyright decisions, including the Aereo case.
A brief description is here:
Oversimplified version: VidAngel buys a lot of physical discs of movies, and that‚Äôs how the studios are paid. You can then purchase a disc from them, and then stream the content from your disc to your device. If you want, you can sell back the disc, and someone else then buys it and can stream the content from it, and so on.
It‚Äôs an interesting and not yet fully clarified area of the law; VidAngel‚Äôs position is certainly colorable. The studios believe this is infringement; VidAngel believes otherwise. I think they will ultimately lose at the Supreme Court, but it certainly isn‚Äôt flat-out theft.
It sure does. What I find fascinating, maybe even bewildering, however, is that it seems to be most popular among conservative iron-rodders rather than liberal ‚Äúallow me the space to justify my sins, please‚Äù types.
Good point. I suppose that by getting hung up on obvious-ish outliers like Deadpool it‚Äôs easy to miss lots of cases where gentle massaging of a film can remove stumbling blocks from an uplifting work.
‚Äúit certainly isn‚Äôt flat-out theft.‚Äù
Nope, just a business practice that is questionably legal at best and more likely illegal. Funny, you would think that VidAngel would want to build a hedge about the law and avoid even the very appearance of illegal behavior.
I only skimmed the decision, but my understanding was that VidAngel doesn‚Äôt actually stream you the edited version from the disk you bought, but from their edited digital copy that you didn‚Äôt buy, and that‚Äôs the problem.
Ha, I also grew up without a tv, as have my kids, though with computers they did/do get to see dvds‚Ä¶
We usually use commonsense media reviews when deciding what we‚Äôd like to spend out time watching. We don‚Äôt actually watch very much even then. Mostly because not enough time. Where do people find the time?
Also, I agree with JKC about strange attitudes to violence as compared to sex and language.
So, I have never used VidAngel and now probably never will.
Overall I agree that no amount of editing will make a morally wrong movie watchable. I like the examples of Deadpool and Wedding Crashers. I regularly watch R movies that have been edited for television and enjoy them. Some of these movies are simple entertainment and others actually have enough of a message or story in them to be of some value once the offensive content is removed. However, at least one movie comes to mind that removing the language from it would change the movie, the Kings Speech. The scene that makes that movie R is really a necessary part of the story line. Or so I feel.
As for violence being OK and nudity\language not, I usually avoid movies with nudity and language but, do not avoid the violent ones as much. I do not tend to watch movies with what I feel is overly gratuitous violence but, that definition changes per individual. I avoid nudity because that type of temptation is the one that that I struggle with the most. I don‚Äôt struggle with thoughts of violence and have found no decrease in my ability to empathize with my fellow man. I think again that this is a use your brain and watch what you can and avoid what doesn‚Äôt work for you.
Also, not sure that what vidangel is doing is technically stealing, studios are getting paid and from what I can tell more than they would from me because if there is something in the movie I don‚Äôt like I will feel momentarily sad that I cant watch and never spend money on it anyway.
I don‚Äôt see a problem with editing out undesired content(as long as it is legal). Hollywood often uses such content as a check mark for making ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù movies. However, they aren‚Äôt necessary to plot or story. More often than not story and themes determine whether a movie is moral, not individual instances of content. If I remove those check marks, I can still enjoy the same themes and messaging without the content I personally disagree with.
Also, I‚Äôve always thought that violence is less problematic than nudity or language. Violence in movies is hardly ever uniformly bad or good. For example, Schindler‚Äôs List gains its moral meaning from accurately showing some of the atrocities of the Nazi regime. The movie would have less power if it didn‚Äôt depict those violent acts. Now, a similar logic could apply to language and nudity, except violence in movies is only a depiction. No real acts of violence occur, so the depiction is not inherently immoral. A depiction of nudity on the other hand is still nudity and the f-word is still the f-word. The distance that movies give to violence don‚Äôt apply in these cases. There is a debate to be had on whether depictions of violence are moral or not, but they exist in a different category than depicting sex or using explicit language.
RE the legality of Vidangel: Vidangel would love to pay the studios for streaming rights. The needle-threading they‚Äôve been doing is only because the studios have insisted on violating the spirit of existing law that allows for post-release content editing. It seems likely that higher courts will slap the studios for their complete refusal to enrich themselves by selling streaming rights to Vidangel just like they do to Apple. They aren‚Äôt going to be able to pretend that congress only meant to allow content editing of physical media.
What I don‚Äôt get is why aren‚Äôt studios offering their own service? There‚Äôs obviously some money in it.
And I guess I don‚Äôt understand the moral ‚Äúthis is stealing‚Äù argument, as long as the media/rights were paid for. And I understand there‚Äôs a big difference between the ‚Äúlegal‚Äù and the ‚Äúmoral‚Äù arguments. I get the legal ones. If I went into a bookstore and bought a book that had several pages torn out or large sections blacked out, would I be stealing?
This is not a win by ‚ÄúBig Hollywood.‚Äù This is win by screenwriters, directors and editors who have the right to maintain control of their own creations. Prior to the 25th anniversary republication of Ray Bradbury‚Äôs great novel about censorship, Fahrenheit 451, he returned to the current publication and discovered that through the years his own publisher had edited (Censored), without his permission, over 75 passages. He was dumbfounded that this could happen in a book about ‚Äúcensorship,‚Äù and so he wrote an essay on censorship that is included in that edition of the book. In it he makes the strong and legal case that the creator of the art owns the rights to that art and no one has the right to make any kind of cuts or changes to it without specific permission ‚Äî permission which he then denied everyone carte blanche. The book was reprinted as it was originally published. Here is one vital short section from this seminal essay on ‚Äúcreator‚Äôs rights:‚Äù
>>mild.‚Äù<<
Neil Simon, responding to a Utah high school production of his play, "Rumors," said essentially the same thing. In essence: You changed my art without permission. You violated the copyright laws and your contract. I receive so many requests for changes in my plays that it would take ALL of my time to consider them. And so, NO! You CANNOT change my script for your production. If you will not do the play the way it was written, then do some other poor sucker's play and be done with."
No one has the right to "sanitize" other people's creations. This does not even being to examine the issue that taking out surface "offenses" has NOTHING to do with the morality of the work. Morality comes from context, from the decisions characters make and the consequences of those decisions. Morally, it does not matter one whit how little clothing they are wearing, what words they are uttering, or how much blood is on the floor when they're done. Morality comes from CHOICE. And so even on that level, the argument for sanitation falls totally into oblivion.
Ask BYU how they felt when the owner of the rights showed up in the Dept. of Theatre Office and cancelled the opening of "Noises Off" by Michael Frayn because they had cut the script without permission. That action ushered in a new era of morality within the BYU Theatre Department, as you can well imagine: Morality based on illegal, arrogant decisions that were wrong.
Dr. GSA no publisher, producer, or broadcaster is censoring anything. USERS are doing the censoring using *optional* tools. Does Ray Bradbury have the right to prevent me from ripping a page out of Fahrenheit 451 before I read it? Can he stop someone from selling plastic sheet swith marks that black out certain words when laid over the pages of the book? Obviously not. If it‚Äôs legal for me to fast-forward or mute in order to avoid seeing or hearing anything I please then what Vidangel is trying to do should also be legal. All we‚Äôre seeing here is the studios (or the writers or whoever) using the fact that the law has yet to enter the 21st century in order to maintain control over our culture. They are the Big Brother in this story manipulating people‚Äôs thoughts, not Vidangel.
There seems to be a lot of conflating of ‚Äúlegal‚Äù and ‚Äúmoral‚Äù going on. IMO the morality of something doesn‚Äôt depend on its legality. There are lot plenty of legal things that are immoral and plenty of moral things that are illegal. I don‚Äôt give a hill of beans whether or not something is illegal. As long as it isn‚Äôt immoral then I‚Äôm fine with it. I‚Äôve never used VidAngel, but I find nothing immoral in their actions (and I don‚Äôt know about their intentions).
Not much to add politically or philosophically‚Ä¶
How about some science, or at least social science? I am reaching way back in memory and I hope someone can either confirm or correct me. After WWII when television was first distributed to the gullible public, an interesting social experiment was performed entirely by accident. Every few years the ability to transmit TV marched a few miles further north to more isolated Canadian villages and towns. After about a 15 to 20 year lag the social problems followed in the same procession.
The problems could be grossly grouped into two categories; violence and sex. I seem to recall that viewing violence on TV was pretty strongly associated with an increase in violent actions. But seeing naughty episodes was not so strongly connected to changes in sexual activity. That was tied to many other factors such as availability of contraception, parental influence, religious beliefs, etc.
So watching violence seemed to be more damaging than watching lasciviousness. Yet we see the opposite in the Book of Mormon which is rather violent but clean as Utah spring water when it comes to descriptions of unchastity. And I see the same pattern in my hard-core LDS relatives. They don‚Äôt blink an eye at the displays on the screen of all but the most outrageous graphic violence. But a skirt a few inches above the knee or a lingering kiss with wandering hands and the entertainment comes to an abrupt end.
Are specific questionable categories of behaviors displayed in entertainment more harmful than others as measured by associated observable undesirable behaviors?
Musicians the world over create ‚Äúarrangements‚Äù of the works of others and perform them for profit and sell them (both the arrangement and the recorded performance) to the public. These altered arrangements are for countless reasons: because they prefer different instrumentation, because they are working with different voice parts, because the basses can‚Äôt sing low enough, or because they want to repurpose the piece for a different occasion. This is no less art than a film. However, the difference is that musical artists aren‚Äôt just chopping out segments of the original, but are reconstructing it and making it their own (or, at least using their own voice, etc.). Maybe VidAngel just needs to re-produce their own version of Deadpool.
The question in the first place that must be answered is why the hell would you watch Deadpool without the swearing, nudity, and blood?
I like VidAngel for many of the reasons that have been elaborated. I don‚Äôt usually mind watching movies with objectionable content, but I have relatives that do. It is nice to be able to filter out a few curse words from a PG-13 movie, for instance, and avoid the drama of having certain relatives squirm and sigh or boycott or anything like that. It would be great for everyone to be as grown up and enlightened as me (/s), but filtering is a good compromise. It is also nice with young kids. And I have to admit that even I, myself, enjoy being able to filter out some of the more objectionable bits of an otherwise good movie. When I would normally just look away, I instead have VidAngel skip or mute the scene.
I am mainly just commenting, though, to say that VidAngel still seems to be up and running for the moment. They even have a promotion going. Maybe it gets shut down in the next day or two, but so far things seem to be operating as normal. Does this mean it stays up until the ruling comes down from the next court?
I love Vidangel. Studios are making a mistake in trying to destroy it and confine filtering to drastically inferior ultra-limited-selection subscription services like Clearplay. They should just strike a deal to charge Vidangel what they charge Amazon and iTunes for streaming rights.
Also: it‚Äôs a mistake to over-moralize filtering. Some individuals and families just enjoy movies more when they can skip a few icky parts. Simple as that. I‚Äôd compare using Vidangel to picking mushrooms off a pizza‚Ä¶ except that people who do the latter really are ‚Äúmoral children‚Äù (as an unfortunate comment above put it) while Vidangel users are kind, savvy, and reasonable. :)
mike, perhaps violence in entertainment is harmful to society (by increasing violent acts against others) whereas nudity is potentially harmful to the individual viewer. Especially viewers who, like a great comment above stated ‚Äúdo not want to have to master their own thoughts, words, and deeds; they want an external force to constrain them because they do not want to have to do the work of self-control.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mind ‚Äúadult content‚Äù so much in historic depictions or films that discuss social issues that I feel I should understand. I watched Schindler‚Äôs List and Precious for those reasons. But why is a hero ending the lives of a handful of people followed by a comical line ok when even slight sexual content makes many Mormons extremely uncomfortable? I keep coming back to patriarchy. Violence, typically by portrayed by males, supports the idea of men as protectors, aggressors, and dominant, something that folks buying into patriarchy may find acceptable. But nudity in entertainment, typically of women, is unacceptable in patriarchal organizations (for many reasons which have been discussed ad nauseum).
T, how funny that we felt so different about that comment!
I should add that many violent movies that Mormons tend to see as acceptable have intensely eroticized depictions of the male body‚Äìe.g. 300, which is pornographic both in its violence and in its presentation of the Spartans, who actually wore heavy armor (and also practiced man-boy ‚Äútutelage‚Äù that very much included pederasty, although not to the same extent as in Sparta or especially Thebes).
Which also makes me wonder how many Mormons watched sanitized versions of Starship Troopers, which presumably excluded the nude shower scenes but included the sadomasochistic spectacle of Casper Van Dien being flogged and contorting his face in orgasmic fashion.
APM ‚Äì probably the same principle behind the Ensign cover photoshopping sleeves onto female angels‚Äô porn shoulders but a bare chested Nephi is nbd.
On the subject of the whole hypocrisy with violence vs. nudity, etc. For myself, the temptation of swearing and breaking the law of chastity is real. The temptation to perform acts of animated violence is not.
Personally, I don‚Äôt watch sanitized versions of movies. I forget the lessons behind why I‚Äôve made that decision, but I have, and my life is fine. I hardly even watch PG-13‚Äôs. The only ones that I do, tend to be if they‚Äôre PG-13 because of animated violence. No matter how many times I watch Spider-man, I‚Äôm just not going to be slinging web around, any time soon. On the other hand, I do not want the swearing, and sleeping around to feel normal to me. Something which would begin to occur by watching movies that had that in them. That could actually affect my spiritual standing.
I had a roommate once, who played a lot of whatever Grand Theft Auto that had been recently released (I think it was 2). He was driving me to the Macey‚Äôs in Provo once and said ‚ÄúYou know, in Sunday School I‚Äôd argue against the teacher that watching certain shows, or listening to certain music would be a bad influence on me in any way. But I have to be honest with myself, since I‚Äôve been playing GTA I‚Äôve become a much more aggressive driver.‚Äù It was great that he was being honest with himself.
Probably the big difference is that we tend not to watch the same less-than-wholesome over and over again, the way we put hours into a video game for multiple days/weeks in a row.
Is the difference between our reactions to violence and nudity in film based in the idea that we‚Äôre pretty sure the violence is fake (nobody‚Äôs really getting hurt, we hope; certainly nobody‚Äôs being killed for real) while naked really is naked?
‚ÄúProbably the big difference is that we tend not to watch the same less-than-wholesome over and over again, the way we put hours into a video game for multiple days/weeks in a row.‚Äù
Well for me the biggest difference between video games and movies is that in the former you are a participant ‚Äì carrying out those actions virtually ‚Äì whereas in the latter you are a passive observer. Active participation in (virtual) violence has to be doing something different to the brain than being numbed by exposure to watching violence I‚Äôd have thought.
Well, sure, the violence is fake, but unless you‚Äôre watching a porno, so are the acts of unchastity. There‚Äôs no commandment ‚Äúthou shalt not be naked‚Äù; that‚Äôs part of the hedge we‚Äôve built around the commandment to not commit adultery or fornication. And it‚Äôs probably wise to do so. But why have we not built such a hedge around the commandments related to murder and violence? When Jesus says that you commit adultery if you even look on a woman with lust, we‚Äôre totally on board, but when he says that if you‚Äôre even angry with somebody you‚Äôre in danger of condemnation, it‚Äôs nbd to watch stuff glorifying wrath and violence.
Note that the problem is not looking at a naked body. The problem is looking with lust. I‚Äôll be the first to admit that lust is more likely to be excited when you look at naked people, but if you are actually categorically incapable of seeing a woman‚Äôs body without lust, it sounds like you see women probably add sexual objects, which probably says more about your attitudes about women than it does about the morality of nudity in movies.
Any other medical providers here? I‚Äôve seen so many naked bodies, my mind just doesn‚Äôt go all lusty automatically anymore, no matter how perfectly built the person is. Maybe this is why teens in Europe can go to a topless beach and not be so easily affected.
I‚Äôm not saying being more open about nudity and sexuality in church curriculum is necessarily the answer (although it will be in my family), but I do think that excessive sheltering on this issue can lead to greater objectification of women, and therefore, lust and sin.
Maybee, I think you‚Äôre absolutely right. Being excessively hung up about sex is just as unhealthy and just as likely to lead to sin as being excessively oversexed.
My love for Vidangel is mostly hedonistic and libertarian.
It is simply more pleasant to watch movies with some of the gross profanity, etc. turned off.
Yes, you CAN just get used to the profanity, etc. (the way you get used to a foul smell, or to bits of sand in your food, or to polluted air) but it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air when you don‚Äôt have to.
Of course tastes differ. If my foul smell is your delightful aroma, more power to you. But it is important to realize that studios refuse to allow Vidangel to license streaming the usual way (like iTunes and amazon) in part BECAUSE that would provide a preferable experience for so many people, which would threaten services that (due to moral hangups or weird secret agreements with Hollywood unions) cannot offer filtering themselves.
In this, studios attacking Vidangel are like taxi companies attacking Uber. Technology has produced a superior product, but traditional players hope to hold back the tide as long as possible.
Watching violence in movies certainly has not moved me to become a more violent person. But I wonder whether I would be able to summon more outrage over what is happening in Aleppo if I hadn‚Äôt watched so many slaughters on the movie screen.
I dunno. Seems like the more apt comparison would be between Hollywood studios and the just-announced VidAngel Studios‚Äìboth (will eventually) produce content, just like taxis and Uber both provide rides. Filtering someone else‚Äôs work is fundamentally different than producing your own, and I‚Äôm sure Hollywood does not feel threatened in the slightest by VidAngel‚Äôs vow to produce family-friendly content on its own.
@ Maybee- that‚Äôs because real people don‚Äôt look like tv people! Except for teenagers. Once your in your twenties everything heads south quickly. (I have 15 years as a CNA, RN, ARNP)
Movies, like people, aren‚Äôt inherently bad or good. They‚Äôre a totality of their actions which can be bad or good or neutral. Filtering out the bad, while keeping the good, is exactly what God asks us to do with our lives. Then why not with our movies. Sure you might not be able to filter deadpool into a movie about a guy with morals, but you can take a movie with a solid foundation, like Schindlers List, or Bridge of Spies, or ‚Ä¶ and clean off unnecessary filth so you enjoy the inspirational story without it.
You‚Äôre right in saying that cutting a burned part off a hot dog doesn‚Äôt make it into a steak. But there a good number of movies out there that are underlyingly steaks, they just have a little fat to trim.
Charred hotdogs are the best.
Copyright laws have been fraught since the written music combined with someone wanting to be paid for it. It gains a resurgence any time we get a new medium, or someone realizes they were plagiarized (see the recent-ish lawsuit against Men at Work for using the Kukaberra tune in Down Under). Music arrangers who re-work someone else‚Äôs music without permission and make a profit from it are setting up their own Damocles sword.
Personally, I agree with the Bradbury quote above (as much as I loathe his writing). Not only to creators need to get paid for the use of their work, the work itself needs to be left as it was created or simply not used. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a surfeit of ways to spend your time. Thinking you‚Äôre ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù is a part of human nature that needs continual work to overcome.
‚ÄúThe question in the first place that must be answered is why the hell would you watch Deadpool without the swearing, nudity, and blood?‚Äù
Word.
I think the same way. My sister thought otherwise: that creations, after some limited time to benefit solely the creator, should become part of the intellectual capital of the giant/djinn race, to be used, repurposed, recombined, remixed, and reimagined into ever more diverse and glorious forms.
Of course, that‚Äôs why I had to destroy her and everything else.
Christian Luke Maynes: I wouldn‚Äôt say the scene in Schindler‚Äôs List that most frequently gets cited as ‚Äúunnecessary filth‚Äù‚Äìthe postcoital scene where Ralph Fiennes‚Äô camp commandant leaves his naked lover (wife? I can‚Äôt quite remember, it‚Äôs been more than 20 years) in bed and shoots a passing Jew as casually as most of us would squash an ant‚Äìis truly ‚Äúunnecessary.‚Äù Sex, whether within or outside the bounds of marriage, is a normal part of everyday life for most adults; committing murder is not. There‚Äôs nothing remotely titillating about the nudity in that scene for anyone who‚Äôs actually seen a naked woman before. Instead, the scene demonstrates why Hannah Arendt was not wrong to use the phrase ‚Äúthe banality of evil‚Äù to describe the Third Reich.
I understood this even as a 12-year-old. Why can‚Äôt allegedly educated LDS adults do the same?
Bleeping out bad words in a movie reminds me of those Arrested Development scenes where the bleeping goes on for a really long time. The reality for me is that my mind automatically fills in the blank. So whether it‚Äôs said or censored, it‚Äôs the same for me. I personally would therefore find no benefit from watching a movie where a word in censored; in fact, it just highlights the missing word more for me, which I find distracting.
I don‚Äôt live in UT or ID, so perhaps my perspective is different. But I cannot simply avoid swear words in order to stay ‚Äúpure.‚Äù I have a very white collar job, but my clients and colleagues use swear words all the time. I‚Äôve had to learn to listen to them swear and practice/cultivate not mimicking them. I think we are all capable of the same if we have to. Avoiding swear words in the media is not the only way to avoid allowing them into your own vocabulary.
Sometimes the harsh reality of violence, sex, and language make sense as art tries to mimic life. Other times, it feels forced. I think most of us can tell the difference. But where is the fun in life if we cannot constantly misdjudge other people‚Äôs decisions? =)
I question the notion that violence isn‚Äôt abnormal part of life. Maybe for white male suburbia, but look beyond that in space and time and the picture ain‚Äôt so pretty.
‚Ä¶ a normal‚Ä¶
Owen:
The US is in the middle of the pack worldwide, but in rich countries that aren‚Äôt the US, homicide is exceptionally rare. When you consider how uncommon homicide is in countries like the UK and France that have large, socioeconomically isolated ethnic minority populations with the same ‚Äúculture of honor‚Äù problems to which America‚Äôs high black-on-black and brown-on-brown homicide rates are often attributed, the elephant in the room of our (hand)gun policies becomes that much more obvious.
Going outside the rich world: in much of post-Communist Europe, it‚Äôs much more common than in the US; alarmingly common in much of sub-Saharan Africa; and terrifyingly prevalent in most of Latin America. Do consider, though, that a large portion of the world‚Äôs population lives in three countries that are significantly safer for homicide than the US (China, India, and Indonesia), and that most of the rest of East and Southeast Asia have significantly lower homicide rates than the US despite being, in most cases, far poorer.
WIth all of this in mind, the amount of homicide that‚Äôs depicted in US films, especially the kind that are designed to do well overseas, is off the charts, and totally out of line with the experiences of most of those films‚Äô viewers.
I do agree that forms of violence short of homicide are a much more common part of life outside of relatively affluent places than in them‚Äìbut even then I‚Äôd be willing to wager that they‚Äôre disproportionately concentrated among relatively small sectors of the population, the way they are in rich countries.
Chadwick: I have never heard a stupider piece of verbal communication than when I heard a former housemate of mine (a student at BYU-Idaho interning in LA) using ‚Äúfetch‚Äù and ‚Äúfetchin'‚Äù on his side of a phone conversation with approximately the same frequency as the real F word appears in the scenes in The Big Lebowski that feature both Walter and the Dude.
Would one please let my prior comment out of the moderation queue? Many thanks.
APM, I‚Äôm well aware of current homicide statistics. Perhaps you missed the ‚Äúand time‚Äù part of my post, and you‚Äôre also getting hung up on murder when I was talking about violence. Axe to grind much?
Humans are brutal creatures, and if they are less so now, it‚Äôs an odd historical aberration that no one should lull themselves into believing will continue without a lot of work and a lot of luck. It also dovetails with the surge of violence in media people lament so frequently (although perhaps our view of the violence of media in the past is a bit biased toward the recent past in western culture).
You‚Äôre right that the amount of violence in general and homicide in particular doesn‚Äôt reflect real life anywhere or anywhen. But movies aren‚Äôt about reflecting real life, or at least not primarily. The violent parts of life are some of the most interesting parts and always have been whether the media for telling the stories was oral, books, or video. The most dramatic events naturally tend to involve humans killing each other since that is the most extreme act a human can commit. I‚Äôm sure there were people squatting around campfires in the paleolithic who enjoyed a low-key Woody Allen-style yarn, but the story about Zog clubbing Gif was the one that got people really hooting and hollering.
Oops, outed myself! LOL. I get so mixed up constantly creating new pseudonyms for different threads on different devices‚Ä¶
Isn‚Äôt that kind of the point, that sex and violence are both very much a part of mortal life? Both are extremely common. Both are morally fraught, the most extreme form of violence is murder, which is the worst sin (other than denying the holy ghost, of course) we can commit, and the most extreme form of sex is either marital sex, which is morally good, or extramarital sex, which is morally bad, but at worst, still second to murder. But for some reason we‚Äôre super uptight about sex and kind of blas√© about violence.
And we‚Äôre also uptight about swearing, which isn‚Äôt even really sinful except to the extent that it‚Äôs taking God‚Äôs name in vain, or it offends someone and acts as a stumbling block.
I‚Äôm not arguing that we should necessarily be as lax about sex as we are about violence, I‚Äôm just interested in why we don‚Äôt rationalize and justify on-screen sex the way we do on-screen violence. Because all the reasons and explanations I‚Äôve heard sound more like rationalization than anything.
I‚Äôm probably making myself obnoxious by repeating that point, so I‚Äôll stop. My point is not just to repeat myself, though; it‚Äôs that all the various comments are interesting, but none have made a persuasive principled distinction that justifies the huge discrepancy between the way we treat on screen sex (and language) and the way we treat on-screen violence.
Does the discrepancy need to be justified? Americans have roots in Puritanism and a lack of local wars for more than a century and a half, so we treat any kind of sex as out of bounds and violence as something completely unreal, even if it‚Äôs pictures of children being bombed in Syria.
It‚Äôs not justifiable, or surprising.
It‚Äôs always interesting in discussions like this to observe all the judging that goes on. For those who like or have no problem with cursing, nudity and violence in their movies, that‚Äôs your choice. For those who prefer not to have them, they ought to have the option of watching desired movies with out them (which they do with mute and fast-forward, so why is it wrong (not talking legality) to use a service that does that much smoother for the consumer?).
To grossly paraphrase Rodney King, can‚Äôt we all just quit judging each other?
And risk becoming moral relativists? Never! Seriously, though, I agree in principle that it would be nice if we treated each other as moral agents, but I feel obliged to point out that BCC and the commenters here didn‚Äôt start the fire. A generation raised on Mormonads with cockroaches in ice cream sundaes grew up judging their peers for consuming tainted entertainment. And now they are watching Deadpool through filters.
‚ÄúI feel obliged to point out that BCC and the commenters here didn‚Äôt start the fire‚Äù
Nope ‚Äì it was always burning since the world‚Äôs been turning
No we didn‚Äôt light it, but we tried to fight it
.
.
No need to blame the Church. it‚Äôs not like this is a new thing.
I‚Äôm late to this post but I find some of the sentiments expressed in the comments puzzling. Why on earth should I care what my neighbor cuts out of his/her movies (or doesn‚Äôt cut out)? I learned years ago that I was sensitive to certain content in movies, even if the worst ‚Äúbits‚Äù were removed. I only ever watched one Clean Flicks VHS ‚Äì it was of Enemy at the Gates and it was supposedly edited down to PG. But the themes of a movie are something you can‚Äôt edit away, and I was still disturbed by what I didn‚Äôt see, if that makes sense. I use VidAngel all the time to watch movies and cut out the stuff that bothers me, but I am well aware of the limitations of filters on thematic elements. I think there‚Äôs absolutely a time and a place for filters and I‚Äôm happy to have the option to use them for myself and for my kids (like cutting out the million ‚Äúoh my god!‚Äùs in The Parent Trap or whatever). I truly think this comes down to the fact that some people are more affected by what they see on the screen than others, and if someone is more sensitive than me (or less sensitive, like my husband), then who am I to judge them for what they watch?
A guy on a podcast I listen to, not of our faith, used VidAngel to show his 10-year-old the old Ghostbusters (an excellent Christmas movie!) without that completely unnecessary sex scene, which sounds like a perfect use-case.
I think an ounce of critical thinking is better than a pound of filtering, but that‚Äôs mostly because I‚Äôm a snob. I‚Äôm glad all these comments helped bring me to repentance ‚Äì shine on you crazy, filtering diamonds.
Well, of course you have no standing, but when has that ever stopped anyone? My point isn‚Äôt that we should continue to point fingers with abandon, but neither let us pretend that it began with someone like me who is surprised that members of the Church resort to filtering filth‚Äìpolishing a turd, to put it bluntly‚Äìnot because they have to but because they want to! Ok, maybe most of us are not filtering Deadpool, and far be it from me to insist that everyone consume everything that comes their way. But the sensitivity justification simply doesn‚Äôt fly‚Äìin my decades of church membership it‚Äôs never been the case that it‚Äôs all good, just some are sensitive than others, so let them filter in peace. Rather, it has been lines in the sand (drawn essentially by an America-centric ratings board), across which members in good standing will not step!Nsa chica 42051 for friend to wants

The word "fertile" means the ability to procreate.
1 min read
Men start producing sperm during puberty and new sperm are produced for the rest of their lives. The quality of the sperm can decrease as men get older, although this isn't always the case.
Women have eggs in their ovaries from birth. The beginning of ovulation is indicated when girls have their first period at the start of puberty. When ovulation starts, girls become fertile. The chance of having a baby decreases from the age of around thirty-five for women. After forty it is often difficult to become pregnant, although this varies from individual to.Using Critical Incidents and E-Portfolios to Understand the Emergent Practice of Japanese Student-Teachers of English
Source: Teaching and Teacher Education, Volume 62 ( February 2017), p. 1-9
(Reviewed by the Portal Team)
This article aims to describe the nature of emergent practice arising from conflicts student-teachers experienced in a teaching practicum and its implications for teacher learning.
Methods
The participants were 10 student-teachers located at three secondary schools in Thailand. They were all English education majors from a Japanese university, nine were third year undergraduate students and one was a graduate student.
The authors used critical incident (CI) writing in ePortfolios as a means for student-teachers to record conflicts experienced and what was learned from them.
The student-teachers participated a 2-week teaching practicum at three Thai secondary schools recording their Critical incidents in an ePortfolio.
Discussion
The authors identified new teaching principles students developed through this experience. The principles include what the student-teachers felt is important for teaching in a communicative manner.
Furthermore, the authors also identified techniques and strategies they felt helped them teach effectively at their schools. Lastly, the critical incident also gives a view into the teaching principles, strategies, and world-view which comprise student-teacher emergent practice.
The authors also regard the issue of theory to practice.
The authors have argued that none of the student-teachers mentioned any kind of teaching methodology, teaching concept, or learning concept they learned about in their university teaching methodology classes. The authors argue that if student-teachers are to relate their experiences to their university learning, they will arguably need some direction.
Finally, the authors redesign the emergent practice to provide students with more scaffolding which would help them better understand the concept of critical incidents and encourage them to use critical incidents as a means to reflect on their emergent practice.
For each critical incident, there are four subfields: category, incident, significance, and result. The categories are designed to help students link their critical incidents with the changes they wrote in the first page as well as with the skills necessary to be successful in the program. The incident is designed to help the students describe the incident that occurred.
The purpose of the significance is to help the students explain how they felt and why this incident was important. The result is designed to help the students explain, the changes to their teaching, beliefs, or world perspectives this incident brought about.
Conclusion
The authors conclude that through using the critical incident technique they were able to understand the nature of students' emergent practice: the new general concepts about teaching they developed as well as localized teaching techniques they employed. The critical incident also show the experiences of cognitive dissonance are not necessarily negative. The authors argue that although they were successful using the critical incident technique to analyze the students' experience on the practicum, the students themselves might have been confused about the concept of critical incidents. Furthermore, the authors were unable to bridge the theory practice divide as they originally planned.Particular. ‚Ä¶ Continue reading Particular enginesRevision as of 00:02, 19 November 2010.

It doesn‚Äôt matter what language they speak or where they live: we know what it means to be a diver in difficulty and regardless of our differences, we support them in every way.
Getting the right help,
at the right time
The Claudius Obermaier Fund bears the name of a young German diver who died during a technical dive. When needed, the fund steps in to help those who have been affected, directly or indirectly, by a diving-related incident. Over the years, the Fund has financed:
- Special medical care
- Medical evacuation following serious accidents
- Prosthesis
- Special means of transport for tetraplegic
- School grants for orphans of deceased divers
READ THE STORIESREAD THE STORIES
While on a diving holiday in Cambodia, Belgian diving instructor Adriana K. got involved in a terrible bus accident.
She was badly injured, while some other passengers died. She was left laying on the ground for two hours, and was finally transported by car to the Bangkok Hospital. As a result of the accident, she had her back broken in three different places, and had to stop teaching diving. She was left without any personal income.
The COF stepped in to help, providing her with a special orthopaedic bed and kinesitherapy treatments.
"Yesterday was a day to remember or to forget. We took a bus from Sihanoukville to Trat Thailand to teach an IDC in Koh Chang... The bus had no breaks at all and with great speed the driver tried to keep the bus on his wheels. It looked for a second like he regained the control but then the bus swung to one side balanced to the other and then fell on his right side and skidded down the hill... I helped Adje to leave the bus by one of the roof exits. She was bruised all over and had serious back pain...I stayed behind to help. First I took out a 2 year-old girl... A guy was standing over a girl trying to reanimate her. We took her out of the bus and I began CPR... A friendly German living in Cambodia wanted to help us get to the border, so we took a taxi to Pattaya and went to the Bangkok Hospital."
(Adriana's husband)
"Thank you for the medical bed I received from the DAN COF. I have been sleeping there for just one week, but the reasults are already very good: I have recovered a 80% of mobility in the morning. I can also sleep a whole night, which has not been possible since the day of my accident. Thanks again."
(Adriana K.)
In 2013, Portuguese diver Jorge B. died during a dive, leaving a wife and two daughters. The Fund supported Jorge's family by donating ‚Ç¨ 5.000, to be used for the education costs of the younger daughter.
The donation took place during a public event, in September 2014 in Lisbon.
"When those we love practice risky activities, which technology makes us consider a controlled risk, we can never imagine that a dive, a goodbye, like many others, may be the last one.
Only when we face a loss, we realise that everything which seems impossible to happen, can actually happen.
The loss of Jorge was sudden and abrupt, and neither I nor our daughter Margarida were prepared to face such a harsh reality. It was a very difficult year for us, during which nothing could alleviate the pain. Without a chance of a farewell, it was even harder to bear.
For me and Margarida, having been received at the Claudius Obermaier Fund ceremony in Lisbon was like a balm that helped us remember with harmony the great passion of Jorge for diving, and made us feel the warmth of the large ‚Äúdiving family‚Äù. For Margarida in particular, stimulating her admiration for the father and for his profession, and feeling the consideration of all present at the ceremony, was very important for her emotional stability. As for the economic side, what to some may seem a tiny help, to those who experience so many adversities like us, it makes the difference.
I have no words to describe how important it is to feel the presence of the missing ones, through the gestures of those who remain and, in solidarity, alleviate the pain that, although always with us, is less arid and harsh.
Thank you all for your support.‚Äù
(Jorge's wife)
On April 16th, 2013 in Koh Tachai, Thailand, when a storm suddenly hit the area, the dive boat Little Princess started to sink. Some of the divers present chose not to abandon the ship until the others were saved, crew included.
The Fund profoundly recognized the heroes for their exemplary courage and altruism, and to show its appreciation financed the purchase of new equipment after it was lost saving the lives of others.
"You have helped all of the instructors and the Thai crew that were onboard on this unfortunate day. It means soo much to everyone and from myself. I personally will be happy to continue my membership as long I continue to teach in the future as everyone has been so helpful and fantastic during this difficult time. Please relay my thanks to your team and their support that they all have shown.
(A DAN Member who survived the shipwreck)
On Dec. 26th 2004, a destructive tsunami hits the Indian Ocean, leaving death and destruction behind. In the first months of 2005, one task force, lead by the Department of legal medicine of the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, directs a mission financed by The Claudius Obermaier Fund.
During two different searches, 180 buried bodies are identified in 92 different islands, with utmost respect for the local customs, which are particularly strict regarding the exhumation of bodies.
"The Disaster Victim Identification Team has high regard for the Maldivian authorities whose hospitality knew no bounds and experienced full cooperation in a friendly atmosphere. The team has gained incalculable experience in the process of international disaster victim identification and established liaison between our High Commission in New Delhi and the Maldivian authorities".
(The DVI Team)
"I was so impressed by the energy of the Thai people. I think that positive thinking is exactly the right word to explain their mentality. They said, 'Let's think about the future!'. Everyone started reconstruction work with smiles on their faces. I truly respect their attitude. I said to my friend Thaies, 'let me know if there's anything I can do to help". But he said, "You have your own job to do. Please invite lots of divers."
(Seiji Atsuta - Instructor/ DAN Japan)
Good job DAN! Still the best choice for all divers; this story only proves that DAN is more than an insurance... DAN has a heart!"

Are your hands dirty? It‚Äôs not always good to use hand sanitizers, which can sometimes be bad, as a result of their unnatural contents. Try the natural way out; and it‚Äôs to pour lemon or lime into a bowl-full of water, and wash your hands up to your wrist in it.(Most people only wash their fingers, when washing hands, but that is not a Good Practice).
Wash your hands like how the Jews wash their hands.
That‚Äôs the correct way, to keep your hands and fingers off germs and every unwanted particles, before holding something, or before touching food.
This best way, is to wash your hands up to about 3-4 inches above the wrist, which we have shown in the picture.
In this way, this will keep germs far away from your fingers or hands.
Meanwhile, before you do that, make sure you pour lime or lemon into water, with a little honey if you have some to rinse your hands thoroughly. This should come after you‚Äôve washed your hands with a soap, or a detergent. The acidic water, will keep your hands thoroughly clean! This is why you need to get, a lemon or a lime tree, in your house, as one of ‚ÄòTrees‚Äô that must be in your house., as a result of their important use.
Keep your hands clean from dirt regularly.

Depending on how long you have been using the web, you may remember a time when all functionality was handled by servers. You loaded a page, decided what you were going to do next, clicked (this was several years before smart phones so no tapping‚Ä¶ yet) and waited while the server processed your choice. After the server had built the next representation of the state of your session and sent it back down the wire to be rendered by Internet Explorer - your flavour may vary, but I first used IE 3 - you then repeated the whole process until you got bored (or your housemate tried to use the dial-up too and dropped your connection).
Circa the year 1999 Microsoft introduced an ActiveX component in IE 5 which lay the foundations for what we typically refer to as AJAX. After a few years incubation, greater adoption by browser vendors and some high-profile launches from Google (Gmail and Maps were among the first to deliver cross-browser experiences using XMLHttpRequest), rich interactive experiences were appearing everywhere and Web 2.0 was born. However, there was a problem - search engines didn‚Äôt execute JavaScript, which was, and remains, the de facto tool in browsers to facilitate server requests from within a page. Any content that appeared on a page as a result of
XMLHttpRequest usage was invisible to their bots and left out of the index.
In 2009, Google recognised the rising trend for web applications being built using AJAX and client-side rendering and announced their AJAX Crawling Scheme. In a nutshell, this scheme provided a way for developers to tell Google where to find a HTML snapshot which mirrored the client-side state seen by a user.
The end of Google‚Äôs AJAX Crawling Scheme
About a month ago (October 2015) Google announced the end of support for the AJAX Crawling Scheme. The rationale for this deprecation being that their crawling bot has become sophisticated enough to render a page and execute any linked/inline JavaScript, enough that there is no longer a need to provide a HTML snapshot at some pre-arranged meeting place.
That‚Äôs the theory at least, but we had an inkling that while JavaScript would be executed, the bots would still only see content contained either in the HTML itself or the parsed JavaScript. Or, to be more clear, if your site was AJAX powered and called in content from APIs, you‚Äôre still invisible.
To try and understand if this is the case I specifically asked if API-driven sites would be penalised and received a response from John Mueller - Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google:
Ian Thomas - How well does the crawler handle SPAs that compose their content from further XHR calls on load? I‚Äôve seen good results with apps that bundle their content into their JS payload but nothing to suggest that those backed by an API with data loaded after DOM Ready will be as well crawled.
John Mueller - I‚Äôd use the Fetch and Render tool to double-check. Loading data via AJAX/JSON shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, as long as everything‚Äôs crawlable.
This announcement is interesting because, if true, this opens up the world of SPAs to websites which rely on search engines for traffic acquisition. Coupled with the fast paced JavaScript ecosystem,there are some interesting opportunities arising from removing the requirement to render HTML on a server.
Why should we favour client-side rendering?
Web applications which implement client-side rendering can feel faster than more traditional websites. Looking specifically at our own Skybet mobile site, there are significant performance enhancements achieved by not requiring a full page load on every customer action. Additionally, the introduction of transition feedback and persistent UI elements during content load makes browsing the site feel slicker.
There are product features that only become possible with client-side rendering - an example being our recently released video player which can be docked to the top of the screen allowing uninterrupted stream viewing across page views.
Our service relies on real-time data to ensure that customers receive accurate odds and in-play information so we already have a large dependency on JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Moving to a thick client, thin server approach would keep all our view logic in one place (rather than duplicated across PHP into JavaScript) and opens up innovative approaches to building interfaces using components (whether that be using Polymer, React, Ember or AngularJS).1
A client-only stack can take advantage of advanced tooling designed to optimise developer productivity and UI performance such as Webpack or Browserify. It‚Äôs also possible to separate out data dependencies without need to understand a component tree ahead of sending a response back from a server - allowing us to deliver a library of components which can be plugged in and re-used across applications.2
An additional benefit arising from client-side rendering is the requirement to power the front-end through well defined APIs. This helps decouple our platform and allows us to develop new products from our data or even open up our service to third-parties to build new applications as part of a wider Sky Betting & Gaming ecosystem.
Why shouldn‚Äôt we favour client-side rendering?
While it is great that Google is trumpeting the ability to render pages as a standard browser would, unfortunately they aren‚Äôt the only crawler in town. Other third parties (such as Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, etc.) often crawl links shared to their platform to bring back relevant content to insert into their own pages. If we remove the server-side markup entirely it‚Äôs highly likely that these services will not have the ability to execute JavaScript to the same standard as the Google bot. This could mean poor brand exposure on those platforms which may result in a significant drop in referral traffic.
It also remains to be seen just how well search engines can understand API-driven websites. While there is strong evidence showing that SPAs that include JSON payloads or content as part of their JavaScript bundles are rendered and indexed correctly, there still is little to prove that API-driven sites which rely on further XHR requests after a DOM ready event have their full content crawled.
There are some performance concerns here too - while client-side rendering should significantly reduce the response time for initial page load, depending on how the application is built there may be an issue with slow APIs resulting in a noticeable wait for real content on a page. Server-side rendering potentially removes the perception of slow performance by sending back real content immediately so, even if JavaScript hasn‚Äôt finished parsing and executing, the application appears to be responsive and the user can engage with the content.
Are there any non-functional concerns about removing server rendering?
Choosing to go with a third-party framework could be risky as we don‚Äôt have ownership of their development roadmap and there are no guarantees of long term support. We can make educated decisions to mitigate this risk and given the main contributor to React and Redux is Facebook, it seems to be a risk that we can afford to take. That said, if ever we wanted to experiment with a new technology for a single part of the site, that would be very difficult indeed.
We know the performance profile of our servers and can scale appropriately, moving more processing to the client removes any control we have over the execution environment. Initial performance tests show an increased usage of device CPU (which is to be expected) so for those customers on older/weaker devices there may be greater performance penalties than a server rendered approach and we may cause excessive battery drain if we aren‚Äôt careful.
There‚Äôs also an increased reliance on monitoring real-user data to ensure products are working as expected. We have very detailed logging from our servers which gives detailed visibility of their health and makes debugging issues less painful. When a significant amount of processing is done on a customer‚Äôs device we do not have the same level of control or visibility so triage and debugging could be much harder. Equally, the sheer number of different devices and software makes it difficult to pinpoint problems precisely.
How can we put this approach to the test?
SEO and rich links from third parties are critical to our marketing and ongoing acquisition strategy; we need to be certain that this approach won‚Äôt incur SEO penalties. We decided that the simplest way to test this theory was to build a lightweight website which is entirely client-side rendered and see what gets indexed. This blog post is our organic way of linking to the proof of concept so search engines can find it (and, of course, so that you can view our thinking)!
In addition to organic indexing, we can hook up the site to Google‚Äôs Webmaster tools to Test what Google sees through the fetch and render - this is the most immediate way to get a feel for how crawlers might see the site.
How did we build it?
It‚Äôs always exciting to have the opportunity to work on completely greenfield projects so we took the opportunity with this spike to review several exciting front-end technologies that we‚Äôve had our eye on for a while:
- React
- Redux
- React Router
- ES2015 transpiled via Babel
- CSS modules
- CSSNext
- PostCSS
- Webpack
- Hot Module Reloading
We currently use several of these in production as part of our Bet Tracker and Cash Out product but JavaScript packages don‚Äôt stand still for long so it was good for us to experiment with the latest approaches coming from the wider community. It was particularly exciting to be able to investigate CSS modules as, like many long-lived websites, the scaling and maintenance of our CSS is a particularly thorny topic.
If you‚Äôre interested to see what we built, it‚Äôs available to view at.
The results‚Ä¶
Well, it‚Äôs a bit early to say on this one, but early signs are not so good for getting our content into Google. Using the fetch and render feature shows a beautifully accurate representation of the loading state of the demo website, with none of the API requests having completed at the time an image was captured. Whether this means that the actual indexing behaviour also misses the XHR data fetch is yet to be seen, we‚Äôll have to wait to see how any organic crawling performs.
Keep checking for a follow on post containing the full results of this test.
We are specifically looking at the way a component based UI could work using a technology like React, but the other frameworks mentioned are equally capable at working in this way. ‚Ü©
As we are specifically looking at React the component lifecycle could be used to empower smart components which know how to fetch and update their own state from dedicated endpoints - an approach that is inefficient and difficult to implement cleanly when using React‚Äôs server side rendering capability. ‚Ü©1952 Chevrolet Bel Air For Sale

Well, we went ahead and took care of that for you by placing a gold dot on one half of the numbers indicating that you should add +10. We understand the adrenaline rush of seeing that NAT 20 come up so we went ahead and placed the five pronged symbol of Arkhan‚Äôs Dragon Goddess as the high number not only on the 20 side but also on the high numbers on the other four dice as well!

THANK YOU.Blocksync Ventures Invests in Synthetic Assets Startup Shadows Network
We‚Äôre pleased to announce that Blocksync Ventures has completed an early stage investment in Polkadot project Shadows Network.
A decentralized protocol for issuing, trading, and lending synthetic assets, Shadows Network is the first project to bring synths to Polkadot‚Äôs Substrate framework of interconnected parachains, with all the potential this brings for disrupting a multi-trillion dollar market.
It is our belief that tokenized synths will be one of the major growth areas in crypto over the next five years, as more and more value is represented onchain, where assets can be traded permissionlessly 24/7.
Why Shadows Network?
Blocksync Ventures was founded with a mandate to seek out the most innovative projects building web3 solutions, with a particular focus on the Polkadot ecosystem. Shadows Network ticks all the right boxes, and boasts an accomplished team who are capable of building out their impressive tech.
The case for recreating traditional assets onchain shouldn‚Äôt need much explaining: in our view it‚Äôs the natural evolution of financial markets, enabling global access to stocks, commodities, indices, and much more. The upside in bringing this financial infrastructure to a blockchain environment cannot be overstated; Synthetix already has $2 billion in value locked into its protocol. Shadows Network is building an entirely new infrastructure for synthetic assets on Polkadot‚Äôs more scalable and interoperable framework, without the constraints that are inherent to Ethereum.
Projects such as Synthetix and Mirror Protocol have demonstrated the demand for tokenized stocks, fiat currencies, and commodities in a crypto context. Shadows Network will take these primitives to a new level by pioneering an interoperable ecosystem for synthetic issuance and trading on Polkadot.
Shadows Network is building out a versatile cross-chain solution that will enable real-world assets to be traded by anyone, anywhere. The potential use cases for this technology are limitless, and we‚Äôre excited to support the Shadows team as they build out their protocol, heralding a new era for synthetic asset swaps.
Shadows Network CEO Iror Chen said: ‚ÄúBlocksync Ventures were the first investment firm to really get what we‚Äôre building, and recognize the value of provisioning synthetic assets within Polkadot‚Äôs scalable, Substrate environment. With their support, we look forward to delivering on our long-term roadmap and capturing a slice of the multi-trillion dollar financial markets that are ripe for being recreated onchain, where anyone can participate.‚Äù

January 14, 2020 | Lea Hart
NC State College of Design students and faculty are using design to tackle housing insecurity. Here‚Äôs how:
The results of Professor Tom Barrie‚Äôs fall 2019 studio course yielded education for his students, and produced a tangible takeaway to combat housing insecurity among NC State students.
Barrie‚Äôs studio class, Affordable and Supportive Housing for NC State, explored possible solutions to student housing insecurity. The concept connected with the results of a 2017 research study by the NC State Food and Housing Security Initiative, co-chaired by psychology professor Mary Haskett and Sarah Wright, TRIO academic coach at the university, which found that almost 10 percent of NC State students had experienced homelessness within a 30-day period.
In the time since, Haskett and Wright have been bringing people together to find solutions for supporting students facing both food and housing insecurity. Barrie, professor of architecture in the College of Design as well as director of the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Initiative, serves on their committee and viewed the fall studio as an opportunity to contribute to solving housing insecurity on campus.

As far as finding the right deal is concerned, you should make use of various news, blogs and forum web sites on the World Wide Web. You will get to know about the various criticisms of debt settlement, its plans, practices and policies. Rather than launching into a theoretical tirade against all this and asking for, government support or something as unrealistic as that, you should adopt a practical and goal oriented approach.
Your goal should be to get the best deal possible from the honest settlement company.
Whether the market is filled with fraudulent companies or whether other persons are not in a position to find the right deal should not be of concern. Since you are at the doorstep of bankruptcy, you should focus on all those solutions that will help you overcome your problem.

I‚Äôve devoted a lot of posts to this issue. In spite of what‚Äôs been suggested in comments, I‚Äôm not a one-wayist, but it‚Äôs hard to see this as anything other than an approach rooted in the idea that these people are beyond help and untreatable. Much of the analysis I‚Äôve read focuses on social benefits rather than benefits to the individual. When they‚Äôve tried treating these people with the same methods we‚Äôve offered physicians and failed, then, maybe, there‚Äôs a case for experimenting with this kind of approach.

4 thoughts on ‚ÄúMore on heroin as treatment for heroin addiction‚Äù
I don't know what to think of this issue. It seems you can point to different studies to support any view. My son was a hard core heroin addict (the kind they want to treat with free heroin). He has been homeless, sick, jailed, rehabed, etc. Now he is in prison, but soon to be released. None of these consequences have been his bottom, although I can tell by looking at him (and I send very little money) that he is not using in prison. But once he is out of a controlled environment, all bets are off. I remain hopeful, but I will not let him come home, so he will be going to a half way house. I'm skeptical of his chances there without therapy, meetings, etc. After 8 years of using, I feel like methadone is an option for him (if he picks up again), although inside it feels like failure to me. I appreciate these articles, and I like reading different opinions on this.
I wish you and your son the best as he gets released.
BTW ‚Äì If he's interested in sober housing and/or treatment, have him give us a call.

Ethiopia‚Äôs development has been greatly hindered by the human capacity to absorb it. Management, development, education, and skilled labor are necessary to support a proper growing economy. The extent to which the educational institutions and the government can meet the needs for human capital will determine the future in Ethiopia. Educated and skilled professionals are needed.
Our Approach
Ethiopian Diaspora Fellowship (EDF) will offer exceptional applicants the opportunity to participate in educational programs and trainings, work in different organizations in Ethiopia, and network with local professionals. Fellows will be trained in key areas such as leadership, service, and creative storytelling. Once in Ethiopia, fellows will participate in peer-to-peer mentorship to increase cultural identity and promote a knowledge sharing opportunity. Lastly, fellows will be encouraged to document their experience thoroughly through different mediums, in order to define and redefine what it means for them to be an Ethiopian.This weekend, The Mister and I are taking Little Tiger and The Milk Belly Princess to see "Charlotte's Web" at a local theater. Prior to watching the play, I thought it would be fun for Little Tiger and I to read E. B. White's classic story. Unlike her younger sister, Little Tiger is old enough to enjoy a chapter book with limited pictures. We started about two weeks ago and finished on Tuesday night. Little Tiger REALLY enjoyed the story and I got more out of it as a parent than I did when my own mother read it to me as a small child.
As a little girl, I was enamored with the idea of talking animals and Garth Williams' gentle drawings. I could not begin to appreciate half of Charlotte's wisdom in the way I did while reading the story as an adult. Earlier this week, I was especially struck by what Charlotte told Wilbur when he asked her why she worked so hard to save his' (White 164).
In the beginning, when Mr. Arable wanted to kill Wilbur, Little Tiger was very worried about what was going to happen to him, which made me worry about how she would react to Charlotte's death in the end. As it turns out, while she was upset at the prospect of Wilbur's untimely, violent death, Little Tiger took Charlotte's peaceful passing due to old age in stride. She said that she "felt bad for Charlotte," but was really excited for Charlotte's eggs to hatch and to see the new baby spiders.
I was the one who was more choked up about Charlotte's death. We read the majority of the book lying next to one another in Little Tiger's bed, but when it was time for that part of the story, I sat up and had Little Tiger sit in my lap. I wasn't sure if I was going to cry or whether my doing so would be upsetting for my daughter. I know that crying is natural, and I usually don't go out of my way to mask my emotions when I'm truly sad about something like an illness or a death in the family. However, I feel like at the age of five Little Tiger is still too young to fully understand why someone would cry over a story that they chose to read and select "entertainment" that they knew would stir such strong and , in her eyes, negative emotions. In fact, at the age of 36, I'm not sure that I fully understand that myself. I do it, and on some level I suppose I "enjoy" it, but I don't understand it.
When my mother gave Little Tiger "Charlotte's Web" last Christmas she also gave her a little stuffed pig to snuggle while we read the story. After we finished the story, and Little Tiger was tucked into her bed I decided that our own Wilbur could use some embellishment so I found some ribbon, felt and embroidery floss and made this:
Charlotte also wove "terrific," "radiant," and "humble" into her web, but I think this says it all.
If I could spin a web for you, it would say "brilliant".

you are aware that crew from one airline fly jump/excess on others quite routinely, right?
I'll give her ticket if you contact meLydie de Rochefort-Th√©obon, Comtesse de Beuvron
Born in the same year as Louis XIV, Lydie, although in favour of the Sun King for quite a while, is one of his lesser known mistresses.
She was the daughter of Jean de Rochefort-Theobon and his wife Anne de Chaussade de La Mothe. The couple also had a son, Charles Bordeaux de Rochefort, as well as two more daughters, Marie Guyonne de Rochefort-Th√©obon and Fran√ßoise de Rochefort-Th√©obon. The latter was known at court as Mademoiselle de Loub√®s and apparently acted as spy for the Chevalier de Lorraine after she got a position as demoiselle d‚Äôhonneur to the second Madame.
Lydie‚Äôs family was of old nobility and she was probably born at the ch√¢teau de Lespinasse, where she spent most of her childhood.
Known at court as Mademoiselle de Theobon, Lydie became a demoiselle d‚Äôhonneur to Marie-Th√©r√®se d‚ÄôAutriche some-when before 1670. Madame de S√©vign√© relates a funny anecdote of an indecent that took place in 1671. Lydie, Madame de Ludres, and some others were bitten by a small dog and it was feared they might get a case of rabies. To prevent that, all of those involved were sent to Dieppe, at the coast of Normandy, in order to hop into the sea, which was a treatment advised by the Messieurs Doctors to prevent rabies. Mademoiselle de Theobon did not want to go, but the Queen refused to let any of them serve her until they had contact with sea-water. Thus Louis XIV himself ordered the ladies, which made much ado about it, to go.
At that time, which might explain her refusal to leave, Lydie received frequent visits from the King already. The affair apparently started during a visit to Chambord and is even mentioned by Spanheim, ambassador of Prussia in France, in his secret dispatches. It went on through the years 1671 and 1672, where the Marquis de Saint-Maurice mentions it is believed the King enjoys to spend time in company of Mademoiselle de Theobon, and continued to at least the end of 1673.
The Marquis de Saint-Maurice mentioned in February 1673, that the Queen‚Äôs ladies were not present at a ball at Saint-Germain, which led many to believe it might be because Madame de Montespan could be pregnant and thus does not wish to give her royal paramour a chance to ogle them. He also mentions that it seems the King is entertaining himself with Mademoiselle de Theobon quite often, who is believed to have been honoured by him in the past as well. The fun was over for a while by November. Madame de Montespan was quite the jealous type and aware her lover amused himself with the demoiselles d‚Äôhonneur. She tried all she could to get him to dismiss the demoiselles, and replace them with pious married ladies, but he turned the idea down for quite a while. Until November 26 in 1673. Lydie was thus dismissed, along with many others. She, and some of the other girls, afterwards became demoiselles d‚Äôhonneur to Liselotte von der Pfalz.
Apparently, she was then approached by Monsieur to keep an eye on his new wife, but that did not quite work out, because Lydie and Madame became friends rather quickly.
Her affair with the King was not entirely over either. Madame de S√©vign√© mentioned her in a letter to her daughter, dated 7 August 1676. She hints that Louis XIV still had quite passionate feelings for her, and she for him, which some at court believed to be rather ridiculous, since they saw no chance that Lydie could ever replace Quanto, her nickname for Madame de Montespan.
Around the same time, as she was nearly forty years old, Lydie considered marriage. Mademoiselle de Theobon had her eyes on another Louis, namely Louis Oger de Cavoye‚Ä¶.but a other of Madame‚Äôs demoiselles beat her to it and he married Louise-Philippe de Co√´tlogon in 1677 instead of Lydie.
Lydie nevertheless found herself a other dashing gentleman to marry the following year. It was Charles d‚ÄôHarcourt, Comte de Beuvron, capitaine des gardes de Monsieur.
The year 1682, wasn‚Äôt too good a year for the now Comtesse de Beuvron. Being friends with Madame, she got into the line of fire between Madame and Monsieur and was forced to retire, spending some time in various cloisters. She remained faithful to Madame anyway and Madame often mentioned her in her letters. In one she calls her the ‚Äúdie gute schwarze Jungfer‚Äù -the good dark maid- referring to Lydie‚Äôs dark hair and complexion, in a other she writes ‚ÄúIch habe sie sehr lieb‚Äù -she is very dear to me-.
With revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lydie converted Catholicism. She was widowed, childless and poor, three years later, in 1688, yet remained very close to the family of her late-husband. The Comtesse and Madame saw more of each other again the same year and, at the request of Madame, Louis XIV doubled Lydie‚Äôs pension. Raising it from 2000 livres a year to 4000 livres.
Yet, Lydie was still not allowed to officially return to Madame‚Äôs side by Monsieur. In hopes to change that, she took in mind to marry one of Monsieur‚Äôs favourites, the also widowed Marquis d‚ÄôEffiat. Madame did not like that one bit. Monsieur doesn‚Äôt seem to have minded, since it looks like he intended to request his brother to turn the Marquis into a Duc. The marriage never took place. Madame was so outraged such a scandalous marriage was even considered, that she prevented it. Thus the Comtesse de Bouvron did not return to Madame‚Äôs side until 1701, after Monsieur died.
Lydie died seven years later, October 23 in 1708, at Marly. Madame was much troubled by her demise. In a letter dated October 25, she writes: ‚ÄúI am writing to you today, although I am afflicted from the depths of my soul and ‚Ä¶ I lost the day before yesterday a good and faithful friend, namely the Comtesse de Beuvron, which has cruelly touched me. ‚Äú
