You have 2 options when paying your land tax liability.
You can:
- pay the full amount with a single payment by the due date shown on the assessment notice
or
- use the extended payment option (EPO) to make 3 equal payments 45, 90 and 150 days after the date of the assessment notice. The specific due dates for each payment are stated in your assessment notice and cannot be changed without cancelling your EPO.
Interest does not apply to the EPO (unless your second or third instalment is late).
You need to register a separate EPO arrangement for each financial year’s assessment.
Qualifying for an EPO
To qualify for an EPO, you must:
- register online within 35 days
- nominate a bank account to pay by direct debit.
1. Register within 35 days
You can register for the EPO at OSR Online within 35 days of the issue date of your assessment notice. If you try to register after the 35-day deadline, the EPO option will not be available. If you don’t have an OSR Online account yet, follow these steps to set one up.
- Log in and select:
- My land under My portfolio for your personal land tax account
- View accounts for another person, company or trust.
- Select Payments from the side menu.
- Select Request for extended payment option (EPO).
- Choose the bank account you want to use to make payment. If you haven’t added a bank account yet, select Add bank.
- Select Request EPO.
You’ll know your EPO is approved when you see Payment plan in your OSR Online account.
OSR Online will help you track your EPO payments. Select Payments, then View details (beneath the Payments due heading) to see amounts and due dates. If you do not register within the 35-day deadline, you must pay the full amount by the due date on the assessment notice (90 days after the issue date).
2. Nominate a bank account to pay by direct debit
The EPO is only available if you pay by direct debit.
Amounts you pay using another method will be considered ‘part-payments’ and not EPO payments. In those situations, regardless of the amount of the part-payment, unpaid tax interest (UTI) on outstanding amounts will begin to accrue on the 91st day from the date of the assessment notice.
Instalment amounts will be debited from your nominated bank account. Once you have nominated an account, it cannot be changed unless you tell us in writing at least 7 days before the date on which you wish the changes to take effect.
Find out how to set up a direct payment.
Conditions
There are a few conditions that you will need to know when registering for the EPO.
Sufficient funds
If there are not enough cleared funds in your account on any of the instalment dates, the EPO will be cancelled.
The table below sets out the new due date, the amount of land tax payable and the day unpaid tax interest (UTI) will start to accrue if you miss a payment.
Reassessments
Your land tax can be reassessed at any time during the period you are making EPO payments, in which case your EPO instalments may change.
If the reassessment is:
- 30 days or more before your next instalment is due—the amount of your remaining instalments may be adjusted for the reassessment
- less than 30 days before your next instalment due date—the next instalment will be the same, but subsequent payments will be adjusted
- issued after the EPO is finished—you will receive either:
- a refund
or
- a new assessment notice with 30 days to pay any additional amounts (the EPO will not be available for this notice).
We will notify you if this happens.
Early payments
Even if you elect to pay using the EPO, you can still pay the full amount or outstanding balance at any time. Once your payment is received, the EPO will be cancelled automatically.
You do not get a discount for choosing to make 1 payment, or paying early.
Payment errors
If a payment fails and your EPO is cancelled because of an error on our part, you can call us to have the EPO reinstated. This does not include situations where you have provided incorrect bank details, or do not have sufficient funds at the time of the scheduled instalment dates.Loved the practical "rewiring" assignments that helped me with understanding what really makes us happy. Not only this course changed my life perspective but enriched the lives of the people around me

Dr. Santos, I am a retired psychotherapist who started my professional life at Yale. This course has been extraordinarily helpful because I have my health, a loving family, more money than I need (and yes I find great satisfaction giving it to others) and yet it is by its very nature a time of life that can be difficult. I am fortunate to be an active competitive tennis player, yoga devotee, dog walker, an art docent, etc. but it is difficult to be bombarded by the death of family members, friends, etc. I was prompted to take this course by the death of my sister, a federal judge, 10 years younger than me 2 months ago which prompted the question, “How can one continue to live life to the fullest when reality is painful?”
I wanted to pass on to you that this course has helped me recenter and to feel that there are things that I can do to enjoy living without perseverating about the negatives. It has even helped my tennis game! I have read Flourish, Thanks and Mindfulness for Beginners. And I have become an advocate of the course, sharing details with friends I hope will take it.
Thank you,
Jean

I have taken a dozen courses online. This is the most challenging and fulfilling course I have taken so far. And I believe that the course shall be beneficial to all people in different walks of life.
創建者 Julia H•
The course is mostly about the opinion of the lecturer, which can be summed up to "social media is bad" and "money doesn't make you happy". A very simple minded world view is presented, without critical notions challenging that view or the more complex science behind emotions.
From Yale I would have expected a course that challenges such simple views and empoweres students to find the ideal path for themselves.

She ruined a perfectly good idea. From the synopsis, I realize that I have followed the precepts for years to be happy. This professor infused politics into her first week of lectures and ruined the good idea. I also learned long ago to walk away from negative people who want to rule other people (tell them who to vote for, tell them how to eat, tell them how to rear their children, tell them how to feel about religion, etc). This is me walking away.

This is the BEST course in coursera I've ever had. Living the good life weans you feel happy and fulfilled every day. This course changed my definition a lot. Initially I thought well-being is about your own life, nothing about others. But social connection maters a lot, to be connected with others, even talk to strangers would make you happy. On the other hand, I didn't realize exercise and sleep would be the magic medicine what makes you younger, more beautiful, thinner and with no side effect. I was so busy to work out and think only elderly needs to sleep longer, but I was wrong, after two weeks practice, exercises and sleep more lifted my happiness level a lot higher. I'm so grateful that I've choosen to study this course. Highly recommend to everyone who wants to be happier in life.

I have a hard time listening to these lectures because she up-talks (ends every other sentence on a high inflection note) which is very distracting. She also employs vocal fry, another distracting habit, that she would do well to eliminate. Also, she's taking credit for being the first to identify that you don't just need to know something but have to practice it, to be good at it, and naming it the GI Joe Fallacy. Surely this is not an original (or even profound) insight , as most everyone already knows this from trying to learn an instrument, a sport, solving math problems.

Having spent thousands on life coaches and getting little in return, growing more frustrated (and poorer!) with a lack of result and my objections met with being asked to "trust the process." Thank goodness I finally found this course. It helped me understand how and why I feel and behave the way I do. Grounded in science, evidence based, no faith required! More importantly, it walked me through a process that helped me finally make some changes I needed to make, while discarding the "goals" that I realised did little to serve my wellbeing.
創建者 Heidi w•
For me it was a bit research/data heavy. So much of what I learned in the course I had heard from spiritual leaders such as Pema Chodron and Thich Nhat Hanh. Or from yoga and meditation. I think the course should have an actual yoga and meditation session in it. Its ironic that the premise of the course is that "knowing is not enough" yet the there is sooooo much emphasis on the data. There should be more emphasis on experience.
創建者 Joe H•
I couldn't have asked for a better class to be offered during this time. Got to learn a lot about myself and why I think or do certain things without even thinking about it. Thank you for this course!
創建者 Jennifer S•
The course was interesting in terms of the statistics presented however it was VERY basic in concepts. Most examples given were geared towards millennial's and college students. I found the class to be quite boring at times and would have preferred her to introduce more complex concepts and information. I expected much more from Yale and this class was a bit disappointing. You can learn an entire weeks lecture from one CNN or NYT article.

創建者 Jonathan G•
very good course! However, it was extremely condescending and felt trivial or unnecessary during a lot of it. Of course anyone can set their own goals, but you don't need a course to do that!

The course renewed a number of things but mainly helped me focus on things that would increase my satisfaction with the things I do. As well as helping me reduce the frustrating gap between unrealistic aspirations on the way to achieve a sense of happiness and what I really have in my life, which is enough to live a life of satisfaction and quality of life.I fully recommend the course.

Published: 17/11/2021
The FBHVC (Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs) has been in dialogue with the Department for Transport regarding the recently released proposals within the DfT’s Future of Transport Regulatory Review.
In particular, there were concerns raised by the historic vehicle community around the implied intent of the review to make it an offence to modify, remove or reduce the effectiveness of an existing vehicle system.
The preliminary view of the Legislation Committee of the Federation (FBHVC) was that the consultation proposals that the DfT have put forward should be viewed in the context of a number of expected future developments in transport and any future legislation will be applicable to “tomorrow’s vehicles”. The Federation noted that the consultation document uses phrases that suggest it is forward looking in terms of regulation with phrases such as:
“[a] modern framework for tomorrow’s vehicles”
and
“[w]e anticipate a greater range of new and innovative road vehicle designs and associated technologies. We propose a flexible, proportionate and responsive approach to allow safe, secure and environmentally friendly vehicles to come to market. These vehicles need to be registered for use on our roads without undue delay.”
The Federation noted also the reference to the Law Commission 3-year review and the fact that this new consultation “compliments” their work in relation to legal frameworks for automated vehicle deployment. All this is suggestive that the new legal provisions are directed at the next generation of vehicles rather than those of the past. Thanks to the efforts of the Federation, new vehicle design, maintenance, equipment and inspection standards do not generally apply to earlier generations of vehicles.
The principle accepted within government and reflected in the Construction and Use Regulations and Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations is that a vehicle need only conform to the regulatory standards of its time to remain on the road. Subsequent standards are not applicable to it. In addition, where contemporary regulations did not specify a design or build standard, the law has not barred modifications to for example ignition, brakes and suspension in older vehicles to improve safety, reliability and efficiency. Thus, the main aim of the Federation’s response to the consultation was to ensure that the above principle was maintained and there was to be no retrospective application of any new provisions.
However, concerns were raised by a number of elements within the historic vehicle community around anti-tampering proposals in the consultation, in particular:
“We [ the DfT ] will create new offences for tampering with a system, part or component of a vehicle intended or adapted to be used on the road. This will enable us to address existing gaps in the legislation, ensuring cleaner and safer vehicles. We will also create new offences for tampering with non-road mobile machinery and for advertising “tampering” services or products.”
Concern was expressed by some that this may outlaw modifications conducted on historic vehicles and damage the many businesses either manufacturers or installers who rely on this trade.
As a benefit of the long-standing working relationship between FBHVC and DfT, the Federation received an early invitation to respond directly to the DfT ahead of the formal Consultation.
The Federation used this opportunity to ask for confirmation that the principle of no retrospective effect would be maintained and to address the concerns over anti tampering proposals. The Federation therefore sought assurances from the DfT on the following points:
a. The DfT would follow the existing long policy principle that the revised regulations will not have retrospective effect.
b. They would specifically not apply tampering provisions retrospectively, but confine them exclusively to “tomorrow’s” vehicles.
c. They would consider a specific exemption provision in the regulations allied to the definition of historic vehicles.
The Federation has received a detailed written response from the DfT, who have given assurances that they do not intend their proposals to prevent legitimate motorsport activities, prevent restoration, repairs or legitimate improvements to vehicles, such as classic cars or motorbikes or to negatively impact businesses involved in these activities. These assurances are reflected in the recent issue of an updated consultation paper on the DfT website.
They also confirmed older vehicles will not be expected to comply with new type approval standards. The type of activities they want to take more effective action against include tampering activities that prevent a vehicle’s emissions system from operating correctly and as vehicles become increasingly automated, to prevent alterations to a vehicle’s integral software and sensing technologies which create safety and security risks. A badly modified “autonomous vehicle” for example, has the potential to kill its occupants and other road users.
The prompt action by the Federation as a formal stakeholder, has produced a preliminary response from the DfT that will offer reassurance to those who have expressed concerns about potentially damaging legislation.
Clearly, any subsequent draft legislative proposals will have to be examined carefully. As a formal stakeholder, the Federation will be engaged in consultations on any future proposed legislation. It will also be providing a full response to the Consultation to ensure that initial undertakings are maintained throughout the process.Since I’m the petitioner in an uncontested and my husband was defaulted, if our final hearing date is tomorrow but I don’t go yet he does, will the divorce still go through?

South Africa is the second-largest exporter of citrus in the world, producing 60% of all citrus grown in the Southern Hemisphere. It exports more than 70 % of its citrus crop to the European Union and USA. Not being able to manage fungal pathogens effectively can have a serious impact on the global trade in not only citrus but also other food and fibre crops, such as bananas, coffee, and cacao.The Department of Plant Sciences at the University of the Free State (UFS) hosted a public lecture by Prof Pedro W. Crous entitled “Fungal Pathogens Impact Trade in Food and Fibre: The Need to Move Beyond Linnaeus” on the Bloemfontein Campus. Prof Crous is Director of the world’s largest fungal Biological Resource Centre, the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), in the Netherlands. He is also one of the top mycologists in the world.Since the topic of his lecture was very pertinent to food security and food safety worldwide, it was co-hosted by the Collaborative Consortium for Broadening the Food Base, a multi-institutional research programme managed by Prof Wijnand Swart in the Department of Plant Sciences.Reconsider the manner in which pathogens are identifiedProf Crous stressed that, because international trade in products from agricultural crops will expand, the introduction of fungal pathogens to new regions will increase. “There is therefore an urgent need to reconsider the manner in which these pathogens are identified and treated,” he said. According to Prof Crous, the older Linnaean system for naming living organisms cannot deal with future trade-related challenges involving pests and pathogens. A system, able to identify fungi based on their DNA and genetic coding, will equip scientists with the knowledge to know what they are dealing with, and whether it is a friendly or harmful fungus.

Embrace the molecular-based information systemProf Crous said that, as a consequence, scientists must embrace new technologies, such as the molecular-based information system for fungi, in order to provide the required knowledge. He presented this very exciting system which will govern the manner in which fungal pathogens linked to world trade are described. This system ensures that people from different countries will know with which pathogen they are dealing. Further, it will assist with the management of pathogens, ensuring that harmful pathogens do not spread from one country to another. More about Prof Pedro CrousProf Crous is an Affiliated Professor at six international universities, including the UFS, where he is associated with the Department of Plant Sciences. He has initiated several major activities to facilitate global research on fungal biodiversity, and has published more than 600 scientific papers, many in high impact journals, and authored or edited more than 20 books.

François-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes was my 6th great grandfather. Born at Montréal in 1700 to Jean-Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, and Marie-Marguerite Forestier. At age 18, he was an officer in the French Marines tasked with establishing an outpost on the Ouabash (Wabash) River near what is now Vincennes, Indiana. The city was named for him. Although Vincennes was technically part of his inherited title and not his actual name, he was usually referred to as "VinceBuilding one of our kits for your garden railway...
Building one of our kits is an easy and enjoyable project, along the lines of how Garden Railways started out many years ago.
In the early days, there was little choice when it came to making models of rolling stock or locomotives.
Ready-made equipment was for those with deep pockets and 'kits' hardly existed.
It was up to the ingenious hobbyists to 'invent' inexpensive ways to build wagons, coaches and even locomotives without breaking the bank.
One of the first (and most obvious) choices was to build using cardboard. Very often, this was simply an empty cereal packet, turned inside out.
At Rail-road models, we have gone back to the early days of the hobby, and brought back card models.
The major difference now of course is that we have 21st Century materials and technology to help us produce kits our early 'Railers' would have given their fishplates for.
First and foremost - Our kits are card. Yes, and we are proud of it.
NO - They are not made from cereal packets. We use very high quality Architects modelling board, with a full colour gloss printed surface. All you need to do is cut out the parts and glue them together.
With a bit of time, care and maybe a tad of added detail, the results will astound you.
We even go to the effort of 'weathering' most of our kits with faded, streaky body panels for a bit of added realism.
Even the cab and roof panels often have rain-streaks.
As many of our customers have said of their finished project - 'You wouldn't believe it was made of card - or how cheap!'
Below is a brief summary of putting together one of our kits. Of course, full instructions aren't shown to save space:
BUILDING THE FUNKEY DIESEL:
Locate parts 1 & 5. Glue part 29 to the end of part 1, making sure it is at the end with the window opening. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Make sure the bottoms of the parts line up properly.
Glue part 31 at the other end of the side panel, again making sure that the main part of the bottom lines up with the bottom of the side panel.
Carefully glue part 5 to the other sides of the end panels to form a box.
The windows in the side panels should both be at the same end.
Using parts 2, 6, 30, 32, assemble the other box section in exactly the same way. Again, both windows should be at the same end with the end panel containing corner cut-outs furthest from the windows.
Lay one cab side panel face down and glue the lower edge of the cab front panel in place, making sure that the roof ends line up first. Do not attempt to glue the whole edge together yet. When the glue on the lower join is dry, glue the top angled sides together and hold in place until dry.
Cyanoacrilate adhesive will make assembling the cab very straightforward.
Repeat for the other cab side panel.
Glue cab rear panel 58 in place on the back of the cab, taking care to make sure the lower edge lines up with the bottoms of the cab sides.
Repeat all the above for the other cab section.
When dry, carefully glue the cab sections in place at the ends of the main body, making sure that all of the floor edges are perfectly in line and level. Clamp the cab sections in place until the glue dries.
Cut out 4 x parts ‘ROOF A’. Glue these in place across the main body at 60mm centres. Allow to dry fully before proceeding.
Carefully ‘drag’ a curve into the two long roof panels BEFORE cutting them out of the sheet. This will avoid creases and help in achieving a smooth curve.
Cut out the panels and re-adjust the previously formed curve.
Position the panels on the loco body and trim to length.
Apply a bead of glue around the upper walls and across the roof supports on the loco body. Carefully fix the roof panels in place.
Cut out parts 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. Colour all edges black.
Glue parts 21 & 23 together to form a ‘sandwich’. Repeat with parts 22 & 26.
Glue these components in place over the location below the front cab roof.
Glue the four lights in place over the locations on the front panels of the cab with the RED lights inside.
Cut out all the grill panels 9 through 18. Colour all edges black or body colour.
Glue in place over the printed panels on the loco body sides.
Of course, the above is just a very brief example of how our kits are built.
The actual instructions are VERY thorough, and there are lots of illustrations - most of our kits have full colour photo instructions - just like the ones shown here.
If you've never built one of our kits - have a go!
You won't be disappointed.

Currently, South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria are trialling such apps, which use geolocation and facial recognition technology to help monitor compliance with COVID-19 quarantine measures. For example, over 97,000 residents have already used Western Australia’s home quarantine app, the G2G pass.
The report called on state governments to “regain the public’s trust” after police (in Queensland and Western Australia) were caught accessing data collected in COVID-19 contact tracing apps to assist in investigations.
“It is important to learn the lessons of recent history and not allow moments of global crisis, like the pandemic, to reshape the way surveillance technology is used,” Peter Lewis, director of the Centre for Responsible Technology, said in a press release on Oct. 11.
“Twenty years ago, the world responded to 9/11 and the threat of terror by forcing technology companies to access the search history of their users, something that had never been contemplated before.
“Once this increased degree of surveillance was normalised, it was adopted by corporations like Google and Facebook to track users and to target ads, and by governments around the world to control their citizens.
“While it is important to get quarantine models right, the idea that facial recognition technology should be the primary monitoring tool for home quarantine should be treated with real scepticism,” he said.
Lewis called on governments to recognise the deficiencies in facial recognition technology and the risks it posed to privacy rights.
The report stated that the increasing use of surveillance technology globally to monitor compliance was a “troubling trend” and warned of the “normalisation of surveillance culture.”
It noted that while home quarantine was a preferred option over hotel quarantine—which can be costly and demanding on individuals—it was unclear whether governments had considered the full implications of using such technology, noting similar concerns with vaccine passport apps.
“The most prominent case study for successful use of facial recognition to combat the pandemic comes from China, which should be taken with a grain of salt given the country’s history of privacy abuses,” the report stated.
The Centre recommended that facial recognition be limited to single-use and for there to be precise expiration dates for any data collected. Further, the group called on state governments to update laws to cover facial recognition and stronger human rights protections.
South Australia’s home quarantine app, Quarantine SA, is set to become the national model once trials are deemed successful.
Residents entering home quarantine are required to download the app and will need to “check-in” with the app at random intervals during their quarantine period of two weeks.
Users have just 15 minutes to respond to a random check-in notification (in Western Australia, this is just five minutes) by scanning their faces.
If they miss a scan, they will receive a follow-up phone call from the Home Quarantine SA team to discuss the reason why. If the individual misses the phone call, a compliance officer may be sent to the approved address to check on their situation.FORSYTH COUNTY, Ga. — Protests and petitions in the midst of a resurged movement for law enforcement to reexamine what some are calling injustices have led the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to reopen an investigation into the death of a mother of five.
WSB-TV first reported on the suspicious death of Tamla Horsford in November 2018.
Horsford was found dead after an “adult slumber party" with several other local mothers. Investigators concluded that she accidentally fell off a house balcony while intoxicated, which killed her. But her friends and family have always disputed the results.
Horsford was found dead in the backyard of a home in Forsyth County, Georgia, around 9 a.m. on Nov. 4, 2018. The coroner’s death certificate listed Horsford’s death as an accident. The report said that a fall from a deck caused multiple blunt force injuries and “acute ethanol intoxication” was a contributing factor.
Horsford’s family hired another medical examiner who found extensive injuries all over her body.
“It’s impossible to get the injuries that she had from one fall,” Horsford’s best friend, Michelle Graves, told WSB-TV in an interview last year.
Graves said she believed there was “something awry with the story and with how [Horsford] lost her life."
The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office announced last February they were closing the case because investigators had found no evidence of foul play in Horsford's death.
Since then, a petition to reopen the investigation has amassed more than 500,000 signatures.
In a letter to the Horsford family, obtained shared by WSB-TV, attorney Ralph Fernandez said his office has done an exhaustive review of the case and believes Horsford was killed.
“It appears Tamla was involved in a struggle. There were abrasions consistent with that scenario. There were parallel scratches to one arm. Since they were fresh, photos would not have proven recent use of defensive force,” the letter said. “There was one x-ray, yet the injury noted as the cause of death appears nowhere.”
The party was held at the home of a woman whose boyfriend, Jose Barrera, reportedly found Horsford dead, face down. Barrera called police to report her death.
Barrera, who worked for local courts, was fired for accessing documents related to the case, WSB-TV reported.
“Witness statements are in conflict. A potential subject handled the body as well as the evidence prior to law enforcement arriving. Evidence was disposed of and no inquiry followed," Fernandez wrote. "The scene was not preserved. A remarkable fact is that there were no photographs taken during the autopsy of Tamla’s body. This had to have been done at someone’s directive because such a practice is unheard of.”
Forsyth County, one of Georgia’s 10 most populous counties, is an area known for its tense racial history. In 1912, county leaders forced all of its black residents out of the area. Author Patrick Phillips, who moved to Forsyth County as a child in the late 1970s, said he noticed Ku Klux Klan rallies in the area. Robed members have been seen there as recently as the 1990s. In 1987, in the midst of civil rights demonstrations, Oprah Winfrey hosted a program spotlighting the county’s racial conflict. The county made headlines again in October 2016 when an elementary school staffer called Michelle Obama a “gorilla” on Facebook.
On Friday, WSB-TV obtained a letter that Forsyth County sheriff Ron Freeman wrote to GBI director Vic Reynolds. The letter states, “renewed requests for reexamination are best served by an independent law enforcement agency to review previous findings and to search and act on any new evidence which may come to light."
Freeman told Reynolds the sheriff’s office would assist in any way possible, and GBI agents will have “complete access” to the case file, office and deputies as well as Freeman’s “full cooperation.”
The GBI said they will open an investigation based on Freeman’s request.

Dieting teaches you a lot of things.
It teaches you about controlling portion intake and moderation.
It teaches you about dealing with hunger, and how to manage it.
It teaches you which foods you need to prioritize if you want to see the best results.
It teaches which treats you would do questionable acts for, just to get a taste of.
Last year I embarked on the strictest diet I’ve done. Not “contest prep” strict (that’s this year’s challenge), but fairly close. I was preparing for a photoshoot and wanted to get leaner than I had ever been in my entire life. I wanted to push myself physically and mentally further than I ever had before; not only to experience it, but also make myself better in the process.
I had a coach I knew could get me there. But I wasn’t sure if I could get myself there.
In the past when it came to dieting, I’ve always been kind of an asshole. Granted, I lost over 80 pounds, so I knew a thing or two about how to lose a pound or two, but I would always get to a certain point in the diet where “life” would come up and I’d relax too much with my nutrition, or I’d just get into the mindset of “Eh, I’m good where I’m at. I don’t really need to get any leaner.”
I knew this was a mindset of mediocrity I needed to break if I wanted to get to the next level.
When I decided to start this, I was just coming off a three-month mass gaining phase, a break-up, trips to Vegas, Mexico, and New York – basically a period of time where nutrition had taken a back seat.
Actually, at that point, it was probably riding in the trunk.
I knew taking back control of my nutrition and body was going to help bring back control and stability into my life as well. So I committed. I committed to making this damn thing happen more than I ever committed to a diet in my life.
It was tough.
It was miserable at times.
It was fun at times.
In those four months, I lost approximately 20 pounds and got leaner than I have ever been in my entire life.
And here are 6 dieting lessons learned in the process…
You’re going to be hungry. Deal with it.
Hunger is a natural part of dieting. And the longer you diet – and the larger your deficit becomes – the more hunger you’re going to experience. It’s inevitable. But you have to deal with it. You have to accept it’s a natural, unavoidable part of the process.
Hunger is not an emergency. Just because you’re hungry doesn’t mean you have to eat. Living with hunger teaches you discipline and mental toughness. If soldiers can go days without food in the midst of battle, you can make it a few hours before bed without a snack.
That said…
If you’re constantly hungry, you’re doing something wrong.
I’m approximately 215-220 pounds, 5’11”, 15-ish% body fat when not dieting. My total daily energy expenditure is around 2,700 – 3,000 calories a day. At my lowest towards the end of my diet, I was eating about 1,500-1,600 calories per day. Nearly a 50% drop.
Now, granted, my metabolism adapted and dropped as my weight and activity dropped as well, but for someone my size, that is a large deficit. And yet, I rarely ever felt “hangry.”
Sure, I had hunger – like if I woke up and hadn’t eaten for several hours, or just prior to a meal. But rarely, if ever, did I deal with constant or uncontrollable hunger.
Why? How?
I had leafy, green, high-fiber veggies at every meal (dinner nearly every night for the final two months consisted of a entire bag of broccoli slaw).
Nearly 80% of my protein came from whole, animal sources (ground turkey, ground beef, chicken breast, eggs, egg whites).
My carbs were almost completely made up of oats, greek yogurt, rice, and starchy veggies. No bread. No pasta…basically, no “garbage macros,” with the exception of a small serving of Enlightened ice cream each night.
I was drinking at minimum a gallon of water every day; closer to two and a half towards the end.
This really opened my eyes, especially the final few weeks. While I was certainly hungrier than normal, it was nothing to the effect of “Errrrmaaaagaaaaaahhhhhdddd, I’m sooooooo hungry!!!!!!!!”
Reality is, if that’s the kind of hunger you’re experiencing regularly – and you’re not at an unhealthy calorie level – you’re probably doing something wrong. You’re probably not eating enough veggies, not eating enough high-quality protein, eat subpar carb sources, not drinking enough water, or likely, a combination of all four.
You may not want to eat more veggies or drink more water, but nine times out of ten, that’s going to solve your hunger problem. The tenth time, as we talked about above, you just have to deal with.
You are going to want to do questionable acts for food you don’t normally eat.
When it comes to strict dieting, the cravings are real. These were waaaaay worse than any hunger I experienced.
I had cravings for things I never, ever eat – Oreos, chocolate bars, those Hostess brownies, and of all things, protein bars. And this was alongside my normal, daily cravings for cookies, donuts, and ice cream.
It was bad.
So how did I combat this?
I didn’t keep things in my apartment I knew I’d have a hard time controlling myself around. I’m a snacker by nature, and could easily put away an extra 2,000 per day just grabbing something every time I walked through the kitchen; be it cookies or nuts or candy…so I didn’t keep this stuff in my house. In fact, there was almost nothing that I could “easily” snack on. All my food had to be made or prepped in some way, so I couldn’t just mindlessly eat.
I worked something that replicated these cravings into my macros every day. As you can tell, I have a big sweet tooth, so that’s where my weakness lies. To replicate this, I’d eat something every day that made it seem like I was eating sweets: oatmeal or Greek yogurt flavored with sugar-free pudding, a protein bar, or my small serving of low-calorie ice cream at night. All of these things helped quell my sweet tooth while also fitting my macros.
I kept myself out of situations that tempted me. A big part of this was not being home as much as I could because when I am, I tend to eat, even when I’m working. So I worked elsewhere, and went for a lot of walks. Other things included not going out to eat or drink with family or friends, or putting myself in social situations where I knew I’d be exposed to my weaknesses. I just stayed home. May sound sucky or miserable, but when you have a goal and a deadline, these are the types of things you have to do sometimes.
I just wanted it more. Sure, the above tactics helped make things easier, but that doesn’t mean I wasn’t still tempted. I could easily put down two tubs of greek yogurt and want more. I still went to my favorite coffee shops, where they serve great cookies, donuts, and other treats.
At a certain point, you just have to make the decision that your goals mean more than that cookie or donut or whatever. And this is where a lot of people either misunderstand or refuse to accept that what you eat is absolutely 100% in your control. It’s your decision. Every day, no matter what, I still had to make a number of these decisions – not to buy that donut or my favorite cookie, not to say “screw it” and binge on yogurt and justify it because it’s “healthy” – because ultimately, I had something I wanted to achieve.
Traveling and dieting suuuuuuuuuuuucks.
Admittedly, traveling the last month of my diet may have been what kept my great results from being amazing results.
In the last five weeks, I went to Vancouver and Atlanta for two weeks, Toronto for five days, and Madison for three days.
Now, I’ll be the first to admit, I do not do well with dieting and travel – but that’s by choice. I would much rather enjoy things I don’t normally get to, because personally, I value experience more than that week or two I set my diet back. But this time, I really had to dial it in more so than normal.
In Vancouver I still hit my macros every day (it helped I was staying with my coach and he cooked for me) but we still went out for ice cream most nights.
In Atlanta, I cooked, prepped, and nailed my macros most nights, but we still went out downtown one night, and had a cookout another, because Eric Bach and I are a dangerous combo together.
In Toronto, I fasted most of the day and didn’t drink once, but didn’t count my macros at dinner so inevitably, ended up over.
In Madison, I had the luxury of driving so I prepped my meals and just sat in my hotel room when I wasn’t attending the seminar, but still went out for sushi with a friend I hadn’t seen in over a year.
Through all those situations I managed to maintain where I was at, more or less, which for me was an improvement from previous diets. However, I know I could have dialed it in even more, been super strict, and likely came through each of those situations a bit better. But being the first instance I was actually dieting and traveling at the same time, I consider it a victory and a great learning experience of what I need to do better next time.
Because you absolutely can stick to your plan while traveling. It just takes much more conscious effort, thought, and planning to do so. And you need to know that going in.
Don’t forget about the post-diet diet.
All I could think about the entire time I was dieting was how I couldn’t wait to eat cookies and birthday cake and ice cream and burgers and…
I need to stop. I’m making myself hungry…
Anyway, all I could think about was how I couldn’t wait to eat all of the foods that didn’t fit my macros while I was dieting.
And I did eat all the foods.
And this was a mistake.
See, just because you reach your goal doesn’t you’ve reached the finish line. When it comes to physique building, there is no finish line. When you finish one diet, you just start another one.
Notice I didn’t say you keep diet-ing. Instead of eating a diet for the physique you want, you transition to eating a diet for the physique you have.
After a long, extended diet your body is primed for both muscle and fat gain – and which happens is highly dependent on how much of an asshole you are.
When you get lean, you’re sensitivity to insulin greatly increases; which means the body is much better able to utilize nutrients like carbs and protein for fueling intense workouts and thus, building more muscle.
However, an extended dieting period also comes with metabolic adaptations. You weigh less, so your total daily energy expenditure is lower, plus the drop in calories has down-regulated your metabolism and has you expending less energy. This means a rapid jump in calories before your metabolism has a chance to bounce back can lead to way too much fat gain as well.
The best course of action to take, in order to take advantage of the advantageous muscle building environment – while limiting fat gain – is to continue eating the same diet, just with a few hundred more calories; while gradually increasing training volume as well.
Basically, don’t have your cheat meal – or day, or weekend, or in my case, week – right away. Spend 4-6 weeks gradually increasing your metabolic rate before getting a bit more loose with your diet.
While I jacked up my training volume post-diet and definitely put on some muscle, I also put on a little more fat that I should have as well. Which certainly isn’t the end of the world, but not ideal for your body either.
Having a coach makes all the difference.
I never would have undertaken this if I didn’t have a coach. And I never would have made it through without a coach.
I undertook this diet because I knew deep down this was one of those I really wanted to do, but likely wouldn’t do without that push. And I knew my coach would continuously push me. I knew he wouldn’t let me quit on myself.
I’m not sure if it’s a pride thing or stubbornness or what, but people seem extremely opposed to the idea of getting help achieving something they claim is really important to that.
Because for me personally, the single best thing I have ever down for my body – and my business – is hiring coaches to help me get where I wanted to go, faster. And if I’m being completely honest, they probably helped me get further than I ever would have on my own.
There is no trophy for taking one or two or five years to accomplish on your own what you could accomplish in three or four or six months with someone helping you. Yes, part of the benefit of working with my coaches has been learning things I didn’t know. But a vast majority of the benefits have been accountability, speed of implementation, keeping me focused on my ‘big rocks,’ and having someone to call me on my bullshit.
Simply put: Having skin in the game and hiring people to help me get where I wanted to go – who have done it themselves – is the best investment I have ever made in my life. Hands down. I wouldn’t be here without that.

Winning the Battle, And the War
Dieting is pretty simple in theory: Eat fewer calories, strength train, sleep well, and repeat daily until you reach your goal.
But in reality, it is a whole helluva lot tougher than that. It’s a mental battle. And the longer you’re dieting, the tougher and tougher that battle gets.
The key to winning that battle? Being prepared, and knowing what to expect…and also having someone who has your back along the way. So hopefully, with these 6 lessons, you’re now better prepared to win that battle, and ultimately, the diet war.

It is very helpful to choose your friends wisely, and friends are supposed to be your support system too as they will help you to grow. So, if they fail to encourage you to be a better person, now is the right time to cut them off! Your time is too short and precious to deal with toxic people. So, spot and stop them quickly!
The Narcissist
A long and deep conversation with your friends should be inspiring, encouraging, and eye-opening. In order to be like that, each of your voice must be heard and responded sincerely. If your friend only focuses on themselves that they do not bother to ask further about your perspective, always force the rest of the group to prioritise their needs, and a little bit cocky sometimes, they must be a narcissist. Sorry ladies, any of your ideas will most likely be unheard, and zero contribution will be given to you so that only their needs that should be fulfilled. They do not care about you, it is always about them, them, and them. What is the purpose of having a friend who never sincerely and thoroughly listen to your ideas or problems? Adios!
The Liars
When discussing, sometime we love to exaggerate things to add more excitement to our story. Well, that’s normal. What is dangerous is when lying and exaggerating become the main essence in every story. Do not you realise, this type of toxic friends is just everywhere. Too many reasons they end up being a liar: they want to be known as an interesting story-teller, they want to gain popularity, they are just insecure with their true self, they do not want you to get mad; either way, it is none of our business. What we have to do is simply creating some space from them and brush them away.
The Gossipers
Meeting friends and gossiping are two inseparable things—like it or not, there is always a risk of us talking about people or celebrities. While gossiping is very enjoyable, we should limit ourselves and decrease the frequency. When we talk something behind other’s back, it says more about us than about the person we are gossiping about. Cut the negative vibes off by avoiding avid gossipers who always influence you to talk crap behind others’ back. You do not know the real story about each person in this entire world, and there is always a reason behind what we decide to do. Instead of spreading rumours, try talking about ideas or other hot issues. Not only your knowledge would expand, but also you increase the chance of further opportunities that may coming your way.
The Jealous One
Other than gossipers, this type of toxic friends is also common. Why so? As we have stated before here, a female friendship can be competitive too; partly because from we were kids, we were told and have been expected to look feminine, strong enough to face our problems, and are able to get domestic chores done in a timely manner. All of these expectations can frustrate us without us realising it. However, there is a thin line between healthy competition and jealousy we must recognise. Jealous people can’t stand your success! According to their perspective, everyone else is uglier, lacking in some way, worse, uncool, and more negative traits you can possibly add. They are actually an insecure person whose self-hate can destruct positivity around them, and somehow want to control every single aspect—including the lives of their friends! Spot them by paying attention to the way they discuss about people with you. If they tend to jealously gossip about others, then probably they will do the same behind your back!
The Drama Queen
Love to exaggerate things is the easiest symptom to spot in a drama queen. Just be careful of a friend who sprinkles some spices to a plain story, keeps sweating small problems, loves making troubles continuously, easily explodes, and is hard to forgive. A healthy friendship should comfort you in a way that you are allowed to be your most vulnerable self and still be accepted as you are. A drama queen will be concerned of every inch of your weakness. It is indeed tiring to deal with this kind of person who will prefer to escalate a problem into a war than just speak it out and let it go.
The Critics
Constructive criticism may hurt you a little bit inside but somehow, we need it until some extent, because not every single thing we decide to do is a positive action. Yet, the way criticism is being conveyed also matter a lot. A too-critical-friend will not get this idea, they sometimes just throw demeaning criticism for you in front of others just so other people may think less of you. Only by that way this type of toxic friend will feel better about themselves.
The Fakers
One day your friend told you how much they hate their neighbour, but today you found out they arranged a party without you being involved! Let us tell you, if you do not like someone, spare some time to calm down and settle the issue. But if you do not see the worthiness of it, you should know where the exit door is. One of keys to have a supportive and inspiring friendship is to like each other. Why should waste your time to faking it just to get things done? Do not pretend to like and adore your friends when deep down inside you find them somewhat disturbing. Watch out, fakers are the potential betrayers!
The Energy Drainer
That one friend whose stories are either sad, painful, pessimistic to tell! They keep complaining and oftentimes feel pessimistic even though it is crystal clear that they are capable enough. It is because their confidence level is just so low that they need us to ensure they are decent and enough—which most of the time will not work! Whenever you are with them you can’t simply light the spark, because they always bring the cloudy clouds wherever they go. The world is gloomy from their point of view.The Palazzolo Strings

They visited families and checked on school reports, the child's health and the well being of the family and safety of their homes.

If you or a family member are seeking an Oregon medical malpractice lawyer, it is important for you to hire someone who understands the health care professions, and understands the injuries caused by the malpractice. Our Oregon medical malpractice lawyer provides you the benefit of not only being a trial lawyer, but also being a former doctor.
What is Medical Malpractice?
Medical malpractice is the failure of medical professionals (doctors, nurses, etc.) to provide adequate treatment to patients that leads to personal injury or loss of life (wrongful death). According to an article published in 2016 in the British Medical Journal, over 251,000 people in America die each year due to medical malpractice, up from an estimated 98,000 people / year in 1999. This increase in deaths and injuries comes at the same time that lawyers have reduced the number of medical malpractice lawsuits they are filing against doctors.
Medical Malpractice is now the third leading cause of death in the United States, after deaths from heart disease and cancer. The number of people killed by medical professionals is equivalent to nearly 700 people per day dying of medical malpractice, with hundreds of thousands more being injured but not dying. The amount dying is equal to more than one 747 plane full of passengers crashing every day of the year. Nearly 10% of all Americans that die in a year, are killed by medical malpractice. Compare these numbers to the number of American’s killed in car crashes (34,000/year) and even guns (34,000/year).
This means that as an American, you have an 7x higher likelihood of being killed by a doctor than being killed by a drunk driver, a drugged driver, someone texting on their phone while driving, or someone shooting you. And, the numbers of people dying from medical malpractice don’t even include those injured or dead from pharmaceutical drug reactions. Harvard University reports that another 128,000 people per year are killed by pharmaceutical drugs, which they suggest is the 4th leading killer in America. That should speak volumes as to the seriousness of medical malpractice, and pharmaceutical drugs prescribed by doctors, as a public health issues.
For more information, or to speak with our Oregon medical malpractice lawyer, contact us or call our office at (503) 227-1233 or toll free at (866) 843-3476 for a free consultation.
Our beliefs on medical malpractice as a former doctor
Doctors should not be sued for acts that are not malpractice, and we will not take a case we do not believe has merit.
The controversy presently created in the media between the medical and legal communities is false. For years, insurers have blamed medical malpractice lawyers, greedy patients, and runaway juries for steep increases in medical malpractice insurance premiums. However, multiple studies have now proven there is no correlation between the stratospheric rise in medical malpractice premiums and malpractice lawsuits. Instead, these studies point to the cause of these insurance increases, as the insurance industry itself. Some insurers have gone so far as stating that even if malpractice caps are legalized, they will not decrease malpractice rates.
Oregon medical malpractice lawsuits are an unfortunate necessity, given how many people are being killed by careless medical care. These suits serve as a deterrent to minimize the unnecessary loss of human life and health. With the number of Oregon medical malpractice lawyers handling these cases decreasing, the number of people killed is skyrocketing. Additionally, when medical malpractice does occur, we believe the injured patient has a right to seek compensation for their loss, caused by the health care provider’s carelessness or recklessness. Every human life is important, as is quality of life for those who survive the malpractice, but continue to have life-long consequences. An Oregon medical malpractice lawyer is critical to seeking appropriate compensation for your loss.
We believe that no case should be accepted unless we are willing to go to trial on that case. Jurors often do not like patients suing doctors despite the horrible outcome, and so, in order for us to accept a case, we must believe that a jury will hold the doctor accountable for their malpractice. We have the extensive trial experience necessary to try medical malpractice cases.
That said, with Aaron DeShaw being a former doctor, we do not believe any health care provider should be named in an Oregon medical malpractice lawsuit unless they have done something clearly wrong. It is for this reason that we decline approximately 500 medical malpractice cases for every 1 we accept. (In those cases, often the doctor has committed malpractice, but the injury isn’t serious enough that we believe the doctor should be sued.)
Every Oregon medical malpractice case is personally screened by Dr. DeShaw before it is even accepted, to ensure that a health care provider has clearly done something wrong, and that what was done wrong caused a serious injury or death. In most cases, the case is then investigated by another health care professional to determine if malpractice occurred. In some cases, we also retain one or more doctors who specialize in the field of practice at issue to determine if they believe there is malpractice before we accept the case. It is only in those cases where a person is hurt or killed by a health care provider’s clearly improper conduct, and we strongly believe that there is malpractice based upon all of these reviews, when we accept a malpractice case. That way, every malpractice case we accept can be considered credible for a jury who has to decide the case.
Despite our conservative approach to accepting very few medical malpractice cases, we also believe that given the huge increase in deaths from medical malpractice shown between the above studies in 1999 and 2016, occurring at the same time that lawyers have reduced the number of medical malpractice lawsuits they are filing against doctors, that malpractice claims are necessary both to appropriately compensate patients and their families for the devastating effects of medical malpractice, but also for the good of society in stopping this unnecessary loss of life because of poor health care practices that endanger every American.
Why hire Dr. Aaron DeShaw, Esq., P.C. as your Oregon medical malpractice lawyer?
As former doctor, Dr. Aaron DeShaw has over 4000 hours of doctorate level training in anatomy, physiology, diagnosis, pathology, obstetrics, lab testing, pharmacology, radiology and other subjects of health care, years of practice as a doctor, and a solid understanding of physician standards of care. He is one of a select group of doctors in the country, who has become a lawyer for injured people. When additional medical specialist review is required on a case, we hire experts to fully research your malpractice issue before it is accepted. When you hire Dr. Aaron DeShaw, Esq., P.C. as your Oregon medical malpractice lawyer, you can concentrate on recovering from your injuries, or starting over with your life after the loss of a loved one, while we put our medical and legal experience to work on your legal case.“B ‘to war’ for Trump, and that he would marshal the resources of Breitbart, the Government Accountability Institute and the power and rage of Trump’s base against any establishment Republicans and Democrats who stand in the way of the president’s nationalist agenda.
He repeated his warnings against establishment Republicans during an interview with The Washington Post on Saturday, saying that the president’s enemies in Congress should either fall in line or risk being targeted.
‘ Republicans enthusiastically support Trump’s priorities on taxes, trade and funding a massive border wall, everything will be ‘sweetness and light,’ Bannon said. However, he doesn’t expect moderates to capitulate so easily.
‘’If the Republican Party on Capitol Hill gets behind the president on his plans and not theirs, it will all be sweetness and light, be one big happy family,’ Bannon said. But Bannon added with a smile that he does not expect ‘sweetness’ anytime soon – and described the turbulent political moment in the Republican Party and the country as a necessary battle over Trump’s priorities.’

All engines at one time or another will have idle problems; Ford engines can have idle stumbling, surges and stall-outs, no matter what make and year. Engines should run smooth and evenly when at idle, never fluctuating in rpm or dying.
What’s the rough on a 1999 Ford F250?
7.3L Diesel Rough idle, miss at low rpm. Discussion in ‘ 1999 – 2007 Ford F250+ Super Duty Forum ‘ started by acman2013, Mar 3, 2017 . Hey guys, I’m new to the diesel world and just bought a 99’ f250 7.3.
Is there an issue with my 93 F150 302?.
Why does my 93 F150 302 hesitate and surge?
EGR works properly. This problem is only in closed loop. While the engine is cold everything seems to work fine..
Why does my engine hesitate when going up a hill?. Seems to be more prominent when under load like when going up a hill at around 40 MPH.SalesAde uses 20 years’ experience to coach sales professionals to achieve their personal best

Additional DNS entries in General Setup would be good for 3 or more WAN's
100%
Description
For multi-wan with 3 or more WAN's, it would be good to have additional DNS server fields in General Setup.
Currently there are 4 possible entries.
With 3 WAN's for example, assigning 2 different DNS servers to each of the WAN gateways would require 6 total entries in General Setup
because pfSense recommends that each gateway be assigned its own unique DNS servers.

Updated by Phillip Davis almost 5 years ago
So that sort of config should have failed the input validation already prior to his change. The code considers anything on a "really locally connected" network or pointed to by a static route in the config to be "local" and a DNS server on such a network/address should not have a gateway specified.
I guess it would be possible to do more validation checks, and if the existing static route for that address already points out the selected gateway, then it is OK. But actually it is easy for the user to either remove the static route or not select a gateway for the DNS server (and then it will use the static route they already set up).

This seems to work fine as-is. No need to check/validate someone's unintentional misconfiguration. At least it did error (correctly) rather than trying to clobber the route.

Dear Patty,
To many people, my “problem” is going to sound like I’m complaining about the burden of being too rich and too thin. What’s my problem? My husband loves my knitting too much. Specifically, he loves one TERRIBLE sweater I knit for him ages ago. It was the first sweater I ever knit, and it’s full of mistakes. I’ve since knit him many other much better sweaters, but he keeps wearing the terrible one. He’ll put it on when we are going out with friends and I try the “why don’t you wear this one” trick, but it never works. Worst of all, he’s always bragging about how I knit that abomination.
What do I do: spill red wine on it?
Embarrassed Ex-Bad Knitter (Sarah)
Dear Embarrassed,
I know exactly how you feel. I had the same problem. My husband is proud of my knitting, yes, almost too proud. Whenever he would wear one of my knits out, there would be an exchange reminiscent of a David Rakoff story called “The Canadians Among Us.”
Party Guest: I was driving over here when a song from Bachman Turner Overdrive was—
David Rakoff: (cutting them off) They’re Canadian.
Party Guest: That’s a nice swea—
My husband: (cutting them off) Patty knit it.
I knit a monstrosity for my husband many years ago, and like you, I have since knit him many other, nicer sweaters. It was the second sweater I ever knit. It was hideous and he loved it. (Ironically, I am using the before and after pics of the sleeve cap in this very column to demonstrate a row gauge fail.) He wore it once to drop me off to teach at WEBS and I wouldn’t let him come inside.
So, what should you do? That depends on how fixable it is. Is it one element that can be ripped out and re-knit? I was able to do that with the terrible neckband. The first time, I thought picking up stitches was randomly shoving a needle from front to back. I also didn’t know that you weren’t supposed to decrease all the way at the edge.
Horror show neckline:
Re-knit when he wasn’t looking and I could rip out the neckband and redo it, pretending it had something to do with fixing a moth hole, neckline:
Or if it’s an all-over mess (as my husband’s sweater was) you might luck out like me and have moths eat it, or have it “lost” by the dry cleaners. But if he really loves it and it would make him sad, that might make you sad.
Perhaps if you could find the exact yarn, you could go the route of every parent with every dead goldfish. Replace it without his knowledge. Secretly knit an exact, but better version, replace it and bury the original.
If all else fails, perhaps you can tell him that he looks too sexy wearing it, and you’re not comfortable with him wearing it out, so let’s just make it our special “alone time sweater.” I mean how can he say no to that!
Godspeed my fellow embarrassed knitter/appreciated wife.
Look Ma, No Algebra!
Dear Patty,
Okay, I’ll bite. You mentioned in your gauge column that there was an “easy” math adjustment for not matching row gauge, even for the sleeve cap. I don’t think anything about gauge math is easy, so my question is, prove it.
Signed,
Better Not Say Pythagorean Theorem
Dear Better Not Say,
Not only is my method simpler than the Pythagorean theorem, it’s what I always call in my gauge class “cookie math.” First let’s break it down to three friendly formulas.
If you had 10 cookies on a plate and you had 5 friends coming over, how many cookies would each friend get?
1. Cookie Total/Friends = Cookie Portion
10 ÷ 5 = 2
If you had 20 stitches in a 4-inch swatch, how many stitches are inside each inch (gauge)?
1. Stitches (or rows) Total/Inches = Gauge
20 ÷ 4 = 5
If you had 5 friends coming over, and you knew each friend was getting 2 cookies, how many cookies you would need?
2. Friends x Cookie Portion = Cookie Total
5 x 2 = 10
If you knew your gauge was 5 stitches in an inch and you knew you wanted an 8″ scarf, how many stitches do you need to cast on?
2. Inches x Gauge = Stitches (or rows) Total
8 x 5 = 40
If you had 10 cookies, and you wanted to give each friend 2 cookies, how many friends could you have over?
3. Cookies Total/Cookie Portion = Friends
10 ÷ 2 = 5
If you had a pattern that told you how many stitches or rows are in a specified section of knitting (e.g., 38 rows of a sleeve cap), how tall will it be if gauge is 6 rows per inch?
3) Stitches or Rows Total/Gauge = Inches
38 ÷ 6 = 6.25″
So if your row gauge is off and you want the sleeve cap to look the same, then that means you want your inches to be the same, but the number of rows worked will be different. (Since your cookie portion is different, your total cookies will be different!)
Four easy steps to success:
1. Count the number of rows in a shaping area.
2. Divide that by the pattern row gauge = inches the pattern used for that shaping zone.
3. Multiply the number of inches by YOUR row gauge = how many rows you have to accomplish the shaping.
4. Start tweaking.
The Problem
This can come in handy for many sweater parts, for instance a sleeve cap. Say the pattern gauge was 6 rows per inch, but you are getting 5.25 rows per inch.
No biggie right?
Wrong: biggie. Remember Seinfeld’s puffy shirt? Well, for the second sweater I ever knit, that’s what I created. It’s hard to tell in the picture, but when he was wearing it, it always looked a bit like a puff sleeve.
If the cap was supposed to be 5.5 inches, you can bet that there are 33 rows in the cap.
5.5 inches x 6 (gauge) = 33 rows
But if I just knit the cap as written, at my different row gauge, the cap would be 6.25 inches, a whopping .75 inch too tall. That’s just enough to make it a puffy sleeve when you try to set it in.
33 rows ÷ 5.25 (gauge) = 6.25 inches
The Fix
Now that we know what the problem is, let’s look at the easy steps to fix it.
1. Count how many rows are in the cap after the initial bind off at the sides. I counted 33 rows in the cap.
2. 33 rows ÷ 6 rows per inch = 5.5″ for the desired cap height.
3. Multiply the desired cap height by your actual gauge (e.g. 5.5″ x 5.25 rows per inch = 28.87). This means that if you knit a cap that is 29 rows, it will be the desired height.
4. So I’ll get rid of 4 rows, evenly across the cap. Sometimes when it tells me to decrease every other row, I might do that every row. If every 4th row, do it every 3rd row. Look at the instructions, and make a plan to achieve the same shaping over 4 fewer rows.
Thanks to the aforementioned moth attack, I took out the sleeves, ripped them back (using the excuse of needing to harvest more yarn) and re-knit the sleeve cap.
Original cap is in front; new, improved cap is in back.
No Pythagorean theorem, just a sophisticated version of fudging. If the cap is the right height, all is right with the world.

The moment you hit 40 years old in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), people are going to start questioning whether you need to retire sooner rather than later. So Matt Brown had a lot riding on his UFC Vegas 29 fight against Dhiego Lima, a man eight years his junior who Brown actually coached back on The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) in 2013.
Fortunately, age turned out to not be a factor for Brown this night: “The Immortal” fought a bit more conservatively than he did years ago, but in a good, smart way. And he still landed a nasty faceplant knockout punch in the second round that earned him an extra $50,000 (watch that monster of a highlight here).
“How’s that for forty, b—ch?” Brown declared as he walked off from the knockout.
“I think a lot of people write me off because of my age,” he said at the post-fight press conference. “I knew the right hand would be available at some point. I didn’t expect it the way I did it, but I knew it would be available, just watching the tape. So we did work the right hand a lot.
“It did feel sweet,” he continued. “That one I didn’t even feel land, it reminded me of when I fought Diego Sanchez and he was out and I didn’t even know it had landed. I was like ‘Wait, is the fight over?’ I didn’t know where he went. I hit him and was like, ‘Where’s he at?’”
No matter how good Brown looked tonight, he’s still keeping it real regarding how much longer he has.
“I definitely don’t have a lot of fights left,” he said. “That’s a tough question right now, I have to think about that a little bit. When I go out there and fight like that, it’s like all the skills I’ve been developing over the past how many years in the UFC, it feels like they’re coming together better. And just, my performance, I was more calculated and smarter. I feel like I could do a lot of really big things. It’s more of just a matter of ... life. Life. Life gets in the way.”

“I think I’m in my prime now. I have the ability to fight and fight at a high level still for a long time. There’s just so many things going on in my life. That’s why I don’t fight as much as I used to, there’s just so many factors, mainly my kids getting older. I’m not going to bore you with all that shit though. We’ll do a full interview and talk about it.”
As for when he wanted to fight again?
“Tomorrow? I love fighting,” he said. “It’s just putting a camp together and putting all the pieces of the puzzle together, that just takes more time. So that’s what kind of determines when I’m able to fight, not as much as my desire. Because my desire is there, I want to come in and do that to a lot of people what I did tonight.”
If he had his way, he’d like a chance to avenge one of his losses.
“That’s what I would like next: Cowboy [Cerrone], Demian [Maia] and Robbie [Lawler],” Brown said. “Those are the ones. I’m not the guy who’s, ‘I want a rematch I want a rematch,’ I had my 15 minutes and I didn’t get it done. I thought I won the Robbie fight personally, but I didn’t get it done.”
“And it’s not my place to go around begging for it, but if they’re happy to, I’d love for it to be Demian’s retirement match, I know he’s looking for a retirement match. I would love that, and out of respect for him because he’s a true legend. Just like when I fought him the first time, he’s the worst match up for me in the division and I like that challenge. I think I’m more up for it now than I was before.”
With Maia’s loss to Belal Muhammad being the last fight on his UFC contract, we’re not sure whether that’s a fight UFC can put together. It’s also not on the top of the list for us, either. Give us Donald Cerrone and/or Robbie Lawler please and thank you!

For Boys and Girls. i A SURPRISE PARTY. 5 By AMY F. HEPPLE. Wouldn't it be jolly fun for us to give a "^Prise party V'' ,i A what ?" asked all the other children in •°orus. It Was holiday time at the Vicarage. Dermot home from boarding-school, and Miss p^kwood, the governess who taught the girls, gone to her own home for a fortnight. To- the children were together' in the school- and were decidedly hard up for some *5. arnusement. Bdeen. the second girl, held up tha Canadian ter which Cousin Maud had given her to c&d.

You pack up a lot of eatables, of course, tea and sugar, and go to some Jena's house and just say, Good afternoon eVe come for a surprise party.' Then the of the house sit round and watch while surprise party get the tea ready and set out jjj the cakes. After tea, there are games and of fun." w It would certainly be very nice," said j^,riorie, but mother would never let us do I Well, I agree with Eileen that it would be good fun, and 1 don't believe that mother J^ld say no," broke in Dermot.

That silly Dermot will ,Xer make mother understand." Alother was in the drawing-room with grown- Cousin Maud. Let me speak," said Marjorie, I'm the We want to do what Cousin Horace been doing in Canada, mother dear. We *°uld like tremendously to give a surprise J>»Pty." Oh, do say yes," exclaimed the others. u" But where would you go ?" asked Cousin t Jhe children looked at one another. They n°t know. I know," shouted Dermot. i Oh, mother, may we go and 'surprise' Nurse ane Mother smiled approvingly. "It is a good Dermot. Perhaps you will cheer her up 1 little." She has just lost her baby, poor thing," explained to Maud. "Her husband is out of ^°°> iust now, and I fear the expense of p child's illness has used up all their little •avings.- C()usm Maud was rich and generous. Poor r !ng," she said. Auntie dear, may I put a *!r co*n the plum cake for her pother nodded and turned to the children. 'You may have your party, dears," she but promise you will be very careful of Jane's things, and tidy everything away l4ore you leave." )j We promise, mother," they answered de- jshtedly. And we won't tell Jane a word *°out the money in the cake what a fine sur- mise it will be for her," added Dermot. „ I shall make the tea," said Marjorie. J&ne shall just sit in her chair and watch ale." And I'll set the cups and saucers on the ^°le," said little Oonah eagerly, I'll be very tareful, Mummy you'll see." Cousin Maud came in just then with a big plum cake. 1 have cut a hole in the middle put the money there," she said. "Marjorie see that no one but Jane gets the middle •Uce." Potir o'clock found the children setting off to their surprise party. Dermot and Mar- had the hamper between them, while and Marie carried flowers for the table, Oonah walked soberly beside them, with under her little red cloak which *emed to give her a good deal of trouble. "It's secret to 'muse poor Jane," she said on being Tnestaoned. Jane was sitting in her tiny kitchen thinking her dead baby,and wondering how she and Jim were to get money for the rent. She wastooppoiKj to beg, and she greatly feared wastooppoiKj to beg, and she greatly feared that unless Jitn. got work she would have to e some of the furniture. She wiped the qu¡(,t tears away with her apron. Just then rtme a loud knocking at the door. She opened •t wearily, and Dermot's merry face appeared, With all the others close behind. Good afternoon, Jane. We're a Surprise ^artv all the way from Canada. May we have I tea here, please ?" Well I never!" said Jane, and stood meekly On one side while the children crowded into the tittle kitchen. Dermot set the hampercaretnlly on the floor, *»d Marjorie pushed the bewildered Jane into her rocking-chair. Now, Jane," she said politely, "sit still,and ?0a't bother yourself. What a good thing your *ettle is nearly boiling But I don't understand, Miss Marjorie, my 'fear," said Jane, helplessly. Of course you don't! That's the fun of it, we have the pink cups, please ?" Marjorie did not wait for permission, but Counted a chair and began to take the best "IIlna, from the cupboard. j. Mother said we might come truly she did, £ *He," whispered little Oonah, and she sent Ser love and will come for us at eight o'clock, f lease can I come on your knee I want to 5'ss you 'cause your little baby's gone to heaven." Jane bent her head down on Oonah's and all about her best cups. Presently P°Hah slipped something soft and alive into arms. It is Nigger," she whispered. "I J^Uldn't spare him to you to keep, you know, ut I had just brought him to 'muse you." 4," Bless the child said Jane, and stroked *he little puppy's soft fur. y Then she jumped up from her seat. "Better Jet me lift the kettle, Master Dermot; it is too heavy for you." f No, no, Jane, sit still. It's as light as a leather," said Dermot. By this time Eileen and Marie had arranged flowers, and Marjorie was setting out such tea as Jane had not seen on her own table for **U.ny a long day. There were sandwiches (egg ham, Oonah told her), girdle cakes, lots of ~*ead and butter,and in the centre of the table the big plum cake. There's a secret in the plum cake," pro- claimed Oonah. I know, but I mustn't tell." Be quiet. Oonah." said Eileen, hastily. I wish Jim would come from work quick, I'm. so hungry said Oonah. Jim's not working just now, dearie, because ef the strike," answered Jane with a sigh. Here he is 1" exclaimed Oonah, and ran to *he door to meet him. Jim's s ad face brightened when he saw the children. Why, Jane, lass, here's company he ex. kilned, and stooped to pat Nigger. What a tea party that was The children ate and drank, and made their 5piet host and hostess eat and drink, too. Mar- r>rie poured out tea, and Eileen had the honour of cutting the surprise plum cake. Jane first," she said, cutting right into the huddle of the cake, and handing it to Jane. Oonah was so excited that she stood on her ehair to see Jane take the piece offered her. she lifted it-, something yellow and round kU with a tinkling noise to her plate. It's yours, Jane—it's the surprise from Cousin Maud shouted Oonah. But what Jane did next sobered the merry Party, for she put her head down on the table began to cry. Oh, Jim she sobbed. We can pay the and have some left. How could I have been so faithless Now, Jane, my woman now—now 1" Jim "aid soothingly. But his voice was trembling, "Dd the children looked at each other in dis- haay. All the fun was gone from their surprise Party. It was Dermot who brought back the smiles. Here's my surprise," he said, and pro- duced a great bag of chocolate creams. Oh, Dermot, how lovely cried the chil- dren. Now, Jane, have some chocolates, and atop cryrag," coaxed Marjorie. "Cousin Maude "lidrj't mean you to cry when she sent you a Sovereign." Jane dried her eyes. I couldn't help it, His-; Marjorie you children don't know what that money means to me and Jim." When even Dermot could eat no more, Jane Mid the girls cleared the table, for Jane would hot trust them with her best chin; Then the games began, and the fun waxed faàt and furious. Jim turned into a lion and Soared so loudly that Nigger was frightened tod ran crying to Oonah for protection. Eight o'clock came all too soon for the childreji. But mother shook her head when they begged to stay just a little longer." Jao«- took:! tired, and it is past Oonah's bed- she said.

NEW OCEAN PORT. i Future of Fishguard. PROPOSED GREAT EXTENSIONS. Arrivat of Anether Liner. Fishguard an ocean port That is what the village in the extreme west of South Wales is destined to become if the enterprise and gene- rous expenditure of the Great Western Rail- way Company are rewarded by the success they merit. In a small way Fishguard has already become in fact an ocean port, for arrangements have been completed with the Booth Line for their vessels plying between the Brazils, Madeira, Spain, Portugal, and England to call there on their way to Liverpool and dis- charge passengers and luggage for South Wales, London, the Midlands, and the North, while it is extremely likely the Elder Demp- ster WeSt African boats will also in the near future make Fishguard a port of call. The fourth Booth liner to discharge passen- gers at Fishguard is the,Anselm, which arrived there just before noon on Saturday. The pas- sengers and their luggage were disembarked with remarkable despatch and put into the ocean express waiting in readiness at the quay- side, going right through to London with but one stop-at Cardiff, where passengers for the Midlands and North had to change trains. The ocean express was in Cardiff at 10 minutes to 3 and London before half-past 5 on Saturday evening, whereas the passengers remaining on the Anselm could not be landed in Liverpool till 9 o'clock on Sunday morning. They would thus be quite a day later than those who disembarked at Fishguard in reach- ing their homes. This shows what a big pull the last named place has over Liverpool, and is also an indication of the possibilities of Fish- guard as an ocean port. The shaded part shows the position of the proposed reclamation and the new break- water. I At present passengers have to be landed at Fishguard by tender (as is the case at Ply- mouth), the tender meeting the liners out in the harbour, but when the constructive work now nearing completion is finished the tender will no longer be required the biggest liners will be able to come right alongside the quay wall and discharge passengers within a few feet of the waiting ocean express. The present breakwater, just on the point of completion, is 2,000 feet long, 300 feet broad at the base, 60 feet wide at the top, 90 feet high, and 30 feet above high water, while the company's Bill now before Parliament provides for the con- struction of another breakwater rather over a mile in length commencing on the foreshore in the middle of the bay and extending to within 500 feet of the existing breakwater. When the additional breakwater is constructed 175 acres of deep water will be almost entirely enclosed, and provision made for deep water berths and wharves, ample for the largest vessels afloat. In addition 55 acres of land on the foreshore is to be reclaimed and added to the existing area available for sidings, warehouses, etc. The Harbour Works. With its extensive harbour works and com- plete equipment Fishguard must in the near future command the attention of steamship companies desirous of increasing their facili- ties for the quick transit of mails and passen- gers, for it is the nearest port on the coast of Great Britain to New York. It is an inspiring sight to view the present surroundings from the centre of Fishguard Harbour. Looking towards Goodwick, the cliff rises sheer above the railway station to a height of 300 feet, the face of the cliff being white, showing where a huge slice has been blown off by explosives in order to get the material to form' the breakwater and to pro- vide space for the railway station and quay, which now stand on a spot. formerly occupied by sheer cliff, whose sides were washed by the sea. All over the summit of the cliff and on patches of its side houses are springing up with mushroom-like rapidity. Right on the top, swept by the health-giving Atlantic breezes, is the new harbour village, a collec- tion of model cottages, after the style of those at Letchworth, built by the company for the accommodation of their employees. Most of the cottages are semi-detached, are quaint and picturesque in appearance, and their num- ber is being rapidly augmented. Houses, many of them of the bungalow type, continue down the face of the cliff in an easterly direction. On the other side of the harbour at Fishguard vil- lage the hand of the builder is equally busy throwing up dwellings and shops. On both sides of the harbour, in fact, the eye meets evidences of progress. Saturday's Record. With scarcely a ripple upon its surface and the bright sun streaming down upon the water, splashing it with bars of silver, Fishguard har- bour in its setting of sheer cliffs looked at its best on Saturday morning, when the tender backed from the quay side at 11.15 a.m. and went out towards the centre of the bay to wait for the Booth liner Anselm, from South America, the liner having been sighted at the Smalls at 9 a.m. and information to that effect telegraphed to Fishguard. A quarter of an hour after the tender had anchored out in the harbour a signal from the breakwater indicated that the Ansehn was in sight. The clearest idea of the expedition with which passengers can be discharged at Fishguard can be obtained by perusing the following table of times 12.32—Anselm signalled from breakwater. 11.40—Anselm rounds head of breakwater. 11.45—Anslem's anchor dropped, vessel being near centre of harbour. 11.50—Tender alongside Anselm. 11.53—First passenger comes on tender. 11.58—All passengers and luggage on board tender. 12. 0—Tender leaves Anselm. 12. 7-Tender alongside quay wall dis- charging. Just as the tender reached the quay side the Anselm started on its journey to Liverpool, which port it could not discharge at till 9 a.m. on Sunday. It was, therefore, not de- layed more than half an hour by having to discharge passengers at Fishguard—an in- significant ih I i in a voyage trom South America. Before the tender was properly moored alongside the quay wall the passengers' lug- gage was being discharged in the huge baskets into which it had been placed, a crane lifting the baskets from the deck of the tender right on to the station platform. Here the luggage was set out for the inspection of the Custom officers, being there by the time the passen- gei-s reached the inspecting point. The Cus- toms inspection took some little time, one or two of the passengeis not having kept within the strict letter of the law. One had to pay over £1 for having more cigars in his posses- sion than the law allowed. Departure of the Express. The ocean express steamed out of Fish- guard at 12.32 p.m., exactly an hour after the Anselm had been signalled from the break- water, and rattled along at a gi-eat pace through pastoral Carmarthenshire, which looked its best with a bright sun lighting up its green fields and white farms. Then came Carmarthen Bay-a magnificent sight, with the sun glinting and flashing upon the calm sheet of water. At this point passengers were able to dine as well and comfortably as if they had been in a first-class hotel. Although the ocean express bowled along at a mile a minute, there was practically no oscillation, thanks to long stretches of perfectly straight line and a well-kept permanent way. At Landore, passed through slowly and reached at 1.59 p.m., the ocean express was three minutes ahead of her scheduled time, while at Cardiff she had gained another minute, reaching the capital of the Principality at 2.49, and the schedule time being 2.53 p.m. After a three- minutes' stop at Cardiff the journey was re- sumed to London, which was reached at 5-30 p.m. The occupants of the train could not possibly have been disembarked and conveyed to London with greater expedition, nor could they have wished to travel in more comfort or through more picturesque scenery.
FRENCH AND THE CAT." The attention drawn by the imposition of the cat at Cardiff in cases of robbery with violence has led the Paris journals to discuss the possibilities of such a punishment being introduced into France to deal with the apaches." M. !c Poittevin, a well-known authority on French criminal law, has given his viewsto an interviewer. He thinks that the use of the cat o' nine tails will never pre- vail in France, for the reason that the tradi- tions and sentiments of the French people are totally opposed 0 it.
A meeting of the committee of the above society was held at the Ivy Bush Royal Hotel, Carmarthen, on Saturday, to select a new site for the annual show. It was decided that the exhibition be held in a field of Rbydygorse, Johnstown, on Thursday, August 20tb.
Shouted Dewn atLlanelly UPROAR FOR AN HOUR. Opponents Left in Possession ef Hall. Mrs Despard, of the Women's Freedom League, met the same fate at Llanelly on Sat- urday night, and at Swansea on Sunday, as that experienced at Cardiff and Pontypridd. She was refused a hearing. It had been an- nounced by the Llanelly Branch of the I.L.P. that Mrs Despard would not touch upon women's suffrage, but dwell exclusively u- on How to feed the five thousand." It was originally intended that Mrs Despard should ad- dress an open air meeting near the Town Hall, but the organisers discovered that opposition was being threatened, and this is the reason assigned for the change in place of meeting. The doors of the Athenamm Hall were opened at 7 p.m., but the people loitered about until Mrs Despard, accompanied by Mr Arthur E. Davies, Holmsleigh, appeared on the scene. She was greeted with ironical cheers, and the hall quickly filled. Mrs Phillips, a member of the Llanelly Education Committee, pre- sided, and she was supported by Mrs Despard, Dr. J. H. Williams (Burry Port), and Councillor T. Harries. The meeting opened with the singing of Lead, kindly Light," andasection of excited young fellows at the back of the hall whistled the accompaniment. POLICE HAILED WITH BANTER. Scarcely had Mrs Phillips completed a few introductory sentences than interruptions began, and these increased in volume as time advanced. Appeals for freedom of speech were of no avail—in fact, these appeals only tended to increase the determination of a section of the audience to howl the speakers down. A few police were distributed among the noisy ones in the gallery, but they were received with banter. A motion was then moved and seconded that all disturbers should be ejected. When the re- solution was being put to the meeting someone shouted, "Vote by ballot." The resolution was carried unanimously amid laughter, but no sooner had it been passed than a wordy war- fare ensued between the stewards and the dis- turbers. Mrs Phillips singled out a young man, and commanded him to leave the building. This he refused to do, and he was backed up by a large section of the audience, who angrily exclaimed, We have paid for admission." Realising the futility of attempting to forcibly eject him without rousing the ire of his sup- porters, it was decided to allow him to remain. Councillor Harries then explained that Mrs Despard's visit to the town had nothing to do with the question of women's suffrage. "I appeal to your intelligence," shouted Councillor Harries, and then a youth replied amidst laughter, But we haven't got any." MRS DESPARD'S PLUCK. Mrs Despard then made a plucky attempt to gain mastery over her assailants. Above the din could be heard her defiant voice exclaim- ing with dramatic emphasis, Let me re- mind you that I come of a fighting family— (cheers)—and that I never shrink from oppo- sition. (Cheers.) I will meet all your oppo- sition at the close of this meeting by answering any questions you may put to me." Someone shouted, What about Miss Moloney ?" and a number commenced to sing We'll hang Miss Molqney on a sour apple tree." This was followed by the singing of Sospan fach with much gusto. With a view to humouring the opposition, Mrs Phillips beat time while the latter was being sung. LIBERALS' INDIGNATION AROUSED. Councillor William Roberts then appealed for fair play, and explained that he did not be- long to the party which was responible for bringing Mrs Despard to the town. (A Voice": I suppose you are pleased," and laughter.) The uproar continued, but Mrs Despard seemed as though she would succeed eventually in gaining a hearing, when Coun- cillor Harries ill-advisedly referred to the noisv section of the audience as There's the Liberal party for you." This reflection roused the indignation of a few Liberals, who demanded a withdrawal and an apology amidst loud cheers. There was a Babel of voices, and Councillor Harries uttered a few words which were quite inaudible. A little later Mrs Phillips was heard to say, It was an unfortunate remark," but this did not satisfy a section of the audience, who de- manded that Councillor Harries should leave the platform. With a view to healing the wound Councillor Harries complied with the wishes of the oppo- sition, who were highly elated with their success. Three-quarters of an hour had elapsed, and there had been nothing short of uproar. It was now realised by the pro- moters that the meeting was beyond control. Stamping, whistling, singing, and booing con- tinued, and Dr. J. H. Williams' appeal that re- spect should be paid to an aged lady was lost by the singing oi For he's a jolly good fellow." What the speakers subsequently said it is impossible to say, but when a lull occurred Mrs Despard, addressing a young man in the gallery, said, Lem no coward, and I appeal to you to put that trumpet in your pocket." No sooner had the trumpet sound finished than an electric bell was set going, with the result that confusion became worse confounded. The speakers left the platform, followed by their supporters, leaving their opponents in possession of the hall, after having been in the din for over an hour. Some commenced to knock the furniture about, but only a couple of chairs were damaged. Subsequently Mrs Despard delivered her address at the rooms of the I.L.P.
Swansea Sands Uproar. APPEAL TO CHIVALRY tN VAIN. Mrs Despard on Sunday visited Swansea, under the auspices of the Swansea Indepen- dent Labour Party, for the purpose of deliver- ing addresses on The Gospel of Socialism." At the appointed time Mrs Despard took up her place on a waggonette placed close to the seawall. Mr Beynon (president of the Inde- pendent Labour Party) took the chair, and amongst others supporting were Aldermen David Williams and Morris, Mr Matt Giles, and Mr Victor Morgan. The audience, small at first, gradually increased, till there was quite 3,000 persons standing round. A strong wind blowing, and the waves were by no means silent, and consequently comparatively few could hear the speeches. Perhaps/ this, coupled with a love of mischief, animated a few youths to begin the disturbances which at last led to the silencing of the speakers. Police were well sprinkled among the crowd, but in the absence of dis- order, as defined by law, they were powerless to interfere on a public place like the sands, where everybody is privileged to enjoy him- self according to his inclination so long as he commits no breach of the public peace. The chairman was given a good hearing, and he asked those present to give Mrs Despard a characteristic Welsh welcome, and to so prove to her that in some parts of Wales at least the age of chivalry had not gone and that her work in the cause of humanity is respected. APPEAL TO CHIVALRY. Mrs Despard followed, and was cordially received. She also began by appealing to the chivalry and manhood of those present to secure quietness for the few minutes during which she proposed to address them on the gospel of Socialism. Soon, however, a disturb- ing element arose. At first sentence after sen- tence was punctuated with laughter and ironi- cal cheers, and this grew in intensity till at length Mrs Despard, who pluckily kept to her speech, had to break off and say, "My friends, I appeal to your manhood." This had only momentary effect, whereupon Mrs Despard, still smiling, exclaimed, Is it right ? Is it fair ?" The shouting continued, and then those furthest off began to push, to the dis- comfort of those in front. Steady Steady!" advised Mrs Despard, but the surging con- tinued, and Mrs Despard, still even-tempered and smiling, urged the disturbers to Be men have some respect for women have some respect for courage." This appeal being in vain, Mrs Despard became less calm, and warned the disturbers that they would be ashamed of this by and bye. By this time effective speech had become impossible, and Alderman Williams attempted to shame the disturbers in a spirited protest, which, how- ever, did not throw oil on the troubled waters. Mrs Despard got up again and started to speak, but the disturbance was renewed, and she indignantly exclaimed to the disturbers, Slaves to a Government, slaves to a party, slaves to your employers, slaves to business, poor fools. One day you may have wives and children and you may see them crying for bread then perhaps you will remember this." The singing of songs followed. MRS DESPARD'S SOCIAL GOSPEL. At last, however, order was restored. Mrs Despard then resumed her speech. She said she had spent many years in the service of the people, and the motive which actuated her was the fact that she had seen with her own eyes the hopeless misery of the people. Hav- ing tried all sorts of ways of bringing abotit social reform, she fell into a sort of despair till she took up Socialism, through which she be- lieved the time would come when there would be no more sweated industries, no more slavery, and no more unemployment. The speech was heard in respectful silence till Mrs Despard described herself as a suffra- gist, when the disturbance broke out with renewed vigour. Facing the disturbers she exclaimed to the majority, Take some of those people away. Let them have their fight out there." The crowd, owing to the pushing on the outskirts, surged towards the stage, whereupon Mrs Despard said, Do you think I care for you disturbers ? No. I only care for the great cause I hay" described." Songs were started, and M Despard remarked Go on sing and suffer. Co on till you are tired." WAR SONG VARIATION. The New Zealand war song made a variation of the disturbance, and then comic songs were sung. Mr Mark Giles interposed with the taunt carry out the order of your masters; go to-morrow and ask your masters for starva- tion wages." Then Mrs Despard was able to say that she was president of a boys' and men's club in South London. Her boys and men fell out of 1 work through the present system. They be- came thin, miserable, and ill-clad, aDd so as not to care for work. That, she added, was I what the disturbers were going to do. The disturbers again got the upper hand, singing A Rubber Dolly." Go and sing a few songs, you will get tired of it sooner than I shall," said Mrs Despard. A little later she sarcastically observed," Your voices are not so strong as they were," but then someone struck up a music hall song with the refrain—" The men will soon be wearing skirts and the women be wearing the trousers." This elicited from Mrs Despard a smile. As the singing continued she observed, Brave Liberals splendid men. I hope someone will write to the papers and say how splendidly the cause of Liberalism is represented at Swan- sea." There was a movement in the crowd to remove the small ring of interrupters, where- upon Mrs Despard observed, Let the poor fools alone." 'I' MEETING ABANDONED. From this time on further speaking became hopeless. Those on the platform faced the disturbers, and the overwhelming majority appealed for order. But it was no good, and after quite ten minutes of this attitude the Chairman announced the meeting, which he described as a splendid one, at an end. Mrs Despard was then escorted along the sands on, the arm of Councillor Morgan Hopkin. A crowd followed, and the police, fearing horseplay, got in evi- dence. But save for a little jostling, due to curiosity, no disorder occurred. At last amid ringing cheers and a few groans Mrs Despard arrived at the Sea Beach Hotel, evidently none the worse for her trying experience, for she appeared at the bay window and bowed her acknowledgments to the large crowd outside. Mrs Despard decided to abandon her inten- tion to address a night meeting on the sands. Later Mrs Despard attended a private confer- ence of the Socialist party, and it is probable that a meeting in <?ne of the local halls will be arranged for to-night.
LOCAL DISPUTES. EXCESSIVE HOURS OF BOYS IN MINES The Conciliation Board for the Coal Trade of South Wales and Mon. met on Saturday at Car- diff, Mr F. L. Davis presiding over the owners' side, and Mr W. Abraham, M.P., over the workmen's side. In the absence of Mr T. Richards, M.P. (who, with Mr A. Onions, is attending a colliery inquest at Bath), the sec- retarial duties on the workmen's side were dis- charged by Mr Watts Morgan. The chairman and secretary of the owners' side reported that some time ago they had waited upon the Home Office authorities, by their request, with reference to the alleged ex- cessive hours worked by boys in mines in Mon- mouthshire and other parts of South Wales. The Home Office authorities said their atten- tion had been called to the fact that in several pits the boys worked not only an excessive number of hours per day, but also the hours they worked per week exceeded the maximum of 54, laid down in the Act of 1872. Replying to the owners, Mr Abraham, M.P., said that the workmen's representatives would have no objection to meet the owners to discuss the matter, but it must be clearly understood that so far nothing had been done from the workmen's side in this matter. They were, however, prepared to meet the owners on the subject, without prejudice, on some special day, with the view of meeting the objections of the Home Office. No further decision was arrived at. It is believed that this matter of excessive hours worked by boys in mines was brought I to the notice of the Home Office by the evi- dence given by workmen's representatives from South Wales and Monmouthshire before the Royal Commission on Mines. The work- men contend that the only remedy is a legis- lative eight hours day for men and boys. Whitsuntide Holidays. It was decided that holidays be taken at the collieries on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes- day in Whit-week. Mr Watts Morgan com- plained that the Glamorgan Coal Company had refused to carry out the arrangements made by the Conciliation Board for the holi- days in Easter week, with the result that the night workmen had been made to lose what is known as the bonus turn in two weeks. It was resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the colliery management and the local miners' agent, to be dealt with in an amicable manner. Hauliers' Grievances. Several matters were raised with reference to the Hauliers' Joint Committee, and it was re- solved to ask Mr Hann and Mr Evan Thomas, the two chairmen, to convene a meeting of the sub-committee at an early date in order to clear off various matters in dispute. It was agreed that the summonses issued by the Powell Duffryn Co. against the workmen of the Treaman Colliery be suspended, and -this matter was entrusted to Mr Joseph Shaw and Mr W. Abraham. M.P., for settlement. It was reported that notices tendered by the hauliers against the action of the management of the Brittanic Colliery, Giliach Gocli, in deal- ing with two of their workmen had been with- drawn and the matter in dispute amicably arranged. The question of contracts existing as between the employers and the workmen in the Glyn Colliery was left over to a future meeting. In connection with the dispute at Varteg Hill Colliery, complaints were received from the workmen that the matter was still un- settled, and it was resolved to urge Mr Rout- ledge and Mr W. Harris to attend to the matter at once. It was reported that the owners of the Albion Road Colliery (Messrs Baldwin, Ltd.) had given notices irregularly to the workmen and were trying to force the men to accept a re- duction in the price list without bringing the dispute before the Conciliation Board. The .matter was referred back to be dealt with locAily by the owners and the workmen. The Blaenavon cases being delayed the owners' side promised that their secretary should write urging the arbitrators to meet at once to deal with them.
OFFICIAL REPORT. The following official report was supplied by Mr Gascoyne Dalziel, the owners' secretary :— The question of the continued stoppage of 26 men working in the four-feet seam at Messrs the Powell Dyffryn Company's. Frea- man Colliery was raised by the owners' re- presentatives. and it was arranged that the men should resume work, and that Messrs W. J. Heppel and D. Watts Morgan should in- quire into the matter. Three questions which had been raised at previous meetings were again brought forward by the workmen's representatives, namely— (1) as to the supply of house coal to injured workmen (2) as to the introduction by the owners of a new book which newly-engaged workmen were requested to sign, declaring that they had not previously suffered from diseases scheduled under the Workmen's Com- pensation Act; and (3) as to the payment of colliers whose working places are found to be in an abnormal condition. It was decided that, inasmuch as the questions involved im- portant points of principle, it was desirable to appoint a committee of inquiry, which'would report to a future meeting of the Board. Ac- cordingly a sub-committee of si x members from each side of the Board will be appointed for the purpose. The following disputes were referred to two representatives of the Board for investiga- tion :—The prices to be fixed for the different seams in Messrs the Glamorgan Coal Com- pany's Collieries (Messrs T. Griffiths and Evan Thomas) the cutting prices at Gellideg seam at Aberaman Colliery (Messrs T. Griffiths and John Williams, M.P.) payment of dooring money to colliers when' they are called out to do hauling work at Messrs In- soles Collieries (Messrs E. M. Hann-and Chas. Edwards) change of method of working at Brook Drift Colliery (C. H. Eden and C. B. Stanton) price list at Britannic Colliery (Messrs W. W. Hood and W. H. Morgan) screening dispute at Abercarn Colliery (Messrs W. H. Routledge and Charles Edwards). It was reported that several disputes had been settled by the two representatives to whom they were referred.
DEADLY BRAWN. Seventeen Persons Poisoned. A remarkable case of wholesale poisonin has occurred at the village of Murrow, Cam. bridgeshire, 17 people belonging to tour tamihes having been affected, two of whom have died. Mrs Boston, the wife of a bricklayer, bought in the village a quantity of pig bones and a pig's head for the purpose of making brawn, the local name of which is pork-cheese. Later Mrs Boston purchased some fried fish which, when warmed, was consumed by herself, her husband, their two children, and a girl visitor. The brawn was made the following day, but before any of it was eaten all the members of the household, with the exception of Mr Boston, were taken with violent sickness. Some of the brawn was given to two families named Dade and Ramsey, and every. one in their households who ate the brawn, and also Mrs Wilson, who had attended Mrs Boston while she was ill after eating the fish, were affected similarly to the Bostons. So were the father and mother of Mrs Wilson, who are iiauieu. i urner, uiey navmg apparently eaten some of the brawn. Muriel May Ramsey, aged nine, and Mrs Turner, aged 74, succumbed and others are not yet out of danger. At the inquest held in the fatal cases a ver- dict that Death was due to irritant poison effects, caused by eating pork-cheese," was returned.
TIME HUNG HEAVILY. Worried by the illness of his wife, and de- pressed because he had nothing to do after employment on the water for 50. years, Charles William Callaghan, a master mariner of Chat- ham, committed suicide by hanging himself. At the inquest on Saturday the son said his father retired a. few months ago on a pension,' but could not get accustomed to a life of in- action. He was of excitable habits, and unfor- tunately had no hobby. The jury returned a ¡ verdict of Suicide during temporary in- ,sanity."
Sunday School Union. PRESIDENT VISITS CARDIFF. Competition Shield Awarded. The nterest taken in the work of the Cardiff Sunday School Union was demoiistriked by the crowded assembly at the Cowbridge-road United Methodist Church on Saturday, when a reception was held to meet Mr F. F. Belsey (chairman of the Sunday School Union Council) and in the evening a public meeting tookplace to witness the distribution of prizes in connec- tion with the scholars' Scripture examination, and also for the presenting of the competition shield, which has this year been won by the Cowbridge-road school. Welcoming the large number of teachers present at the reception, Mr V'illiam Broben (chairman of the Cardiff Union) said that they were most anxious to conduct better teachers' preparation classes, this being necessary in view of the rapid development of school organisation and work. They must aim at con- tinual progress, and he urged his hearers never to be satisfied that their Sunday school work was perfect, but to be always in a con- tinual state, of holy unrest." After referring to the warm Welsh wel- come he had received, Mr Belsey said that that gathering was similar to those being held all over the country, showing the deep interest now felt in the work. He emphasised the per- sonal side of the teachers' duty. To make their efforts most effective they had to understand the Book they taught, the child they taught, andvthe best method of teaching. In order to gain the first, it was nearly always possible to obtain the services of qualified. men from churches or colleges who would be willing to gve Bible talks." Then they had to study the growth of the child's mind, and having done this they must carefully consider "how to teach the Book to the child." If they wished to learn how to teach they should study the methods adopted by the day-school teachers, many of whom were deeply in sym- pathy with Sunday school work. Above all, they must study the method of the Great Teacher Himself, who questioned His disciples continually, and who drew his illus- trations and suggestions from the common in. cidents of every-day life. He spoke of the value of specimen lessons, and laid particular stress upon the value of questioning and the right methods to be adopted. When illustra- tions were drawn from the environment of the child, he then could understand more clearly the truths taught. Preparation classes for the teachers should always have a question box," for this was the means of help to a great many students. "The work," he concluded, "is worthy of the best means."

Then he became a member of the first School Board, and was soon elected chairman. Twice he filled the office of Mayor, and was put on the Commission of the Peace for both Rochester and the county of Kent. Twice also he has contested a seat for Parlia- ment. For his native city he has done much. He founded a workmen's club, and afterwards, when two others were started, converted it into a branch of the Y.M.C.A. and a temper- ance hotel. But the Sunday school cause has commanded his best energies. For 45 years he was superintendent of the Vines Sunday School at Rochester, and 40 years ago he came up as a delegate to the Sunday School Union meet- ings from the Rochester and Chatham Sunday School Union. This brought him into touch with the National lunion, his services to which have been of inestimable worth. As a writer of text books, as a public speaker, as chairman of the Council, and in a hundred other ways his life has been given in rich and fruitful ser- vice to the Sunday schools of the world. He was elected president of the Sunday School Union in its centenary year, 1903, the highest office which the Union has to bestow.

WOMEN FREETRADERS. Llangwm's Chilling Reception to Tariff Reformers. Tariff Reformers are not meeting with a very gratifying reception in Pembrokeshire. At Letterston a Tariff Reform meeting was aban- doned to opponents, who. elected Mr J. Harries, of Stagscastle, to the chair, and passed a strong Free Trade resolution. On Saturday evening the Tariff Reform speakers invaded the oyster village of Llan- gwm, but met with a reception that was de- cidedly chilling. The LlangwH^ women are pronounced Free Traders, and as the brake containing the Tariff Reform speakers drove down the village the women, attired in their picturesque red skirts and broad-brimmed felt hats, shook their fists at these unwelcome in- truders with their gramaphones. Mr J. Lort Phillips, who presided, regretted that his neighbours and tenants at Llangwm were indifferent to the question of Tariff Reform. It showed that he never exercised any pressure on his tenantry in political matters. For himself he regarded Tariff Reform as the question of the hour. Mr Walter Roch, the prospective Liberal candi- date, had put Disestablishment and Disendow- ment in the forefront, but the next election would not be fought on this, but Tariff Reform. Mr Ivan Davies advocated a tax on foreign- made motor-cars, and asserted that 75 per cent. of the ladies of Haverfordwest wore foreign made goods. He did not blame them, but at the same time imports should not come into the country free, while at the same time people in the North of England were abso- lutely starving. Mr Gould followed, and said he believed there would soon be a bve-election in Pem- brokeshire, when they would be able to choose between a Tariff Reformer and Free Trader. Mr Gould aiso told his hearers that when the preachers told them from their pulpits to vote for Free Trade they should question them- as to what they meant by Free Trade. The preachers were the chaps he was after. Like the cobbler, they ought to stick to work they knew something about.
NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD. The Gorsedd Examinatiens. On Saturday the examinations of candidates* for the degrees of bard, druid, ovate, and the musical degrees of the Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isle of Britain in connection with this year's National Eisteddfod were held at several centres throghout the Principality and some of the principal towns of England'. The examinations were arranged by Eifionydd, of Carnarvon, the recorder of the Gorsedd, as- sisted by some of the members of the Gorsedd at the various centres. The examiners who prepared the questions and will examine the answers are For the degree of bard the Revs. Evan Recs (Dyted), the Archdruid of Wales Thomas Davies (Bethel), of Cardiff and J. Dyfnallt Owen, of Pontypridd. For the degree of ovate, the Revs. Ben Davies, of Ystalyfera, and J. C. Davies (Cadvanl, of Aberystwyth, and Llwydfryn and for the musical degrees, Mr John H. Roberts, Mus. Bac. (Pencerdd Gwynedd), of Liverpool Mr R. Wilfrid Jones, of Wrexham: and Mr W. J. Williams (Gwilym Alaw), of Carnarvon.
On Sunday evening a man named Fred Dastin (24), of no fixed abode, was taken to the Swansea Central Police Station on a charge of attempted suicide by jumping into the North Dock. It is not stated how he got into the dock, and Dastin himself has made no statement to the police. When rescued he was described as being in a state of collapse. The police sent him to the Workhouse Infirmary for treatment.
MR LLOYD GEORGE. FINE SPEECH IN EDINBURGH. Battle With the Brewer. SHALL THE TRADE TRIUMPH ? SUFFRAGETTES CAUSE DISORDER. Under the auspices of the Scottish Temper- ance Legislation Board and other temperance organisations, a great demonstration was held on Saturday afternoon in the King's Theatre, Edinburgh. The gathering was held in support of the English Licensing Bill, and the chief speaker was the Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P., the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The theatre was crowded in every part when the Master of Polworth took the chair. Amongst those on the platform were Sir Samuel Chisholm, Sir A. R. Simpson, Master of Elibank, M.P., Mr Alex. Ure, M.P., Lord Provost Gibson, Rev. Dr. Alex. Whyte, the host of Mr Lloyd George, Lord Forbes, Mr Alex. Cross, M.P.. Principal Stewart, Rev. Principal Hutton, Mr J. W. Gulland, M.P., Dr. Laws, Moderator of the U.F. Church, Mr J. D. Sope, M.P.. Sir James Low, Mr C. H. Lyell, M.P., Mr C. E. Price. M.P., Sir James B. Smith, Mr J. D. Hope, M.P.. Mr G. P. Esslemont, Mr G. McCrae, M.P., Sir Henry Ballantyne, Cap- tain Murray, M.P., Sir James Sivewright, Lord Dalmeny, M.P., Principal Sir James Donald- son, St. Andrews. Mr James Murray, M.P., Lord Had do, and Lord Provost of Dundee. Air Llcyd George had a very enthusiastic welcome from the audience when he rose to speak. He said they were engaged in the southern part of this island in a great struggle to redeem our land from one of the most terrible evils that affected it. (Hear, hear.) They had got a trade in this land which con- ducted its operations in a way that constituted a peril to the State. (Hear, hear.) There was a gigantic waste of national resources involved in it. Here Mr Lloyd George was subjected to. the first of a series of interruptions by suffragettes, one of whom demanded votes for women." When she had desisted, Mr Lloyd George said the worst of it was that he agreed with the lady. (Laughter.) He would give her the vote to-morrow. The Lady in the Gallery Thank you. That is the first thank you I ever had from them, retorted Mr Lloyd George, amid laughter. The woman again got up, and, making more noise this time, w.as ejected by a number of stewards. Why don11you give women the vot$?" came from another suffragette in the dress- circle, and amid cries of Put her out," the interrupter was ejected. Mr Lloyd George expressed surprise that for 20 years these ladies had never asked the ques- tion of a Unionist Government. (Applause.) Continuing, he said that the drink trade bred more poverty, disease, crime, and vice than any single causejA the land. It was responsible for a great mass of festering degradation, and the Government proposed to deal with it. (Cheers.) CARRIED OUT. Another suffragette here broke in with the cry, Does the Government intend to give women the vote ?" Mr Lloyd George said the question had been answered by the Prime Minister, and every sensible woman would be satisfied. The woman, however, was not satisfied, and had to be carried out. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had always maintained that there was no cause that would gain more by the extension of the suffrage to women than the cause of temperance. (Applause.) But when they found the women associated with such tactics as they had found in Peckham and North- West Manchester, he was certain they were doing more harm than good to the sacred cause of womanhood by doing that. (Applause.) He declared that the Government staked their existence upon dealing with the drink evil. (Cheers.) There was no doubt, he continued, that the Trade was a great power in the land. The Government had challenged a powerful, ruthless, relentless foe. There was one thing which characterised this Trade when it was attacked which they would find hardly true of any other interest. None of those ordinary considerations of party or of patriotism which appealed to every other section of the com- munity seemed to-affect that Trade. The Trade was absolutely solid. In England the Trade threatened to boycott people who voted against them. They would withhold charitable subscriptions, and, as an able Wesleyan friend of his said, that was like firing on the red cross. (Applause.) But if Britain was to re- main a free country it must over- throw the dominion of that Trade. If they were beaten this time—politicians having the usual share of the instinct of self-preservation—they would have some difficulty in inducing any party to take up the question again in their day." That was why he said the drink reign of terror would be established in this land. Its throne would be riveted in the politics of the nation, and he had come to Scotland to ask their help. (Applause.) They would find men who said they were in favour of temperance reform, but who objected to this particular measure. They always did. (Laughter.) He asked them to regard with considerable sus- picion that attitude towards the Bill. The brewers' support was invaluable to the Tory party, for the publicans could supply 100,000 electioneering committee-rooms and 100,000 canvassers. Beer prevailed where the gramo- phone failed. (Laughter.) The Bill provided that all the licences in Englandvand Wales should have a time limit of 14 years. (A Voice Too long.) He agreed with the interniptcr, but they were prepared to be liberal. He thought King Hezekiah had 15 years to prepare—(loud laughter)—but the brewers said their reckoning was a heavier one. (Laughter and applause.) They wanted a longer time to prepared for their end. Why should they ? At the end of 14 years the Bill pro- posed that the people residing in the neigh- bourhood'should have the absolute right to declare how many public-houses they wanted to supply their needs—(cheers)—or whether they wanted any public-houses at all. The hope of the Government was to get rid of the redundance of public-houses, especially in the poorer quarters of the cities, and which reduced the slums to beer-sodden swamps. Where, he asked, was the injustice of the Bill ? Mr Lloyd George proceeded to declare that the Government's proposal was the most moderate that had ever been put for- ward by any responsible Government for deal- ing with the question in the British Empire, or in America. In Canada the time limit was ninety days. In the United States not a day was given. In Australia the limit was fourteen to fifteen years, but in New Zealand there was no time limit; and, after all, the peoples of these countries were not pirates. (Laughter.) 200,000 CONVICTIONS. A licence, he said, was not the freehold of the brewer. It was purely an annual licence. (Applause). How long, he asked, did the law allow an inventor the monopoly of his ideas, the product of his own brain ? Fourteen years and his invention probably benefited mankind. Whom had the brewer benefited ? Was Britain better, brighter, nobler for the mono- poly ? (Chorus of No.") If, then, fourteen years was good enough for the inventor, it was too much for the brewer. (Loud cheers.) The Trade had really broken faith with the nation. It was a breach of the law to make a man drunk. Yet last year there were 200,000 convictions for drunkenness, which was pro- bably ^osl^c. one-tenth of the drunkenness of the land. These 200,000 drunks were breaches of contract by the Trade, yet the Trade came down and pleaded that contract which it had torn to ribbons long ago. (Applause.) Every slum was a breach of contract. (Renewed applause.) If they had not the excessive drinking, half the profits of the Trade would disappear. It was a fine old English adage which said. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands." (Applause.) In conclusion, Mr Lloyd George said the Government's object was a land where they would meet no drunkard staggering on the road towards his doom—a land where they had no slums for humanity to rot in a land with two-thirds of its prison cells empty a land with its workhouses vanished a land with its children well fed, well clothed, well sheltered well trained, with their merry laughter ringing through the streets a land where the curse of drink shall be driven from its haunts. That was their ideal. They asked Scotland to help them to it. (Loud cheers.) Sir Samuel Chisholm (Glasgow) moved a resolution thanking the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer for his address, pledging the meeting to render every possible assistance to those who, irrespective of party, have given their support to the Government in its endeavour to place upon the Statute Book a comprehensive and effective measure of temperance reform for England and Wales, and calling upon the Government to introduce into Parliament at the earliest opportunity a measure of temper- ance reform for Scotland which shall take into account the more advanced state of Scottish opinion upon this question. f Sir Alexander R. Simpson (Edinburgh) seconded, and the motion was adopted with acclamation. In reply, Mr Lloyd George said he would bring before the Cabinet Scotland's desire for a more atdvanced measure of temperance reform. Outside the theatre the women who had been ejected endeavoured to address the crowd from a platform improvised from an orange box. The crowd, however, was in no mood to listen, and, pelting them with bread and paper, forced them to beat a retreat to an ice- cream shop, where for some time they re- mained besieged.
FRENCH ONION MEN. How Aliens Act Affects. Them. It would appear that the report circulated to the effect that the Breton peasants, who visit this country annually to vend their onions, resent the formalities to which they have to submit under the Aliens Act, has no foundation in fact. They have to submit to no formalities whatever," said a Customs official at Cardiff on Saturday. The only condition imposed upon them is that they must come to this country in batches of not less than 20, and we have not beard that they obiect to that."
Radnorshire Liberals. ANNUAL MEETING OF ASSOCIATION. Mr Lloyd Geerge: What Will His Pelicy Be ? SPEECH BY SIR FRANCIS EDWARDS. The annual meeting of the Radnorshire Liberal Association was held on Friday at Franks bridge, a remote village over five miles from Builth Railway Station and most inac- cessible from the greater part of the county. Nevertheless, the experiment was a great suc- cess, and there was a splendid attendance of Liberal stalwarts from Rhayader, Presteign, Knighton, Llandriiidod Wells, and from all parts of rural Radnorshire. The retiring president (Mr J. W. Stephens, J.P., C.C., of Womaston) presided, and delivered a speech on current politics. The following officers were unanimously elected :—President, Alderman Thomas Davies, J.P.. C.C., Fronolan vice-president, Mr Jeffrey Jones, Llandrindod Wells hon. secre- tary, Mr C. M. Nixon, Knighton (re-elected) treasurer, Mr Richard Morgan, Rhayader (re- elected). The County Member's Speech. Sir Francis Edwards, Bart., M.P. for Rad- norshire, who was cordially received, spoke enthusiastically of the qualities and abilities of Mr Asquith and Mr Lloyd George, the new Premier and the new Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr Asquith's last Budget was a triumph for Free Trade and a staggering blow to Tariff Reform. It had given old age pen- sions and at the same time reduced the tax on sugar, and in about three years the national debt would have been reduced by £46,000,000. (Cheers.) This hadcbeen accomplished under Free Trade, whilst Protectionist Germany would probably increase its national debt in the next five years by £50,000,000. Touching on the education question, Sir Francis pleaded that although the Irish hadsomewhatthwarted the Liberals in their desires with regard to this matter, yet Liberals should not judge them harshly, as being Roman Catholics the matter was one of deep principle with them, and Liberals must try; to solve this problem by satisfying the just demands of all people. The olive branch had been held out, but there could be no settlement without the conceding of popular control and the abolition of tests. (Cheers.) He was hopeful of a compromise fair to all parties, but High Churchmen, like Lord Hugh Cecil and Lord Halifax, made a settlement very difficult. These men claimed the same privileges as the Roman Catholics. They scorned the name Protestant, and despised undenominational religious instruction. Did they despise undenominational religious itt* struction because they believed it to be bad, as the Roman Catholics did, or because they considered it to be insufficient ? If the former, then the place for these men was not within the Protestant Church of England, but out- side of it. (Loud cheers.) If the latter, then they should pay for additional religious in- struction at their own expense. (Renewed cheers.) Sir Francis proceeded to give whole-hearted support to the Licensing Bill, saying he had never heard of anything quite so despicable as the threats of the brewers to boycot Church charities because the hishops were daring to do what they considered to be their duty to God and man. (Cheers.) After replying to the charges that the Government were robbers and spoliators, and that the Bill would injure the innocent investor, Sir Francis said the whole heart of the Tory party was now in Protection. He could not understand how this policy would benefit the farmer. It would in- crease the price of feeding stuffs, manures, agricultural implements, food, rent and for almost everything the farmer had to buy he would have to pay more than under Free Trade. The Tories were anxious to find some system which would bring in more money, but there were systems which would do that without the taxing of the food of the people. (Cheers.) They now had a Welsh- man as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he (Sir Francis) had a shrewd suspicion that Mr Lloyd George had some ideas on this subject. (Hear, hear.) His idea would be to tax the rich for the benefit of the poor, and not the re- verse, and he could assure them that if Mr Lloyd George brought in a Bill for the graduat- ing of the income-tax it would have the sup- port of the member for Radnorshire. (Cheers.) Subsequently the members of the associa- tion sat down to tea, provided at the Franks. bridge Schoolroom.
LATE CARSLAKE THOMPSON. Unveiling of aTabletto His Memory On Sunday afternoon there was a large con- gregation present at the West Grove Unitarian Church, Cardiff, when a memorial service was held and a tablet unveiled to the memory of the late George Carsla-kc Thompson, one of the founders of the church. The whole of the members of the Thompson family were present, and representatives of the Unitarian cause from Newport, Aberdare, Pontypridd, and other places in the South-East Wales Unitarian Society, of which Mr Carslake Thompson was a prominent member, as well as many friends of the late Mr Thompson who are not connected with the cause. The open- ing service was taken by the Rev. Blount Mott, the minister of West Grove, after which letters were read from many absent friends, including communications from the Rev. George St. Clair, the Rev. W. Whittaker, of Hull (two former ministers of West Gro e), and Professor Weatherall, late of Carmarthen. The unveiling of the tablet was performed by the Rev. Edward Odgpts, of Oxford, who de- livered a most touching address on the many characteristic's and personal excellences of his old friend and fellow student George Carslake Thompson. He was an outdoor man, a. lover of nature, a climber, a walker, attached to Nature, and a student of her ways. He was not content to run out for an hour to look at Nature. Many of his greatest pleasures were found in simple ways, with plants and flowers, and on th hills,and his great love of re made of him an astronomer. He was a man of broad out- look, of great liberality in thought, and he combined with his breadth the warmth of the enthusiast, which made him a devoted friend and a loyalsupportcrof any causehe espoused. The younger members of the congregation could scarcely realise what the empty seat in the church he served and founded meant to those who had grown up with him in the cause, and who had lost an encouraging friend and fellow-worshipper. The memorial tablet is in excellent tasoa and of artistic beauty. There is nothing funereal about it, in its mellow and subdued, tones of coloured marble and alabaster, with design in glass mosaics. The decoration is made up of the wild rose, Mr Carslake Thompson's favourite flower. The inscription reads To the memory of George Carslake Thompson, an active member and devoted supporter of this church, of which he was one of the founders, who died 30th March, 1906, in the 63rd year of his age. This tablet is dedicated by sorrowing fellow-worshippera in grateful recognition of a life-long service to the cause of liberal religion." Mr H. Woolcott Thompson thanked the subscribers on behalf of the trustees of the church for the beautiful gift to the memory of his brother, and to the church. He also thanked them on behalf of the family, and he thought it was not too egotistical to say that his brother was one of the founders of that church, and had given of his time and of his means in the interests of liberal religion. They felt that his loss was great.
LR.C. MEETIN8 AT ABERAVON. Prospective Candidate for Swansea District. The Aberavon, Port Talbot, and District Trade and Labour Council has now become de- funct, but it is replaced by a stronger organisa- tion, viz., the L.R.C., and the first meeting of the latter body was held on Sunday after- noon in the Grand Hall, Aberavon, when there was a very large attendance. County Coun- cillor Henry Davies, Cwmavon. presided, sup- ported by Messrs Richard Davies (London), Tom Griffiths (Neath), Jonah Charles (Dockers' Union, Aberavon), W. Lewis and R. Llewellyn (Taibach), and others. Mr R. Davies (Municipal Employees' Asso- ciation, London, delivered an address on they progress and work of the Labour movement throughout the country during the last 50 years. Mr T. Griffiths (Neath) also addressed the meeting. A resolution approving of the establishment of a branch of the L.R.C. for the Aberavon district, and calling upon all organised workers to support it was moved by.Mr J. Charles. Mr W. Lewis, in seconding, said the time had come when they in the Swansea District Division should be represented in Parliament by a Labour member. (Cheers.) He was sure that in their chairman they had one capable of holding his own with any man—(applause)— and when a bye-election or another General Election came they would not need to go fur- ther than CwmaVon to seek for a suitable can- didate. (Loud applause.) Thhe Chairman I agree that the time haa „ come when the Swansea District should have a Labour representative, but it should be left to the whole of the organised bodies of the dis- trict to decide upon the candidate. (Laughter and cheers.) The resolution was carried unanimously.
CARGO IN FLAMES. Exciting Fire Scene at Sea. Lisbon, Sunday.—The British steamee Glenisla, belonging to Dundee, ran into the Tagus this morning with her cargo of esparto grass blazing furiously. The fire, which broke out amidships, threatened to destroy the vessel, but thanks to the efforts of tugs and fireboats sent out from the arsenal at Lisbon the outbreak was mainly confined to the cargo, this, however, being completely destroyed. Several men on board sustained severe in- juries in fighting the flames. The damage Ï8 estimated at many thousands of pouztds^- Central News. iThe IFD research team is a multi-disciplinary team of committed Christians, with years of practical experience assisting youth and young adults in connecting to God and becoming lifelong disciples.

Stephen K. Wilke, PhD
IFD Executive Director
Dr. Wilke is a clinical psychologist whose research interests began with his dissertation published in 1981 entitled Church and Clergy as Prevention agents in Rural Community Mental Health. The finding of this research provided insight into how rural clergy and their church leadership, who serve communities under-served by the mental health profession, experience effective interventions with persons experiencing significant life stressors. Dr. Wilke has continued to work towards more training for clergy and lay leaders to help empower their ministries and their faith communities to be effective in both healthy spiritual formation and emotional well-being. Now in his 3rd decade on a college campus, his primary interests have focused on assisting persons ages 14 to 24 (a life stage termed the decade of discernment) with the understandings, habits and community to live a life of Christian discipleship.Our Founder and Managing Director, Sandra Gravlee opened our first office in Melbourne in 1981.

‘Oh, my gawd!’ I exclaim, as the full impact of the tableau across the road of the intersection with the R44 hits me. ‘We have to, have to stop off a minute and get a good look at that.’
We’re just turning onto the R44 that links Somerset West to Stellenbosch, en route to the Stellenbosch Botanical Garden, with Spier behind us (via a rather circular route, admittedly). Speak about advertising.
If the hodge podge arrangement of what appears to be raggedy anne dolls, aeroplanes and very tall giraffe were a billboard, it would be exceedingly large and outrageously bright; virtually incandescent actually. One is drawn like a magnet…
We fall out of the car into the full heat of the day – it must be 40 degrees already, no kidding – to get a closer look. Breakfast, a rather jaunty blackboard placed strategically at the ramp to the farm stall announces, is served ‘die boere manier’ (the farmer’s way), with 2 eggs, 2 bacon, boerewors and 2 toast.
And if that doesn’t do it for you, then a ‘healthy start’ is the muesli, yoghurt and fruit alternative or just plain eggs and toast.
In front of the restaurant, next to the farm stall, which is in reality a rather small shop but stocked to the hilt, is this display that makes the huge strawberry at Lyndoch station at the garage look, well, rather pathetic by comparison.
There is what looks like a papier mâché giraffe, the gaudy purple and pink neck of which rises above the little tree next to which it is perched. At its feet lie a bunch of vacant looking scarecrows, tied together with string.
But wait, there’s yet another giraffe, this one light blue, a scarecrow on its back, and what looks like a group of papier mâché figurines behind a wire fence, called the Mooiberg Sexy Star.
An entire collection of little aeroplanes, a train engine of note called the strawberry choo-choo, and a real studebaker 1954 model (I think it’s a studebaker, but I wouldn’t know a real one if it jumped up and bit me), in mangled disrepair, but what kid wouldn’t want to clamber all over this?
But that’s where it gets a little difficult, as despite the incredible allure for children, it’s not particularly safe. Out of necessity, I assume, barbed wire has joined the tableau.
And more than one child, I would imagine, has found his heel, or worse, nipped in the process of attempting to experiment with the individual characters and obvious rides – the grain fertiliser seed planter is so enmeshed with it that you can’t even get close to it – what a pity!
Admittedly, there are rather obvious signs indicating that play in this particular playground is at your own risk, but then every park has one of these (signs). One doesn’t expect barbed wire.
I cast my eye over the sail boat and the windmill and the tower that begs children to scramble, and shepherd my five-year old back to the car. Okay, so it isn’t a playground, but it’s up there with Outsider art for entertainment value, and just about every establishment in the neighbourhood, from wine farms to accommodation venues in Stellenbosch, mention the Mooiberge farm stall. It’s something of a landmark.
But Mooiberge Farm Stall is actually about strawberries, and, at the right time of year – the season usually starts in November and runs through to February – this is where you can experience what it is to pick your own, whilst munching them straight off the plant. The idea is that you pay for what you pick (and what you manage to get into your mouth whilst picking is, well…)
The farm stall is a treat. Aside from the obvious jams and dried fruit, there are nuts, fresh fruit, drinks and any kind of snack you can think of. The place is brimming. But this is only a pitstop and we’re off again. Glad we stopped to have a look.

My great-grandfather, “Pops,” gave up everything to move here from Italy because he loved the United States. But sometimes, he also hated this country’s guts.
A proud American who nevertheless kept a picture of Mussolini on his night table, Pops left Naples for New York in 1904, with wife and small children in tow. He moved less for freedom than for fortune; why he thought there was a fortune waiting for an uneducated, middle-aged custom-suit tailor encumbered by a burgeoning family — seven kids by the time they were done — is anyone’s guess. Rumor, propaganda and Horatio Alger, Jr. in cheap translations all probably had something to do with it.
The Great Depression altered his perspective. On the eve of the 1929 crash, he filed for citizenship, identifying his race as “white”; when he was finally naturalized seven years later he labeled himself “Southern Italian,” in a small act of protest.
It was probably around then that he became fixated on Benito Mussolini. There’s an old photo in which he stands in front of his glass storefront in the Bronx, compact, barrel-chested, mustachioed and furious. That the son of a blacksmith could grow up to be a dictator probably seemed to Pops an inspiring story of real opportunity.
About that time, Ezra Pound was giving full, baroque expression to more or less the same crackpot philofascism. Not only in the “Cantos,” his epic, but in peculiar tracts with titles such as “Jefferson and/or Mussolini.” His lifelong campaign of bringing about an “American Risorgimento” in poetry and the arts was carried out mostly abroad, first in London and Paris, then in Italy. This most American of poets indeed spent little of his adult life in the U.S., but he did make three return visits. The first was in 1910, to persuade the New York Public Library, then under construction, to change its design. No luck. The second was in 1939, to persuade the U.S. not to enter World War II. Also no luck. The last was in 1945, to stand trial as a traitor for his pro-fascist, anti-Semitic rants on Rome radio. This time, a bit of luck: Robert Frost and other writers organized a campaign that resulted in his spending 13 years in an insane asylum instead of being executed.
Pound’s career — his trajectory from rebellious instigator to reactionary crank — still makes people uncomfortable. But he’s only an extreme example of a iconic American type: the patriot whose love of country is heat-tempered with defection and disavowal.
American patriotism is indeed so often fused with its seditious opposite that the contradiction passes unnoticed. Good ol’ boys who fly the Confederate flag next to the Stars and Stripes are called out for their racism but not their ideological incoherence. They inspire revulsion and outrage but not perplexity. For what could possibly be more American than personal secession — which combines, after all, the original sin of the American Revolution with the mystique of the heroic individual?
The right has no monopoly on this. As a leftist who considers National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden an American hero, I’ll concede that a measure of his appeal for me derives from his subversiveness, from his direct flouting of a president I voted for, twice. Snowden talks about “turnkey tyranny” and I feel patriotic. “We are the nation that produces this kind of individual courage!” I think to myself, not unfatuously.
I find it nauseating when the National Rifle Association wraps itself in the flag while ranting about “jack-booted government thugs.” But I find it stirring, lyrical and inspiring when the unforgettable Mickey Sabbath, a Philip Roth creation, wraps himself in the American flag and pees and masturbates onto his dead lover’s grave. When the cops show up, “Sabbath could easily have tucked himself into his trousers and pulled up the zipper. But he wouldn’t.”
Is this appalling tableau a consecration or a desecration? Or like straight-up flag-burning, a bit of both? I don’t know, but it made me laugh, hard, and it made me proud to be an American.
Patriotic “secession” can take ludic form intentionally or unintentionally. There is no more ridiculous piece of visual wit than the image of Neil Armstrong saluting the American flag while standing on the surface of the moon. In the running for a distant second is the invisible “sculpture” marking the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, which consists of six inches of bare earth and the words: “This soil and the air space extending above it shall not be a part of any nation and shall not be subject to any entity’s jurisdiction.”
More recently, Dean Kamen, the American inventor and Renaissance man who brought us the Segway, bought an island off the coast of Connecticut and seceded — verbally, at least — from the United States. You might call that a joke, but then you might say the same about the Segway. Still, no one ever questioned Dean Kamen’s patriotism. Why would they? He’s in the tradition of Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison and, for that matter, Elon Musk, who will probably secede from the solar system when he gets to Mars.
While Musk heads for the moon, his former Paypal colleague Peter Thiel is setting keel to breakers to “establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems.” He calls them “seasteads” — the new homesteads, only on massive sea platforms.
Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is predicting he defines as “an opt-in society, ultimately outside the U.S., run by technology.” In a rambling, exhilaratingly absurd speech at the Y Combinator Startup School, Srinivasan invoked the legacy of the Puritans, the Founding Fathers, Ellis Island, “people leaving pogroms, and in the 20th century fleeing Nazism and Communism,” America as the nation of immigrants and emigrants, and so on, all as the basis for what he proposes as “Silicon Valley’s ultimate exit,” the creation of “new countries” in which warfare becomes software, laws become code, and so on.
Srinivasan’s speech was nuts, but it made a kind of sense. The spirit of American secession lives on, for some. It is not today’s downtrodden, but rather its elite, who are setting out to settle a new world for themselves.

This week the Boundary Commission for England (BCE) published initial proposals for new constituency boundaries and opened an eight-week consultation period.
The review was launched to ensure that the number of voters in each constituency is more equal by increasing the number of constituencies in England from 533 to 543.
Final recommendations are set to be presented to parliament by July 2023.
The initial proposals suggest four constituencies to cover Croydon which would be Croydon East, Croydon North, Croydon South and Norwood.
The current constituencies are Croydon North, Croydon Central and Croydon South.
The following council wards would be included in each of the new constituencies.
Croydon East:
Addiscombe East, Addiscombe West, New Addington North, New Addington South, Park Hill & Whitgift, Selsdon & Addington Village, Selsdon Vale & Forestdale, Shirley North and Shirley South.
Croydon North:
Bensham Manor, Broad Green, West Thornton, Fairfield, Norbury & Pollards Hill, Selhurst, part of Waddon and Longtornton which is a Merton Council ward.
Croydon South:
Coulsdon Town, Kenley, Old Coulsdon, Purley & Woodcote, Purley Oaks & Riddlesdown, Sanderstead, South Croydon and part of Waddon.
Norwood:
Crystal Palace & Upper Norwood, South Norwood, Thornton Heath, Woodside, Norbury Park as well as Lambeth Council wards Gipsy Hill and Knight’s Hill.
Consultation on the proposals ends on August 2 and can be found here: - It will be followed by another two consultations in 2022.
Tim Bowden, secretary to the Boundary Commission for England, said: “We consider all feedback received during the consultation process, and it is your local knowledge that helps us to shape constituencies that best reflect your local area.”Hundreds of times we have prepared cases like yours beyond the brink of trial.

No win. No fee. Free Case Assessment.Amid record-setting numbers for daily coronavirus tests and deep concern from health experts, Premier Doug Ford for the first time acknowledged what has been warned about for weeks.
"Ontario is now in the second wave of COVID-19," Ford said at his daily press conference Monday, hours after the province revealed that a whopping 700 additional people tested positive for the coronavirus. That beats the daily record of 640 set on April 24, and is 209 more than the 491 who tested positive the day before.
The premier urged Ontarians to abide by public health recommendations, download the COVID-19 app, and to get their flu shot, laying out in stark terms that the severity of the second wave will be determined by the actions everyday citizens take.
"Will we face a wave or a tsunami?" he rhetorically asked, issuing a call to action to the province for residents to do their best. "This is extremely, extremely serious."
The premier also announced a push to hire 3,700 health care workers to respond to the second wave, allocating $52 million in funding to do so. About 2,000 of those workers will be personal support workers and there will be incentives to work in long-term care.
The big surge in cases coincided with over 41,000 tests being done, including addressing some of the testing backlog. Mondays tend to have higher levels of positive tests following lags over the weekend.
Despite these caveats, health experts were alarmed at the caseload and direction of the province.
Dr. Colin Furness, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, called the numbers "disappointing," although he wasn't surprised by them either. He added that the latest numbers reflect where we were at about seven to 10 days ago, and do not yet register the renewed sense of vigilance that has been emphasized recently by public health officials.
Despite the recent moves to shut down strip clubs, limit the serving time at bars to 11 p.m. and reduce the limits on social gatherings, Furness referred to the existing suite of measures as an "inadequate" policy response.
"We're behind the curve," he said of the current state of the pandemic. He urged the government not to lose more time before coming up with a more forceful response. "Losing a week or two can make the difference." Among the measures that Furness would like to see is a complete shutdown of indoor service at bars and restaurants. He characterized the most dangerous occupation in the province right now as bartenders and servers, as they consistently work with people who are not wearing masks.
Furness also expressed some doubt that Ontario is actually in a second wave, as the recent surge in cases does not seem tied to school reopening or colder weather, adding that this may be the tail end of the first wave and the coming months could be worse.
He also added that the recent surge in cases may have a silver lining, insofar as the bad numbers create political will. "One positive consequence is it will give the premier political cover to do more."
One group that would like to see a more forceful response is the Ontario Hospital Association. In a statement it sounded the alarm on provincial trends and urged the government to push the Greater Toronto Area and Ottawa back into stage two, saying they are "gravely concerned" about the direction things are headed in. "Without public health measures in place to limit opportunities for disease transmission, Ontario will soon see higher numbers of hospitalization, admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) and more deaths," warned CEO Anthony Dale.
Ford acknowledged in his press conference that he spoke with Dale. Health Minister Christine Elliott added that the government does not want to return to a previous stage unless it absolutely has to, based on feedback from health experts who form its command table.
Despite the record numbers, dire warnings and sober assessments, the government also opened up one part of the economy Monday morning, as casinos were able to open their doors as of 10 a.m.
Suzanne Sicchia, a public health policy expert at the University of Toronto campus in Scarborough, cast a skeptical eye on the decision to open casinos given the latest developments. "We need to pick our priorities," she said. "Do we open casinos in the midst of a second wave?" she asked, suggesting doing so is a bad idea.
Instead, she urged the government to focus on strengthening the social safety net and making sure there are policies so that employees can stay home with paid sick days when they need to.
Furness was more open to casinos, but he highlighted one potential hazard, saying that it would be inappropriate to run the typical shuttle buses, which could be a vector for transmission.These beautiful boxes are designed to make every parting gift look like a sentimental present from you and your partner.

IPOB said though the struggle for freedom had not been easy, it remains “steadfast, resolute, fearless and totally committed to the freedom” of Biafra.
In a statement signed by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, the separatist group vowed to always stand by the truth no matter the cost in its fight for freedom.
The pro- Biafra group, however, commended those it said had opposed it’s ideologies in the past for aligning with it at this point.
The statement reads, “IPOB worldwide and the directorate of State DOS commend the efforts made by the people of Biafra since the inception of the struggle by the indigenous people of Biafea IPOB
“All through history, in every clime when God’s ordained revolution manifests like Biafra and IPOB revolution, so many forces usually oppose it, and move to stop it, subvert it, and undermine it and or sabotage and blackmail it. Our journey to freedom is no different.
“We must forgive all who opposed us in the past, either out of fear or out of ignorance. We welcome them anytime they wake up from slumber and queue in to the correct line.
“The journey has not been easy, but we appreciate you all and assure you all, that the great and noble IPOB worldwide and it’s leader mazi Namdi Kanu shall remain steadfast, resolute, fearless and totally committed to freedom no matter what may come our way.
“We will always stand on the truth at all times. No price is too high for liberty of Biafrans.
“In that connection, we note the recent waking up of those who have misunderstood us in the past, we welcome them all, including the Igbo summit group held at Uturu in Abia state, who called the federal government to release our leader mazi Nnamdi Kanu during their summit Abia university Uturu, Ohaneze Ndi Igbo and Igbo Leaders of thought.
“We believe we have conquered every opposition, through the simple truth and the grace of the Almighty God.”
IPOB also commended those who have been sympathetic to the Biafra course.
“We sincerely thank all our members, admirers, sympathizers and supporters all over the world for their sacrifices, steadfastness and support so far. We are truly grateful.
“In this regard, we must appreciate the tireless Prof. Ben Nwabueze, for his fatherly counsel and noble heart in defense of the truth and pursuit of justice.
“We appreciate Dr. Alex Ekwueme, the Iroko, for his fatherly advises and standing on the truth, we appreciate the great Mummy Chief Mrs. Maria Okwor, the defender of the oppressed, the only amazon, who like wine appreciate in value with age, we are grateful to the indefatigable Evang. Elliot Uko, a truly upright man, defender of truth and a man of peace.
“We are grateful to the traders’ unions, students bodies, age grades, PFN, CAN, traditional rulers, individuals, drivers’ unions, okada and tricycle riders unions, women’s groups and youth organizations all over Biafraland and the world who have publicly and privately stood by us, encouraged us and supported us, in one way or the other.”
IPOB assured its supporters that it remains resolute and “will never waiver, sell out or betray unborn generation by falling into the temptation of being attracted to filthy lucre. Cursed be us, the day we do that.
“Finally, we pray that Almighty God the Chukwu Okike Abiama, who has conquered the oppressor for us, will soon grant us the final victory as we march on confidently and joyfully to the promised land of Biafra.”

School achievement of pupils with a non-Western minority background often lags behind that of their peers with a Dutch ethnic background. Bettina de Jong's research investigates two possible explanations for these differences in school adjustment. She focuses on the effects of negative stereotypes on school achievement and how the quality of the teacher-child relationship affects the behavioural adjustment of ethnic minority students in the Netherlands.

The artist is Whitney Herrington, an artwork trainer from Nashville, Tennessee. She advised Oil Metropolis Information the unique posting from the Casper Mural Challenge referred to as for a design centered on the theme “Welcome to Casper.”
“My take is a recent twist on a postcard,” Harrington stated. Every letter within the phrase “Casper” is being rendered in its personal distinctive model. Indian paintbrush and bike treads are among the design components being labored into the general piece.
Article continues beneath…
“I made certain to achieve out to folks earlier than I submitted my closing design … to ask what they wished to see within the mural,” she stated.
The suggestions signaled a want for one thing past conventional landscape-and-cowboy Wyoming tropes: “one thing just a little extra enjoyable and shiny,” Herrington stated.

Herrington added the phrase “The place wander meets surprise” to her design in honor of the brand new host.
Elmore stated a nationwide name was put out for the welcoming mural venture, and three artists have been chosen primarily based on portfolio submissions. The finalists then submitted design ideas.
The fee was funded by a grant from the Wyoming Arts Council and by cash raised by the Better Together mural project on the side of the Atrium Plaza last summer, Elmore stated.
After doing a little murals for college initiatives, Herrington began doing them across the neighborhood and started searching for different initiatives.
“I in all probability utilized for thirty issues, and heard again from two,” she stated. “However that’s the sport; you’re going to get one million ‘no’s.”
That is her first out-of-state fee. She famous the friendliness and hospitality of the folks she’s met up to now.
“It is a massive deal for me, completely, to have the ability to journey someplace I’ve by no means been, meet all these great folks, and depart my mark and likewise do one thing that’s going to be a constructive a part of the neighborhood.”

Avocado trees are cherished not only for the fruit's flavor, but for the fruit's nutritional and ornamental values. Avocados are appearing at consumers’ tables and menus with more frequency than ever. Sandwich chains promote some novel uses of avocados in order to capitalize on the nutritional and tasty quality of the fruit. Avocados are somewhat like bananas; they mature on the tree, are harvested, and then ripen. The Hass avocado (Persia Americana) is one of the most popular because it can produce fruit almost year round. In colder climates avocados must be potted and brought inside so they do not freeze. However, the 'Bacon' avocado is gaining popularity because it is cold tolerant.
The lovely form, bountiful flowers, and structure of the avocado tree makes it an excellent ornamental tree. If planted in a pot, it may be pruned to regulate the mature size. Nature Hills supplies grafted trees with clonal root-stocks to help insure disease tolerance and ample harvests.

Tutira Mai is a traditional Maori song which has been arranged for female voices. It was written for the Rangi Ruru Chorale in 1988, and this original version was for sopranos, altos, solo flute, solo cello and piano.
The piece proved so popular, particularly with school choirs, that a second version which didn't require the solo instruments was produced. The second version has identical vocal parts to the first, but only the piano for accompaniment. Both versions last one and a half minutes.
Check out these different youtube versions of Tutira Mai, arranged by Anthony Ritchie:
Tutira Mai - Coro Encanto, Spain
Tutira Mai with flute, Argentina
Tutira Mai with gilt, Mexico

Well that is what happened at Forest Fields Primary School.
All their Year groups, from Year 2 to year 5 were asked to write their own stories about “resilience”
What did it mean to them? What does resilience actually look like? How could the trait of resilience be described in a story?
Each and every day the pupils at Forest Fields are taught how important it is to develop their character. To be able to cope with what life throws at you is very important. The earlier we can learn about that the better. The government has very recently acknowledged how important this part of the national curriculum is. How do you cope with bullying, loss, disappointment and even accolade (swot!) It’s not easy, but writing about it is certainly a way to demonstrate you get it!
Nottingham Trent University judged 15 stories shortlisted as the best and then awarded first prize to a pupil in each year group. We were there, at an assembly, to present a shield of achievement to the winner and runner up certificates to the rest. Everyone got a £10 gift voucher to spend on whatever they wished.
It was the
We are proud to support such initiatives in primary schools. They add value to our normal school provision and classroom interventions and help raise the attainment and progress of the pupils we work with.
It will be more again next year as NTU CenSCE continue to look for opportunities to work with primary schools in innovative ways. We have 25 “resilient” primary schools all of whom having budding story tellers and wonderful pupils.
So could you write a story around when you demonstrated you were resilient against all the odds? Have a go but I am afraid there is no promise of a shield; they are reserved for my primary friends
Pete HayesThe United States, France and Britain called a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Thursday to press for “immediate action” to secure the delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged areas of Syria. The supposedly heartfelt humanitarian concerns of the three imperialist powers that are currently bombing Syria came amid a concerted propaganda campaign over alleged starvation in the southwestern Syrian town of Madaya.
Originating with Al Jazeera, the news agency controlled by the Qatari monarchy, a key source of financial and arms support for the Al Qaeda-linked militias that have ravaged much of Syria, the invocation of Madaya as proof of the supposed inhumanity of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad has been taken up by much of the world media. The New York Times published a front-page report Friday on conditions in the town, based on accounts that the newspaper said “could not be independently confirmed.”
There is no reason to doubt that conditions are desperate in Madaya, as they are in much of Syria after more than four years of a sectarian civil war fomented and provisioned by US imperialism and its regional allies, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar. As many as 4.5 million Syrians are in areas that have been cut off from the rest of the country by the battle lines.
If Madaya is the focus of international attention, however, it is because it is encircled by Syrian government forces along with their allies from the Lebanese Hezbollah militia. The town sits at a strategic juncture near the Lebanese border and less than 25 miles from the capital, Damascus.
In the international furor being whipped up over conditions in Madaya, including through the use of photographs of starving people taken elsewhere, little attention is given to the fact that the town is largely controlled by the al-Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, and Ahrar al-Sham, a similar Salafist jihadi militia.
While conditions of hunger in the town are routinely attributed to the government siege, residents have reported that food supplies have been monopolized by the Al Qaeda-linked groups, which sell them at extortionate prices to finance their operations. On October 18, the International Committee of the Red Cross delivered two months’ worth of food supplies to Madaya, with the government doing nothing to impede humanitarian access to the town. That many are facing hunger is largely attributable to the looting of the aid shipment by US-backed “rebels.”
While the imperialist powers and their media accomplices are directing all eyes to Madaya, they have wholly ignored equally if not more desperate conditions in the predominantly Shia towns of Kefraya and al-Foua in the northwestern province of Idlib, which have been under attack by the US-backed “rebels” since 2011 and under a total siege since March of last year. Starved of supplies and under constant attack, the town has seen 1,700 civilian residents killed.
The indifference of the imperialist powers to hunger and suffering among populations under siege by their proxy forces demonstrates that the invocation of starvation is just one more bid to promote a war for regime change as some kind of humanitarian intervention.
Today marks the 25th anniversary of the launching of the first Gulf War against Iraq in 1991. Then, as now, phony pretexts were floated by the US government and echoed and amplified by the corporate media to justify a predatory war for control of the Middle East and its strategic oil resources. In this regard, little has changed over the course of a quarter century of uninterrupted American militarism in the region.
In 1991, it should be recalled, the public was told of marauding Iraqi troops snatching Kuwaiti babies out of incubators and leaving them to die in order to ship the devices back to Iraq. A tearful volunteer nurse was brought to Capitol Hill to testify on this atrocity, which seemed to echo World War I propaganda about German soldiers using Belgian babies for bayonet practice.
Only well after the US invasion was it revealed that the “nurse” was, in fact, the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the US and a member of the oil sheikdom’s royal family, and that the incubator story was a propaganda hoax from start to finish.
In the years that followed, the US imposed draconian sanctions upon Iraq that led to real starvation and unchecked disease. According to some estimates, the sanctions led to the deaths of as many as 500,000 Iraqi children due to a lack of food, medicine and uncontaminated water resulting from the imperialist blockade. Confronted with this appalling death toll in a 1996 television interview, Madeleine Albright, who was then the US ambassador to the UN and soon to be secretary of state, responded, “We think the price is worth it.”
This is the same government now shedding crocodile tears over the alleged use of hunger as a weapon by the Syrian government.
Since then, the United States has annihilated over a million people in the invasion and occupation of Iraq, killed tens of thousands more in the US-NATO war to overthrow Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, and orchestrated the war in Syria that has left an estimated 260,000 dead and displaced half of the country’s population. These interventions have thrown all three countries and their social infrastructures into a state of collapse.
The recklessness and brutality of the US ruling oligarchy’s militarist attempts to impose its hegemony over the Middle East and the entire planet go hand-in-hand with its destructive role within the US itself, smashing up the country’s industrial base, destroying the jobs and living standards of the working class, and funneling the bulk of the nation’s wealth to a handful of financial parasites.
Neither the escalation of the war for regime change in Syria, nor, for that matter, the toppling of Assad will extricate American capitalism from its insoluble crisis. The unending eruption of American militarism will produce only more death and destruction, intensifying the crisis both at home and abroad and bringing humanity ever closer to a global conflagration./cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58372035/usa_today_10236413.0.jpg)
While he may not have been the star signing Toronto FC fans have gotten used to, Nicolas Hasler was a great addition to the team. The Lichtenstein midfielder came into the team during the summer months and played great.
His addition was a perfect antidote during a time when Toronto needed one most. With TFC being without Beitashour after his scary injury, Hasler stepped into the lineup and filled that right wingback role admirably. While it took him a few games to get acclimated to his surroundings and new teammates, Hasler quickly found himself in the starting lineup and producing.
His speed and offensive ability was a change of pace from Beitashour. Going forward, Toronto might be looking for him to take over the spot left by Beitashour’s departure to LAFC. With the CONCACAF Champions League coming up this season and TFC looking to go back to the MLS Final for the third straight season, his presence will be much needed.
:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10052765/usa_today_10327130.jpg)
Hasler only played 12 games in 2017, but he did put up some good offensive numbers. He scored three times on the season while also registering one assist. Hasler finished ahead of Jonathan Osorio and tied with Marky Delgado in goals.
He was almost as good on the defensive side of the ball as the offensive side, as his 1.6 tackles per game shows (according to whoscored.com). Hasler is a jack of all trades, soccer’s version of the utility man or Toronto FC’s version of Ashley Young (as Manchester United fans know).
He can play multiple positions, whether it be right midfield, wingback, or as an out-and-out right-back. This versatility makes him a valuable commodity for TFC going forward if they decide to change from their 3-5-2 to a more regular 4-4-2. He can slot into that right back position in the 4-4-2 or slide into the right wingback/right midfield role if they go back to the 3-5-2.
Two of Hasler’s three goals this season were headers off of beautifully placed balls from Victor Vazquez. The first goal of his MLS career came in just his second MLS game, when he latched on to a cross from Vazquez and put the ball into the bottom right corner.
The next game, Hasler followed that up with what was probably one of the best goals of the season. Off of a cross Hasler found himself open and put the ball toward goal into the top left corner of the net, hitting off the crossbar. His ability to place the ball in such a perfect spot just shows the kind of ability he has and the promise he has to Toronto going forward.
While it was his first season with Toronto, he came at the right time as he ended up becoming an MLS Cup Champion. While he didn’t get much playing time in the playoffs, his success during the season helped TFC get to where they were. If Hasler had goosebumps during his first few games here, wait until he gets to the home opener on March 3rd.Read Time:1 Minute, 51 Second

Mumbai: A group of three men tried to rob a couple at knife point after sneaking into their sixth-floor flat in Juhu area of Vile Parle (West) in early hours of Sunday, but local police reached there in time and nixed their plan. The Juhu police made a move after one of the victims called them at around 5 am. The incident took place on the sixth floor of Umang building on NS Road 9, JVPD scheme, where Alpesh Goliya, 32, lives with his wife. While one of the two accused is their former house help, who the couple had fired, one of his aides is an ex-convict who had just got out of jail after serving his sentence in a theft case. The accused have been identified as Sanjaykumar Jungle Yadav, 19, Pawankumar Mahendra Yadav and Abhishek Lalchand Yadav, 20. The three accused sneaked into the flat from the window and were trying to steal their belongings when the couple heard them and called the police control room. A team was immediately dispatched to the spot. Before the cops could reach the spot, the trio had threatened to kill the couple with a knife, a wooden stick and an iron rod. They managed to steal Rs 6.49 lakh but they couldn’t run away with it as the cops caught them on the door step. The accused also allegedly assaulted the victims, who sustained minor injuries. Sanjay, who had worked as a house help for the couple for over a year, was fired 10 days back after he got into a verbal spat with the couple on not getting advance salary he had demanded for personal reasons. “All of them were produced before a magistrate’s court and remanded to police custody for three days,” said senior police inspector Sunil Ghosalkar of Juhu police station. An FIR has been registered against them under Sections 394 (Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 397 (Robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.), 452 (House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 450 (house trespass to commit crime), 506 (2) (criminal intimidation), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the IPC.]]>TECH BYTE: Make Pictures Perfect with Photo Editing Apps

RIP Bishop Heahmund.
His death on Vikings Season 5 Episode 15 was arguably more impactful than the Seer's, but both characters, in a way, saw their ends coming.
Heahmund renounced his love for Lagertha before the battle to save his soul, but that doesn't mean he died with a clear conscience.
In his final moments, as he was struck blow after blow, he used his last bit of energy to call out for Lagertha.
Unfortunately, she was wounded and unable to get to him, so there was no dying declaration of love.
He renounced his relationship with her out of fear of spending eternity in Hell, but in those final moments, he seemed to regret hurting her.
Whatever his final words would have been, we'll never know.
You can't do this. You can't do this to me, I thought you loved me. You know something? I think you always loved your lord, your God, more than you ever loved me. I don't think you ever did love me. Your soul, whatever that is, meant more to you than I ever could.Lagertha
Lagertha doesn't even have time to mourn his death. She has other problems.
We don't know where she is, but it's probably safe to conclude she's been taken prisoner by King Harald. Considering his next stop was going to be Kattegat, this can not bode well for Lagertha.
Related: Vikings Season 5 Episode 14 Review: The Lost Moment
After losing the battle in Wessex, Harald might want to regroup before attempting to overthrow Ivar, so he may take his time before returning there.
I don't know what Harald's next move is, or what he plans to do with Lagertha, but Bjorn is not going to let it go.
He will most likely demand Alfred help him find her. He wants the lands that were promised to him, but his mother will be his first priority.
The battle was a thing of beauty.
As usual, the camera work and editing made it visually stunning. The cuts between the pre and post-battle scenes, the slow motion, and the music all played a part in ramping up the tension.
Ubbe's battle plan was pure genius.
Tricking Harald into thinking they wanted to make a deal to put him in a compromising position worked like a charm.
They made good use of the catapults, and the wall of fire that kept Harald's army from retreating backward was a great idea.
Ivar has always been known as the best strategist, but Ubbe could give him a run for his money. Alfred told his kingdom that they couldn't have won without their Viking allies, and he's right about that.
I knew then, with a beautiful certainty, that the day and the battle belonged to us! But without our Viking allies, I swear to you, there could be no victory.Alfred
He didn't get to revel in his victory for very long before his mother dropped another bombshell on him. Alfred now knows that his brother, Aethelred, was conspiring against him. What will he do about it?
Alfred would not have survived the battle had his brother not saved his life. He is blood. He is family, and Alfred is a fair, forgiving king. He has to give Aethelred at least a chance to defend himself.

Will Alfred believe him if he pleads with him and tells him he could not go through with the proposed plan? It's the truth, but it doesn't change the fact that Aethelred considered killing his own brother to take his place on the throne.
It's a conundrum, for sure, and Alfred does not want to look weak. Perhaps Alfred will punish his brother but spare his life.
Magnus joined Harald's army and fought against his brothers. Will we continue to see more of him?
I thought he and Bjorn would perhaps team up, but that didn't happen, at least, not yet.
If Lagertha is in Harald's clutches, it would be interesting to see if Magnus helps her. He has a healthy respect for Bjorn and Lagertha, so I could see him playing a part in her rescue/escape.
Related: Explore Hundreds of Hours of Curated Historical Videos with History Vault via Prime Video Channels!
Also, did anyone else find it a little ironic when Magnus proclaimed that soon no one would know the name, Jesus Christ, considering we're watching this the day after Christmas?
It got a chuckle out of me.
Apart from my mother, I've never really known what it is to be loved, or truly love. My father left me outside to die when I was a baby because I was a cripple. Everyone has always treated me first as a cripple. All I ever wanted was for them to love me, but I thought it was impossible, so I was angry with everyone. I've been enraged all my life. Until now.Ivar
Ivar has become obsessed with this notion that he's a god. Honestly, it's getting a little annoying. They are so sure that the baby is going to be a son, what is he going to do if it's a girl?
After killing the Seer, he put on a big show of not resting until they find out what happened to him, but Hvitserk is on to him. He knows Ivar had something to do with his disappearance, and I can't wait to see Hvitserk take his stand.
It's coming; it's just a matter of when.
Hvitserk is about done with Ivar, and the more he prattles on about being a god, the more Hvitserk's skin crawls.
He's getting pushed to the edge, and when he blows, it's going to be something to see.
Thankfully, we were given a reprieve from Floki's adventures in Iceland. Did anyone miss him?

- Pre paid insurance as at 31.12.2016 is Rs. 2 000
Note
Insurance is prepaid by Rs. 2 000. Hence, we should deduct the prepaid amount of Rs. 2 000 from the balance in the trial balance (Rs. 12 000 – 2 000 = Rs. 10 000). As a result, Rs. 10 000 becomes the annual relevant insurance expense amount for the year 2016. We should enter this amount in the profit or loss statement under the administration expense category. Then we need to enter the prepaid amount of Rs. 2 000 in the statement of financial position under the current assets section as a prepaid expense is a current asset.I’m not a fan of fundraising campaigns that promise privacy, but when the funding goal is not reached, then the campaign keeps all the funds with no product delivered. Yet not everyone trying to raise money for a project will succeed, not all failed projects keep the funds, and you can’t please everyone all the time. The insanely popular Anonabox router has raised a crazy amount of money, but some Redditers are not pleased about Anonabox claims that the hardware was custom-designed and open source.
Basically, it’s plug-n-play flavored privacy via a tiny router that encrypts and routes all the users’ web traffic via the Tor anonymizing network.
The Kickstarter campaign starts off with: “The anonabox is an open source embedded networking device designed specifically to run Tor. It's 100% Open Source.” The developers claim to have been working on Anonabox for four years with examples of the four prototypes pictured on Kickstarter. It later claims, “No more backdoors! The anonabox provides better security than most available products because it is completely open source, and open hardware.”
Yet Redditer htilonom claimed that the Anonabox Tor router was a “false representation, possibly even a scam” and the startup was basically “reselling Chinese devices.” Side-by-side comparisons pointed out by htilonom are disturbing as the hardware does appear to be available off the shelf. For example, the “mini WiFi router” in the top image is selling on AliExpress as WT3020; the router in the bottom image is a close-up of Anonabox posted on its site.
Then there’s the circuit board comparison as pointed out by htilonom via cstyves.
When the comparison was pointed out to Anonabox developer August Germar during his Reddit AMA, Germar replied:
Nice! Yes honestly that does look like the same circuit board. I can't help but wonder if the factory that we sourced is going to try to sell them too. It seems pretty common in the electronics industry and that’s fine. I've never seen that photo before now, but if that is the case good for them! We have not invented anything and there are no patents on anything. We want to encourage people to make their own if they so desire because that’s what makes this project fun.
Other Redditers claim that Anonabox is basically saying, “Pay us $45 for a Tor router that is already available for $18 retail.” Yet Germar told the Daily Dot, “The device’s circuit boards were designed by an electrical engineer based on anonabox’s specifications, and that the company ‘found out tonight that there is at least one hardware product that is very similar, but… What makes the anonabox do what it does is the software and configuration’.”
That code has not yet been analyzed by the Tor Project community or other interested third-party security minds. If it does what it claims, basically plug it into your router for instant anonymous surfing, then that’s a good thing. It’s so portable that it’s “small enough to hide two in a pack of cigarettes.” Under the heading of “built for civil disobedience,” Germar told Wired the device could be hidden in a bodily orifice. “Maybe it’s too late and the police are already downstairs, so you smash the box with a brick and throw the pieces out the window. Or maybe you just crush it by stepping on it with your shoe and flush the pieces down the toilet.”
After the “misrepresentation of ‘custom’ hardware” stink started on Reddit, Wired, which reported on the custom hardware, reached out to Germar again.
In a follow-up.
Anonabox likely could bring Tor to an audience that has never used it and might be too tech-squeamish to setup Onion Pi or other little devices for “Web Security Everywhere.” Funding pledges are still pouring in for the project, so it’s not like Anonabox has been shot down in flames. Yet some tech-savvy folks are worried that if the open source hardware claims are not true, will the other “promises” made on Kickstarter prove to be false too?
If you don’t like it, then don’t fund it. If you funded it and are sorry you did so, then “Manage your pledge” and withdraw your funding via “Cancel pledge.” If you feel like Anonabox is making false claims, or violates the Kickstarter rule that “projects can’t mislead or misrepresent the facts,” then report it to Kickstarter. If you see nothing wrong it, then make a pledge to support the tiny Tor router. Or you could do nothing and attempt other methods to evade government surveillance and to protect your privacy.Fish mongers filleting cutting table bench stainless steel sea and salmon fishing

Around 80 per cent of the total commercial fleet in India is leased against 53 per cent of the same, globally
Driven by a rising greenback and possible dollar-purchases by nationalised banks, the rupee suddenly turned weak on Tuesday, slipping to an intra-day low of 73.46 against the dollar. On Wednesday, the rupee pared some of its losses from the previous day but continued trading below the 73 level, ending FY21 with gain of 3.3 per cent against the dollar.
Two days ago, the rupee was the best performer among its emerging markets peers and had been the only currency reflecting a positive return on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. The up-move was supported by strong foreign portfolio investor (FPI) inflows into equity markets as well as a possible pause in the Reserve Bank of India’s dollar-buying spree in the quarter.
A report by IFA Global said the nationalised banks were persistently on the bid, likely on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. ‘Correcting recent rupee over-valuation, especially against the yuan, and securing a higher USD/INR rate as on financial year-end could possibly have been the twin motives of the central bank. The up-move further triggered the unwinding of short USD/INR carry positions.’ the report said.
The central bank continued to shore up its forex reserves till early 2021 following which India’s forex reserves touched a record high of $590.185 billion by the end of January, according to Bloomberg data. Later, however, the forex reserves figure stagnated close to the $580-billion levels.
Experts pointed out that the RBI is likely to have stopped buying dollars in the spot market over the last two months and this could have provided a boost to the currency, especially at a time when foreign investors were buying into equities.
Anindya Banerjee, Vice-President at Kotak Securities, confirms that the central bank may have intervened and purchased close to $160 billion between June 2020 and February 2021, via spot, futures, and forwards which he believes could be a record level of intervention. “As long as the intervention was via the spot market, it was effective. However, once the RBI switched to forwards, it caused the forward premium to rise, thereby incentivising carry trade in a huge way,” he added.
Strong inflows from FPIs have also contributed to the rise in rupee over the last few months. Since January, FPIs have infused over $7 billion on a net basis into Indian equity markets although they have been net sellers in the bond market to the tune of over $2 billion.
The significant fund flows into Indian equities over the last two months may not continue for long and that could have an impact on the currency.
MS Gopikrishnan, independent market expert, said usually the last quarter of the fiscal year is the best one for rupee from a trade deficit point of view. “We are just crossing that period and also entering a period of uncertainties in FPI flows on the back of higher US rates; these factors can put pressure on the rupee against the dollar. I expect the pair to move towards 74 in the coming weeks,” GopikrishnanHello everyone, I am new to this site and I hope someone can help with my problem, my P50S601 stopped working blue light blinks 3 times, no picture, wont shut off without unplugging. replaced swollen caps on the power board check the buffer boards (visual) unplugged one board at a time, unplugged x-sus board all with no luck.

Karma & Desire
About this item
As we all struggle to deal with the sorry state of Earthly affairs, Darren Cunningham answers the Batcall and returns with a brand new Actress LP on usual haunt Ninja Tune. The producer recently resurfaced with his self released mixtape '88', a sparse and stripped back set of low slung house crunch, electro madness and uncompromising techno coated in a thick patina of fuzz and feedback. 'Karma & Desire' then is a comparatively expansive and accessible affair, replete with vocal contributions from the likes of Sampha, Zsela, Aura T-09 and Christel Well.
Billed as “a romantic tragedy set between the heavens and the underworld", the set serves us a string of retro-ist house and techno heaters, balancing a fragile beauty, in the form of soulful vocals or delicate keys, with the grit and growl of hissing drum machines and gnarly basslines. Naturally Darren avoids playing with a straight bat, twisting the traditional styles with the chopped and screwed sound design he excels at. If singles and stompers are your thing, look to "Angels Pharmacy", "Loveless" and the meditative closer "Walking Flames", but really this album works best when enjoyed in its entirety.

Not MentionedHarare –.
The Robert Mugabe University project was announced just three months before the Zimbabwe military launched a soft coup last November, and a week later Mugabe retired as parliament began procedures to impeach him.
Former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who had been sacked from his post a month earlier, was then sworn into office.
Higher and Tertiary Education minister Amon Murwira, appointed by Mnangagwa, told NewsDay newspaper in Harare this week, that the Mugabe university “was not a priority.” He said the government was looking at supporting university projects in other parts of the country.
The cabinet approved the proposed Mugabe university after the project was launched by the so-called G40 faction within Zanu PF which was heavily supported by former first lady Grace Mugabe.
The university was due to be built on Mugabe property in the Mazowe district, about 40 km west of Harare, in the heart of Grace Mugabe’s farming empire.
It is here, in this district, that Grace Mugabe has, since 2002, launched several projects including construction of two large and expensive schools, more than 30 houses, and an orphanage. She rebuilt and expanded a sophisticated dairy, and also runs several well-equipped, sophisticated commercial farms all of which were taken from whites and a local black-owned company.
The two-storey schools were officially opened by Robert Mugabe in 2013, and are named after his wife, Grace.
Earlier this year the education ministry ceased paying about $160 000 subsidies for 18 students for mathematics and science studies at the Grace Mugabe high school, saying it would no longer fund extra tuition for pupils at private schools and would divert the cash to public schools.
The schools Grace Mugabe built, one senior and one for primary school learners, charge about R40 000 fees per term. In April the schools’ administrators said it had 19 teachers between the two schools, but admitted its pupil numbers were reducing since Mugabe left office.
The schools have other extra expenses to cope with, as the police, which used to guard all the Mugabe family’s properties, including the schools, were withdrawn shortly after Mnangagwa was sworn into office. So now the schools have to provide their own security.
After he was pushed from power, Robert Mugabe’s eldest nephew, Leo, said his uncle was looking forward to becoming a full-time farmer, and he praised Grace Mugabe. “I like the spirit she has … she is with him all the time. She is an amazing person. She wants to continue planning the Robert Mugabe University so they have something to do.”
It has never been clear where Grace Mugabe secured cash or loans for her expensive projects and for other properties she bought in Zimbabwe recently and her R43 million home she bought in Sandhurst, Johannesburg last year.Apple Cider Floats are made with delicious vanilla ice cream, Apple Cider and a dash of cinnamon which makes a tasty cool drink that is perfect for warm fall days.
Apple Cider Floats
One of my favorites parts of fall time is all the delicious fall time food. Although you can buy apple cider in most stores all year long nothing compares to the taste when having a cool glass in the fall. These Apple Cider Floats are a delicious twist on the summer time favorite Root Beer Floats. We added some vanilla bean ice cream and a dash of cinnamon and we couldn’t eat it fast enough! You can also add a drizzle of hot caramel syrup if you wanted.
We have a few local pumpkin patches near us that make their own apple cider and apple cider donuts ( yum!)and while store bought apple cider works in a pinch there just isn’t anything that tastes better than apple cider made directly from the farm!
How to make delicious Apple Cider Floats
- Gather your mason jars and your favorite vanilla ice cream. We like vanilla bean ice cream the best 🙂 Fill your glass jars halfway with ice cream.
- Pour apple cider on top of your ice cream until it is covered.
- Top with another scoop of ice cream and a dash of cinnamon.
- Enjoy!

These look delicious! Apple cider is one of my favorite parts of fall and I love that this is a cool version because at the rate the weather’s changing in San Diego, I won’t be drinking warm cider until Christmas!
Melissa Belanger says
Yum! This is such a great idea! I love fall things, but sometimes it’s just too hot for them. This is the perfect solution 🙂
Katie says
Thanks! Fall is my favorite time of year and favorite time to bake 🙂Thoughts for the Day

The bottom line is, it is really hard to the buy box if you are just starting out as a seller. So what is this buy box? When browsing on Amazon, customers who navigate to a product’s main page and click on the “offers” links below the product description (as indicated by the red circle on the screenshot below) will be able to have a look at the total number of sellers who are offering a certain product. The thing is that since multiple sellers are allowed to sell the same product, you are all competing for the buy box as well. And, if there are more sellers for a particular product then you are going to have a tough time getting that sweet, sweet spot. Nearly 70% of the total business on Amazon happens on the buy box, so you should pay attention to this.
Here are a few things that Amazon wants you to know if you want that revered box:
- You need to price your products competitively. Customers tend to buy prodcuts which have a low price.
- Watch your competition to stay competitive. View the price of the offer that is currently winning the Buy Box. On the Manage Inventory page, you can click on Preferences button, and select Show when available for the current Buy Box winning price. Buy Box winning prices are displayed for “New” condition listings only.
Availability
- Keep stock available. If you have no current stock for a product, you cannot win the Buy Box. Use inventory planning best practices to keep your popular products in stock.
- Update your inventory. Customers who submit orders for products that are not in stock are likely to leave negative feedback, especially around the holidays. To ensure that buyers cannot place orders for out-of-stock items, keep your inventory updated.
- Plan vacations. If you are going on vacation, make sure that customers are not left waiting for orders to arrive. See Listings Status for more information.
Fulfillment
- Offer multiple shipping options on your products, including free shipping. You can manage your available shipping options in Shipping Settings.
Customer service
- Customer service is measured in numerous ways. Excelling in all areas can help you succeed on Amazon. The Account Health page on the Performance link can help you track your customer metrics.

A recent dumpster dive netted me a Vision Engineering Mantis Microscope. The Mantis will be extremely useful for soldering SMD parts and general PCB assembly and repair. I was lucky that the objectives had been thrown out with the unit, a 4X and 8X objective. I am unable to find the model number of this Mantis but it is not a new microscope. The Mantis had not aged well, small cracks are appearing in the plastic housing and the mounting bracket is broken into unusable plastic scrap.Read More Mantis Microscope RepairWord's out on little tunny
captain rUSTY CHINNIS | SUn
Captain Rick Grassett poses for a photo before releasing.
No sooner had we uttered those words when baitfish started to show on the surface followed by diving birds and striking fish. Running to the nearest feeding frenzy we cut the motor twenty yards away and launched small clousers into the melee. Almost immediately Grassett's line came tight as a little tunny inhaled the fly. The fish bolted in a burst of speed that makes little tunny such a sought after target. Grassett's rod bent deeply as he applied pressure in an attempt to slow the fish's run as backing disappeared from his spool. The gamey fish would have nothing of it and ran another twenty yards of backing into the depths of the channel. After several more runs and a battle near the boat I was able to grab the little tunny's tail and swing it into the boat for a quick picture. As quickly as we could we launched the fast swimming fish into the bay to give it a head start.
After the first fish we found them challenging to intercept. Fish were exploding everywhere, but more often than not they would sound before we could get flies into the carnage. This is a common experience but we knew to run up to a school as fast as possible and make casts before they sounded. Employing that technique we were able to catch four little tunny each and several mackerel before we decided to try the beaches on our return south.
We didn't find any action on the return to Longboat, but we had a great day of action and were content to enjoy a smooth ride home in the Gulf. Little tunny should be in local waters until cold spells send them south. That's a lot of time to enjoy some spectacular action. If you go, look for birds and breaking fish along the Gulf Coast. Small flies and spoons that mimic the baitfish work best. Now is the time to enjoy some of the hottest rod bending action of the year!Manufacturer of packaging sheet.

Hey everyone! How was your weekend? I wish it was longer.
Anyway, I'm trying to get back to my regular weekly comic postings but it has been ridiculously hard as my schedule gets wonkier and wonkier each passing day. Hence, a short comic this time round.
Enjoy. For 2 seconds.
As a kid, my parents never let me own a gaming console and I longed for one for the longest time. I would usually go to my friend's house just to get a chance at playing video games. As I grew up and had the capacity to earn my own money, it was like a dream come true but then it was short lived.
Yep. Nowadays, I hardly even have the time to play video games and I have so many uncompleted and even unopened games lying in my house. My gaming console has essentially become a dust collector. Is this what growing up means?
I miss you my Playstation.
I shall find time to enjoy you once again. *cue sarcastic laughter*

Author, Malcolm Gladwell has a great story that illustrates how an 'underdog' can lean in and leverage what they've got.
This one relates to 'Full Court Press'.
"... Ranadivé decided to coach his daughter Anjali’s basketball .This was National Junior Basketball - the Little League of basketball. The team was made up mostly of twelve-year-olds...
...Nicky, Angela, Dani, Holly, Annika, and his own daughter, Anjali, had never played the game before. They weren’t all that tall. They couldn’t shoot. They weren’t particularly adept at dribbling. ....” Urban dictionary.com defines full court press as: "... to agressively put the moves on, ...To not give up on trying to get someone until you actually get them."
Think about full court press in relation to your studies ...
You may perceive them bigger than you?!
There not! Not really!
Put the moves on...and dont stop trying till you get it.
Like Ranadivé's daughter, there are no set characteristics you need. Just do you! As you continue to give it all you've got, answer this...

Girl wants to be a painter, like her parents and grandparents, yet cant quite paint. Girl wants to be an actress, but has a bit of a lisp and blushes too readily. Girl meets camera, Girl falls in love with camera, and the rest is history.
That was about 25 years ago and I haven't put a camera down since.
One of the most interesting things I find about photographers personal stories are the very varied paths that lead them to this place. Essentially you can study, read, teach yourself, work for others, work in labs, produce shoots, manage studios, test shoot or just work for free - and all because you love it.
So really this is just a story about Love.
As a married type, and a mother of two busy little kids, I know a thing or two about Love. I also know how incredibly fast paced our lives increasingly become, and how moments can just be too fleeting. I work very hard to catch them! My lovely clients always report to me that I blend in, feel like one of the guests, and make everyone at ease, while still capturing beautifully all of those moments that fly by.
With a background in documentary photography, a personal art practice, and 20 years of experience in Fashion, Advertising and Portraiture I apply all of these approaches and styles in your wedding documentation.

The starts of the routes on the main section of the Old Redoubt cliff are tidal and calm sea conditions are required for the approach traverse to the base of the Old Redoubt. Rainbow Bridge is non-tidal but requires a calm sea. The routes are often in condition, although they can be guano-covered in places immediately after the bird-ban has finished. Seepage does occur after prolonged periods of wet weather. The sea conditions are often benign, the bay being sheltered from westerly swell or winds.

It is important that climbers wanting to deepwater solo on these crags MUST call Brixham Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre on (01803) 882 704 before descending to the base of the cliffs. Climbers have caused a number of false call outs in the past - this creates significant problems for the rescue service and may jepordise future access on the Nature Reserve. problematic as you must NOT get out at the Great Cave ledge (doing so would disturb the nesting birds). Those concerned by this should opt to abseil in (see b above) - doing this allows you to leave a rope through the in-situ thread at the base of the abseil to facilitate pulling out of the sea....or make the big swim to the ‘ Red Walls’ area.

Two activities Wisconsinites missed over the past year and a half: Festivals and drinking beer together.
Milwaukee's Third Space Brewing is helping out with both — by hosting its fifth installment of Wisconsin IPA Fest on Aug. 28.
"Beer is all about bringing people together," said Andy Gehl, Third Space co-founder and president. "Coming together in our beer garden at Third Space to sample IPAs, I can't think of a better event for the summer."
The fest plans to feature about 50 breweries exclusively from Wisconsin, including Milwaukee's Lakefront Brewery and Eagle Park Brewing Company, Waukesha's Raised Grain Brewing Co., Beloit's G5 Brewing Company and Madison's Working Draft Beer Company.
"We thought this was a chance to really showcase great hoppy beers made right here," Gehl said.
Last year, the fest went virtual during the coronavirus pandemic. Participants picked up 12-packs (one drink from each participating brewery) curbside at Third Space in August. Then, there was a Zoom event with representatives from each brewery walking people through their IPAs. About 400 people participated.
"It was a successful event as far as virtual events go, but not quite the same as getting together in one place and sampling IPAs together," Gehl said.
What to expect at the 2021 fest
The 2021 festival will have more beer and fewer restrictions than in past years, Gehl said.
Previously, each brewery brought one IPA and guests purchased sample tickets to try them.
This year, samples are unlimited and each brewery will bring about three IPAs and one non-IPA.
One brewery will be named the 2021 "Best Wisconsin IPA" and receive the coveted miniature fermentation tank trophy. Each brewery gets to submit one IPA into the competition and send one judge. Attendees will be able to get into the action, too, by voting on a "People's Choice" winner.
During a typical year, the event has drawn between 800 and 1,000 people, Gehl said. This year, tickets will be limited to 850 total.
"Early bird" general admission tickets cost $49, and include "all the IPAs you can responsibly sample," a limited edition Wisconsin IPA pint glass, and a 2021 Wisconsin IPA Fest sticker. The "early bird" special ends July 9, which is when general admission tickets become $59.
VIP tickets, which are limited to 100 total, cost $99, and include a take-home four-pack of the 2021 Wisconsin IPA Fest Collaboration IPA between Third Space and Raised Grain (the People's Choice winner from 2020), early entry at 1 p.m., a 2021 Wisconsin IPA Fest event T-shirt, access to a VIP lounge with extra seating, shade and a private bar with special VIP-only IPAs.
RELATED:Milwaukee's Third Space Brewing is launching a beer fund, so teachers can drink free beer this summer
If attendees need sustenance to soak up some of that booze, there will be food available for purchase from local food trucks.
There will also be a screen printer on hand making shirts with different Wisconsin IPA Fest designs and color options. Each shirt will cost $25.
The event will run from 2 to 5 p.m. Aug. 28 at Third Space's beer garden, located at 1505 W. Saint Paul Ave.

The beginning, the middle, and the end. Traditionally, this is why stories are broken down into three acts. There are six parts of a story contained within these three segments: Act I 1. Introduction. 2. Rising Action. Act II 3. Complications. 4. Crisis. Act III 5. Climax. 6. Resolution. The beginning (Act I) has three goals. The first goal is to get the ball rolling by introducing the main characters, & the setting they are in. The second goal is to hook your audience with something that is exciting and interesting. The third goal in the start of a story is to introduce the villain and the main story goal. 3. One of the marks of an amateur Storyteller is to use up a large part of the early story introducing characters. 4 5. 6 A good character will always have some level of internal conflict.

'My Long Trip Home' A Memoir Of Mixed Heritage
In his memoir, My Long Trip Home, Mark Whitaker explores the lives of his parents. They came from vastly different backgrounds, and their interracial relationship helped shape Whitaker's own life. Host Audie Cornish talks with Whitaker, who is executive vice president and managing editor of CNN Worldwide, about growing up biracial during a key turning point in this country's history.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
In his memoir, "My Long Trip Home," Mark Whitaker explores the lives of his parents, two people from vastly different backgrounds, and how their interracial relationship and histories helped shape his own life. Mark Whitaker is now managing editor for CNN Worldwide, and he's in our studios in New York to talk more about his memoir. Mark Whitaker, welcome to the program.
MARK WHITAKER: Hi, Audie.
CORNISH: Now, your story centers on the story of your parents and their marriage, which I read you called it doubly scandalous. So, set the stage for us. Describe who these two people were at the time of their wedding.
WHITAKER: Well, my parents met in the mid-1950s when interracial marriage was actually still illegal in most states in America. My father was an undergraduate, in fact, the only black male student on campus at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. And my mother was a professor there, a professor of French. And they fell in love. And because they were both an interracial couple and a student-teacher couple, they carried on an affair in secret for a year and a half until he graduated, and then got married that summer.
CORNISH: Is this the kind of story that you found out after the fact or was this always part of the mythology that you understood about your parents?
WHITAKER: Well, you know, I knew some of the details. My parents only remained married for seven years. They got divorced when I was six, and a lot of the story is about what happened after they split up and we went to live with my mother. But it was only in going back and talking to her but also finding a lot of letters that she and my father had written to each other and to others that I discovered a lot of the really emotionally wrenching details.
CORNISH: I want to get a little bit more into the story that you just talked about, the fact that your parents did divorce. And this had a profound effect on you.
WHITAKER: Yes, that's right. My mother, first of all, was almost denied tenure at Swarthmore after the president found out about her relationship with my father. She ultimately, some civil rights leaders - Byard Rustin among others - got involved and she was granted tenure. But a few years later she gave it up to follow my father. He had gone on to become the first black graduate student in the department of politics at Princeton University, where he got his doctorate, and that's where everything fell apart. What I discovered was that when they moved to Princeton, they both started to drink much more heavily. It became sort of the beginning, I think, of what ultimately became my father's alcoholism. I found out that my father, you know, was involved with all of these other women and sort of this open marriage scene. I discovered that my parents had really started to fight quite bitterly about all of this during this period. And his first big tenure track opportunity was at UCLA. So, when I was just about to turn five - my younger brother was three - they packed us up and moved us out to Los Angeles, and that's where everything fell apart.
CORNISH: Essentially, you unleash your formidable reporting skills on your own family, and a lot of the book reads like not a news story but it had that very sort of anecdotal feel.
WHITAKER: Well, my parents both came from such interesting worlds. My father had grown up in Pittsburgh, the son of two black undertakers, both my grandfather and my grandmother. My mother had come to America from occupied France in 1940 on a boat with other refugee children. It's a very personal story and a family story, but with a backdrop of a lot of interesting history.
CORNISH: How did your parents end up reacting to you coming to them about wanting to write a book and making their story the center of it?
WHITAKER: Well, I approached both of them and said if I were to do this would you cooperate with me? And it was interesting - they each had very characteristic responses. My mother said, oh dear. She said, I'm afraid the story would make me look weak. And my father said, I'll talk to you under one condition. He said, I don't want to be the villain of the piece. But ultimately, you know, I was busy. I was editing Newsweek and, you know, I just didn't know if I really had the stomach to take on the project. And then my father died two days after Thanksgiving in the middle of the night. A year later on the very same day, I woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning with just this blinding epiphany that I was ready to write the story now. And I literally got up in the middle of the night and got my laptop computer and started writing down memories. And I did that for probably a couple of weeks. But then I realized that there was just so much that I didn't know. There were huge gaps. And so I said, you know, I had to do some reporting, and I sort of became obsessed with finding out as much as I could.
CORNISH: Mark Whitaker, it's clear that you've learned a tremendous amount about your parents. What now have you determined that you've learned about yourself?
WHITAKER: Well, I thought that I was making my way in the world by doing everything my parents didn't. But what I discovered is that a lot of the qualities that had made me successful actually I had in one way or the other inherited from my parents. Stories of survival and perseverance but also a love of learning, of writing that went back to my grandparents. So, there are a lot of these things that I thought that I had discovered on my own that in fact had deep roots. And, you know, I was happy to learn that actually.
CORNISH: Mark Whitaker. He's managing editor for CNN Worldwide, and his memoir is called "My Long Trip Home." Thank you so much for speaking with us.
WHITAKER: It's been a pleasure.

CORNISH:.Using signatures in Outlook
A signature is a predefined text that is automatically added to the bottom of the e-mails you send. It should be short - preferably no longer than 4 lines - and it usually contains contact information.
One of the strengths of Microsoft Outlook is the ability to handle multiple signatures. In this tutorial we show you how to set signatures both in Norwegian and English, as well as using a short version of the signature.
Create a signature
1. Open the File menu. Click Options in the left column. Select Mail, and then click Signatures.
2. Click New to create a new signature.
3. Give your signature a name, such as Norwegian (if you are also going to have a signature in English) or Internal (if you want to use a different signature to e-mail you send internally and externally).
Type what you want as the signature in the Edit signature field. If you have multiple accounts, verify that the correct account appears in the E-mail account field. If you are only going to have one signature, select it in the dropdown menu for the New messages field.
If you later want to create a signature for use in response to e-mail you have received or e-mail you are forwarding, create it and select it in the Replies / forward field. If you have multiple signatures you want to switch between using, do not select anything in the New messages or Replies / forward field.
If you create multiple signatures, you can choose which one you want from the Signature button in the toolbar. From here you can also choose Signatures to create new signatures, or delete / change the signatures you already have.

Please choose colorIt is really very challenging to compare one virtual private network or VPN with another, especially if you are new and not aware of the technical jargons that are used commonly. Both IPVanish and NordVPN are the most popular VPN services, but when it comes to choosing the best amongst them you need to compare its specifications, reliability, compatibility, speed, and connections thoroughly to find the real winner.
So, to make things easier for you here is the simple comparison guide of IPVanish vs NordVPN which you must consider to find which VPN is the best for your specific need.
IPVanish vs NordVPN: Important Comparisons
1. Security Data
In terms of security, both IPVanish and NordVPN are head to head. One has more protocols than the other and not all are relevant for average users. Both the VPN services offer OpenVPN which is considered to be the secured and safest security protocol. However, there is a small difference which may matter most of the users. NordVPN is strategically located in Panama which is far away from the date retention laws and from the authorities known for snooping. This is the reason why they don’t need to cooperate with these entities.
On the other hand, IPVanish is situated in America and according to the law, they are restricted from saving or storing the user logs. So, when the government asks for user information, they would have nothing to handle the authorities. But in the end, both VPNs have better security protocols, but NordVPN is a bit more advantageous because its location adds a layer of protection.
2. Best Features
This is the most crucial part of this IPVanish vs NordVPN comparison as it gives you an insight into major differences. Both the VPNs offer the much needed tool called Switch Kill and DNS Leak Protection. These features were integrated into a bit to enhance security in both the VPN servers in different ways. IPVanish VPN comes with a free Nat Firewall which is chargeable with all other service providers. This VPN also comes with the ability to block the LAN traffic which is the great addition to its feature, Kill Switch. This feature enables the users to control VPN when the PC connects to internet services.
NordVPN also excels in offering great features, of which the most popular is the ability to update the software regularly. It introduces new tools frequently which help in updating the software. There are also other features which enhance the anonymity like Double VPN or double encryption, protection from malware and bots and more. So, the real winner in terms of features is NordVPN because they have gone the extra mile to make users safe.
3. Speed
There is no much difference in terms of connection speed of both IPVanish and NordVPN. Both the VPNs have performed optimally when the speed test was conducted. But, IPVanish has a very small advantage in speed connection comparison as it managed to maintain 97% of the internet connection. NordVPN achieves the same speed with 95% of internet connection and it was conducted with no VPN connection.
The matter of fact is that every VPN would consume some internet speed because the encryption eats the resources and hence the speed is affected. Both the servers have very minimal impact on speed and it is very impressing indeed. Most of the VPNs out there consume larger chunk of internet speed, but with these two VPNs, fastest speed is recorded.
5. Locations & Servers
In this part of IPVanish vs NordVPN comparison, both the VPNs had a very close fight. Both the VPNs have the servers in the same number of nations, but NordVPN has a small benefit as it has several servers for each nation. Since the number of server locations of both the VPNs is same, the winner actually depends on where the users are located.
You are required to understand the fact that it is always secure to connect to the server in another nation, but ensure that it close to you for better performance. This will prevent speed loss. Keeping this in mind you must always check the list of servers of each provider and always try to connect to the server that is close to your country or within your country.
5. Devices & Connections
The feature of simultaneous connections is really excellent in IPVanish and NordVPN. You can have 10 simultaneous connections with IPVanish, while with NordVPN you can have 6 connections simultaneously. This is more than most of the providers out there. One single account is sufficient for protecting all devices of one single user simultaneously. However, it can do a lot more things than this. The allowed connections in these VPNs are sufficient for protecting 6-7 family members at the same time with a single VPN account. This is really a great move by both these VPNs. For NordVPN you can add one more connection to make it six, but with IPVanish you can add up to 10 connections.
Besides great connections, both the VPNs are compatible with the major operating systems and devices including Smart TVs, Mac OS, Android, iOS, Windows OS and Linus OS.
6. Subscription Prices
Both the VPNs have regular plans and there is no difference. But when you check the discounts offered by both the service providers there is a major change in prices. NordVPN is offering about 75% off discount on their 3 years plan and they also offer 30 days money back guarantee against 7 days money back guarantee of IPVanish. So, here NordVPN is the clear winner as it offers great deal for an extended period of 3 years.
IPVanish vs NordVPN – Which is Better?
When you check the IPVanish vs NordVPN comparison, you will see in some areas IPVanish excels, while in some areas NordVPN outperforms. The in the majority of areas NordVPN is considered the best choice. From the location of the company to added features of increased security are impressive and to add more the company offers up to 75% of discount on its 3 years plan. Although IPVanish VPN had put up a tough fight, the real winner in this comparison is NordVPN.LightingQuick Links: About - Categories - Products

BookmarksHealthcare. Part 4 in a series about five themes in which the three universities and two medical centres are conducting AI-related research.
‘People, professionals and society as a whole are increasingly confronted with it: artificial intelligence in or around health and healthcare. Our health is the area that stands to gain most from artificial intelligence.’ These are the words of Alessandro Bozzon, who as Professor of Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence researches a wide range of AI applications. He is Head of the Department of Sustainable Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and conducts research into smart cities, among other things. ‘AI helps gain a richer picture based on data.’
Support rather than replace
This applies to an MRI scan or other diagnostic methods, but equally to the layout of a city. What, for example, are the best green spaces for an older population? AI can also help plan care so that scarce operating theatre staff are used as efficiently as possible. Bozzon emphasises that AI will never replace humans in healthcare. ‘It only supports them. The machine helps the human to function, and vice versa.’
As health is such a wide topic, the participants in this theme distinguish between five focus areas:
- AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery and Life Sciences
- AI-Assisted Population Health Improvement
- AI-Assisted Healthcare Teams
- Human-AI Partnership in Hospital and Home
- AI-Assisted Healthcare Systems.
Unafraid of sharing ideas
In general, scientists will always manage to find one another when it comes to fruitful collaboration, says Gerard van Westen. He is Professor of AI and Medicinal Chemistry in Leiden and has been conducting multidisciplinary research in the field of AI-assisted drug development for a few years now. ‘Existing networks mean we can act fast and aren’t afraid to share ideas. We don’t see colleagues from other institutes as competitors.’
However, Van Westen adds, it can make a refreshing change to meet new people within the Zuid-Holland universities and see how you can take each other and the field forward. ‘Leiden has a lot of expertise in the field of chemistry and small molecules. Delft is way ahead with automation and robotics, and Erasmus has lots of valuable patient datasets that AI systems can learn from. And it’s been great to get to know Catholijn Jonker, for instance. Great person! She sees opportunities and has a fresh outlook,’ say Van Westen about this Delft professor of hybrid intelligence.
The soft side is essential
Within the AI and health focus group, there is plenty of room for the ‘softer side’ in the form of social sciences. That is a development that Moniek Buijzen is seeing more often. She is Professor of Behavioural Change at Erasmus University Rotterdam. ‘We behavioural scientists are now being involved in projects from the outset, and that provides opportunities. It prevents you from finding out afterwards that an innovation doesn’t suit the users at all.’
On the other hand, Buijzen can see her field becoming increasingly ‘hard’. She uses the algorithms that social media uses to serve people up with what they find interesting. ‘If you manage to create the right buzz online with, for example, fun challenges that encourage healthy behaviour... Then you’ll really get somewhere!’
Gigantic marketing budgets
Buijzen cleverly turns things around. If marketing and influencers can seduce us to do anything, can they also seduce people into healthy behaviour? It is difficult to compete with the gigantic marketing budgets in the food industry and the enormous influence of advertising on children, but she’s plugging away at it anyway. What role do influential children have in a class or neighbourhood and how can you use them to promote healthy behaviour?
Below are a few examples of the work of each of the three professors: AI-related research in health
TU Delft - Alessandro Bozzon
Superb land-registry data shows where 1.5m distancing was difficult
In 2020 we suddenly had to keep 1.5m apart from others. Decisionmakers who were responsible for public spaces had a problem: where should they adopt measures and which ones? Where is it difficult to maintain this distance and where are the hotspots where people gather?
Artificial intelligence offered a solution, says Alessandro Bozzon. ‘It only works if you have lots of good data, and that’s what we had. The land registry has superb data about roads and narrow pavements as well as about restaurants and other places where people gather. This allowed us to simulate mobility and calculate the likelihood of problems occurring at location X.’
This is how knowledge about the environment can help develop a smart city, one of Bozzon’s focal points. ‘You can also use such a system to see to what extent it’s possible for people in a certain city to take a daily walk in the fresh air. Is there enough green space near every house for such a walk? Where should we intervene? Plenty of data is available from the land registry or Statistics Netherlands (CBS). If we make good use of this, it can help improve people’s health.’
Erasmus University Rotterdam - Moniek Buijzen
Healthy young people from deprived areas give the whole neighbourhood a boost
Houses with mould growing on the walls. In deprived neighbourhoods people live much unhealthier lives than they do elsewhere, and young people are less happy and healthy. Moniek Buijzen wants to help tackle the extreme differences in health in the Netherlands. ‘Despite their poor circumstances, some young people manage to lead a good life. How do they do so?’ The answer can help others.
On the Planet Rock project, which VU Amsterdam and Leiden University are also participating in, young people and data analysis with AI techniques have taken a leading role even. The researchers hold meetings with young people from disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Their main questions are: What does a healthy lifestyle mean to you? What should you focus on? Who are examples to you? Activity trackers and data on the physical, social and cultural environment of these young people also help gain a clear picture on what the situation is and what needs to change.
Sometimes you find you can’t go straight for your goal, says Buijzen. ‘From a session on healthy eating behaviour, but also from the perspective of well-being, it became clear that young people struggle with feeling unsafe and unsure on the street and have a negative self-image from social media. We elaborated on this: it makes little sense to promote oranges to a target group that is concerned about their safety on the street.’
Leiden University - Gerard van Westen
Not linear but circular: a new way to develop drugs
His ambition: a virtual human being, consisting of algorithms that predict what an administered substance does in our body. Gerard van Westen is already well on the way. He is developing a system based on millions of measurements that have been made into how substance X reacts to body protein Y. This data is teaching an algorithm to predict how other potentially effective chemical structures would respond to the thousands of relevant proteins in the body. This is an enormous help to drug developers. ‘You know which direction to look for a good drug.’
Each part of the drug discovery chain is already supported by AI. From developing possible medicinal substances that can then be tested in a petri dish, animals and humans to personalised predictions of what the side-effects might be once the drug is actually in use. There is automatic data analysis, robot synthesis, safety prediction and much more.
Once the chain has been completed and a new drug is on the market, this too provides new data for Van Westen’s virtual human. New information on how the new drug reacts with all the relevant proteins in the body is added to his model, and its predictions become even better. These in turn make the start of the drug discovery chain – making molecules that might be effective – more efficient. ‘This means that drug development is no longer linear but circular. With artificial intelligence in the middle of the circle.’
Five themes packed with AI research in Zuid-Holland
This article is part four in a series showing how research and teaching with or into AI plays a role at Erasmus University Rotterdam, Leiden University and TU Delft. The articles cover the following five themes, on which the universities work together and alongside one another:
- AI for peace, justice and security
- AI for port and maritime
- AI for energy and sustainability
- AI for life sciences and health
- AI for smart industry

Three ceremonies will be performed, all done by Q’ero Nation shamans specialized in different areas of healing. The three ceremonies are a Flower Cleansing Ceremony, a Coca Leaf Reading Ceremony, and an Offering to Pachamama, the Earth Mother. Traditional shamanic ceremonies such as these have been practiced since before the time of the Inca Empire and their Quechua culture. Participating in these shamanic ceremonies with an authentic Andean shaman will show you a new perspective on life and will allow you to develop physically and spiritually.
We will pick you up from your hotel and go to a beautiful site located in the outskirts of Cusco. All the ceremonies are presided over by Q’ero shamans from a small village a few days walk up the mountains. Each is specially chosen by a shamanic family to follow their profession. The Q’eros are the closest living descendants of the Incas and still maintain many of their ancient traditions.
To begin, the shaman must start
Next is. Once all three ceremonies have finished, it is time to celebrate.

These results and the simplicity of the new add-on optics are an important step toward several structural, functional, and multimodal imaging applications that will benefit from the tight optical sectioning and the use of near-infrared light. small animal retinal imaging in a wide array of translational vision applications. Included in these are the monitoring of tagged cells and arteries as time passes fluorescently, and the useful fluorescence imaging of calcium mineral probes that are accustomed to monitor retinal neuronal activity. Invariably, these several applications need systems that can handle imaging great retinal buildings. High-resolution funduscopy mainly uses scanning laser beam ophthalmoscopes (SLOs) with or without adaptive optics (AO)1,2,3,4,5 or wide field imaging through low-numeric aperture (NA) goals6 and topical ointment endoscopes7,8. Using two-photon excitation for retinal imaging in little mammalian eyes provides multiple potential advantages. Initial, the existing one-photon systems make use of noticeable wavelengths to excite fluorescent markers that result in solid light adaption9, whereas near-infrared (NIR)-structured two-photon excitation continues to be successfully useful to get useful imaging of visible responses to noticeable light in isolated retinas10,11,12,13. Second, two-photon excitation has an natural optical sectioning capacity, eliminating the necessity for extra spatial light filtering. Third, two-photon excitation autofluorescence making use of endogenous fluorophores continues to be confirmed in retinal explants14,15,16 and gets the advantage of decreased phototoxicity and absorption in the optics of Rabbit polyclonal to UBE2V2 the attention weighed against ultraviolet (UV)-structured autofluorescence. Despite these multiple potential advantages as well as the widespread option of two-photon microscopes, two-photon microscopic imaging through a mouse pupil was just confirmed utilizing a fairly complicated lately, specific optical program for compensating for the aberrations from the eyesight17 adaptively,18. Moreover, it really is typically assumed that main barriers have hindered other attempts to directly implement such imaging, such as the strong aberrations in mouse eyes19. Here, we make use of a model-based approach to analyze the requirements for an two-photon retinal imaging system, and found that the mouses vision strongly constrains the range of imaging lens combinations that can be used for this application. Next, we show that a system that follows these design criteria yields fundus images of optically sectioned, well-resolved, and fluorescent Doramapimod supplier microstructures down to the cellular level (observe Schejter two-photon imaging of the mouse retina.

(c) Paraxial model-based predictions for multiple objective lenses (situated 100 m from your cornea) of focus location relative to inner limiting membrane plane as a function of the combined offset focal length (shaded areaCretinal range). Optical models We built two optical types of the substance optical program (Body 1b): (1) a simplified, analytically tractable paraxial optical model and (2) an in depth ray tracing-based model that was applied in the Zemax software program (ZEMAX Development Company, Kirkland, WA, USA) utilized to validate the paraxial outcomes and to offer imaging performance evaluation. For the paraxial model (Body 1b, best), each one of the optical components was symbolized with a slim zoom lens using the Doramapimod supplier particular focal area and length, whereas the ocular optics had been modeled as two slim lens (for the cornea and crystalline zoom lens) whose focal ranges (= 4.5 mm and 2.05 mm @ 488 nm) had been extracted from Remtulla tests Through the imaging tests, we used an adjustable clamp to correctly position the attention and minimize the top motion from Doramapimod supplier the mouse by securing a metal bar that was surgically fixed towards the skull from the C57Bl adult mice (8C16 weeks). The pupils had been dilated with eyes drops (1% atropine sulfate, 0.5% tropicamide, 2.5% phenylephrine), and a saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) was utilized to keep the eyes hydrated and in conjunction with water immersion goal. The mice had been anesthetized by an intraperitoneal Doramapimod supplier (IP) shot of ketamine (50 mg kg?1 BW) and medetomidine (1 mg kg?1 BW), and 20 L of 10% fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was injected before the imaging. Six 5-week-old mice had been intravitreally injected with an adeno-associated trojan (AAV) that portrayed the genetically encoded calcium mineral indicators, GCaMP624 and GCaMP323. GCaMP3 was employed for the structural imaging because of its higher baseline fluorescence, whereas GCaMP6s was employed for the useful imaging due to its bigger dF/F. Two mice had been injected with AAV2/1.hSynap.GCaMP3.3.SV40,.At him on checking his jeans and truly happening and pressing it forever sustain trials in tainted space wiki emmy climax.

At the end of December, Sharon Ball will step down as the executive director of the Broome County Arts Council
At the end of December, Sharon Ball will step down as the executive director of the Broome County Arts Council after an 11-year tenure.
Among Ball’s major accomplishments: Pushing for more cooperation among local arts organizations, advocating for the importance of the arts in the community, and managing the United Cultural Fund, which last year distributed $239,000 in grants to Broome County nonprofits and artists.
Before leading the arts council, Ball worked as a radio host and producer for 30 years, including 15 years at NPR News in Washington, D.C. In the late 1970s, she served a stint in Presidential Personnel Office at the White House during the Carter administration.
The arts always have been close to her heart, though. While growing up in Cambridge, Ohio, her family and their circle of friends included singers and other creative folks who offered plenty of inspiration.
“This culture and all cultures need the arts to widen the mind. Without it, we’re kind of lost. We don’t have a deeper life,” she says. “Our mind is our best weapon and our best protection in the battle against banality and closed-mindedness and greed and prejudice. If it’s not being fully developed, then I believe our entire society is in trouble.”
Earlier this month, the arts council announced that Laura Knochen-Davis will take over as executive director in January.
“I couldn’t be happier about handing off to Laura,” Ball said. “She’s a brilliant choice.”
QUESTION: What appealed to you about the job that made you apply for it?
ANSWER: I always loved the arts, and my speciality and interest as a journalist were cultural issues. In my last position as senior cultural editor at NPR News, one of our beats was the arts. So I’ve always had the interest and it’s always been part of my life. My brother is an actor and poet and singer, and my daughter was an actress — we’re still trying to get over that! And I sang for many years. There was always music and theater — so it makes sense that when I went into journalism, that’s what I was really interested in.
I saw the job in the paper or someone called me about it. I read the job description, and it was like, “Bing! I can do that!” I’d done a piece of everything they had in there, so I applied without any hope at all getting the job because I wasn’t from here. I assumed that in a small town, you had to know somebody or know people, and I didn’t know anybody, really — just a handful of people that I’d met going to First Fridays, and I was on the TCO [Tri-Cities Opera] board briefly.
It was the most relaxed interview I’ve ever done in my life, because I didn’t think I had a prayer. I didn’t put on a persona and I didn’t do any of the stuff that I’ve always done or you’re supposed to do — and they hired me. Go figure!
Q: Do you feel as someone coming from outside the area that you have a different perspective on the arts in this region?
A: I had been going to First Friday, but when I got here I’d never heard there was an opera company, never heard there was a symphony. I was moving to Whitney Point — never really knew Binghamton. What I was stunned about was how much art is here, and good stuff. I thought, “I can live here, because there are wonderful cultural choices.”
I think my appreciation for that was enhanced by being from somewhere else. What I encountered were people who took it all for granted, who’d been here all their lives and say things like, “What did you move here for?” When it happened the first time, I thought it was some malcontent and I didn’t pay any attention. Then it kept happening, and I got mad. I thought, “What are you doing? Why are you hanging crepe on this place if you’re still here?”
This place is beautiful — the landscape, the rolling hills. I live in Whitney Point, and that drive to Binghamton is beautiful every single day. It doesn’t matter what the weather is doing. All you have to do is look up.
Then there are all these musicians and artists, people you meet who are clerks during the day but at night they paint or in a band. Everybody has a creative outlet — at least the people I’ve met — and it’s natural, like breathing. In other part of the world where I’ve been, people did their jobs morning, noon and night. At night, they just weren’t at work. Here, people have these multiple lives and multiple dimensions, and that creative piece is something that seems to be really endemic. That’s a good thing.
My outsider perspective allowed me to see not just the positive that was here, but the possibility. I saw a role for myself and the arts council for being a hub for communicating how wonderful and special the Broome County arts scene really is.
Q: Was that the biggest challenge you found going into the job was trying to foster that communication?
A: The communication part continues to be a challenge. Trying to be a source of information for everything — not in this clique or that clique, not favoring one or the other but actually being a neutral promoter of all of the arts and all of the people who support, defend and patronize the arts. That’s the role I see for the arts council, which is a service organization.
Everything we do is designed to promote the community of the arts — the whole thing. In there lies enlightened self-interest, because when we’re promoting everybody else and being fair and equal about that, then we’re doing well and we’re advancing the arts council itself.
Q: What were some of the other challenges you faced?
A: Money! It’s always money. I started in 2004, and then we had the floods and the economy was already in trouble.
One of the biggest challenges was telling the story of arts and culture so people could hear it. Telling the real role that it plays — and the essential role — in the community and the economy, and that the nonprofit and culture sector of the economy is not a drag on the economy just because we raise money. I kept encountering this idea that nonprofits were somehow taking and not giving back.
I felt that was a story that needed to be told, so you listen for the framing —this is where my journalism experience comes in — and here, in an economically challenged area, an economic framing is something people can hear. What we have are statistics — we have real numbers — because we raise money and we award grants. People have to apply for those grants, and the sizes of their audiences, the demographics of their audiences, how much money they spend in Broome County in a given year — all that information is required in our applications, so we started pulling those numbers together and analyzing them. We didn’t make it up — we just pulled the information and presented it for what it is.
There are probably still people out there who think that nonprofits are somehow a drag on the culture, but collectively, United Cultural Fund grantees return more than $4 million a year to the Broome County economy.
Look what First Friday has done for downtown — it started there. Those were small businesses and galleries and arts organizations working together to bring people downtown.
Q: What else has changed in the 11 years since you started running the arts council?
A: One of the things that’s happened in Windsor is the Windsor Whip Works arts center. Bill and Johanne Pesce were vacationers in Windsor for years, and they took that old building — that dilapidated former whip works — and renovated it, and it’s become a center of arts training and classes. It’s a great success story, and it has generated all kinds of redevelopment in Windsor.
Similarly, the Cooperative Gallery, the Brunelli Gallery, the Orazio Salati Gallery have generated the success of State Street and Artists’ Row and the rest of downtown [Binghamton] through First Friday and the Gorgeous Washington Street Association. It took everybody — that’s the thing I find interesting, and what I think everyone understands now. You’ve got to figure out a way to work together, even if you’re rivals.
You have to work together to create effective change, and I’m hoping that’s something that’s taking root. There’s a lot of lip service, so I hope it’s true, but I also see people trying to undermine that, believing that they can’t succeed unless someone else fails. In a small place like this, if one domino falls, you’re really up close to the one that’s going to fall next.
Q: Talk about the United Cultural Fund, where that money comes from and how it gets allocated out to groups.
A: The United Cultural Fund is our combined campaign for the arts. It is one of seven such active programs in the entire state of New York, and only two of them are upstate — one here in Broome County and the other in Jamestown. All five of the others are in the metropolitan New York City area.
It was established in 1987 to maintain organizations that have proven their cultural value to the community and to support projects of nonprofit community groups and individual artists. Over time, the United Cultural Fund — which is our largest program — has awarded something like $9 million to the arts locally.
The money comes from Broome County government, our major foundation — Hoyt, Decker, Gaffney and the M&T Charitable Foundation — as well as our major corporations like IBM, and other businesses and individuals in Broome County. That’s our annual campaign, and this past year we raised $282,000, of which $239,000 was distributed in grants. We’re trying to raise $315,000 for 2016, and Feb. 2 is when it closes.
There are two different kinds of United Cultural Fund grants. One program is for general operating support, the other is for projects. Obviously, general operating support has a much higher threshold for eligibility. It requires a $150,000 budget for at least three years. We have one organization that’s smaller than that, but they were grandfathered in when these eligibility guidelines were put into place. All of these organizations are providing unique services in one way or another.
The idea is that the arts council is an accountable mechanism for the distribution of these funds for the arts. We run a pretty rigorous application process. The guidelines are very clear and the applications can be downloaded from our website. I’m in the midst of doing seminars [explaining the process] and I’ll be doing more in December.
We want to make sure that the word gets out so that individual artists can apply and that nonprofit organizations that may have an arts project should apply. Money for the arts has been shrinking nationally for years, and even in our project grants, the maximum is $1,000, but that can make the difference when hiring a guest artist that makes your concert pop or renting space to have the concert or show, or paying an honorarium to an artist who’s teaching a workshop.
It’s a great treasure, and it’s an example of a community working together. The donors are trusting the arts council to distribute this money properly, to run a rigorous process and be held accountable for the grants that are out there.
All the programming that is funded by the United Cultural Fund has to be public in one way or another — either open to the public or having some kind of public benefit — and they have to demonstrate that in the applications. You can charge admission — people seem to think that if it’s “open to the public” that it has to be free, but it doesn’t. You can use the money for marketing and advertising, so you can get the word out there. You don’t want to put something on and then not have people know about it.
The other thing that’s really important is that they have to demonstrate they’re being fiscally responsible — that they’re taking care of this money properly. First of all, that they’re spending this money for the purpose they said they were going to do in the application. Number two, if it’s a big organization, you want to make sure they’re taking care of the money they’ve got, whether that’s from you or anybody else. If somebody is fiscally irresponsible, we can’t be giving to someone who shows they have a few problems with how they’re handling the money — we need to know they’re going to handle this money properly.
We are held to the same standard by our donors. We have to apply for funding from the county. We have to apply for funding from our donors. They have to see our budgets and we have to be able to be accountable to them.
The decisions about who gets funded belong to the board — the board approves all grants — but the process of deciding allocations is handled by a panel that changes every two years. This year, our whole panel will be members of the board, but usually it’s a mix of members of the community who know how to read a budget and how to read a grant along with members of our board of directors. They review the applications on their own time as volunteers, and they spend an entire day reviewing the requests.
There’s a lot of checks and balances on the process. To me, one of the most important things for the arts council to be is transparent about the process that it uses to allocate money, part of which is public money — tax money — from Broome County government and the rest are charitable donations from everyone else. You’re as responsible to the person who gave you $40 as you are to the person who gave you $78,794 and more. You want to retain your donors and they have to trust you.
Q: Where does the funding for the arts council itself come from?
A: We have members, and that’s a very important part of our budget. We have the United Cultural Fund — we get an administrative fee of 15 percent for running the campaign and monitoring grant compliance all year. We have a general operating support grant from the Klee Foundation, for which we are deeply grateful. We also get board support, and there’s a certain amount we take when we have gallery shows and there are sales — we take a small percentage.
Q: How many members does the arts council have?
A: Today, it’s 115 organizations and individual artists. We’re very pleased that about two-thirds of our membership is individual artists, which was a personal goal. It’s very important that we’re serving musicians and painters in addition to organizations. They see value, and that’s great.
Q: What do you think is ahead for the arts council after your retirement?
A: I want them to succeed, I want the arts community to succeed, I want this area to succeed. You know why? Because it’s enlightened self-interest. I’m staying here in Whitney Point. I love my house, my husband and I are here to stay, and I need this community to continue to be a vibrant cultural entity where I can enjoy the arts and enjoy culture and see great work and hear great music.
Q: Apart from taking in the arts as an observer, do you have any other plans?
A: I’m going to sleep for a week! Then I’m going to clean my house and throw things away. I’m going to clear my decks, because I want to do some creative work of my own. It’s been a while. I’ve been applying my creativity in this position — which has been great fun and I’ve met some amazing people, but I have some creative work of my own that I’d like to do. Some writing, maybe — I haven’t decided.
But right now, the hard drive is full! I need to delete some things and clear some stuff off so I can let that out and have space for that to develop. I’m not even going to think about what I’m going to do with it, because if I start thinking, I won’t do it. I want to do the creative work and see where it leads. I get excited thinking about it.

Here is what the NSPCC says on the subject:
NSPCC Help and Advice Pages
"Leaving children at home alone:
- the age of the child
- the child's level of maturity and understanding
- the place where child will be left
- how long the child will be left alone, and how often
- whether or not there are any other children alone with the child."
Times Online
."
So, in effect, the answer is that there is no minimum age set by UK law for when children can be left alone. However, if the children should come to significant harm as a result, those responsible are likely to be prosecuted.So, in effect, the answer is that there is no minimum age set by UK law for when children can be left alone.

The 4th scenario fits the McCann case. I am under the impression that an 18 month old is classified an an "infant". Isn't it so?
Considering that Madeleine had a genetic disorder wasn't it more risky to leave the child alone?
Taking into account the fact that she woke up and cried the night before as Mrs. Fenn had also stated wasn't it extremely thoughtless, that she was left alone again?
Mariana,
I teach Health and Social Care at GCSE and A level and the official definitions are:
0-3: Infancy
3-11: Childhood
11-18: Adolescence
18+ adulthood
Also, I do seem to recall in one of the first reports I read on the BBC's web site, that one of the relatives said that Madeleine had a habit of sleep-walking. So, it seems to be rather irresponsible to leave her with her twin siblings in an unlocked apartment, in a strange place.From the very start, Link building has always been important for SEO. This is the reason why Backlinks share a prominent position in the Google Algorithm and it is still one of the most favored metrics Google uses to establish Search Engine Rankings. After the attack of Google’s beloved pets (i.e. Panda and Penguin) on the web-sphere, it has become immensely difficult to build links and dominate rankings. The recent catastrophe on Guest blogging and the penalty on one of the finest Guest blogging networks of Ann Smarty’s My Blog Guest proved to be a nightmare for the SEO industry.
In this post, I’m going to cover one of my favorite link building tactics that does not only help you to build quality links but also provides you with immeasurable benefits for your brand.
Let’s start exploring!
We all know about GoDaddy, which is the biggest and most well-reputed market for buying online domains. This giant does not only offer these services but also provide us with a platform to sell our domains. We all know about the “Domain Auction” that GoDaddy and other platforms offer. Let’s analyze how we can build quality and clean links with their help.
Don’t worry you don’t need to bid here. This isn’t about buying domains or buying links. This is about link prospecting using expired domains.
Simply follow the steps.
Step 1:
Go to Godaddy and click on Domain Section.
Now go to the column “Auction” and click on the “Browse Auctions” link.
Step 2:
You’ll see the list of various domains that are available for auction. Simply go through the list, and copy the related domains into an Excel Sheet.
If your niche related domains aren’t showing up, don’t hesitate to use the search bar option.
Step 3:
Now you’ll see all the domains that are going to be expired soon or the webmasters are no longer interested to keep them. Just copy all the top domains to your Excel sheet.
Step 4:
If you’re not satisfied with the results, it’s time to take things to an advanced level. Click the “Advanced Search” option at the search bar. Here you’ll see the best filters available to get the desired results.
Enter all the necessary details and click run search. Copy all the top domains into the excel sheet.
At this moment, you may be thinking what we’re actually trying to achieve here.
Take a breath!! And move further…
Step 5:
It’s time to get the most out of these domains. Enter each of them one by one into your favorite back link explorer and download all the links.
Step 6:
Now you have the complete prospects list, visit each link and observe the environment completely. Focus on the topics that these sites are talking about and contact them.
Now, your outreaching skills should be sharp here. Otherwise, all your efforts will be in vain. Make sure you’re not using any stale outreach pitch. Be personalized, creative and honest! Keep it short and concise and do not hesitate to state the purpose of your email.
For more ideas related to writing outreaching emails, see this post from Moosa Hemani.
Apart from GoDaddy, there’s more…
If you’re thinking that the domains you picked up are not good enough and the DA and PR is way below the average, you’re on the right track.
While researching more sites related to Domain Auctioning, I’ve come across a very useful site that will surely solve your problem.
Go to Expired Domains, this site is completely focused on providing precise data of Expired and Deleted Domains. It also allows you to search your desired queries and facilitates you with important metrics that help you judge the domain’s overall condition.
As you can see, all the metrics including PA, Moz Backlinks ALexa, Domain Birth and others show up right away. Download the data and start the same link prospecting cycle again!
This method is one of the tactics that you can use to build links in the year 2014. Although it is time consuming and requires some effort, the effect makes for a rewarding outcome. Long gone are the days when you could easily generate thousands of links in a month’s time. It’s 2014 and you must be creative and smart enough to be respected by Google and rule the rankings.A set of the most current Tokyo Ghoul product you may get online!

[Q] In the case of the shark, who's out of primary school or secondary school, which has this extremely unpleasant, not to say fatal experience, how do other sharks learn not to tangle with these things?
Well, the Greenland shark, they're very, very lazy and slow, and they're scavengers, really, on the bottom. But they keep one eye open and they see what happens, and I don't think there's any way that the mummy shark... well, she doesn't, because actually she leaves the eggs they come across... Other sharks look, I suppose. And they don't do that. Everybody leaves these things alone.
[Q] But that whole system, which you have to believe evolved according to this principle of natural selection over a period of time, it's almost impossible to believe, isn't it?
It is, yes, but it's the only possible explanation. And given that you've got 510 million years, and they're reproducing all the time, yes, it is. That's what I mean. It's so exciting. This... the nets go down for a mile, okay? This was the only fish... it's not really a fish... well, it is, but the only thing that was alive when it came up. It was looking for a new home. There it is, on the gutting table. Damned thing crawling across the stainless steel. Difficult to kill. So I whopped it into formalin.: Leave the hagfish alone

5. Online at The Teacher Store
Simply find the titles you need at The Teacher Store and enter the required quantity. Enter coupon code AUTHOR at checkout to save 40% on the author's books.
Choosing Books to Order
To select which titles you want students to study and which ones you want to offer for sale, review all of the author's work. Make sure you have a complete list of your author's or illustrator's books. The author may have titles available from other publishers as well as new Scholastic titles that are not yet listed on Scholastic.com. Check with your local library and Children's Books in Print to ensure you have a complete list of works.
Your author or illustrator is the best resource when planning your book order. Not only will they be able to inform you of titles from other publishers, but they can also indicate which books they will mention in their talk and which books tend to sell better at events.
Planning the Number of Books to Order
Every school is different, so Scholastic can't provide an estimate of the number of books your school will need. Some schools choose to have students' parents pre-order books that they want to buy for their own home libraries. This will provide a fairly accurate count of how many and which books you should order for your book sale. However, books can go out of stock or change in price without notice. You might have to ask for more money to cover increased prices or refund money on titles no longer available. Many students realize that they want to purchase books only after they have met the author. You may not have any books for these students.
Some schools predict their needs based on previous book sales in their school or in their community (from previous author visits or Book Fairs). This eliminates the problems of varying prices and inventory that might be associated with pre-ordering. You may sell out of a favorite title or order too many copies of less popular titles. You will need to pay return postage on unsold books.
Ordering from Scholastic is risk-free. We will accept returns on any unsold books, and credit your account. Simply return them to:
Scholastic Inc.
Attn: Book Returns
3030 Robinson Road
Jefferson City, MO 65111
Please enclose:
- A copy of your invoice
- A letter explaining how many copies of each title you sold, how many of each you are returning, and a calculation of the balance owed.
- A check for the total cost of books you sold (if you have not pre-paid for your books), taking into account your 40% discount.
You are responsible for all postage or freight costs on return shipments.Red Dot Sights

Red Dot Sight Basics
Technology makes tons of things possible. For firearms, advances in electronics and optics have helped shooters move beyond conventional iron sighting systems in magnifying riflescopes, and further in electronic sighting systems. Among the most popular options on the market are red dot sights, usually small, electronic sight systems that generate a dot-shaped reticle - frequently in red - which serves as a designator for where the towers should soil. The red dot is employed as a general term to describe a plethora of view systems that create a comparable effect - projecting that red reticle on the target via the area of view.
The fact is these various kinds of beaches work differently, using a that a fiber optic system to collect ambient lighting to power, the reticle. Essential to keep in mind that no matter how the light is created, these sights don't utilize lasers to project on to the objective. Reflex technology has been used in fighter airplane heads-up displays, airplane and tank gun sights, and commercial applications, such as surveying gear, camera viewfinders, and optical telescope pointing devices.
Contrary to using iron sights, where the shooter must align their eyes, most of using prismatic landscapes is that the shorter, narrower eye relief is compared with a reflex sight. Some types of firearms have mounting systems that use an extra-long eye relief, usually considered five inches or longer, which might make utilizing a prism sight difficult, if not impossible.
Also, prismatic scopes with magnification have parallax problems at longer distances similar to magnified riflescopes. However, the quantity of parallax is negligible at most three. The system accomplishes damage through use. A weapon by itself is just a tool, and to use it correctly, you need practice. Any professional will tell you that no matter how good your weapon is, it is your skill to determine the outcome of each battle or competition. So what you need is a safe practice. Practicing just anywhere will not bring the maximum desired results, as consistency and comparability is what will make you improve. This is where we can help you, offering an amazingly wide array of shooting targets!

IEEE Access, 9. pp. 73392-73412. ISSN 2169-3536
Abstract
The phenomenal growth of the Electric Vehicle (EV) technology demands efficient and intelligent control strategies for the propulsion system. In this work, a novel fuzzy fractional order PID (FOPID) controller using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm has been proposed to control EV speed effectively. The controller parameters and the fuzzy logic controller’s membership functions are tuned and updated in real-time using the multi-objective ACO technique. The proposed controller’s speed tracking performance is verified using the new European driving cycle (NEDC) test in the MATLAB-Simulink platform. The proposed controller outperforms the ACO-based fuzzy integer-order PID (IOPID), FOPID, and traditional IOPID controllers. The sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the proposed controller for varying parameters of the EV model. The stabilization of EV speed in the presence of external disturbance is also confirmed. In the proposed work, an attempt is made to analyze the system’s stability using Matignon’s theorem, considering the linearized EV model. The proposed controller gives optimum speed tracking performance compared to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based fuzzy FOPID controllers. Additionally, the optimized fuzzy FOPID controller is realized using a second�generation current conveyor with extra inputs (EX-CCII) and fractional-order capacitors with electronic tunability. The controller circuit’s performance evaluation is carried out in the Cadence Analog Design Environment using GPDK 180 nm CMOS process.KITCHEN SERVICES

Research profile
In our lab, we study Morphogenesis, Extracellular Matrix, and Cell Junctions. Broadly speaking, our work combines three crucial fields of biology: Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, and Genetics.
Summary
We want to find out the fundamental mechanisms that take place in nature and therefore do basic research. However, our work often has a clear medical interest because understanding the fundamental processes that regulate life is essential for developing better treatment for diseases.
In our lab, we employ a multidisciplinary approach using a wide range of techniques from genetics, genomics, cell biology, high-resolution and quantitative imaging, biochemistry, molecular biology, and theoretical biology, among many others.
The main question our lab is trying to answer is:
How are tissues and organs built and maintained throughout the life of an organism? Our lab studies Gene families that help cells in cell drinking (endocytosis), cell-cell contact, and cell-matrix formation.

Well it had to happen didn't it? Great 15km run Monday with the first opportunity to wear a bloody t-shirt #getin followed by a great feed was what the Dr. had ordered. As a Monday usually goes, this was definitely up there with the best in recent times. Fast forward 24hrs and all had been forgotten. #crash #bang #wallop
I mean it was to be expected though wasn't it? How can we work so hard delivering online learning and not expect to be run down? We look forward to our half-terms for the relaxation and recovery period it allows our bodies and minds but this one was required more than ever #weekfromhell
What followed was a severe lack of sleep, little man teething and having his injections along with having a cold would result in a tough and testing week to follow and the dreaded cold going around the house faster than Usain winning gold in Beijing. I mean it's hard enough trying to cope at the best of times on a lack of sleep but throw your own illness into the equation and it becomes far harder than you can ever imagine. 1am until 4am was the magic waking hours this week and little man could just not settle #blesshim Thankfully his mama was able to settle him as best as could be.
So....I've been cranky, knocked out, zapped of energy but the recovery process has begun and the key to all of this is FOOD and quality nutrition. Fruit, Veg and herbal teas to improve my vitamin and mineral intake has been increased before I can put on those running shoes again. On another note, given those loved ones around me have given up something they love for lent, I thought I'd join in and caffeine has gone out of my life for 40 days. To be honest I'm not an addict but quite enjoying being a little less dependent on a cup of coffee and splash of honey for a while :-)
Not much training, running or walking to write home about this week but on the work front been delivering Nutrition workshops and S&C workshops to local communities via zoom with good success again! So...let's stay positive and look forward to the rest of the month as there's a lot going on. WEBSITE going live later next week!!! #YES and a return to training (albeit really easy this week and nothing major in terms of pace). Looking forward to this and a little more normality in the household/everyday life.
We go again! Run well. Run easy.

Snap4Arduino requires that you have StandardFirmata installed in your board.
To do so, follow these simple steps:
The previous instructions cover the initial setup of your board. If your Arduino board comes with Firmata preinstalled or you have previously installed it yourself, you don't need to follow them again. Still, to prevent any possible issues with drivers (on Windows) or permissions, it may be a good idea to install the Arduino IDE anyway.
StandardFirmata is the basic requirement for a board to be reachable from Snap4Arduino, but you can get extended features by using others Firmata versions. See the Devices section for more information.
You can install the ChromeOS app from the Chrome Web Store or download the package, uncompress it and drag and drop the crx file into the chrome://extensions browser tab. This is a limited version of Snap4Arduino that doesn't support extended Firmata versions of the Snap! JavaScript block..
Online version requires a Chrome/Chromium plugin to connect to Arduino boards. To install it, just download the plugin package and unzip it. This will create a folder named crx. Then, go to chrome://extensions in your browser, activate the developer mode and drag and drop that folder into that browser tab.:
From Citilab Edutec Team:
Also note that you can use any type of board (not just Arduino) as long as it can run Firmata. For example, ESP8266 and NodeMCU boards are being widely used with Snap4Arduino.
Additionally, other devices like Picaxe, micro:bit, Lego WeDo or Boost can also be used in Snap! (and thus in Snap4Arduino) by means of different middleware packages. Read more about it here.
Snap4Arduino libraries include SA5Firmata and Creative Robotix, which require their own Firmata versions:.

Moving forward, I’ve decided to tally up some of them (or parts of them) to showcase how useful you can make miles and points. My first was tallying up what a week(ish) trip to Australia cost me (SEE: The Anatomy of a One Week Trip to Australia).
Now I’d like to tally up what three nights in Banff set us back on our recent trip to Alberta. You can see photos of the park in a previous post.
The catalyst for an amazing stay
Our recent trip to Banff was made possible by a single card offer. That’s how lucrative a bonus can be, if you know how to use it!
A few months ago I decided to jump on the Chase Fairmont card before it was gone. Chase pulled their public application link, and it was only a matter of time until the other links died as well. I applied through one of the two surviving application links, and was approved. After meeting the minimum spending, the card gave me some free nights and upgrade certificates at Fairmont hotels, and it was the main reason we were even able to plan this trip.
Admittedly, we could have stayed at a couple other places in/near Banff using points. But using the free Fairmont nights at one of their beautiful hotels in Banff was something I really wanted to do!
Stacking all the certificates and a checking account bonus, we had an amazing 3 night stay in a one bedroom suite. The views were spectacular.
Above is the view through the main living area window. Below is through the second window.
Sadly, the Chase Fairmont card is no longer offered. I wish it was and that you could repeat this experience.
Breaking down our costs for the stay
With the Chase Fairmont card I was able to earn 2 free nights at any Fairmont after $3,000 in spending. The card also offered a suite upgrade certificate, two dining/spa certificates, another room upgrade certificate, and a “third night free” certificate on paid stays.
I was able to stack the free nights with the suite upgrade certificate. We paid for a 3rd night using a bonus I got from opening an account with Bank of America. We were also able to use both dining certificates during our stay.
What our stay cost us:
- 2 free Fairmont night certificates
- 1 suite upgrade certificate
- 2 dining certificates in the totals of $50 U.S.
- $445.28 CAD for 1 cash night (including taxes)
- $75 CAD parking
- $15 CAD resort fee (I think for just 1 night)
Converting to U.S. dollars and subtracting out a $300 checking account cash bonus that we applied to the trip, the total comes to a mere $99.18. Pretty sweet. Or should I say suite?
What 3 nights at the Fairmont Banff Springs *could* have cost
The Fairmont Banff Springs is a true 5-star hotel. It is aptly called the “Castle in the Rockies”, and it is a gem, even among other beautiful hotels in the Fairmont portfolio.
But with 5-star rooms, dining, and service comes a 5-star price tag. The going rate for a standard room during the time we stayed was $399 CAD. The going rate for a one bedroom suite was $899!
Tallying up what the stay would have cost had we paid cash (all in CAD):
- $899 per night x 3 nights + $297 taxes = $2994
- $25 parking x 3 nights = $75
- $15 resort fee x 3 nights = $45
- $60 dining
The total is a ridiculous $3,174!!
Obviously, we never would have paid that much for this stay. This is something that makes determining “value” somewhat subjective. We can’t exactly say that we saved over $3,000 on this vacation when we wouldn’t have paid that much for it anyway!
Other expenses
Many of the remaining costs of the trip were covered by miles and points as well. The nights in the Bay before the trip we using IHG “free” nights, to the tune of $98 in annual fees for 2 nights. That’s a deal in San Francisco.
Our rental car and one night in Calgary were covered by the remaining travel credit on my parents’ Chase Sapphire Reserve. Our final night at YYC airport was using a free night certificate as well.
Even the flights were mostly covered using $200 in Delta gift cards and a cumulative $200 ($125 and $75) in United vouchers. Out of pocket cost came to about $170.
Conclusion
I hope this is another great picture of the usefulness of miles and points. My wife and I had an amazing vacation in the Rockies for both a cheap overall price, and a super cheap price relative to what the experience would have cost us.

Electric bicycles are getting to be more mainstream as the expense to claim one goes down, and the expense to possess a gas-fueled vehicle goes up. In the event that you ask a genuine cyclist what they think about an electric bicycle, you may get your head nod off, yet there’s undoubtedly there’s a business sector out there for them. Actually, that is the reason the Rubbee was made. It’s an electric drive unit that connects to a general bicycle in just a couple of seconds, and that falls off pretty much as fast.
Rubbee is a progressive electric drive which can be mounted on any bike in simply a couple of seconds. It is an electric drive more than ever. Rubbee is a high-proficiency electric rubbing drive for bicycles. It changes the way general bicycles used to be changed over into electric ones. With a coordinated clip instrument it can be mounted on bicycles in simply a couple of seconds and the creative drive engine with an incorporated battery pack keeps you set without needing to pedal for more than 15 miles!
In the event that we take a gander at the transformation units accessible at this moment we will see that every one of them oblige a tool kit and a few aptitudes in hardware and mechanics to introduce them. Also keep in mind all the wires and the battery pack – both of them make your bicycle resemble a DIY test. Change units additionally include around 10-15 kg of weight to your bicycle.
That being said, Rubbee gives an answer for those issues. Delight in the profits of a high-control electric bike without getting your hands filthy or demolishing the feel of the bike you as of now have.
- You don’t have to purchase an entire electric bike on the off chance that you need one
- You can switch between a standard bicycle and an electric in simply an issue of seconds
- You don’t need to convey a substantial and awkward battery pack or an entire bike to energize it
- You can impart it to your relatives and companions
- Your bicycle can be electric without any bother that accompanies normal change units
Engineering utilized:
Rubbee is brimming with creative arrangements and peculiarities.
Thrown grating wheel: The rubbing wheel is the place the rubber meets the street, or meets the rubber if we say. We cast these rollers from an exceptional polyurethane recipe we’ve created for this application. It gives greatest hold while keeping your bicycle’s tire from wearing off excessively.
Multifunction force catch: The force catch works as an ON/OFF switch and as an issue level pointer. Coordinated blue-colored LED flickers relating to the condition of charge of the battery pack. The speedier it squints – the less power you have cleared out. It additionally demonstrates the status of the batteries when the Rubbee is generally charged.
Coordinated concealment framework: It verifies Rubbee dependably gives a consistent compel on the feel worn out on the bicycle accordingly permitting least slip even in wet conditions. This gimmick likewise empowers Rubbee to be utilized even on the bikes with back wheel suspension where the geometry of the bike is continually evolving.
Battery pack: Rubbee has a coordinated battery pack uniquely crafted only for this item. It conveys greatly high flows to power you up the slopes. The lifespan of this pack is in excess of 2000 cycles – this will verify you can energize Rubbee each and every day for a long time without losing any extent.
Multipurpose connector: Rubbee has stood out electronic fitting. It utilizes the same port to join the throttle/ PAS sensor and to associate the charger. Resourcefulness in straightforwardness.
Waterproof development: Rubbee can be utilized actually when it is raining outside in light of the fact that all hardware and the drive unit itself are waterproof.
Details:
- Range (without accelerating): 25 km (15 mi)
- Top speed: 25 km/h (15 mph)
- Weight: 6.5 kg (14 lbs.)
- Peak power: 800 W (250 W Rated)
- Integrated battery pack: 20000 mAh
- Full energize time: 2 hours
Mounting:
- Clamp it on the seat tube;
- Remove the obsession pin to empower concealment framework (You can abandon it in the event that you need to ride around with Rubbee separated from the wheel);
- connect the throttle/PAS sensor;
- press the ON/OFF catch;
- Just reverse the request to expel Rubbee from the bike.
This is simply a first venture for a tech that could get to be significantly all the more low-profile and consumer friendly.

What we’ll do here is raise the pitches of the top two notes a perfect fourth, by keeping the fingers at the same frets while moving them over to the next higher string, thus introducing a string skip.
FIGURE 1 is a legato sequence, incorporating every available hammer-on, that begins with the four-note Aaddb2 (A Bb C# E) shape, or “cell,” I introduced last month, which alternates with our new string-skipping shape on beat two of bar 1. With the new shape, instead of playing the notes C# and E (the major third and perfect fifth of A) on the B string again, we’re substituting F# and A on the high E string, fingered at the same frets.
In the key of A, F# is the major sixth, so we’ll call our new arpeggio, which is intervallically spelled 1 b2 6 1 (ending on the root note an octave higher) A6b2 (A Bb F# A), The string skip gives us a major sixth interval, which is rather wide and has a “yodel-y” quality when played melodically. I resolve the sequence with a bluesy lick, sliding up the high E string to the minor third of A, C, which I then bend up a half step to the major third, C#, before pulling off to the A root note at the fifth fret.
In FIGURE 2, we’re taking our yodel-y A6b2 shape and transposing it up the neck in three-fret increments, in symmetrical minor thirds, just as we had done with the Aaddb2 shape in the previous lesson, to create a twisted, slinky-sounding “nightmare run.” Notice that we’re repeating each four-note cell before moving to the next one, which gives our eyes, brains and fingers more time to anticipate each shift.
As was the case with our previous lesson, all the examples I’m showing you here are based on the A half-whole diminished scale (A Bb C C# Eb E F# G) and sound cool when played over an A, A5 or A7 chord or an A bass note. And, again, experiment with reversing the note contour (playing each four-note cell backward), as well as alternate picking with palm muting, for a more aggressive, percussive attack.
In FIGURE 3, I move our A6b2 shape over to the D and G strings and five frets higher, which gives us the same four notes (A Bb F# A), then proceed to do the alternating tritones thing, by moving that same shape up one fret and back over to the G and high E strings. Notice how I resolve the phrase with a bluesy bend and some vibrato.
FIGURE 4 has you initially doing the same alternating tritones pattern from FIGURE 3 an octave lower, using a different physical shape, for which you lead with the middle finger instead of the index. We do that eight-note sequence three times, then move across the strings in bar 2, staying in position and using the index-finger shape again for the last two cells.
Like FIGURE 2, our final example (FIGURE 5) moves the A6b2 shape up the G and high strings in minor thirds, but here we’re employing hybrid picking (pick-and-fingers technique) to articulate every note and play a jagged melody that continuously changes direction and skips strings. Be sure to shift your fretting hand as indicated.November 23, 2021
This is Part 5 of Modern JavaScript for Django Developers.
Welcome back to "Modern JavaScript for Django Developers"!
Previous installments of this series covered 1) organizing your front end code in a Django project, 2) JavaScript toolchains, 3) integrating toolchains into Django, and finally 4) integrating React and Django.
In Part 5 we’re going to take things in a new direction.
In this installment we'll turn to the low- and no-JavaScript world. We'll cover some of the common approaches to "sprinkling in" light amounts of JavaScript into your Django projects in 2021.
We’ll start high-level—approaching the big-picture questions of when you might choose a "low-JavaScript" architecture, and how to decide when to bring in a framework. After that we'll dive into two of the best low-JavaScript tools to use with Django today: Alpine.js and HTMX.
Now get cozy, put away your Webpack, React, and Vue, and get ready for some good old-fashioned server-rendered Django goodness!
Here's where we're headed:
- When you might choose low-JavaScript
- To framework or not to framework
- Building interactive interfaces in your Django pages with Alpine.js
- Talking to your Django backend without a full-page reload with HTMX
- Conclusion: Choosing Low-JavaScript vs High-JavaScript
- Up next: you decide!
When you might choose low-JavaScript
Before getting into any specific low-JavaScript tool you should first ask yourself: is low-JavaScript right for me?
One place to start in answering that question is understanding the type of page you're building.
In our conversation on Django front end architectures, we talked about three categories of pages you can find in almost every Django app:
- Server-first Django pages with little-to-no JavaScript. These are your standard Django pages like a login form or user profile.
- Client-first JavaScript pages with little-to-no Django. Anything with a rich and interactive front-end experience fits in this category. Think about something like Gmail or Google Maps.
- Everything in between. For example, something like this UI to sign someone up to a SaaS Subscription.
The low-JavaScript world is perfect for category 3—all of those in-between pages with a splash of page-level interactivity. But, it also works great as a compliment to mostly-server-rendered pages (category 1), and it can even work for pages that are typically be handled by something like a single page React app (category 2).
So in short—low-JavaScript is almost always an option. You'll just have to decide if and when it works well for you.
For me, low-JavaScript Django has become a more and more exciting option over time. In the last year I've found myself reaching for HTMX in many situations where I historically would have used React. It let's you do a lot of what fancy frameworks provide, and forces you to give up almost nothing in terms of how you're used to using Django.
Hopefully the rest of this guide will present a clear picture of what this looks like, and help you make the decision for your own projects.
Now let’s get into some specifics.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Before reaching for any particular tool, it’s important to know what you're trying to achieve. This might sound obvious, but it's easy to forget!
You know the saying "when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"? Well, the same is true of technology. You can accomplish most things with any number of front-end frameworks, but they all excel at slightly different things. Using the right one for any particular problem will make you a lot more efficient!
Here are some of the reasons you might reach for JavaScript:
- Maybe you want a bit of on-page interactivity, for example, having a button open a modal dialog. We could call this making interactive interfaces.
- Or you might want to do some work asynchronously—perhaps embedding a form that sends data to your back end without doing a full-page reload. We could call this making AJAX requests.
- Or maybe you're integrating with something that already uses JavaScript—e.g. displaying your app's data in an interactive chart. We could call this using existing libraries.
These aren't the only use cases by any means, but they cover a lot of ground, so that's where we'll start. What's important is that each of these use cases have different needs—and those different needs make them uniquely suited to specific solutions. Alpine.js is great for building interactive interfaces. HTMX is amazing for AJAX. And to integrate with existing libraries we'll return to our Django JavaScript toolchain.
But we're getting ahead of ourselves. The very first question you should ask yourself is whether you need a framework at all....
To framework or not to framework
The first question that comes up for every JavaScript use case is whether—and to what extent—to reach for a framework to solve the problem.
This guide will ultimately recommend using frameworks most of the time, but to get this out of the way first: you may not need a JavaScript framework.
JavaScript—especially in a modern JavaScript environment—is powerful. You can build rich applications with vanilla JavaScript. And the existence of a vast ecosystem of 3rd-party libraries and packages—not to mention Stack Overflow—only makes it easier.
Sticking to native JavaScript is nice mostly because it’s dependency-free. This simplifies and streamlines a lot. You don’t have to worry about importing external scripts and the overhead—both in terms of page weight and code maintenance—that introduces. Your code will also be immediately understandable and modifiable by anyone who knows JavaScript (hopefully!). Frameworks—even lightweight ones—have a learning curve and can trip up developers who’ve never seen them before.
The main downside of choosing native JavaScript is that you’ll be working at a pretty low level. You end up writing a lot of code that looks something like the below. This example wires up events that close the dialog below:
// when the DOM is loaded document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { // find every element with the class "close" (document.querySelectorAll('.close') || []).forEach((closeButton) => { const parent = closeButton.parentNode; // and add a "click" event listener closeButton.addEventListener('click', () => { // that removes the button's parent from the DOM parent.parentNode.removeChild(parent); }); }); });
This code isn't overwhelming or difficult to write, but it’s quite a lot of lines for something so simple. If you only need to do this a few times then sure, throw the script on your page and call it a day. But as more of these are added they will become increasingly unwieldy.
Also, it's worth pointing out that many frameworks exist primarily to make writing and maintaining code like the above easier. We'll see in the next section how we can replace the above with just a few attributes in Alpine.js—which is particularly good for this type of thing.
Introducing a framework to your project is kind of like switching from a text editor to a full-blown IDE for the first time. At first you’re slowed down, everything is unfamiliar, and you have to learn this whole new system for doing every little thing. It's frustrating! But then, once you’re on the other side of the learning curve you are way more efficient. Eventually you wonder how you ever wrote code in that clunky old way.
For this reason, this guide advises having a very low bar for adopting a framework. The frameworks discussed here are quick to learn and easy to adopt. And ultimately, once you get over the learning curve they will make you substantially more efficient.
Do you need a framework if your project is tiny? Absolutely not. But when things start to grow and change over time, keep the bar low for bringing one in.
With that, we're going to shift gears and focus on framework-based solutions, but know that they aren't strictly necessary!
Building interactive interfaces in your Django pages with Alpine.js
The simplest and most common use of JavaScript is for little bits of on-page interactivity: menus that open on mobile, modal dialogs that pop up and close, stuff like that. The code snippet above is a perfect example of this type of thing. You can do these with vanilla JavaScript, but it gets unwieldy quickly, so let's talk about other options.
Some UI frameworks—most notably, Bootstrap—come with many of these things built in. If you’re using one of those UI frameworks, and it supports your use case, use it! That’s what it’s there for.
Outside of UI frameworks, for a long time the default answer to interactive interfaces was jQuery. However, these days there are more popular—and franky, superior—options. The one this guide recommends starting with is Alpine.js. They even refer to themselves as "jQuery for the modern web".
Alpine is particularly good at these little utilities to help build interactive interfaces. Here’s the dialog-closing example from above using Alpine. An important point—which will come up a lot in this guide—is that it doesn't require you to write any of your own JavaScript!
<div x- <button @x</button> <span> Press the little "x" to close this message... </span> </div>
How does this work? Let’s go through it line-by-line.
<div x- ... </div>
This defines a
<div> element with two special Alpine.js attributes on it.
- The
x-dataattribute: which defines a data property named "open" with a value of
true. You can think of data properties like local variables in your HTML.
- The
x-showattribute: which says "only show this element if the value of the "open" data property is
true."
Combined these initialize the element with "open" to true, which results in it being shown on the page.
Now let's look at the close button:
<button @x</button>
This markup does a variable assignment based on the "click" event.
In English, it says "when the button is clicked, set the value of the “open” property to
false."
Finally, there's the message itself, which resides in the outer
<div>.
Its visibility will be determined by the visibility of its parent.
<span> Press the little "x" to close this message... </span>
Putting this together: the page loads, "open" is set to
true, and the notification shows up.
Then you click the close button, "open" becomes
false and the whole thing disappears.
This is the core way that Alpine works: you define some dynamic content in terms of "local" variables, and then wire up events that manipulate those variables. Alpine attributes can set an element's visiblity, change class lists, set content, add transitions, and more. Working this way makes a lot of tasks simpler!
Also, because most logic in Alpine is configured by HTML attributes, you can do quite a lot and never even write a line of JavaScript. This simplifies things dramatically.
Integrating Alpine.js and Django
Alright, so Alpine is pretty cool. But how does it work with Django?
The quick answer is: exactly like it works with anything else.
Because Alpine lives predominantly in HTML it can work seamlessly with Django—and indeed any server-rendered template system. All you have to do is make sure that it's imported somewhere in your Django template with something like this:
<script src="//unpkg.com/alpinejs" defer></script>
And you're off to the races! This will feel very familiar to Django developers who haven't started using things like NPM and Webpack. You can adopt Alpine without worrying about all that other stuff.
Finally, since most Alpine logic happens client-side there’s really nothing specific required to make Alpine and Django work together on the backend. The Django bits become more important when you start making AJAX requests and integrating with your sever.
Which brings us to our next example...
Talking to your Django backend without a full-page reload with HTMX
After interactive interfaces, the next-most-common use of JavaScript is talking to your back end without full-page reloads—what we called making AJAX requests above. Most of these workflows follow a similar pattern—the user does something (e.g. clicks a button), a request is made to the back end, and the front end updates itself based on the response. On-page pagination, partial and auto-saving, and infinite scroll are all examples of this type of thing.
Choosing your AJAX tool
To do AJAX—as with other things—you’ve got loads of options.
Historically, you might have used jQuery’s
$.ajax() function.
These days, JavaScript’s
fetch,
or the
axios library are more common.
All of these are perfectly fine choices.
Once again, choosing the right tool can be a complicated set of tradeoffs—many of which will depend
on the size of your project and the experience and preferences of the people building it.
Fetch is (mostly) natively supported in browsers, which means it can be used with no dependencies.
Axios provides a friendlier API (you can kind of think of it like
requests for JavaScript).
Both fetch and axios play nicely with JavaScript frameworks—including React and Vue but also low-JS frameworks like Alpine.
So with that out of the way, we’ll now say: HTMX is our recommended way to do AJAX in a Django project.
What is HTMX?
Don’t feel bad if you haven’t heard of HTMX—I hadn’t until 2021. But in the last 12 months, HTMX taken the Django community by storm. There were three different talks on HTMX at the 2021 DjangoCon (here, here, and here) and it also got a shout-out in my talk on “Modern Javascript and Django”.
HTMX operates similarly to Alpine, in that it’s implemented primarily by attaching attributes to your HTML markup. But where Alpine focuses on client-side state and operations, HTMX focuses on interaction with your server.
The core workflow of HTMX is: make a request to the server and swap the response into the page. At first this sounds a lot like every other AJAX workflow, but there’s a key difference: the response is returned (and rendered) as HTML.
This little detail results in a complete paradigm shift for how you do AJAX with Django. You no longer have to worry about JSON serialization, Django Rest Framework, or anything like that. Instead, your "APIs" are completely normal Django template views that return HTML. Splash in a little HTMX and presto-change-o, you have an AJAX app!
HTMX is a game-changer for the low-JS world in Django. To do it justice would require an entire standalone post—perhaps the next article in this series. But here’s a quick example that should give you the basics.
An HTMX example with Django Forms
So let’s say we want to build a little contact form. And for the purposes of our example, we’ll assume that you can contact us about anything except chimeras. Chimeras are the mortal enemies of the Pegasus!
Our Django form class for this might look something like this:
class ContactForm(forms.Form): subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100) message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea({'rows': 3}), help_text='You can message me about anything you want. ' 'Except chimeras. I hate chimeras.') sender = forms.EmailField() def clean_message(self): # Accept any message, unless it contains the word 'chimera' message = self.cleaned_data['message'] if 'chimera' in message.lower(): raise forms.ValidationError('What did I tell you about chimeras?!') return message
Now, in a typical Django architecture you'd stick this form in template, serve it with a view, and process the form submission as a POST request (typically handled by the same view)—as outlined in the Django docs here. The form submission is processed as a full-page load in the browser, and the response is rendered as a new page. This is Django 101.
But what if we wanted to submit the form asynchronously—without doing a full page reload? An asynchronous workflow can have several benefits: it's a smoother user experience, allows the form to be embedded anywhere on a page, and sends less data over the wire.
First, a demo! Fill in the form below. For bonus points, see what happens if you try to use “chimera” in the message field.
Smooth, right?
Typically an AJAX workflow like this involves a fair amount of JavaScript and breaking outside of Django forms. You might serialize the data with JSON, build the UI in a JavaScript framework like React, and submit it to a Django Rest Framework endpoint.
What’s remarkable this particular example (which uses HTMX) is that:
- It is 100% backed by standard Django views and forms.
- It doesn't require writing a single line of JavaScript code.
Let’s look at how it works.
First the definition of the form:
<form hx- {% csrf_token %} <p class="subtitle">Get in touch!</p> {{ contact_form }} <input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form>
Notice how familiar this looks!
It's almost exactly like any other Django form inside a template.
The only difference is that instead of using the standard "method" and "action" fields on the
<form> tag,
we’ve instead used some htmx-specific things.
The first is
hx-post. This is much like the standard “action” attribute—basically telling HTMX where to submit the form (via a POST).
In this case to the
'web:contact_form' URL.
The second is
hx-swap. This tells HTMX how to “swap” in the response it gets from the form submission onto the page.
In this case replacing the
outerHTML of the form itself.
Combined, these two things say: "When a user submits this form, do it as an AJAX POST to the
contact_form endpoint,
and replace the form with the response you get back."
Now let’s look at that endpoint.
First a standard URL declaration:
path('htmx/contact-form/', views.contact_form, name='contact_form'),
And the view code:
def contact_form(request): if request.method == 'POST': form = ContactForm(request.POST) if form.is_valid(): do_something_with_form_data(form.cleaned_data) return render(request, 'web/htmx_contact_form_confirm.html') else: form = ContactForm() return render(request, 'web/htmx_contact_form.html', { 'contact_form': form, })
contact_formview code.
Again, this should look very familiar, because it is a completely standard Django form view. Indeed it's almost the exact same view code as the Django docs example. If the form is valid, we process the form and return a confirmation page. If the form is not valid, then we return the rendered form with errors.
What’s in the
'web/htmx_contact_form.html template?
The exact same contents as the original form definition!
HTMX swaps it into the middle of the page, so all you need to do is return the exact same thing
(with the validation errors from the POST data now included).
Notably, the returned form is itself another HTMX form. HTMX swapped an HTMX form for another HTMX form, and this works completely seamlessly. The recursive power of HTMX to return more HTMX is one of the most powerful aspects of using it.
The only other interesting bit of the example is the “Send Another” button on the confirmation screen, so let’s take a quick look at
the
web/htmx_contact_form_confirm.html template:
<div id="contact-form-confirm"> <p>Your message was sent! Thanks!</p> <button hx- Send Another </button> </div>
This uses a similar pattern.
The
hx-get attribute says "when this button is clicked, issue a GET request to the
contact_form endpoint".
And combined, the
hx-target and
hx-swap attributes say "take the response and swap it into the div with ID
contact-form-confirm"—the
confirmation message.
The end result is that the form gets swapped back into the right spot.
You may have noticed that the endpoint it hits is the same as the submission endpoint. Much like any other Django form, we can just serve the empty form from a GET request, and HTMX (somewhat magically) handles swapping it into the right place for us to use.
Hopefully this quick example gives a sense of the power you can achieve by combining Django and HTMX. For a more comprehensive example, with inline editing and the Django ORM, check out SaaS Pegasus—the boilerplate for launching your Django app fast. Pegasus comes with several fully-working HTMX, React, and Vue example apps, as well as loads of other code to help you roll out a production Django SaaS application.

Conclusion: Choosing Low-JavaScript vs High-JavaScript
A year ago if you'd asked me whether you could (or should) build a serious Django application without entering the world of modern JavaScript, I probably would have said "no". But with Alpine and HTMX in the picture, I'm no longer sure. Being able to do on-page interactivity and AJAX without touching JavaScript addresses a lot of the problems that historically benefited from high-JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.
Is JavaScript dead? Of course not. Is JavaScript inevitable? I'm no longer sure.
There are places where JavaScript is still critical—applications that have complex UI requirements or need substantial client-side state. Can you build Google Sheets or Figma without JavaScript? Of course not.
But could you build JIRA? Maybe.
And here again we come back to personal preference. JavaScript still has a lot going for it. The ecosystem of 3rd-party packages is remarkable. JavaScript developers are easy to find. Many people—believe it or not—really like JavaScript! All of these are good reasons to reach for high-JavaScript frameworks, and you'll have a perfectly good experience if you do.
But—if you're a Django developer, you love Django, and you have no interest in learning and using JavaScript—then, yeah, maybe stay in this low-JavaScript world indefinitely. It might just work out fine.
Up next: you decide!
With this post I finally feel like the "Modern JavaScript" series has achieved broad coverage of the Django/JavaScript world. And it only took 18 months!
Still, there's plenty more to say. One thing we didn't cover in this post was our third use case for JavaScript: integrating with existing JavaScript libraries. I put this use case inside the more broad category of "maintaining your own JavaScript codebase". It's a common problem, and one that having a JavaScript toolchain helps a lot with.
Also, we only scratched the surface of what you can do with Django, Alpine, and HTMX. There's a lot more to say on both of these topics, including how to build interactive forms with Alpine, and making full-blown HTMX apps. Either of these could be its own stanadlone post.
Finally, I have gotten several requests to make a Vue guide similar to the React one.
So I've decided to let the people decide! To cast your vote, fill in this form:

The Blackhawks will also retain $750K of Maatta’s contract as part of the deal, bringing down Maatta’s salary cap number to around $3.33MM.
.”
For the Kings, the team just acquired a two-time Stanley Cup champion for practically nothing besides that two year, $3.33MM AAV price tag. Maatta, who originally signed a six-year, $24.5MM contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins back in 2016. While he has struggled with his play the last few years, he still should make an immediate impact with Los Angeles, who needs as much defensive help as it can. After star defenseman Drew Doughty, Maatta likely becomes the second best defenseman on the team as most of their defense is comprised of younger, unestablished players.
Of course, Maatta hasn’t been nearly as sharp since signing that deal, especially considering the original costly $4.1MM AAV. With only two years of more than 20 points on his offensive resume, Maatta has even had some trouble dominating on the defensive side and found himself on the Penguins’ third pairing before they traded him last offseason to Chicago. His play wasn’t much better with the Blackhawks where he put up four goals and 17 points in 65 games. However, Maatta did play better in the playoffs, posting three goals and six points in nine playoff games for Chicago.
For Chicago, it’s a great deal to free up as much cap room. The team has a number of key players it must re-sign, including unrestricted free agent goaltender Corey Crawford as well as the need to work out long-term extensions with restricted free agents Dylan Strome and Dominik Kubalik, who have become top-six players recently. Because of that, unloading Maatta’s contract was expected to occur at some point. There was some discussion that the Blackhawks had planned to buy out Maatta if they couldn’t find a trade option. With Maatta’s contract (or most of it) off the books, the team now has $11.1MM of available cap space with 16 players signed.
While the loss of Maatta takes away a veteran from the team’s defense, the Blackhawks are loaded with young defensive players who look close to NHL-ready, including Adam Boqvist, Ian Mitchell, Nicolas Beaudin and Lucas Carlsson, amongst others.
Chicago did acquire Morrison, who played 50 games at the AHL level in 2018-19, but found himself in the ECHL with the Fort Wayne Comets where he played just 17 games. A fourth-round pick of the New York Rangers in 2015, has one year remaining on his entry-level contract.
This trade feels pretty one-sided to me. While I do think Morrison has some potential and had a chance to play with the Kings in 2021. Maatta is 26, a two time cup winner, and all around good defenseman that can play some big minutes and contribute on the offense. Love it.
As a Hawks fan, I love this trade. The Hawks got out of the final year of meh defenseman with a $4m contract and didn’t have to take on a bad contract to do it. Olli can show flashes, but has never really been consistent enough to play above the 3rd pairing, at least with the Hawks.
Maybe a bit of a win-win situation. Morrison will most certainly get a contract from the Hawks and will be given the chance to play in the back six for them while Maatta can prove himself on the Kings in his final year before heading to free agency. They both fill a need for both teams with the Hawks shedding a bit of salary cap.
Maatta has 2 years left on his contract, hawks needed to shed salary to sign kubalik strome and caggiula, I know absolutely nothing about Brandon Morrison
brad, not brandon
I think this is a killer move by the kings. I think maatta has value above his play the last few years and they got him for nothing other than to eat some salary. Well done.
Kings just gotta hope Morrison doesn’t turn into the next Kubalik.
Man wouldn’t their faces be red!!!
“Two time defending Stanley Cup Champion”? Didn’t realize he played for St Louis and Tampa Bay…
Actually, Pittsburgh and Chicago won the cup these last two years. Now don’t you feel silly!
@The Mistake of Giving Eugene Melnyk a Liver Transplant – Man, I can’t leave you guys alone for a minute! “Actually, Pittsburgh and Chicago won the cup these last two years.” — You got some ‘esplainin’ to do, Lucy!
I don’t think Maatta is that great but they got an NHL defenceman for a depth prospect in their loaded system. Hard to see any downside in this deal for LA.Here it is!

There, inscribed on the inside of an old notebook, was the code.
Early in their lives, I had drummed this word into my kids’ malleable little heads.
Various relatives knew this word was the trigger to spring various locks.
It was a code word. Ours, and ours alone. Upon hearing it, my children would turn compliant and happily get into the vehicles of anyone who showed up to collect them.
It was a code word. Ours, and ours alone.
On a dark and stormy night, a pirate with an eye patch and a sidearm would be cordially invited in upon uttering the word.
If there was an alphabetic combination required, these five letters were it. The word was … pssssst … Daisy.
Daisy was the name of a family pet.
It was our secret code.
Daisy.
Who sent you?
Daisy.
Let me take your coat.
I’ve had a few codes in my life, and now I have a crossword puzzle’s worth of personal identity numbers and email addresses and passwords. With wearying regularity, I reset many of them. More than one irate clerk has looked heaven-ward as I punched in various near misses into the handheld keypad at a checkout. Three attempts seems a bit … paltry. Perhaps keypads could take a cue from game shows and offer a “care to phone a friend” lifeline? Clearly, credit-card companies don’t care about debt, so why not introduce a sporting element to the transaction?

Ordering: “Adam and Eve on a raft; easy on the axle grease.” Translation: Two poached eggs on toast, scant use of butter. At lunch counters in dustier corners of the United States, I’ve had the joy of witnessing this dying patois played out, likely for the amusement of people just like me.

Lesley Stowe looks eternally collegiate despite being a heavy hitter in the foodie world. Lesley produces those wonderful couture crackers, Raincoast Crisps, at her Richmond, B.C., factory. I had dinner with her a short while ago and some of her Rockwellian charm was dimmed. Two days earlier, by utter fluke, Lesley had missed a flight out of YVR (code). A Beechcraft King Air 100 had crashed, killing the pilot and hospitalizing virtually all passengers. She had got the news via radio while driving over the Oak Street Bridge. As the flight was filled with colleagues of hers, Lesley went immediately to the hospital. In the gasping disbelief that followed, she found herself navigating hospital privacy policies as she and other friends and family sought information.

If you watch any TV, you know hospitals use lots of codes. Code Blue is well known from hospital dramas as a cardiac arrest situation. Code Red means, you guessed it, fire. DNR stands for Do Not Resuscitate, although that is under review to be rebranded as the more benign AND, Allow Natural Death. There is a vague uniformity to these codes, but none of them are universal. The notion of codes is so ingrained, however, that medical personnel refer to many serious medical traumas simply as “coding,” as in “the patient was coding.” You may recognize this noun/verb slippage to what has happened at the Olympics: successful participants “medal.”
The military has codes galore. During the Second World War, general Dwight Eisenhower was referred to via the inelegant and more-than-a-bit mysterious moniker of Duckpin. The atomic bomb test at the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands had the bland handle of Crossroads.

I can tell you this now: We had an internal code to use if the safety of the plane was threatened by hijackers or terrorists. It was a woman’s name. If your name was Noni, you were never going to be hired by a Canadian airline. It would be equivalent to a Bernice Madoff filling in applications at an investment house.

In an era of air marshals, no-fly lists, titanium and steel-reinforced flight deck doors that have a Mossadian labrinyth of features to keep nuts at bay, the airlines still rely on a secret code word. He said if he told me the word he’d have to kill me.
Then he told me the word.
But that’s OK: I didn’t tell him about Daisy, so the kids won’t let him in the house.synonyms for woodlands

Police Chief Jim Clark said, "We are continuing the investigation, but believe the death to be the result of a homicide. Once we receive the autopsy results with an official cause of death, I anticipate charges will be filed. I want to reassure the public there is no killer on the loose as we believe the suspect is currently being held in the Wapello County Jail on other charges."Flexible working available jobs in Brierley Hill

All too many bands nowadays label themselves as the ‘old school Death Metal’ bands, but then they add little almost sing along choruses, too much melody and / or start using too much math (as in technical death metal) in their own music and consequently they use all of their primal brutality that the real old school Death Metal (beside other good things) is famous for.
This is where Noose Rot, a Minnesotan Death Metal band composed from veterans who have cut their teeth in bands like Gatecreeper and Wolvhammer, come in. Reviving the primitive and putrid of the old school death metal in a stale modern death metal with their gut wrenching take on death metal, filled with relentless riffing, grinding drumming and deep growls directly from hell. This is how destruction sounds.
This EP is the bands first release and although very short, clocking in at barely 16 minutes, it shows youngsters where their place is. Consider yourself warned, they mean business. (Black Mary)Normalization Lectures

Student Spotlight: U.S. Marine Corps Put Cheonwoo Seo on Path to Business Information Management at UCI
Originally from Seoul, South Korea, Cheonwoo Seo moved to Orange County in September 2010. After graduating from high school in 2014, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a data systems administrator for four years before earning his associate degree in business administration and economics from Cypress Community College. The newly transferred junior chose to continue his studies at UCI because of the breadth of degrees offered in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). After exploring his options, he settled on business information management (BIM) in the Department of Informatics. “I like to invent new techniques, so even if I do the same jobs and tasks every day, I can make it better and more fun,” he says. “My goal at UCI is to gain knowledge that strengthens my data systems background from the military so I can start my professional career.”
Can you talk about your service?
I joined the United States Marine Corps after high school in 2014. I served in the Headquarters and Services Company, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines as a data systems administrator. I had two deployments. The first was for six months at Camp Schwab in Okinawa, Japan, where fighting was occurring in jungle terrain. The second was for eight months in Vaernes, Norway, where fighting occurred in extremely cold weather. I decided to discharge from the service in 2018 to attend college.
Cheonwoo Seo at MCB Camp Wilson in 29 Palms, California, where his unit went for integrated training prior to his first overseas deployment in 2015.
What brought you to UCI?
I decided to attend UCI because only the Bren School of ICS offers so many computer-related degrees other than just computer science. And business information management was the one I decided to study.
What made you decide on business information management?
Ironically, I chose BIM because of the Marine Corps. I began my enlistment as an “open contract,” meaning the Marine Corps chose my Military Occupation Specialty (MOS). I kept bothering my recruiter to let me join as early as possible. I didn’t want to wait months or a year, so I agreed to be placed wherever they needed people most. So it was the Marine Corps that first started my career in data systems.
I enjoyed the service as a data systems administrator and got a meritorious promotion to corporal. I began to manage marines assigned to me under my charge tasks. I got promoted to sergeant in my third year. I loved what I was doing and spent personal time learning how to use new equipment. I loved both management and data systems, so I decided to discharge from the military to begin gaining more knowledge at UCI.
Cheonwoo Seo at the parking lot of the Communications Company, 2nd Marine Division for a simulation (left) and in Bridgeport, California, for cold weather training prior to overseas deployment in 2017 (right). In the parking lot, the blue console cable connected to the laptop was used to program the Cisco switches and router to ensure that data could be stored on the server and that the server stayed connected to the network. In Bridgeport, Seo is sitting on a server and compacted telephone switchboard. The black trash bag near his foot is protecting pre-made cables (such as ethernet and console cables) from the snow. The black cable stacked behind him is fiber optic cable.
Does school seem easy now compared to having served in the military?
I think that the military was easier, because they tell you what to do! They provided structure, giving me a job, food and a place to sleep. Now that I’m in college, I have to manage and plan my own schedule and figure out everything for myself. But watching my fellow students at UCI, who are awesome at gaining knowledge, inspires me.
What are your future plans?
I don’t think I will begin my master’s degree right after the undergraduate period because I really want to jump into industry. However, if possible, I want to continue my learning while working in industry.
How do you usually spend your Veterans Day?
For the last two years, I spent my Veterans Day at home enjoying the peace and quiet while cooking or barbequing. When I was in the service, I didn’t really have an actual day off. I might get off work early, but even when I got to the barracks, we didn’t have a kitchen to cook some kind of feast. Also, I often volunteered to take the duty of my friends who had dependents to care for. In the military, someone must always stay at the post in case something happens. However, in civilian life, I have no worries and can enjoy my day off.
Anything else you want to add?
I really want to thank all the staff at UCI and my fellow students for creating and continuing a wonderful campus culture. I am really enjoying life at UCI.
— Shani Murray

Syrians had barely come to terms with the latest regime attacks on the north-western Idlib province, which made over 60 health facilities inoperable and displaced over 1 million civilians. News of a looming medical catastrophe so huge it collapses the most advanced medical systems in the world, is still barely comprehensible to most. So far people’s reactions have shifted from negating the severity of the pandemic, to distrust in official regime numbers, to cynicism over what form of death there is left for them to survive, to the plain nihilism of not trying to save themselves anymore.
Diverse medical realities on the ground
After over 9 years of conflict, the country is currently split into three control areas, and such fragmentation also impacts management of the coronavirus crisis. Two thirds of the country has been returned to regime control with Russian and Iranian support since 2015. The other two parts are the northeast under Kurdish-led, US-backed, Syrian Democratic forces, known as the Autonomous Administration areas, and the rebel-led northwest, under no real central administration, but with a clear upper hand for Turkey-backed forces and institutions. The medical infrastructure and preparedness also differ from one zone to the next, with much reliance on local and international NGOs and aid in northern areas. However, those differences remain marginal, compared to the scale of response needed to confront such a tsunami.
A recent report released by LSE has estimated the country’s overall capacity for treating COVID-19 patients at around 6,500 cases, in a country with a population estimate of over 17 million. According to their calculations, there are only 325 available ICU beds with ventilators in the whole of Syria. They are disproportionately distributed, with the highest concentration in the hands of the regime (ca. 200 in the capital and the coast alone), while the city of Dier Ezzour, for instance, has none, despite being swamped with Iranian militias, believed to be the main source of virus entry into Syria.
China and Russia lead an international call to lift sanctions against the regime under the pretext of prioritising health over politics, but the regime still refuses to allow international monitors into its detention centres, let alone release the tens of thousands of political prisoners believed to be crowded together in inhumane conditions, potentially turning into gas-chamber situations any minute.
Regime areas: a healthcare system with depleted resources
After about a month of jokes about the brazen regime denial of COVID-19 cases, by mid-March, confirmed cases in Pakistan and Iraq officially reported to have arrived there from Syria forced the regime to admit the presence of only 1 case. It then immediately moved on to measures like shutting down schools and universities, imposing a night curfew, and halting reserve drafting. Some travelers coming in from Iran were put into inadequate quarantine facilities as the last flights arrived before airports were closed. Land borders currently only allow emergency cases, military and essential commercial goods to pass, in addition to aid. The regime has since admitted the existence of 5 more cases, and 2 deaths only. Leaks form hospital staff about a sudden rise in fatal "asthma and respiratory disease" cases sweep through the country. No reporting has yet been able to estimate what the real number of cases may be, and not many care to investigate. The war, destruction, economic collapse, sanctions, skyrocketing levels of corruption and security chaos left medical services at less than half their original capacity, even in the least damaged areas.
Huda M., a 45-year-old school teacher in Damascus has a 19-year-old daughter with a heart condition, due to repeated shocks during the war: “We're staying at home, only going out with masks on, cleaning and disinfecting all day. I've bought regular flu medication, it’s not like there is a cure for it yet anyway. We know we don’t stand a chance at a turn in the hospitals after all the military members, the corrupt and influential, the rich that bribe staff… it’s best to die with decency at home”.
Huda’s middle-class income and small household allows her the “luxury” of social distancing in a clean home, as prices for detergents and face masks have rocketed out of regulation control to over tenfold their original price. Almost all other basic goods have had increases, although smaller, in prices, and government-subsidised goods are only a cause of worry as people crowd their outlets to get their share. Over 80% of Syrians today live below the poverty line, as the currency value dropped from 45 Syrian pounds per US Dollar in 2011, to around 1150 according to the latest estimates.
The Northeast in desperate need of medical resources
Under the somewhat organised Autonomous Administration, this area has the weakest medical resources. It has less than 25 ICU ventilators for an estimated population of over 4 million, 600,000 of whom are displaced and about 100,000 living in rough and makeshift camps. A recent cut in water supply from the Turkish side took much local and foreign pressure to get desperately needed water back to those camps, some of which hold the families of ISIS fighters. A recent jailbreak in the central prison of Al Hasakeh by the imprisoned ISIS members there went almost entirely without any news coverage, as everyone has bigger worries now.
The area’s first defence line so far has been the organisation of its administration that enjoys more local credibility than what the regime has in its areas. Schools and universities were closed, the annual New Roz festivity of 21 March was cancelled, borders were shut and a lockdown was announced even before any cases were reported.
Lack of test kits, medical staff and facilities remains a huge concern for the population, which doubts the area’s ability to detect any cases. Samples are being sent to the northwest for testing, despite political alliances with the regime reportedly being better and the WHO overtly prioritising government-controlled areas over rebel-held territories in aid supply.
Prices of basic goods, except for bread, have also started to rise. There are doubts as to the ability of the local administration to enforce a long quarantine with most people depending on the daily odd job or money transfers from family members oversees they can no longer receive with borders closed and international sanctions complicating bank transfers.
Abu Abdallah, a 34-year-old truck driver from the city of Raqqa with a chronic digestive illness told us: “People are more scared for their livelihoods. They are starting to display symptoms of bankruptcy, not corona symptoms. This is scary. In war and relative chaos…"
Will the war-ravaged Northwest survive coronavirus?
Most of the province of Idlib and some parts of rural Aleppo and Lattakia remain outside of regime control, but not really under any single organised rule either. This makes enforcing any quarantine measures particularly complicated. The population estimates are around 4 million, about 1 million of whom live in poorly constructed camps, or even caves and olive groves. Access to water and sanitation and health services are beyond modest for this population. Local medical sources say there are only about 240 ICU beds and 100 ventilators available in the entire area. The WHO has so far sent only 600 of the 2,000 testing kits it had planned for this zone, and local doctors confirm there have not yet been any cases detected.
This comes as somewhat of a relief to locals, who tend to trust those sources. But they know this can only be controlled for so long. Civil society organisations, very active in all aspects of life in the area, have been on full force to spread awareness of the importance of social distancing and hand washing, knowing how hard it is for a displaced family of 15 people living in one tent to stay home. The most difficult challenge they encounter has been a tendency for some to think that after surviving years of regime shelling, chemical attacks, hunger sieges and displacement, a flu virus is not going to kill them. This does not come from ignorance, argue some of those workers, but from a mental state that simply needs the denial. Cecelya Taweel, a local activist in rural Idlib, explained through Facebook a reaction she faced last week: “We were distributing brochures in the shops in a village near Afrin, when a man came up to us and tore them up, saying we don’t have corona here”. On Tuesday, she posted a statement saying the village mosque was going to announce quarantine, requiring everyone to go home.
Despite the grimness of the overall reality, people still console themselves with the hope that the virus will be less contagious as it warms up in spring, or that the youthfulness of the population will minimise casualties.Collaboration

Explore Our Magical Underwater World
September-2021
It is no secret that our founders, Vanessa and Jasper, are great lovers of discovering the underwater world, and they are experienced divers with logged dives across the oceans. V&J plans diving expeditions to the shores of the Azores; the clear waters of the Caribbean Sea; the glowing plankton-rich depths surrounding Hawaiian Islands; the coral triangle in the western Pacific Ocean; or a mere encounter with whales in the Tasman Sea. “Diving shows you a complete different world, so beautiful that is difficult to express in words.”- Vanessa Mestre.
In Jacques Cousteau own words “the sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever”. More than 70% of the planet is made of our oceans and more than 80% of our oceans is unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored – there is still so much to learn from the mysteries of the deep. From past experience working offshore and from their diving adventures, Vanessa and Jasper bring their luggage to the table, and we will provide the most exceptional diving vacations and expeditions. Together with world renown underwater photographers, marine biologists, and researchers we create unparalleled diving expeditions to the most remote and beautiful paradises around the world.
We have put together some of our favourite diving spots, for anyone that travels the globe in search of that one, unforgettable, diving day. Shipwrecks, vibrant reefs, or dancing with whales, each spot is a unique portal into the mysterious, beautiful world beneath the ocean's surface that awaits us.
V&J only works with private dive instructors and dive centres that prioritise environmental conservation and educational tourism, protecting the unspoiled beauty that attracts scuba divers from all over the world.
Cocos Island (Costa Rica)
When the topic is diving, Cocos Island will absolutely be mentioned in that conservation. Known as one of the most extraordinary places to dive, it is also a highly protected UNESCO world heritage site. The uninhabited Island, 550 km (340 miles) west of the Pacific shore of Costa Rica, and halfway to the Galapagos Islands, offers divers exceptional marine splendour. With a rich history of pirates, whalers, Tongan captives and German adventurers, scuba diving at Cocos Island truly earned the spot on the world map as a top diving destination, with supreme shark experiences in a Pacific playground for schooling hammerheads, manta rays, whale sharks, endangered sea turtles, humpback whales and many more. With the correct weather conditions, it promises diving schedules as many as 3 or 4 dives per day, to explore these ocean waters that are exploding with sea life and ready to unlock unforgettable experiences.
Revillagigedo Islands
This is the place for high octane diving. Exciting, demanding and, for the experienced diver, very rewarding. The Revillagigedo Islands are located south-west of Cabo San Lucas, at the tip of Baja California. There are few other destinations in the world where we can encounter such an impressive array of “big beasts” – humpback whales, giant manta rays, hammerhead sharks, dolphins, tuna, pelagic fish, and many other shark species. At Guadalupe Island you can get an encounter with great white sharks in superb visibility.
The “closest’ island to the mainland is San Benedicto, 390 km offshore, which has become famous among divers around the world for the dive known as El Boiler – a pinnacle covered in corals and patrolled by manta rays and sharks. Nearly 50 km to the south of San Benedicto lies Socorro Island. Also known as the aquarium, Socorro has manta ray cleaning stations as well as several pinnacles where schools of hammerhead sharks are often seen and bottlenose dolphins visit sites, such as Cabo Pearce, almost daily and long encounters are a frequent occurrence. Around 315 km to the west of Socorro is the infrequently visited Clarion Island. Not much is known about Clarion other than it is still relatively unexplored.
The Coral Triangle
The only region where all together, new and unimaginable forms of life, may perhaps be found. Coral reefs account for less than 1% of ocean floor yet they are home to more than twenty 25% of marine life. In a time when much of world’s reefs are dying due to ocean acidification and rising of sea temperature, less than 1% of the world’s reefs are in a pristine state. The world’s finest reefs can be found within the Coral Triangle of Indonesia, where the Pacific and Indian Oceans converge.
Marine scientists recorded over 76% of all known hard coral species and 52% of identified Indo-Pacific reef fish species within this region. When combining both land and sea-based species, Indonesia ranks number one in the world. The diversity goes beyond the kaleidoscopic coral reefs and reef fish. The larger pelagic species can be seen constantly on the move to hunt prey. This includes oceanic manta rays, the great hammerhead shark, the giant sun fish, and the thresher shark as well as the world’s largest living animal, the blue whale and the world’s largest fish, the whale shark.
Have a look at our Raja Ampat voyage, step aboard a wooden schooner build by the Konjo Tribesman with 21st century engineering and sail the Coral Triangle on an exceptional sea safari that is created to your inspiration and requirements.
Tonga
The friendly Islands, also known as Tonga, are called the Friendly Islands because of its friendly reception toward Captain Cook during his first visit in 1773. The Islands exist out of 169 islands located in the Southern Pacific Ocean. Stretching over 800 kilometres and with a total surface area of 750 km2, only 96 of these islands are inhabited. Tonga lies South of Samoa, about a third of the way between New Zealand and Hawaii. Tonga is known as one of the few places in the world where you can swim on a safe distance with humpback whales. These magnificent creatures pass through the islands between the months of July and October to mate and give birth. They then leave for their Arctic feeding grounds. In addition to humpback whales, divers can encounter manta rays, eagle rays, many shark species, and other diverse marine life in the area. The underwater geography is just as diverse as its marine life; with dive sites containing everything from coral gardens to caverns and vertical walls, Tonga truly has something for everyone.Autism and the coronavirus
Parents with a child or children with a disability are facing a challenging moment in regards to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. School closings, social distancing, businesses shutting down, sporting events and leagues on hiatus, along with health professionals saying enough isn’t being done just adds to the daily growing concerns for a family with a special needs child. As a parent with a child on the autism spectrum this is by far one of the most concerning times as a family with a child that’s non-verbal.
They can’t express if they’re not feeling well so constant monitoring of their temperature is imperative especially if appear to be not feeling well. They’re daily routine is disrupted leading to confusion and anxiety so engagement in creative activities like art, music even gardening is helpful with perpetuating academic and social development. Our son, Noah who deals with allergies, especially this time of year, has us on edge with every sneeze and sniffle and brings a constant concern with explaining to people in stores that everything is ok, he’s autistic, non-verbal and has allergies. How long will this last, how long will schools be shut down, businesses close and social distancing a daily practice? No one can say with certainty. So, parents with a special needs child or children stay woke, aware and continue to love unconditionally.

Otherwise, health workers will exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right to walk out and strike. With 9,000 employees, the system begins to falter.
The answer to the announcement by the Austrian Minister of Health Dr. Wolfgang Mückstein, in February 2022 one general compulsory vaccination introducing was tremendous. In Vienna, over a hundred thousand people took to the streets last Saturday to express their protest about this coercion, which is even threatened with imprisonment. In addition, there were countless people who demonstrated on the same and the following day in other cities – including Linz, Salzburg, Graz and Innsbruck. All in all, a more than clear signal.
Well organized Resistance on a broad scale. Active Police officers from Vorarlberg wrote a letter to the public, politicians, the chambers and trade unions as well as the police headquarters. In it they asked the addressees, among other things, to rethink the current course and restore social peace. The authors were represented at the demonstration in Vienna under the banner “Policemen for Freedom and Fundamental Rights”. Report24 reported.
Austria becomes the land of the disenfranchised
At the forefront in the action stands the medical staff. Prof. Bhakdi is convinced that this has in common the power, the responsible Forcing decision-makers to rethink. It is supported in Austria by MFG Austria and FAN, the newly founded interest group for freelance workers. In their opinion “Compulsory vaccination for all – power excess of an inferior federal government“Of November 22, 2021, MFG summarizes the current situation as follows:
- Two top representatives of the Austrian federal government, not elected by the people, announce an immediate lockdown for everyone and a general vaccination requirement from February 2022.
- Neither of the two measures can be objectively justified.
- Austria already took one through the lockdown for unvaccinated people worldwide totalitarian pioneering role a.
- The people will being held hostage by means of disinformation held. It is deliberately lied to and should continue to fear as intensely as possible.
- The two core elements of the political fear propaganda, the “daily new infections” and the horror reports to the intensive care units, do not stand up to scrutiny.
- The number of tests carried out was more than tenfold compared to the previous year.
- The bed capacities were not increased, but gradually reduced. In Corona times and also in the decade before.
- ÖVP and SPÖ are responsible for saving the health system from damage.
- The announced Vaccination is compulsory contrary to fundamental rights, violates all elementary principles of the protection of fundamental rights. The choice of words and diction of the President of the Medical Association are reminiscent of the darkest times.
- the Covid vaccination may for lack of establishment of sterile immunity no game changer be.
- Constitutional Court and international fundamental rights bodies would have to provide a corresponding Act immediately unconstitutional explain. For such a procedure – especially with an experimental substance – there is neither medical nor legal basis.
- Austria becomes the land of the disenfranchised.
- In just a year and a half, Austria became constitutionally and socio-psychologically to the level of a below-average developing country shut down.
- Those responsible for this decline become Accountability to be pulled. A mere one Sorry will then not suffice.
The legal arguments are clear
After MFG informed both Health Minister Mückstein and numerous other addressees via an open letter that “a Compulsory vaccination for health professionals and for the general public From a constitutional point of view, it is simply inadmissible and gives rise to liability for those responsible” is …
See: MFG clarifies in a letter to Mückstein: Compulsory vaccination is unconstitutional!
… the party is now stepping up and announcing again that the health workers will implement their announcement that they will stop working if a Covid vaccination obligation is introduced: “We know from our wing of employees that thousands of healthcare workers in the case of compulsory vaccination, theirs Quit work will. Especially since the right to stoppage and strike is constitutionally guaranteed and protected. ”On the MFG website reads this announcement as follows (reproduction in full, emphasis by editorial staff):
MFG to Mückstein: Almost 9,000 employees in the health sector are threatened with strike
With FAN (free workers), MFG founded its own wing of employees
The publicly announced Compulsory vaccination for health professionals and for the general public In no way justified from a medical or scientific point of view and legally unconstitutional. This also divides society further. Meanwhile, the young party MFG has founded a sub-organization with FAN that gathers workers in the health sector. And this occurs now with clear demands in an open letter to BM Mückstein: The minister may wish the medically senseless, fundamental rights violation and society-divisive Withdraw notice of mandatory vaccination. One hopes to give in. If not, so will a strike cannot be ruled out. And this announcement has serious consequences: if the almost 9,000 FAN employees in the health sector go out of their way, the system starts to falter.
Why the compulsory vaccination is categorically rejected:
- the vaccination granted no sterile immunityIt is still possible for the vaccinated person to become infected,
- consequently a vaccinated doctor, nurse, etc. can endanger the patient through the possibility of infection
- therefore it is difficult to argue with a vaccination in order to prevent a risk of infection (in the health sector)
- All vaccination approvals are in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 507/2006 limited he follows
- moreover stand massive constitutional concerns against an announced compulsory vaccination
Vaccination damage is concealed
“If you take into account the comprehensively documented cases of the most serious vaccine damage, then that means Compulsory vaccination even one Interference with the right to life according to Art. 2 E-MRK ”, so RA Dr. Michael Brunner, Federal Chairman of the MFG. This right is indispensable, even if an interference in the interests of public health would actually be necessary. It is also according to the Nuremberg Code Forbidden to force anyone to participate in a medical experiment. “Any participation in a vaccination campaign must, among other things, be free, self-determined, without coercion, cunning, fraud and with complete clarification of the facts and legal situation,” said Brunner.
Health homework was not done
In the open letter it is also reminded that the real problems in health facilities are not the corona virus, but among other things numerous other pathogens, including multi-resistant bacteria, due to hygienic omissions. The one is also of real drama Well-known care emergency for years in healthcare, as well as the Lack of staff among doctors. So instead of spending large budgets on senseless lockdowns and corona tests, it would make much more sense to put the money into the Increase in health workforce and for preventive measures to invest.
“We know from our wing of workers that thousands of healthcare workers will go out of work if they are vaccinated. Especially since the right to stoppage and strike is constitutionally guaranteed and protected ”, concludes Brunner.
Helicopter Tilt Control
Helicopter Tilt Control
A swash plate is used to control the pitch of the rotor blades in order to steer the helicopter in the air.
A flying machine is usually steered in the air by varying the angle of rotation around three axes: longitudinal (roll), crosswise (pitch), and vertical (yaw). In airplanes the roll is controlled by the ailerons, the pitch is controlled by the elevators, and the yaw is controlled by the rudder.
In helicopters the rotating main blades (with an airfoil cross section) take care of roll and pitch, while the yaw is controlled by the tail rotor. For roll and pitch, the blades are turned around their respective longitudinal axes with the help of the swash plate drive. As a result, the angle of attack of the air changes at the rotating blade, and consequently the lift on the blade is changed. When the swash plate is horizontal, then the lift is equal at every blade. As soon as the swash plate is tilted, the lift on the blades changes and causes a turning moment on the helicopter.
The tilt of the lower swash plate is adjusted by the pilot. The rotating swash plate is placed on the lower swash plate on a bearing. The rotating blades are attached to the rotor shaft. The control rods attached to the rotating swash plate are what cause the adjustment of the blades. … Continue reading US National Intelligence Document Reveals Crypto As Top Threat to US Dollar

Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 1 Corinthians 8:8,9 NIV
Observation: Paul teaches about food sacrificed to idols and how consuming it may affect another’s belief.
Application: Paul teaches us that even though what we eat does not determine our eternal fate, what we eat or do or how we act may cause another person to sin. We must be sensitive to the unbelievers and immature believers around us.
Prayer: Father, help me to be aware of how my words and actions affect others. I ask this in Jesus’ name. Amen
DougJust as you must make sure to keep your children safe, you must do the same for your pets. When you’re big burly dog steps between you and a stranger ready to defend you if necessary, it’s easy to forget that your bold protector is the same dog who runs from the vacuum cleaner. Even the most ferocious felines and courageous canines can find themselves in trouble when navigating the human world unsupervised. These four simple steps will keep your favorite fur baby safe.
Microchip Your Pet
Microchipping your pet is an excellent way to safeguard him. If your pet is lost or stolen, his identification tags may end up missing or being intentionally removed. A microchip, however, is located inside the animal where it is sure to stay with him. Although you will have to keep the information in your pet’s file up to date when you move or change your number, doing so is much simpler and more convenient than having new tags made.
Install Cameras
Security cameras can help keep your pet safe both inside and outside your home. Unfortunately, pets are sometimes stolen out of fenced yards. A visible security camera will deter potential thieves while a hidden camera may catch them in the act so the police can identify the crook and retrieve your beloved pet. Monitored security cameras are useful inside your home as well. They let you keep an eye on pet sitters when you’re out of town and allow you to keep an eye on your pet. If he gets into something he shouldn’t while you’re not home, footage from your camera may help you determine what it was so you can get the right medical care.
Childproof Everything
We got lucky when our cat figured out how to open the kitchen cabinets: she let us know she could open them before she got into any of the poisonous cleaning agents that live under our kitchen sink. Unfortunately, not all pet owners are as lucky. Make sure you childproof everything your pet can reach so that he doesn’t find his way into foods, medications, cleaning supplies and other chemicals that he shouldn’t. Make sure your trash can is secure as well. Know what plants are toxic to your pet and keep them out of your home and garden. You may feel silly doing it, but crawl around your house and really take a look at things from your pet’s perspective. Eliminate attractive nuisances like hanging tablecloth tails and accessible electrical cords as soon as you find them.
Sterilize Your Pet
Spaying and neutering prevent unwanted animals and greatly reduce the risk of certain medical problems later in your pet’s life. These procedures also make your pet less likely to go looking for trouble. Sterilizing your pet won’t turn him into a perfect angel, but it will reduce his desire to try and escape your home or yard. Sterilized animals are less likely to involve themselves in fights and are much more apt to be content hanging out at home or in the yard without trying to get out.
These few simple safety tips will go a long way toward keeping your pet happy, healthy and safe. In addition to taking these steps, keep your vet’s phone number handy and know where your local pet emergency clinic is before you need it, just in case. It’s also a good idea to keep a pet first aid kit handy with an extra leash, gauze pads, antibacterial wipes and some other basics. It takes only a few minutes of time to look at the world through your pet’s eyes and take some simple steps to keep him out of trouble.This Will Be Your Future | Specialty Vehicles | Executive Transport JetVan

Why should I pick TitleTap for my website?
How much does a TitleTap website cost?
What is included in a TitleTap website?
What if I still want a 100% unique custom website for my company?
So, can my competitors get the same website as me?
How Is TitleTap different from a Local Marketing Agency?
Websites by local marketing agencies typically cost between $5,000-$10,000 and can take 8-10 months of your time because the provider knows nothing about your business.
As such, those general marketing companies will typically rely on you to tell them what you want on your website, not only for content but for the security and compliance pieces specific to the Title and Legal industries.
If you aren’t as familiar with all the website related best practices, it could lead to some really wide gaps and your website not performing as well as it could compared to your competition.
From an ongoing management perspective, it is not uncommon for marketing agencies to send you off on your own or charge an hourly rate of $100 to make changes.
Not to mention 2-3 years later your website design has gone stale and you have to start the process involving your time and money all over again.
TitleTap only works with Law Firms and Title Companies. As such, we not only know what is effective in your business, we also have starter content about your practice areas or services that you can customize and industry specific blog posts to help you automatically rank higher in online search (SEO).
In short, you won’t need to train us about your industry on your dime as you would with a local marketing agency.
Plus we are typically a lot more affordable and flexible than a local marketing firm since we don’t charge a large amount upfront, don’t have expensive contracts, have a 60 day money back guarantee and we offer free design upgrades every 3 years so your website can always look up-to-date and have the latest best practices.

We want to provide a great service at an even better price with no contracts. As such we are not in the business of holding you hostage to our service. However, due to our proprietary software we’ve created to build and maintain our customer’s websites faster, easier, industry specific and more secure, our website designs cannot be exported to a third party as they wouldn’t work without our proprietary software running on our servers.
That said, we understand that your business’ needs can change over time.
TitleTap has 2 “exit” options to migrate Customer’s Website content and images to the host of Customer’s choice:
- TitleTap offers a Website export at any time for no additional charge as long as the Customer’s payments are up-to-date and the customer’s website domain has been live on our platform for at least 1 year. This will give the Customer a download or multiple downloads of Customer’s pages, content, and images such as photos, logos, and text but not the website design, website builder, calculator, videos, email marketing or other proprietary tools or content on the website. Then Customer can pay another developer to download WordPress, install it to the hosting plan of Customer’s choice, pick or build a new design template, and import Customer’s Website data that we exported. This option would require Customer to have another developer design a site for Customer, configure the menu, and make other adjustments, but all the non-proprietary pages, content, and images would be intact. If the product is offered a la carte by TitleTap, the calculators, widgets, and software add-ons shall be subject to additional subscription fees.
- If a customer needs more help in migrating website providers such as importing the export file above into the new system, DNS changes, or any advice or recommendation then TitleTap requires a one-time fee of $799.00 to be paid upfront before migration help can be given. Please note that this payment does not include a website redesign, website design services or any help implementing the migration other than pointing the domain, help changing the nameservers, recommending alternatives, and importing the data to the new site. Also the window for engagement with this option closes 30 days after the payment has been made. No other assistance can be given beyond that point. If offered a la carte by TitleTap, the calculators, widgets, and software add-ons may be subject to additional subscription fees.Ultimate Guide: How to Prepare Your Property for Real Estate Photography

A Week Before the Shoot:
1.Exterior
The exterior of the home is going to be the first thing that captures potential buyers attention. Therefore, it is important that your clients review the following pre shoot checklist so that it is photo ready for the day of the shoot.
Clean up the yard. You want to have the basic landscaping needs done as well as add additional touches to really give the home some curb appeal.
Weed flower beds, cut the grass and add fresh mulch or seasonal flowers.
The exterior of the house, driveways, patios, decks, walkways, and the front porch should be pressure washed.
Clean all windows and doors outside.
If you have a pool make sure it’s cleaned as well.
Also, clean any outdoor furniture or lawn décor.
2. Interior
Go through each room and clean up any of the clutter. You don’t want to have stacks of paper or items on shelves, tables or on the floors.
Check to make sure all the lights in the home are working.
Deep clean all the rooms. Clean the carpets, wipe down the walls, clean the windows and window seals, and scrub the floors and bathroom tiles.
Don’t forget to give all the light switches, doors, and cabinets a good cleaning as well.
On the Day of The Shoot:
1. Exterior
You want to make sure the cars are not parked in the driveway or directly in front of the home.
Keep garbage cans, garden hoses, sprinklers, lawn mowers, and any other garden or landscape tools out of sight.
All toys, pool items, and other personal items should be removed from the yard or outdoor space.
Review the cushions on patio furniture.
Sweep the walkways, front porch, and patio to remove leaves and debris.
2. Interior.
Open all curtains and/or turn the blinds horizontally in each room.
Sweep, vacuum, and mop all floors.
Turn on all lights including lamps but keep ceiling fans off.
Try to keep any cables, wires or power cords hidden and out of sight.
If there is a pet you want to clear away any toys and beds from the rooms and remove the pet dishes.
Keep all televisions and computers off and hide the remote controls.
3. Kitchen and dining room:
Wipe off the countertops and tables.
Remove any towels, sponges, dishes and soap dispensers from the counters, tables and sink and store them somewhere out of sight.
Take down any items you have hanging on the refrigerator like magnets, pictures or stickers.
Keep trash cans out of sight.
Consider placing fresh flowers or a fruit bowl on the counter top.
For the dining room table, set out a nice place settings or add a centerpiece.

5. Bedrooms:
Clear floors and make beds.

Said one teen of Pentatonix's musical skills, "The things they can do with just their voices is ridiculous." Ridiculous, indeed.

Responsible Disclosure Program (VDPBW) 2021
One year has now passed since the Bundeswehr made public the first vulnerability disclosure policy (vdpbw) for a responsible disclosure program. Since our security researchers always like to be the first to test and actively participate in a bug bounty or responsible disclosure program, we naturally started this time as well.
Many security researchers from all over germany and even the eu participated in the program. Approximately 100 valid security vulnerabilities were submitted. The bundeswehr is already talking about a great success of the "VDPBW" program. One security researcher from the vulnerability-lab team, whom we all know particularly well as the usual suspect "Benjamin Mejri (Kunz)", has once again hit the bell of success.
Benjamin Kunz Mejri has reported about the most valid vulnerabilities to the security management of the German Armed Forces within 1 year. Among the reported vulnerabilities were bugs such as sql-injections, file-inclusions, code-executions, information disclosure, cross-site-scripting, misconfigurations or access vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, we cannot discuss the individual vulnerabilities and their technical details or exploitability in the Bundeswehr program within the public.
Due to the large number of the researcher's reports on all services, the security researcher Benjamin Kunz Mejri was able to reach the 1st rank with 28 reports in the Bundeswehr security program VDPBW after the first year. At the same time, he encouraged and supported the participation of other independent security researchers from germany as well as the european union.
A few days ago, we received an official invitation letter from the Bundeswehr that there will be a special meetup for the best security researchers in Bonn. Like in the governmental programs of other countries, we have thus our first success in germany with the government to chalk up, which was captured in some shining picture for the whitehat eternity.

We would like to thank the Bundeswehr and especially Generalmajor Setzer (CISOBW) for the acknowledgement, efforts and invite. Our team will continue to test and we hope that other researchers will participate in the program as well. Hopefully our good example for cooperation and exchange can be used by other german institutions to apply and recognize responsible disclosure as a valid technology.

Dexter:
-Green Long Sleeve Henley Shirt
-Khaki Cargo Pants
-Black Apron
-Face Shield (purchased at Home Depot)
– Syringes
Victim:
-Nude Slip (or could be nude underwear if you’re daring)
-Saran Wrap (used 1 1/2 rolls)
-Clear Tape
-Fake blood
-Plastic knife (blade cut off)
-Dexter cut tattoo
Instructions for Victim:
The easiest way to wrap yourself is in 3 parts (top, bottom, & middle). This process is much easier if you have someone to help you wrap yourself. First, start by wrapping the top part on yourself. If you twist and turn the saran wrap, it will create cool effects and hide whatever you are wearing underneath.
Second, do the bottom half of your body. The trick is to stand with you legs open at least shoulder width apart so that the saran wrap is not too tight. This will allow you to walk, move around, and be able to lift your dress up to go to the bathroom.
Lastly, wrap your midsection. Wrap a couple of times and then drop some fake blood and continue to wrap until you hare satisfied. If you want to include a knife, simple cut off the plastics blade and leave only a small part of it so that you can wrap it around. Clear tape works well as well.
Tips:
- Make sure to add some clear tape to the ends when you finish wrapping.
- This costume will make you hot, so be sure to drink plenty of water.
- Be careful going to the bathroom. Gently and slowly slide the bottom part up.

How Alzheimer's Disease Impacts the Brain
November 26, 2019
One condition becoming all too common today is Alzheimer’s disease, a brain condition that is the 6 th leading cause of death in the United States. The Alzheimer’s Association defines the disease as “a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behavior.” Alzheimer’s (also sometimes called senile dementia) doesn’t happen all at once. In fact, the symptoms may at first be dismissed as simply “getting older,” if doctors and family members aren’t vigilant. Early symptoms include relatively small issues like trouble learning new things or remembering details. Eventually, the...Continue Reading

March 5, 2018
Head injuries are often some of the scariest injuries to occur. With car accidents, falls, or other trauma, a possible head injury is one of the primary concerns for doctors. But even a seemingly innocent head bump or "hard knock" could lead to a more serious brain injury. March is Brain Injury Awareness Month. Take the time to get the facts so that you can be vigilant in understanding these types of injuries. Brain Injury Overview: Different Types of Brain Injuries Though there are many types of brain injuries, there are two general categories called traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired...Continue Reading“Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast”. – Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass

Despite the poor reviews for the Phillips Curve, Janet & Company must cling to something; it’s the “give me a model” mentality, no matter its detachment from the real world.
Some are expecting a repudiation of the Phillips Curve tomorrow and tacit confirmation of the view the Fed has no idea if inflation will materialize. Therefore, err on the side of continued ease.
The expectation for a dovish Fed tomorrow is likely one reason the US.

All the Cool Tech in the EV6By Jordan Rodriguez | Posted in Kia Dealers in Miami FL, Miami Kia Dealers on Thursday, May 27th, 2021 at 10:29 am
.
Consumers can expect some of the industry standards to appear, such as Bluetooth functionality, wireless smartphone charging, and a Premium Audio system, this time from Meridian. The Kia EV6 comes available with a 14-speaker sound system with titanium dome for an immersive and rich audio experience, most likely on the GT trim. Has anyone else noticed how some old audio systems used to make the music louder the faster the car was driving? The EV6 now does this intentionally with Intelli Q technology corrects audio volume/sound quality according to vehicle speed change.
UVO Link
UVO Link has been steadily advancing and growing for Kia Motors vehicles. Getting better with every model year, Kia Corp is taking over the system soon and integrating UVO into its “Hello Kia” or another virtual assistant. For now, UVO link keeps consumers connected to their vehicles and enjoy a variety of features. Many automakers are offering consumers new ways to get merch or accessories for vehicles with in-car commerce experiences and transactions. Kia Pay lets consumers do this from inside the vehicle with a growing number of merchants and outlets being added to the collection.
Using technology to its advantage, the Kia EV6 comes with available Add-On customer convenience Map and Infotainment Over-The-Air (OTA) capability, a Wi-Fi Hotspot, connected weather for up to date weather in more than 25,000 cities, an app that works with smartwatches to provide select information, enhanced voice assist for voice commands in the cabin, and even smart speaker integration that allows consumers to connect their Amazon-Alexa or Google-Assistant to their vehicle.
Making GPS navigation more convenient, Connected Routing is also available, using a Kia cloud to provide the driver with real-time maps, predicted traffic info based on historical information, and AI to learn the preferred routes of its users. Kia Motors recently released Last Mile Navigation, a feature that we’ll all love, a system that provides walking directions to the driver’s actual destination, not when the car is in the general vicinity of the location. Also convenient for those of us who forget where we park, on-demand Find My Car with Surround View Monitor can send images to the user’s smartphone of the surrounding area.
In need of assistance, 911 Connect and Roadside Assistance provides assistance with a built-in modem if an airbag deploys by dialing 911. For non-emergencies, like a flat tire, the 24/7 roadside assistance Is still helpful, and able to share the vehicle’s location, no more guessing where you are on Alligator Alley. On the same note, stolen vehicle recovery is an available feature and can help assist law enforcement agencies recover a stolen vehicle.
As always, Kia is all about safety. Starting with something simple like blue light-filtered screens to reduce eye strain and fatigue, the EV6 comes with all kinds of available and advanced safety features. These include a Surround View Monitor (SVM), Parking Collision-Avoidance Assist-Reverse (PCA-R), Rear Occupant Alert (ROA, Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA), Safe Exit Assist (SEA). There are also 21 standard active Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), such as Blind-Spot Avoidance Assist (BCA), Driver Attention Warning (DAW); and a suite of Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA) with FCA-Ped (Pedestrian), FCA-LS (Land-Change Side), FCA-LO (Lane-Change Oncoming), FCA-JC (Junction Crossing), and FCA-JT (Junction Turning). Highway Driving Assist II (HDA 2), ISLA (Intelligent Speed Limit Assist), Navigation Based Smart Cruise Control-Curve (NSCC-C), and Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Avoidance Assist (RCCA) can also be found in the EV6.
The electric vehicle is surely a technological revolution for Kia Corp. Coming straight to America, you can find your new Kia EV6 very soon at Miami Lakes Automall Kia.

Landis, the project manager of Fort Lauderdale-based AlliedBean Demolition, was hit by a projectile from the building's collapse, according to CNN. Emergency crews arrived promptly after the incident to secure the area and search for injured victims. Fortunately, they found that no one else was injured by the collapse.
The incident is under investigation by the police. Police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez states that the search and rescue efforts have ended and the department is now leading a criminal investigation. Inspectors confirmed that the adjacent buildings are safe.
According to Albert Cabada, owner of the restoration company GC Construction, the building was to be demolished in sections but instead it collapsed completely. "As far as I could tell they were scrambling before the collapse to close the streets. It was poorly planned, in my opinion," he said. He also added that the collapse was down to the removal of large sections of structural load-bearing walls on the front of the building. Canada was working on the building next door which is now encased in dust.
Luis Leon, the president of the general contractor on the development project company, Winmar Construction, stated that a "construction accident" occurred during the permitted demolition. According to Leon, another company, Allied Bean Demolition was subcontracted to do the demolition and was responsible for the demolition work. Allied Bean Demolition made no comments for the incident according to CNN.
The building was approved to be demolished in order to make room for new condos, according to the property developer Multiplan Real Estate Asset Management. The new construction will feature up to 87 high-end residences and will include a beach-facing pool, lounge and social area.

Regardless of the specific issues on which consumers focused, however, their assessments of the issues seemed to reflect a single underlying perception of changes in economic conditions.

Dean of the Medical college inaugurated the workshop. More than 150 participants attended the workshop including professors, Associate Professors, HOD of community medicine department, Medical officers, MBBS and MD students, MAPPP office bearers, PAN India team etc. attended.
The focus of the workshop was to sensitise the medical fraternity about the need of improved management of pesticide poisoning cases and thereby to strengthen and improve clinical management of poisoned patients in hospitals in view of minimizing fatal outcomes. This workshop was organized to educate, capacitate and teach medical personnel on management of pesticide poisoning cases, on realising the facts that managing poisoned persons was a challenging when hundreds of farmers and farm workers became poisoned by inhalational and contact exposure to pesticide spray.
The the workshop was meant to determine the impact, management and outcomes of occupational pesticide poisonings; to assess the effectiveness of current therapies for pesticide poisoning and develop Standard Treatment Protocol; to examine barriers and solutions involved in giving greater priority to pesticide poisoning, including legal, policy and budget factors; and to share best practices and develop a action plan for improving medical management of pesticide poisoning and thus to improve medical management of pesticide poisonings.
Dr. Manish Srigiriwal, Dean of the Yavatmal medical College; Dr. Michael Eddleston, Director, Centre for Pesticide Suicide Prevention, UK and international expert on clinical care for pesticide poisoning; Dr. Ayanthi Karunarathne, Dr. Aditya Pradyumna, Co-convenor, SOCHARA, Bangalore; Former Fellow at Community Health Cell; Sri.

Eat In or Take Out available.Until recent months, emerging economies had fallen off the radar, after the worst decade for emerging stock market returns since records began in the 1930s. Now, as we expected, investors are coming back, drawn by attractive valuations for both emerging market (EM) stocks and currencies, and record high valuations elsewhere. Once again, we are flooded with inquiries about EM: will this comeback endure? If so, which EMs will do best and—above all—how much to invest?
The answer, in brief, is there are many reasons to expect this EM comeback to endure for the next five to ten years. The top four reasons: a few EMs are prospering as old fashioned manufacturing success stories; the unfolding revival of commodity prices is a bright sign for the many EMs that rely on commodity exports; lacking the resources to spend their way through the pandemic, many emerging world governments have been forced to press painful economic reform, which is likely to accelerate growth in coming years; and finally, the pandemic is also accelerating the digital revolution, and one of the least understood aspects of this revolution is that it is unfolding even faster in emerging markets than in developed ones.
As for where to invest, the simple answer is in markets best positioned to prosper from one or more of the four trends outlined above. The EMs rising as export manufacturers are concentrated in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, led by Vietnam and Poland. Those already getting a boost from the commodity price revival include diversified exporters like Brazil, oil and metals exporters like Russia, and exporters of metals critical to green electrification programs, like Chile. The pandemic-inspired reform efforts are widespread but perhaps most dramatic in Indonesia and India. Most intriguingly, the digital revolution is seeing new regional variants of the Chinese and American tech giants rise across every region in EM, from Latin America to Africa and East Asia.
This moment was entirely predictable. Over the last decade, investors had eyes for only two countries, the United States and China, and one sector, tech. But the hot themes of one decade rarely stay hot the next, which is why we have been expecting this revival of the rest—countries outside the superpowers, companies outside big tech—for some time. Following a historically weak decade for EM returns (see Display 1), the gap between EM and U.S. valuations has never been wider. And with the growth prospects of emerging economies rising relative to the United States, these extremes are likely to shift back toward balance.

The mood around EM has changed so fast, the question we get most often now cuts right to the chase: how much to invest in EM?
In this paper, we survey three key approaches used to answer this question, and we find that they suggest an ideal global equity portfolio would include an EM allocation of at least 13% but perhaps materially more. Then we compare this ideal to various sources on how much global investors currently hold in EM equities, and find that today, the actual allocation ranges from just 6% to 8%. Many investors are leaving money on the EM table, at a moment when returns have begun to pick up and—we believe—economic fundamentals suggest the revival has legs.
Three Rational Allocation Strategies
Ever since countries began opening to global capital flows in the 1970s and 80s, research shows, most people have remained not only wary of investing abroad, but wary to an extent not explained by the risks. Levy and Sarnat (1970) were among the first to identify the “home bias” that leads most investors to hold high shares of domestic equities. Since then, a vast literature has examined this bias, but it still defies rational explanation.
To help investors counteract home bias, we have surveyed a number of approaches to help answer the question: how much to invest abroad? There are many models, and we focus on three that we think give the best benchmark and understanding of how to think about EM allocations; each has its limitations, but also provides useful ballpark estimates of how much to sensibly allocate to EM.
GDP WEIGHTING: One approach recommends investors allocate money to foreign equity markets in proportion to each country’s share in global GDP, since this should roughly capture a country’s “relative economic importance” (FTSE Russell, 2014). Today, the 27 countries in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index account for 39% of global GDP (see Display 2).
Source: Haver, IMF, MSIM. Data as of December 2020. IMF projections shown for 2021 - 2025. Uses countries in MSCI Emerging Markets Index and MSCI AC World Index only for comparison purposes to index weights.
Even if we correct for a lower free-float share in EM equities and higher dilution, an adjusted GDP weighting approach still suggests that global equity investors should allocate 26% of their portfolio to emerging markets. If we adjust further for the fact that many investors have indirect EM exposure through developed market (DM) companies that earn revenue in EM countries, as well as indirect DM exposure through EM companies with revenue from DM countries, the ideal EM allocation is still sizable, about 17% (see Display 3).1 And as the EM share in global GDP rises, we expect the ideal EM allocation under a GDP weight approach to increase.
Source: MSIM analysis, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. Revenue exposure estimates used to approximate EM and DM cross-exposures. Data as of December 31, 2020.
MARKET SHARE: A second basic approach is based on share of global market capitalization (Tesar and Werner, 1992). Currently, emerging markets have a 26% share of global market cap, up from 19% in 2009. Note that this share is still lower than the EM share of global GDP (39%). Over time we expect the EM global market cap share to rise and potentially converge with its GDP share, as rising incomes give more and more people the means and need to invest in stocks through retirement funds, insurance policies, and other increasingly sophisticated financial products.
A common variation on this approach uses the EM weight in the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI). MSCI uses screens to adjust weights for company and country sizes, free-float of equity shares, and liquidity. These screens, which tend to correct for the relatively undeveloped financial systems in emerging markets, put the EM share of MSCI ACWI at 13% (see Display 4). This share has risen from just 1% in 1988 to 13% today, as shown in Display 5,2 and for the same reasons mentioned above, we believe it will rise further in the coming years.
Source: FactSet. Data as of December 31, 2020.
Source: FactSet. Data as of December 31, 2020.
MEAN VARIANCE: The third basic allocation strategy is based on mean variance. Otherwise known as Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz, 1952) (Black & Litterman, 1991), or Max Return/Risk, this approach calculates the weight of assets that maximizes expected returns for each asset in a portfolio, given the investor’s tolerance for variance or risk.
Using monthly data since 1988, the year MSCI introduced the EM index, and starting from a portfolio which is 100% allocated to DM equities (MSCI World Index), we examined the monthly returns and volatility of the MSCI World and MSCI EM Indexes and found that the optimal equity portfolio would have allocated 27% to EM and 73% to DM, as shown in Display 6.
Source: FactSet, MSCI, MSIM calculations. Data as of December 31, 2020.
One basic objection to that conclusion is that expected EM returns are exaggerated if one uses data going back to 1988 because this period was widely seen as very favorable to EM equities. We would disagree: this period included crises in emerging markets from Mexico to Russia to Southeast Asia, plus the aftermath of the global financial crisis, all of which severely impacted EM equity returns. Nonetheless, to further test our finding, we utilized a series from Global Financial Data for EM equities that goes back to 1925.3 Surprisingly, it showed that over the longer historical period, the optimal allocation to EM equities was even higher, at 37% (see Display 7).
In short, a review of the three standard approaches to EM allocation suggest global equity investors should allocate somewhere in the range of 13% to 39% to EM.
Source: FactSet, MSCI, Global Financial Data, MSIM calculations. Data as of December 31, 2020.
So How Much Do Investors Actually Hold in EM?
There are many sources of data on how much global investors have allocated to emerging market equities, but no matter which one we use, it shows that current allocations represent a low share of overall portfolios, between 6 and 8%.
The EPFR flows database, which covers 346 global equity funds, suggests that the median fund has only 6.4% allocated to emerging markets (Display 8). Morningstar, which reports actual allocation data, yields a similar picture, with the median fund reporting an allocation of 7% to EM equities. And the numbers from eVestment, which aggregates reported holdings for 1,406 global equity funds, suggests the median global fund allocation to EM equities is 8.3%.
Clearly, this 6 to 8% range is significantly lower than any practical theory might suggest, including the 39% suggested by GDP weighting, the 13 to 17% implied by market weighting, or the 27 to 37% suggested by modern portfolio theory.
Source: FactSet, Haver, IMF, Global Financial Data, eVestment, Morningstar, EPFR, MSIM calculations. Data as of December 31, 2020.
Summary: The Irony of Underweighting EM Right Now
It would appear then, that most global equity portfolios, no matter how sophisticated, are still guilty of home bias. For decades, they have been missing an opportunity to earn higher risk-adjusted returns by allocating too low a share of their portfolios to international equity. We think their EM allocations are still too low. The analysis above suggests that the typical EM allocation is at most about half, and perhaps as little as one sixth, of what a rational approach would recommend.
The broad paradox of savvy global investors shunning markets that are far from home is very likely to grow over time. As emerging markets continue to gain share in global GDP and global market cap, and to advance in financial depth and sophistication, they will continue to be increasingly attractive, based on the most important allocation models. This gap, between opportunity and allocation, seems to us especially acute today, when an emerging market comeback has already begun, and the economic fundamentals suggest many reasons to believe that it could last. To those wondering where EM growth will come from, the possibilities begin with manufacturing, commodity prices, economic reforms, and the rise of major new internet service industries and companies outside China.
In general, we think the logical answer to “how much” to invest in emerging markets is more. For a host of fundamental and structural reasons, that answer has rarely been more true than it is right now..

As I’ve been immersed in writing the liner notes for the Criterion’s New Improved The Red Shoes my regard for Walbrook has grown exponentially. He has always been my favortie actor. Now he’s more than that.
A lot more.
Ophuls is all about transitions. La Ronde makes that clear — which is why the complaints of Lola Montes detractors ring so incredibly howllow.
March 20, 2010 at 2:25 pm
And speaking of the German version — here’s its last shot:
March 20, 2010 at 3:21 pm
I’ve heard of a longer version, would love to see it. Of Ophuls movies, La Ronde has always left me unenthused despite it being his most famous and successful work. I think it’s a wonderful film but not near Ophuls best and most interesting work because the concept is privileged over character. Walbrook is excellent of course. I prefer Ophuls pre-war films like Liebelei(the opening of The Red Shoes homages it BTW, David E., Powell had great admiration for the Fantastic Max) over it and definitely Le Plaisir and Madame de… and Lola Montes and the American masterworks.
I wonder why Marcel Ophuls is suppressing it. I’ve heard rumours that he has some kind of grudge against Danielle Darrieux on account of her behaviour during occupation which doesn’t strike me as being anywhere near as problematic as say Maurice Chevalier singing for the Nazis. And besides that Tavernier movie, a truly political look at a national cinema during wartime, showed how ambiguous and gray the situation was. His argument against the German version is along the lines that Ophuls wanted it to be multi-lingual and the one that’s mostly French is right and that’s the basis for the restoration.
March 20, 2010 at 4:17 pm
The Sorrow and the Pity’s use of Chevalier’s voice suggests that Ophuls Jnr certainly isn’t ready to forgive HIM, but a Darrieux grudge, real though it may be, wouldn’t make much sense in suppressing La Ronde, since her scenes are scarcely if at all affected by the longer version.
I assume he regards the long cut as being Max’s rough first version, which he later chose to refine. While you could take it that way, it’s no reason to keep it off the market: let people see it in context. Similarly, releasing the German Lola M as a DVD extra seems harmless, though I can see why he wouldn’t want it viewed as a standalone film without context.
La Ronde is a different kind of film from the others in many ways, with irony dominating over emotion for the most part. Irony is certainly present in the other films, but it’s FAR more subdued in the mix. I can see what you mean by the importance of the structural concept, Arthur, but I still think the film is all about character — it’s driven by sexual attraction, and while Walbrook is something like a puppet master, he doesn’t actually control the people’s emotions: he just steers them into contact and lets nature take its course.
Looking forward to seeing him in Willi Forst’s Maskerade!

Unlike everyone else in the film she does her own singing:
March 20, 2010 at 4:58 pm
Well, there is the whole issue of director’s cut and which ends up being released on Home Video. Now you have movies with multiple edits on DVD and it gets confusing, like audiences can choose which film they want to see and that’s not what art is about, that’s video games. In the case of Hitchcock’s ”Strangers on a Train” they released an earlier preview version and sold it as a British version on the box(when the documentaries in the same box make it clear it wasn’t a British version at all). And what we get is an entirely unnecessary and pointless release. On the other hand there’s the case of Howard Hawks’ ”The Big Sleep” where seeing both the versions is a genuinely fascinating insight into the film-making process.
My problem with the film is that it becomes more of a series of sketches rather than a whole. And I find the ironies of The Reckless Moment, Madame de…, Caught to be far deeply layered and complicated in their conceits than this film. In Ophuls Le Plaisir you had three stories from De Maupassant with a narrator playing Guy narrating each one but the overall effect is more of a whole, individually each episode would not be as effective as when seen in the whole.
March 20, 2010 at 5:04 pm
Darrieux in her films with Demy is a total delight. I especially love her in Une chambre en ville where she plays something of a matriarch-dowager or mistress-of-ceremonies, the variations from comic to diva-like hamming(intentional of course) and deep pathos is comparable to Vivien Leigh’s work with Kazan, albeit in a lighter vein.
She’s also wonderful in Mankiewicz’s 5 Fingers where you can read some autobiographical themes in her role as a Countess who plays any side against the other in order to survive with her money and privilege intact. She’s a perfect foil for James Mason(who nonetheless still gets, quite literally, the last laugh).

For some reason 5 Fingers didn’t impress me as much as I’d expected. The story is fascinating and I love the stars and director. But apparently Mankiewicz only made it to escape his studio contract, and the sense of apathy did seem to come across.
Darrieux’s roles often seem rather pointed, considering her chequered past. Duvivier’s Marie Octobre is a kind of whodunnit about a group of former resistance heroes meeting to try to figure out who betrayed them during the war. You certainly expect suspicion to settle on DD.
One of the miracles of La Ronde for me is that I find each of the stories fascinating and amusing in different ways, with the final episode especially evocative — perhaps the most mysterious moment in all Ophuls. And yet the stories in a way only exist to be parts of a whole, unlike in Le Plaisir where they had a prior existence as independent entities.
Ophuls’ alterations to Maupassant are fascinating, by the way, and generally they’re improvements. In La Ronde, the biggest addition is the ringmaster himself — in a way the most theatrical element, but he doesn’t feature in the play at all.
March 20, 2010 at 5:28 pm
I disagree with you aboutFive Fingers. Really unusual movie that I’m sure must have been on Rohmer’s mind when he made Triple Agent
Demy always cast Darrieux to play variations of his mother. I do wish Une Chambre en Ville were available on DVD.
March 20, 2010 at 5:53 pm
James Mason considered Five Fingers Mankiewicz’s best film and felt all the films he made after that were inferior, although he could possibly be self-serving. It’s my favourite too of his movies. It’s also considerably influential. Triple Agent is also a spy film in a similar vein but you can find homages to it in Laissez Passer where he shoots pictures of the documents with the small camera and also the recent Tarantino movie, Tarantino said his film was about language about performance, where in order to survive resisters had to be German to the last detail. You get that same attentiveness to social rituals in 5 Fingers especially one scene where Darrieux greets a minister and commends him on his posture and then tells James Mason that he’s a Nazi spy because he clicked his heels like a Prussian soldier. Tarantino took that, as always, to the point of fetish.
By the way, David E., there was a recent French boxset of Demy which came out and Une chambre en ville was part of it. That’s how I got to see it, I fished it out of the local Alliance Francaise here(which has an admirable DVD library). I loved Lola and Parapluies des Cherbourg but that film and Les Demoiselles des Rochefort made me a Demy-monde as it were. Especially the opening bit with the monochrome stand-of between the rioters and police, the representative image of French democracy as it were.
March 20, 2010 at 6:08 pm
The giant Demy box set is Region 2, of course. The films are subtitled but the copious extras aren’t, I don’t think. Well worth picking up anyway.
Billy Wilder’s first film, Mauvais Grain, is enjoyable mainly for the fascination of a teenage Darrieux as the female lead.

Ah! Gerard Phillipe! (swoons)
Re France an occupation, it is curious that Renoir got a critical bashing when he released “This Land is Mine” in France: the film had been a box-office hit in the USA, and Renoir received letters of Americans thanking him for letting them know how life in occupied countries was.
On the contrary, the French seemed to dislike a film which claimed that living under the occupation wasn’t a black and white situation: Sanders or Thurston Hall’s collabos are not depicted as evil, but as weak, opportunistic or greedy, but they’re still humans to which we can relate.
Till fairly recent times, many a French critic excused Renoir’s film on the grounds that, well, he was far and away from France, so how could he know… When in fact, he was closer to reality than other films on the subject.
March 20, 2010 at 9:25 pm
Remarkable that Gerard still manages to look seductive as a drunken officer disfigured with weird facial hair and a monocle. I think it has to do with his talent…
Just realized that by canceling my screenings for next semester (the students will be too busy shooting) I’m robbing myself of the chance to see This Land on a big screen with an audience. I think I’ll show it to Fiona instead.
March 20, 2010 at 10:46 pm
Great news about Une Chambre en Ville Arthur!
Michel Colombier wrote the (very fine) score of that one because Jacques and Michel had a falling out. Happliy they got together again and did Trois Places Pour le 26th — Jacques’ last film (and a very lovely one too.)
March 20, 2010 at 10:47 pm
When I come across some bit of James Dean Worship, I can’t help thinking that I prefer Phillipe in terms of talented and attractive: Dean died too young to be allowed to go beyond the Angsty Teenager roles. Gerard, while also leaving this world too young, had enough time to amply demonstrate his talent.
March 20, 2010 at 11:50 pm
The presence of irony over emotion in La Ronde is a mark of Ophuls staying true to Schnitzler’s clinical spirit and even accenting it by adding Walbrook’s character. By contrast, I found Ophul’s adaptation of Maupassant in Le Plaisir stylistically brilliant but less satisfactory. I know many people knock Maupassant’s stories for their cynicism, but I found that Ophul’s choices at times sentimentalized the material (Jean Gain in “Madame Tellier”) and softened its harshness (as in the conclusion of “The Model”). But I have no problems with Ophul’s handling of “The Mask” and the other two segments probably feature his most jaw-dropping camera work outside of Lola Montes (though one could argue that the defenestration shot in “The Model” is ultimately TOO stunning).
March 21, 2010 at 12:54 am
I can’t accept “too stunning” as a criticism!
I like Maupassant’s cynicism, which is far from unemotional, but I also like Ophuls’ use of it. I agree that he’s not wholly faithful to the original spirit, but out of that you get the last line of The Mask, which Maupassant didn’t think of…
Maupassant might actually be my favourite writer… which makes it all the more obscene that I’ve read so little of him.
March 21, 2010 at 2:40 am
Gerard Philippe had classical training, Gloria. James Dean did not. No knowing what might have happened had he lived, but the U.S. doesn’t encourgae anything “classic” or intellectual on any level.
I sense more than a trace of Gerard Philippe in Louis Garrel. He could easily do Racine and Corneille. And the recent mass protest over Sarkozky expressing disdain for Madame de la Fayette led to a mass reading climaxed by Louis reading the last passages of La princesse de cleves
March 21, 2010 at 12:11 pm
Dean fascinates me mainly because there’s such a thin line between naturalism and extreme mannerism in his acting. I eventually convinced myself that he was sincerely doing what came naturally, then I saw Christopher Jones doing a pitch-perfect impersonation of all the Dean tropes in Wild in the Streets, leading me to suspect that every tic and hesitation was self-consciously pre-planned.
Gerard Philippe wasn’t limited to one type of character or even one style of acting, thus he could fit in with a very wide range of directors. And those eyes! Froglike yet beautiful.
March 21, 2010 at 2:13 pm
The main quality about James Dean was that he was incapable of being anything but himself before the camera. In that respect, he probably had limited range as an actor as per the classical idea and probably would not have been very good doing classics. In Kazan’s autobiography which I recently read(and which is an amazing work in its own right), he’s very critical of Dean and his cult but it also touches on his appeal. Kazan noted that Dean wasn’t very impressive when he did a screentest of him before a crew, all of them thought he wasn’t anyone special but he cast Dean in East of Eden because in his words, “He was Cal”. He also boasts shamelessly of how he got Dean drunk to do one scene with Julie Harris when he visits her on her roof.
But then Nicholas Ray, Kazan’s one-time protegee, had a different idea and he took to Dean at once and in Rebel Without A Cause he gives a performance that’s too raw to dismiss and that you can’t get from any other actor. It’s also a really cinematic performance. On one hand you have the belief that performances for film should be restrained, tight and underplayed, the idea that actors should be rather than perform the character than you have someone like Dean or Anna Magnani or Brando and the cast of Cassavetes’ movies that alters our ideas of performance and being.

In the interests of fairness, I should point out that Danielle Darrieux was marked for death by BOTH the Resistance AND the Gestapo. No sooner had she sprung Rubirosa from a prison camp than she fled the ‘good will tour’ and went into hiding in a tiny French village.
Still working today, she seems philosophical about her chequered public image. Following a triumphant concert in Paris a few years back (yes, she still sings) she remarked to the press…”People only bought tickets because they wanted to see if I’d drop dead onstage.”Ten new bison calves born into Banff National Park
During a recent journey to check drift fences in the backcountry, a member of Banff National Park’s bison reintroduction team observed ten new bison calves or “little reds,” as they are affectionately named for their red fur.
“This is a good sign: it is the first time since the animals were released that a majority of cows have given birth during the typical spring calving period for bison,” confirmed Karsten Heuer, project manager for the $6.4 million bison reintroduction project in Banff National Park.
According to images from a remote camera, one of the bison calves belongs to a young cow that was born in Banff herself just after the translocation from Elk Island National Park in 2017. That makes her the first true born-in-Banff bison mom in over a hundred years.
The bison re-introduction team said they observed the herd returning to favored meadows, which is another sign the herd is settling into its habitat, two years after its initial release.
“To the best of our knowledge, the Banff bison herd had three calves last year, including one calf which was born in autumn. This is atypical timing, as bison calves are generally born in the spring.”
This year, with ten bison born in May, the herd is returning to a more natural breeding pattern. Calves are typically born in the spring, so they may feed over the summer, to prepare for the long winter,” said
The herd has three reproductive males, as well as several juvenile bulls.
“Now that the seven female calves born in 2017 have reached sexual maturity, the potential pool of reproductive females has increased from 10 cows to 17. It is too early to tell but highly likely.
Overall, the bison are doing well. They are using parts of the Panther and Red Deer Valleys of Banff National Park, well within the target reintroduction zone,” said Heuer.
The population that started with 16 bison has almost tripled, and is now at 45 in total numbers.
Plains bison are Canada’s largest mammal and Parks Canada Parks officials said their goal is to ensure they roam the landscape for generations to come.Top 5 Marketing Strategies For Promoting Startups

Originally as a memorial monument, its principal function is a reliquary container once used for the corporeal remains of Sakyamuni and other significant Buddhist figures. It is a manifestation of the aniconic Dharma body of the Buddha and his divine presence, represents the past and the present, the body and the mind. Hence, a Pāli text claims: 'The stupa is the Buddha, the Buddha is the stupa'.1
The unique architectural form of the example presented here is quintessentially influenced by Tibetan characteristics. The square Mount Meru base and the tapered steps are Tibetan in style, the rounded dome is Indian in origin. Above is the cubic harmika, consisting of a five-layered conical spire mast, represents the five elements- earth, water, fire, wind, and void. However, this example is also significantly infused with classical Chinese elite aesthetics. The large proportion of the naturally pierced upper section of the throne celebrates the dynamic transformational processes of nature, which manifests in the appreciation of Chinese scholar's rocks and is also close to the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi. It breaks free from the rigid traditional sixty-four-unit proportion.2 Furthermore, the rugged texture of the hollowed centre resembles mountains and caves, particularly the magical peaks and grotto-heavens, which invokes a sense of divinity and tranquillity of the onlookers.
Commonly cast in bronze and gilded, this example is uniquely carved from hardwood. Its generous proportions also entail an extraordinary commission. A related example, carved in zitan, was sold at Christie's Paris, Live Auction 5598 on 8 June 2010, lot 307..Products affected: AddressRight® 200 Printer

At the tender age of 20, I have about 50 years of non-stop working ahead. Oh, joy.
For as long as I can remember, my mindset was if I have to work for the rest of my life, my misery should be compensated by a big paycheck. I always thought living comfortably would eventually bring me all the happiness in the world.
I have had several life experiences in which I have been given the chance to test the waters and found the excitement of working with a big name is only temporary. All I am left with are the bragging rights.
I have been a part of several mission trips and I have seen firsthand the needs in this world. I have felt an incredible sense of fulfillment from seeing the joy on the face of a woman with absolutely nothing, given a house to shelter her children. Knowing I can be a part of something so much greater gave me something beyond bragging rights, but how could I apply this to my public relations major?
This past summer, somehow I was led to Single Mothers Outreach in Santa Clarita, California. SMO is a nonprofit organization that seeks to empower single parents to become self-sustaining by providing classes and resources to push them to thrive.
My job was to bring attention to the organization by writing press releases, newsletters and managing social media in order to attract people to become a part of this team that changes lives. Although I may not be personally providing the necessary resources, I was able to play a part in the process of improving someone’s life.
Seeing the joy on struggling mothers’ faces when they received bundles of diapers or stopped by the office just to let us know they are back on their feet showed me this is what I am meant to do.
I am meant to use the skills I have been given to improve someone’s life. Although nonprofits do not necessarily lead to the largest paychecks, they bring so much more to life.
Regardless of major, a person can find a way to use his or her skills to make a difference. I have chosen to use my career in a way in which I can serve others because this way I can do something with meaning. Choose a career that will bring joy and fulfillment beyond numbers on paper.My old Sony Ericsson isn't up to it any more so... I have just wangled a free upgrade out of 02 for a Nokia N95 8gb.

It has vitamin C and all the other good things found in other fruits, but it looks nothing like the more common fruits purchased in supermarkets. So what makes the pineapple so special in terms of its appearance?
What Fruit Type Is a Pineapple?
Believe it or not, the pineapple is a type of berry. In botany, the fruit of the pineapple plant is called the collective fruit. When the pineapple plant’s flowers begin to mature, they begin to create small fruits that eventually form a larger, collective unit called the collective fruit.
Essentially, what you are buying is a lot of little pineapples stuck together in one large mega-fruit. Each of the units or ‘eyes’ of the pineapple corresponds to one pineapple berry. Though yes, it is simple to refer to the entire collective fruit structure as just ‘a pineapple.’
It’s more of culture than a scientific thing to those who are confused about the naming or terminology of the pineapple. The pineapple is not related to the pine tree, nor is it related to the apple. It certainly is not pine, and no, we can’t call a pineapple something like an apple fruit.
There are so many differences; the primary one is the pineapple’s plant structure. Apples grow on trees; pineapples do not. However, the pineapple does grow on a shrubby plant, which truly aligns it with other berries.
The pineapple is a bromeliad. Surprisingly, this special cluster of plants can be traced to aerial plants that are so tiny you will barely notice them in a forest.
Why Is the Pineapple a Berry?
The pineapple is technically a berry because it contains seeds (the wild ones), and there is a fleshy body covered by skin. While the ripe pineapple does not present itself as individual berries, the fusing together of the ripe pineapple berries into a singular big structure does not take away the fact that you are handling a berry and not something like a citrus fruit.
Historically, pineapples are ideal for long naval voyages because they contained a lot of vitamin C. The lack of vitamin C back in the day caused scurvy, so taking many pineapples for a long trip is life and death for sailors and merchants in the sea.
What about the infamous bromelain content of pineapples? Bromelain refers to different digestive enzymes contained within pineapples. Yes, indeed, the bromelain can technically ‘soften’ the protein of the lining of your mouth by acting upon collagen, which is one of the building blocks of protein.
However, when you eat bromelain, your gastric tract destroys it or renders it harmless, so you don’t have to worry about your pineapple slices fighting back and eating you from the inside.H.B. 15, introduced Monday, would require remote sellers and marketplace facilitators such as Amazon.com to collect and remit tax if they have 200 or more sales or more than $100,000 in sales into the state in the previous calendar year. If enacted, the bill would take effect July 1, although some of the bill's marketplace sections would apply as of Oct. 1.
Florida's legislative session begins March 2. Sunshine State lawmakers weighed similar proposals in the last few years before shelving them amid some concerns from Republicans who perceived the bills as imposing a tax increase.
The bill is co-sponsored by Reps. Chuck Clemons, R-Cross City, and Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point. A representative for Clemons did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, and LaMarca was unavailable for comment.
Florida and Missouri are the only states with a sales tax that haven't begun requiring remote sellers to collect and remit taxes after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2018 Wayfair
While Wayfair-related proposals have been scuttled in the past, pressure on lawmakers to pass a bill that would tax on online sales may be higher when lawmakers convene as they work to address a revenue shortfall from the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Because Florida does not levy a personal income tax, the state relies heavily on sales taxes to balance its budget and has been hit hard by a downturn in tourism amid the pandemic.
Sales tax collections plunged $1.8 billion below projections from April to July before exceeding estimates that were adjusted to account for the pandemic in the following months, according to a Monday report from the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research. The report said that sales taxes accounted for nearly 92% of October's gain of $313.5 million above the month's adjusted revenue projections.
But the pandemic's overall impact on the state's fiscal health remains grim. From April through October, Florida's tax collections are more than $2.3 billion below January estimates, despite coming in at $35.4 million above those initial projections in October, according to the report.
Revenue estimates from prior online sales tax bills have said that a Wayfair-related tax could generate nearly $700 million in state and local tax revenue annually. A fiscal note on H.B. 15 was not immediately available.
Esteban Leonardo Santis, a policy analyst for the Florida Policy Institute who focuses on tax and revenue issues, told Law360 on Tuesday that the organization is advocating for the state to enact a tax on online sales as one of several measures to counter the pandemic's drain on Florida's coffers. In the past, the institute has also outlined its support for a shift to combined reporting and conforming to the federal code as other means to raise revenue.
"FPI's position is that modernizing enforcement of online sales taxes is one strategy to address pandemic-related revenue shortfalls, and it should be prioritized alongside initiatives to close corporate tax loopholes and other revenue-raising strategies," Santis said.
When asked whether Florida should consider a 200 transaction threshold — which some states have eschewed to avoid imposing tax obligations on businesses with large volumes of small sales — Santis noted that other Southeast states like Georgia and North Carolina have nexus thresholds of 200 transactions or $100,000 in sales.
"To start, Florida should look to Southeast trends; thus, the 200 transactions or $100,000 is a useful starting point," he said.
Other states in Florida's region, such as South Carolina and neighboring Alabama, have dollar thresholds of $100,000 and $250,000, respectively, without a transaction threshold.
A task force composed of representatives from state business trade groups, including the Florida Retail Federation and Florida's chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business, has also already thrown its support behind an online sales tax bill for the 2021 session.
A Wayfair proposal was among the legislative recommendations that the task force released in a report on Monday highlighting tax measures that it believes can help the state's economy recover from the pandemic.
"This measure is not a 'tax increase,' but it would provide a means to offset other potentially beneficial tax reductions and to level the playing field for Florida businesses," the report said.
Representatives for the Republican and Democratic leadership in the House did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

Precisely what is a Hooter Bet and also a Saddle horn Significant Guarantee?The standard trump bet is certainly used in multiples for four. Whatever you guarantee might be divide evenly between the 2, 3, 11 along with 12. That category might be explained below. Any car horn large can guess is like that trumpet choice, on the other hand, personal training machines are usually guarantee as an alternative for four. The ball player demands to mention which in turn range the extra model is definitely for.

If you are in pain, this post is for you…Today, I listened to @babaramdass talk about suffering (thanks to my friend @theresagorski). His words changed everything. He explained that nature is unfolding all the time, even through us. Some moments bring joy and some cause sadness, but none of it we actually control.
I know this to be true having spent decades carving an identity as a mother and a businesswoman, only to have much of that change into something else in limbo. Reluctantly, I’m learning my journey to inner peace actually lies in non-attachment to those identities. This is so very hard for anyone, but especially for a mother who cares deeply. Our egos can’t understand when things don’t go as planned, so we fight against the suffering.
Excessive “busy”ness, persistent outreach, and emotional restlessness have been my tools to maintain what I worked so hard to build, even as they’ve crumbled through my grasping fingers. But Ram Dass reminds us that when we stand back far enough to consider the possibility that there are no errors in the game of life, this suffering begins to lose its grip on us. It’s the ultimate paradox — by letting go of everything our minds have created, we can be free of the pain that runs rampant through our minds.
For years I’ve agonized that if I could just remove or fix the obstacles in my path, I could heal and get on with my spiritual work. Ironically, he says the obstacle IS our spiritual work. The goal is to take what’s on our plate and use it to free ourselves from self-made frameworks that are laced with judgment. Ruminating over what to do next is a habit fraught with fear — fear of losing control, fear of being outcast, fear of being alone. And what if that’s already happened anyway? He says, “When you fully understand that your incarnation is a vehicle for liberation, and THAT’s what your business is on earth, then the answer to which action should you take doesn’t matter.” There are no wrong answers. It’s all going to be horribly beautiful. Our job is to only silence our mind’s drama, so we are not trapped by our misperception that this version of reality is all there is. 💜(#workinprogress) 📸 @elizabeth_ida

“What is design? It’s where you stand with a foot in two worlds — the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes — and you try to bring the two together.”
– Mitchell Kapor
While there are several definitions of instructional design and what 'that' is, I feel the most important take away is that instructional design is the backbone of any instructional learning experience. For example, would you want to build a house without any set of plans? No, the answer is no. So why would you want to develop learning experiences or training without the guidance of an instructional designer who is there with the 'plans' to help build something meaningful? In this section of my portfolio, I demonstrate my experiences reviewing, designing, and developing purposeful learning opportunities.
Learning Management System Transition

Course Reviews (Purdue Online)
Background: To help faculty as they work through the course design process, the Course Design & Development Team at Purdue Universit utilizes a review process to look at a course’s design. Built from the principles of the Quality Matters Rubric, this informal review allows CDD to draw from this research-based approach while adapting to best meet the needs of Purdue Faculty. This flexibility of process provides us the ability to balance the benefit of extra feedback while ensuring that faculty continue to pursue the course design that best meets the needs of their students. Through this informal course design review, the Instructional Designer and Instructor will obtain constructive feedback from two instructional design professionals not directly involved in the design of the course in the form of the Course Design Review rubric being completed.Kate Middleton's $65 Sneakers Will Be Your New Go-to Weekend Shoes
This story originally appeared on InStyle.com.
Every time Kate Middleton is photographed, she gives us new fashion goals. Did you see the breathtaking Marchesa dress she recently stepped out in? Or the $98 Kate Spade earrings she paired it with? Stunning. And even her casual outfits are an inspiration. On Wednesday, while hosting runners from Team Heads Togetherat Kensington Palace, Middleton rocked a chic, casual ensemble that's about to become our weekend uniform this spring.
Her long-sleeve top is a new number by Italian label Luisa Spagnoli. The exact color isn't available on the brand's website just yet, but you can shop a similar style here for $280. The Dutchess of Cambridge completed her laid back look with a pair white Superga sneakers ($65; bloomingdales.com) and black jeans.
We're not sure exactly who makes her fitted denim pants (or when her exact top will be available for purchase), but you can copy Middleton's effortless style with these look-a-like pieces below.

I am so excited to see such enthusiastic support for our violin program. Our enrollment is the highest it has ever been!
I am currently working out a rotating lesson schedule for over 200 students across four schools. This letter will serve as a response to the many emails I have received this week in lieu of individual responses. Please read carefully.
All students in the instrumental music program will receive 30 minutes of group instruction one time per week. The schedule will be communicated to your child’s classroom teacher and principal.
The lessons will happen during the school day and will rotate on an 8 week schedule to ensure your child will not be pulled from the same instruction weekly.
○ Lincoln School students will have lessons on Mondays.
○ Jefferson School students will have lessons on either Tuesday or Friday. I will reach out to you directly once my schedule has been finalized to confirm which day your student will have group class.
○ Wilson School students will have lessons on Wednesdays.
○ Washington School students will have lessons on Thursdays.
Attention second grade parents: The Early Start Program replaces the previous Suzuki Program. The only materials required is the violin outfit (case, violin, bow, shoulder rest, rosin). I want to reiterate that while this program is open to all second graders it is not mandatory. If there was a misunderstanding and you would like to withdraw your child from the program, please let me know.
Attention third, fourth and fifth grade parents: The only materials required in addition to the violin outfit are the Essential Elements Book 1 and a music stand for home use. No additional materials are required to be purchased from the rental company.
Unsure what size violin to rent? Follow these directions!
Unsure where to rent? Click here and follow the directions in Step 3 for rental company options.

Violin or Essential Elements Book 1 on backorder? I understand and look forward to when the supplies arrive. But I will still work with your student in class while we wait. ● Orchestra is for only 4th and 5th graders that are in their second year or more of lessons. Orchestra will happen before school as follows:
○ Lincoln School meets on Mondays from 8:00-8:40am in the All Purpose Room (Gym). ○ Jefferson School meets on Tuesdays from 8:00-8:40am in the All Purpose Room (Gym).

Authors: AS English Update: 22 July 2020 15:28 EDT
Lesions inside the mouth may be an indicator that a person has contracted the coronavirus, according to a study carried out in Spain.
Six of 21 Covid-19 patients with skin rash also had mouth lesions
Researchers at the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital in Madrid say their findings show that around a third of Covid-19 sufferers found to have a skin rash also turn out to have rash-like oral-cavity lesions, known as enanthems.
“Of 21 patients with Covid-19 and skin rash, 6 patients (29%) had enanthem,” researchers said in a paper published in the medical journal JAMA Dermatology last Thursday. “The age range of these patients was between 40 and 69 years, and 4 of the 6 (66%) were women.”
“This work describes preliminary observations and is limited by the small number of cases and the absence of a control group,” they cautioned.
Rash among less common Covid-19 symptoms listed by WHO
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, a dry cough and tiredness, while the virus’ less common indicators include “a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes”.
Last week, however, a study carried out at King’s College London in the UK called for rashes – known as exanthems when they occur on the outside of the body – to be included as the fourth key symptom of Covid-19.
The research, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, found that 21% of people who had a skin rash and were suffering from Covid-19 reported that this was their only symptom of the disease.
In its findings in JAMA Dermatology, meanwhile, the team at the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital noted that a recent study on patients in Italy had also underlined the apparently regular occurrence of rashes among Covid-19 patients.
Enanthems could help determine if skin rash linked to Covid-19
However, the Madrid study points out that establishing for certain that a skin rash has been brought about by the coronavirus – rather than another cause – is not straightforward. With this in mind, it says, the process of identifying a clear link could be helped by finding out whether or not a patient also has enanthems.
“Whether these manifestations [skin rashes] are directly related to Covid-19 remains unclear, since both viral infections and adverse drug reactions are frequent causes of exanthems,” the Spanish researchers explain. “An important clue to distinguish between both entities is the presence of enanthem […].”
Mouths not often checked for safety reasons
They also note, though, that an obstacle towards this is that the insides of mouths are often not checked by medical staff: “Owing to safety concerns, many patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 do not have their oral cavity examined.”

With over 96,000 employees worldwide, it leverages more than 50 different technology platforms. The plan was to rehost approximately 80% of the overall environment, and while the customer knew its hybrid IT landscape was complex, it defined and adhered to well-defined processes designed to mitigate disruption.
“AWS recommended using TransitionManager for managing the migrations end-to-end. It provides a single pane of glass that serves as the system of record for data and drives the coordination and collaboration of planning, managing, and execution of migration waves,” said the senior professional services consultant at AWS and lead on the project. “Not only did it help us keep the project on track, it accelerated the migration project to AWS by six months.”
TransitionManager was installed behind the company’s firewall, and data was ingested from disparate systems such as CMDBs, ITSM and files. Leveraging TransitionManager’s rules engine, the team filtered out irrelevant
Upon data import, the team leveraged TransitionManager’s visual map of all applications, servers, storage and other devices across their hybrid landscape. Designed to be used by all project stakeholders, the customer limited TransitionManager access to specific users due to security policies. Data was exported from TransitionManager and displayed in an internal webpage so app owners could verify data and make updates as needed; these changes would then be quickly captured and entered back into TransitionManager.
“Our AWS team was highly efficient and productive using TransitionManager’s asset-level task management,” commented the AWS consultant. “During migration planning, hundreds of asset-level tasks needed to be created, managed, executed and closed out every week. The tasks can be large or small, and may include confirming an OS version, validating dependencies, marking assets as retired or out of scope, adding a start time for a move event, to name a few. Having the ability to track these tasks with the assets they apply to was invaluable and had a significant impact on productivity and efficiency.”
When viewing the map of their IT landscape, the customer expected complexity, but they were not aware of how interdependent their applications and other assets were when planning to rehost the vast majority of workloads. Like many organizations of its size, large database environments hosted dozens or even hundreds of applications, making a single move group impossible.
At this point, re-platforming was not an option. Creative wave planning was needed to move databases without all dependent applications without disrupting business operations.
Recreating 1,000 servers and 600 apps into smaller groups using spreadsheets would have been extremely difficult. But using ad-hoc queries and filters, the team could easily search for QA, development and other non-production systems, and identify applications that were not business critical. The results were saved as reports that could also be exported to spreadsheets or printed for reference. Each report could also be viewed in a map, making it easy to quickly identify conflicts or new dependencies.
Once large dependency groups were reduced to a manageable level, all applications in a specific move group had to be in a final state of readiness to move. This basically meant that any asset with a dependency had to be moved within the same group to be approved. This was clearly a challenge as the groups of apps were broken down from hundreds to a couple of dozen. But with the dependency analyzer view, it was easy for the team to make decisions and demonstrate how all apps with multiple dependencies would be moved, and when and how each dependency would be accounted for – without having the final readiness status. Being able to see how each asset and dependency was accounted for, the date and time it would be moved, and the duration of the move, gave the team the confidence that the wave planning team had accounted for all dependencies. And because each asset record was tracked with business facts in addition to technical facts, the team could demonstrate that the migration would meet all SLAs, RTOs, and compliance or security requirements for each asset.
On top of the obvious use of Transition Manager to store the customer’s portfolio data and manage a comprehensive two-year wave plan consisting of over 50 migration waves, the manufacturer needed a.
The underlying issue in all of this is the application teams who are driving these changes in the environment are not aware of the downstream effects to the wave plan. Since the wave plan has been 95% created and confirmed, each of the changes described above could have wild downstream impacts. For example, a new dependency to a production database server that is being rehosted could create new relationships with other dependency groups and waves. If the newly connected dependency groups cannot be placed into the same wave, then the database team needs to reevaluate the new connection and consider a replatform instead of a rehost for that application. This is just one scenario or “rule” as we call them on this project. There are many rules like this due to the resulting new dependencies we see each week. Other rules around new web server and application server connections have their own set of complications.
To make matters even more complicated, it’s perfectly normal for these changes to affect “in flight” waves. An “in-flight” wave is to be migrated in the next 1-2 months. These waves have started their detailed planning phase which includes application workshops and other migration “gates” as we approach their cutover dates. Anything that impacts an in-flight wave must be reviewed by wave leaders and other stake holders before being committed.
The customer and AWS desperately needed a way to identify these each week. The solution was a series of custom rules created within TransitionManager’s rules engine that would be run each Monday and uses logic to identify the date and type of change BEFORE we commit them. Once exported, the user could query on a custom field called “Last Seen Date” to see if the change is present in this week’s data or not. If the change is not present in this week’s data, then it’s changed. Additionally, the same report could also filter on “New Dep” in the status column to easily identify anything new in the portfolio. These changes are then tagged with their corresponding assets and waves and presented in a weekly report on Monday afternoons. The changes to in-flight waves are highlighted and addressed with the wave leaders and stakeholders to determine which ones can be committed and which ones must be rejected.
The customer is now able to see any new changes before its committed to any wave. This is extremely crucial for in-flight waves. Consider a scenario where the SQL team installs a new database for an application slotted in wave 20. Also consider the SQL team has no idea that the application is already slotted in wave 20. Then consider wave 20 is one week from cutover. Wave 20 cutover happens, but the new database was never included into the cutover plan. Now the application is broken and we do not know why. This scenario is just one example that can happen at any given time due to the number of changes each week. Since incorporating the rules in TransitionManager, this is no longer a problem. We are easily identifying new databases and making informed decisions whether to scramble and get them included into the in-flight wave or making decisions to reject the new database and plan it for a future wave. Either way, now we know.
The customer and AWS plan to continue looking for ways to tighten our change control process to look for other ways to get in front of the highly dynamic environment. The work is paying off, and application cutover are continuing to go “unbroken.”
The team identified the top three elements critical to the success of the project.The Blessed John Baptist Scalabrini

"Waipā District Council does not, at any point, reintroduce or reuse wastewater for the district's drinkable water supply. This water, called potable water, does not interact with the district's wastewater," water services manager Martin Mould said.
/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/YQWQJVBWFR4YZCCXQLTXET4R3U.jpg)
The council says it was alerted to the rumours when a member of the public phoned the council, saying they had been buying bottled water out of fear of the safety of public drinking water.
Mould said following two positive Covid-19 test results in Te Awamutu's wastewater last week, the district's wastewater treatment process had been the subject of misinformation and rumours, which undermined public confidence in the process.
He wanted to make things crystal clear for concerned residents: "There is no Covid-19 in the district's drinking water."
The recent positive wastewater results had no bearing on the drinking water, Mould said.
"Our drinking water comes from a number of sources including underground bores in Kihikihi and Te Awamutu, the Waikato River and from Pirongia's Mangauika Stream, and all are treated prior to reaching households.
"It is important to remember that the water we drink goes through a rigorous treatment process to ensure it is up to national public health standards prior to it being delivered to your homes."
Mould said the treatment of wastewater was done separately, at an entirely different site, and was performed to regulated standards.
"Wastewater is treated entirely separately from the other two water systems [drinking water and stormwater]."
Mould said while he understood the concern, the public needed to have faith in the district's water treatment system.
"We understand our community is feeling apprehensive around the recent wastewater test results, but we want to reassure residents their drinking water is perfectly safe and reliable."
Key messages from Waipā District Council:
• Waipā District Council does not reuse wastewater for drinking/potable water.
• Wastewater is water that has been used within your home (e.g. showering, toilets, sinks, washing machines) that then drains into the wastewater network and is taken to wastewater treatment plants for treatment, prior to being discharged back into the environment.
• Discharge quality is strictly monitored and treatment is done to regulated standards.
• Kihikihi village, Te Awamutu township and Waikeria Prison's wastewater all go to the Te Awamutu Wastewater Treatment Plant.
• The wastewater treatment process is thorough, and wastewater is disinfected using ultraviolet (UV), which kills bacteria and viruses.
• Wastewater is entirely different to drinking/potable water. The processes of treating drinking/potable water and wastewater are entirely different and occur at separate locations.Product

I believe we agree with the goals you state, however most of your claims on flexbox VS a separate renderer class seemed to be assumptions you made 3 years ago. People (including me) have tried to maintain the MathML code after you left and these assumptions turned out to be at least inaccurate. With Alejandro's approach, I believe that in the upcoming months we can at the same time get a good MathML implementation and address all of reviewer's concerns on your original code. At the moment, I do not think there is an alternative proposal with these features, and even less someone willing to work on any other approach...
More replies inline. Le 23/12/2015 08:11, dbar...@mathscribe.com a écrit : >. However when a legitimate change elsewhere does break something in MathML (Alejandro mentioned one bug but I have seen several of them) it becomes a burden for the non-MathML developers. This is especially true because it's hard to understand the code given the complexity of the current flexbox-based implementation and the vagueness of the MathML spec (which we are trying to solve by using and). Using an independent renderer class allows to isolate the MathML implementation and reduces the risk of breaking the MathML code while changing another part of the code. This has been confirmed with the experience in Gecko (actually, such an issue only happened twice in Gecko in the past decade and that was due to changes in graphics and font modules, not layout). >. By using our own renderer class we can actually ignore CSS properties that we consider irrelevant (see). As Alejandro said in his initial message, we now only care about math features and not about the whole flexbox rules. Hence that's less code executed and we hope it would actually improve performance. > 3. MathML must introduce few or no bugs, and especially no security bugs. With a separate renderer class, the layout code essentially becomes arithmetic computations (of box coordinates and size). This is more reliable than manipulation of anonymous renderers and style that need to be kept updated with respect to dynamic tree/style changes. See for example the current implementation of mmultiscripts which is just crazy (). If I understand correctly, one of the improvements you obtained by using flexboxes was that you removed some of the (potentially unsafe) manipulations of margin / border style that used to be necessary for box alignments. With the new approach, we go even farther and expect to remove all the anonymous renderers and style, so that these are no longer a problem. >. I'm not sure the comparison is really relevant, given the limited MathML implementations in WebKit and the fact that the coding style are very different (e.g. MathJax is written in Javascript and has various hacks to workaround CSS bugs from old browsers, Gecko has a 80 characters limit for lines and has fallback code when a MATH font is not available). Instead, let's compare the two approaches in WebKit. The flexbox-based implementation is really naive and just aligns the edges of base and scripts (see attachment integrals.png) ; implementing mmultiscripts that way was overly complex as I said above. As a comparison, in only a single day, Alejandro and I were able to get an implementation of msub/msup/msubsup/mmultiscripts using the TeX rules and a decade of parameters from the OpenType MATH table (see). Moreover, RenderMathMLScripts.[h|cpp] went down from 631 lines to 454 lines i.e. a ratio of 72%. >. AFAIK, neither Gecko nor MathJax rely on flexboxes but just absolutely place the math boxes (as we want to do in the new approach) and they are able to get good math rendering. With hundred of lines, you can do a pure CSS implementation (cf) and that's fine as long as you only expect low quality and limited support. However, users want high-quality rendering similar to what is done in TeX or Microsoft Word and so we need more flexibility to position math boxes. Like for mmultiscripts, you can probably always add more and more nested anonymous boxes but then the code becomes even more complex and we spend too much time maintaining the integrity of the render tree hierarchy instead of just focusing on arithmetic computations and simple rules. >. :) As Alejandro said, we are going to submit patches for review soon. Additionally, we are really interested in hearing any feedback from WebKit experts on the following implementation note and tests: Finally, I believe you are seeing the glass half empty if you reduce our work to "deleting your code". I would rather say that the flexbox implementation was an opportunity for developers/users to experiment MathML in WebKit, improve our test suite, get feedback and discuss the pros and cons of that approach. In particular, thanks to your work we have a good idea of what would be acceptable by the Google reviewers in the future. For now, we are just rewriting the MathML layout to address the feedback from the WebKit community and get something better! Such a refactoring happens everytime in software development, so there are no reasons to worry... -- Frédéric Wang

Former Wales scrumhalf Gareth Edwards was knighted and English cricket’s leading test wicket-taker James Anderson and former England soccer midfielder Frank Lampard were given the OBE in the Queen’s birthday honours list.
Ex-Williams director Patrick Head and Gary Verity, who brought the Tour de France to Yorkshire, have also been knighted while boxer Carl Froch has been made an MBE along with distance runner Jo Pavey and England women’s footballer Casey Stoney.
Former England rugby union flyhalf and World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson becomes a CBE while ex-Wales flyhalf Jonathan Davies has been made an OBE for his work as president of Cardiff’s Velindre Cancer Centre.
Swansea City soccer club chairman Huw Jenkins has been made an OBE.
Edwards, 67, won 53 caps for Wales from 1967-1978, 13 as captain, and played 10 times for the British & Irish Lions on their victorious tours of New Zealand in 1971 and South Africa in 1974.
A Rugby World magazine poll in 2003 named him as the greatest player of all time.
“Gareth Edwards fully deserves the honour of a knighthood for the incredible contribution to rugby he has made both on and off the field,” Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) president Dennis Gethin said in a WRU statement.
“His reputation as a player is possibly unparalleled and since retiring from the game he has continued to be a powerful ambassador for rugby both in Wales and around the world.”
Anderson, 32, became England’s leading test wicket taker this year, surpassing Ian Botham’s record of 383 victims.
He claimed his 400th wicket in the recent series against New Zealand and is still England’s leading fast bowler ahead of this summer’s Ashes series against Australia.
“This means an enormous amount to me and my family,” Anderson said in an England and Wales Cricket Board statement.
“I’m very proud of my recent achievements and this just caps it off. These achievements wouldn’t have been possible without the help and support of my family, friends and everyone at Burnley Cricket Club, Lancashire County Cricket Club and England.”
Former Chelsea and Manchester City midfielder Lampard, 36, was honoured for his services to football ahead of his move to Major League Soccer club New York City FC.
Lampard has won the Champions League, Europa League, three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups during a career that started at West Ham United.
“I am delighted to receive this huge honour,” said Lampard, who won 106 England caps. “I feel very fortunate to have had such a long and fulfilling career in football.
“This is an extremely proud moment for myself and my family.”The Pink Diamond Revue heads to ‘The Albert’
The Pink Diamond Revue and How To Live have both announced that they will be performing a gig together here in Brighton up at The Prince Albert on Sunday 15th December 2019. The Brighton & Hove News Music Team delve a little deeper to see exactly what this is all about!
The Pink Diamond Revue – what is it? The way we see it is an electro-amalgam of 1987-89 ‘Music For The Masses’ era Depeche Mode; the electro-psych vibe of TVAM; ‘Peter Gunn’ flavour Art Of Noise; a snippet of Sigue Sigue Sputnik and lashings and lashings of Sheep On Drugs imagery and sounds that the likes of Marc Almond would adore. The way The Pink Diamond Review see it “A world where ‘60s film soundtracks meet sampladelic acid house in a baggy-punk rathole somewhere in Interzone”.
The way they see it …“Live band fronted by Acid Dol a model from another dimension”. The way we see it is two guys, namely chisel-edged featured ‘Thin White Duke’, London based guitarist and vocalist going by the name of Tim Lane accompanied by Reading based drummer Rob Courtman Stock and fronted by the top half of a female mannequin doll, that they may or may not be obsessed with! See what we mean HERE.
We understand that their forthcoming single will be a cover of the epic Sean Connery James Bond ‘Diamonds Are Forever’ theme made famous by Shirley Bassey in 1971 and that The Pink Diamond Revue fans can expect something rather special to drop on the music front on Christmas Day too!
More info on The Pink Diamond Revue can be found HERE.
How To Live on the case last month in Brighton (pics Cris Watkins Photography) (click pics to enlarge!)
Support at The Prince Albert gig will come from How To Live, who are a London based minimalist alt-pop duo who work with a variety of instruments including drum machines, live drums, guitars, and synths to create their distinctly British sound – think Royal Blood meets Hans Zimmer in a nightclub.
We actually saw them live last month (August 2019) and reported…………
“There were three support acts on tonight, with the first up being How To Live, who are a multi-instrumental London duo made up of Thomas Anonymous and Rich Summers, who specialise in making rhythmic, minimal, cinematic music with a tribal edge, something along the lines of Psyche or Soft Cell. I liked the circular single-pad analog drum synthesizer which reminded me of those hexagonal ones used by Gary Numan in 1979. We, the punters, were their guinea pigs for around 25 minutes as they calmly worked their way through their passable set, with the highlight being ‘Discovery In The Woods’.”
Tickets for the forthcoming gig are a mere £5 on the door at 48 Trafalgar St, Brighton BN1 4ED, with the doors swinging wide open from 7:30pm on Sunday 15th December 2019. The teaser video of the event can be seen HERE.

Asia's major oil consuming nations have decided to release crude oil from their respective strategic petroleum reserves in coordinated efforts with the US to ease the price burden on Asia Pacific consumers, but some of the top Asian economies believe there are more effective ways to tame consumer inflation such as lowering fuel taxes.

India, China, South Korea and Japan said they plan to release their state oil reserves after the White House announced Nov. 23 that the US will release 50 million barrels from its SPR early next year.
India has agreed to release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its SPR, while China is poised to release more crude from state reserves amid expectations that the second set of auctions could potentially include at least 7 million barrels of medium sweet ESPO blend crude.
South Korea will release crude from its SPR, with a source at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy indicating that Seoul could offer about 3.8 million barrels.
Japan will also sell part of the country's national petroleum reserves. Tokyo's sales of national petroleum reserves will be made by advancing its planned sales of crude oil grades for replacement in the national petroleum reserves without violating the country's petroleum stockpiling law. The sales could amount to around "a couple of hundred thousand kiloliters," according to Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda.
However, the volume of the major Asian economies' SPR releases disappointed global market participants, while New Delhi, Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo and have all failed to provide any timeline for their crude releases so far.
"Asia's SPR release was below expectations and it is [even understood to be] an exchange deal... buyers need to return the oil in 2022 to 2024," a crude trader based in Singapore said.
The combined total of the four nations' crude releases account for only a tiny portion of their SPRs. Many Asian nations are not exactly keen on fully utilizing national reserves, with state-run oil companies and major private refiners in Northeast and Southeast Asia indicating that the true purpose of the SPR is for critical events such as drastic supply disruptions due to major geopolitical events like war, not for commercial reasons like high prices.
In addition, quality concerns could limit demand from Japanese refiners as a large quantity of crude oil in Japan's SPR has been sealed in the same tanks for more than decades, according to refinery and trading sources with close knowledge of the matter.
Tax cuts, subsidies
Authorities in South Korea and Japan are seeking to implement more constructive ways to tackle the rising consumer inflation and help ease the burden on consumers struggling with high retail fuel prices.
Earlier this month, South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance decided to lower taxes on auto fuels by as much as 20% for six months from November, as part of efforts to ease rise in pump prices.
In Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry decided to provide subsidies to curb increases in retail prices of gasoline, kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil from the end of December to end of March in an effort to aid domestic transportation fuel consumers.
Tax cuts and subsidies can effectively and promptly bring prices down for consumers, but it takes months for the big international benchmark price moves to be fully reflected in daily life for the average citizen and retail gas stations, according to middle distillate marketers at Japan's Cosmo Oil and South Korea's S-Oil Corp.
OPEC+ hike, not cut
Oil industry and refinery sources across Asia indicated that although OPEC and its allies are adopting a cautious approach in the group's production strategy, the producers are still raising production, albeit at a slower-than-desired rate.
OPEC and its allies are standing firm on increasing crude output quotas by a modest 400,000 b/d each month. In contrast, nine major Asian refiners surveyed by S&P Global Platts -- including PTT, BPCL, ENEOS, SK Innovation, Petronas and PetroChina -- indicated the producer group should ideally raise supply by at least 800,000 b/d as current oil prices appear too high and consumer sentiment is hurt by prices at these levels.
However, the current market fundamentals are far from what Asian oil and refining industry would classify as a 'state emergency' as the OPEC+ is still looking to raise output and the group is not actually reducing supply, according to trading managers and plant operation managers at the major Asian refiners surveyed.Look up quakes by region or country

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly rearranged the workings of the world and its industries. People’s professional lives have been pushed back into their homes as ‘work from home’ becomes the new normal. However, the requirement for remote functioning brought on a need for new software—something that could allow employees to perform their duties remotely in a cost-efficient manner.
Enter Cloud Solutions
In the past few years, the transition to the cloud has been gradually increasing due to its various benefits. With the lockdown and restrictions this year, this transition has been given a significant boost. Companies have consistently considered cloud telephony to fulfil their customer service requirements. There are several reports, studies and news portals vouching for the same.
However, before we delve into the numbers, let’s discuss why there may be such a heavy demand for cloud telephony.
Benefits of Adopting Cloud Telephony for your Business
Cloud telephony has been a revolutionary invention in the telecom service. It has introduced a bundle of features that streamlined business operations, something that was almost impossible to do before. Some of its benefits include:
(1) Cost-efficient: With no need for hardware or data silos, this technology can be easily accepted by small and medium-sized enterprises.
(2) Remote working: Typically, cloud telephony is not just limited to devices. This eases remote working for employees as long as they own a smartphone and Internet service.
(3) Easy installation: The transition to the cloud is an extremely simple process. Once installed, you could take control of the new system in no time. This makes it an easy choice for companies, considering the suddenness of the lockdown.
(4) Customer experience: With IVR, toll-free numbers, call recording and analysis services, cloud telephony promises an enhanced customer experience. The wait times and costs are lower, first point resolution is encouraged, and experience is more personalised overall.
(5) Flexible scaling: Most cloud telephony providers employ a pay-as-you-go model. Because of this, you can scale up or down on your services as per your project requirements.
(6) Consistently updated: Cloud technology, in general, can be updated and optimised constantly. Providers can instantly update your systems once you have chosen cloud telephony.
The pandemic has served as a catalyst for organisations to switch to newer technologies (like cloud telephony) to keep their operations running smoothly. Most importantly, there has been a boost in video conferencing apps, online retail sites, virtual private networks (VPN), and cloud telephony. Notice the commonality? All these endeavours improve life in isolation and by extension, in quarantine.
According to Virtualisation and Cloud Review, Flexera 2020 State of the Cloud Report notes the increased usage of cloud services in 2020. 750 global decision-makers were consulted about their thoughts on the public, private and multi-cloud market.
These respondents were asked about the change in their planned use of cloud services because of the COVID-19 pandemic; 31% expressed that there has been a slight increase, while 26% attest to a significant rise in the usage. 57%, thus, agree that there has been some form of an increase in cloud computing ever since the introduction of COVID-19.
This study was conducted in the first quarter of the year and explores the early transitions in the pandemic. Even as early as then, businesses were seen spending more towards cloud solutions as a way to facilitate their remote working requirements. In the first quarter itself, it showed that organisations spent 23% over their original budget for their cloud services.
The study also predicts that over the next 12 months from the first quarter, organisational spend on will increase by 47%.
Ever since the introduction and advancement of coronavirus, one cannot deny that there have been lifestyle changes but, one must also identify the change in the way people think. The fear of crowds and large gatherings has taken strong roots and virtual reality has become a more comfortable option.
Remote working has been the major driver in the adoption of the cloud. Earlier this year, some of the biggest companies in the world—Facebook, Google, Twitter—announced that their employees are granted a work from home status till either the end of the year or indefinitely.
A revolutionary step, it changes the entire concept of the organisations’ workings. According to an article by Virtualisation and Cloud Review, this has greatly helped in migration to the cloud. While people are enjoying all the benefits of cloud computing, telephony has been the backbone of customer service. It helps with quicker responses and smooth communication, both of which are absolutely vital in the year of event cancellations and delivery restrictions.
An estimation by Market Study Report says that between 2020 and 2025, the global cloud telephony market is expected to grow with a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 9.3% and is expected to reach from USD 13,160 million in 2019 to USD 18,810 million in 2025.
Statista presents a report by Gartner inc, saying that the global cloud telephony market will grow by 9% in the year 2020 and leap by another 17.8 % in 2021. While the numbers may be slightly varied, all the reports suggest that the cloud telephony market is thriving further. A part of this credit is definitely to be given to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Bottom Line
The coronavirus pandemic has been a life-altering event for everyone in the 21st century. It has affected both our personal and professional lives. The corporate world has had to make several changes in their functioning to accommodate remote working.
Cloud services have been increasingly adopted by companies as it is cost-efficient, easy to install but also because it enables remote working. It enables seamless conversation between the consumer and the company. Agents can set up a home office as long as they have a device and an internet connection.

Branding… what is it? Well, branding isn’t just your logo or banner etc, it’s a whole package affair and I hope to give you a wee insight. So, branding is something which is solid and consistent and not just visually but across the board.
Branding isn’t just your name…it’s so much bigger than that. It’s what people ‘expect’ when they think of you/your brand/your product and as authors that makes it even harder for us to get it right. Your brand is also to do with what readers expect from you and your books. So, if you write contemp romance, or pnr and suddenly put out a different genre series … that, in effect, dilutes your brand and it can, I’m not saying always, but it ‘can’ dilute it … in effect … it dilutes you.
For instance, we all know when we pick up a can of Coke what to expect, they have a brand and they stick to it. If one day you grabbed a can and took a drink and suddenly it tasted like orange juice … you’d be unhappy because that’s not their brand. They’d changed it, they’d diluted their brand and Coke would never do that. So, you shouldn’t do it either unless you want to dilute your brand.
You might be one of the lucky ones who can write very different genres and have a mix of readers who’ll pick up anything you write, but for the most part, if your reader base loves one genre they don’t generally expect you to pop out something drastically different and can be thrown if you do.
A lot of readers don’t genre hop, they read one and a lot stick to it so you don’t want to lose them, this can lead to losing your precious readers … just because you weren’t true to your brand.
It’s why some authors use different pen names for different genres as in … different branding for different genres. Or they’ll have So and so writing as … so their readers know it’s them but also know they’re writing in another genre. They’re not springing it on them but they’re also tapping into their reader base too in case those readers might want to pick the story up.
Then there’s the Social Branding aspect … and please excuse my french, but it really does come down to never, ever, be an eejit, or to put it more bluntly, an ass. Not ever. Don’t be passive aggressive or out and out aggressive. Do not, repeat, do not engage in drama on FB. Ever. No matter what’s going on in the industry … and let’s be honest, there is always drama, every other day there’s something happening. Do not engage. No matter if you know the person, no matter if you have inside gossip … do not engage.
Readers see this. They see it as a reflection of you, your brand. It dilutes it, dilutes you … and it can take forever to rebuild. If at all.
Be ‘truthful’ to your brand … what I mean by that is … don’t have one face on your Author page a different one on your personal. Readers will see it and that will not go over well. So be true to who you are and be consistent. The fact is, your author business is just that … a business and a lot of people forget that. You should remember to conduct yourself just like you would as if you were working in any other job because this IS your job.
We’ve all seen authors who’ve acted badly on FB … and had their careers impacted by that. Don’t let that be you. It can impact not just on readers, but on your work too, other authors see it, they see how you are on FB, they see your brand, and it could influence a future decision on whether someone would work with you on a project, a shared world or a boxset, for instance.
Look at FB as your ‘office’, if you do that, and act as if it is, then you won’t go wrong, after all, you wouldn’t go into your office and start scrapping with another member of staff there… would you? Going online on FB and having a barney with say… another author, or a reader, or someone who you don’t agree with… it’s just the same. Except, it’s far worse because it’s online and everyone can see you doing it, and once it’s out there online it can never be undone … screenshots are forever, so even if you do something you regret and delete it, you can bet your backside that someone has taken screenshots and posted all over the place about it.
So, golden rule, don’t do it, FB is your office and you’re the Boss. Act in a manner that does your brand proud and you’ll be fine.
Then there’s the visual side, with logos and banners etc. Notice how I came to this last? It is important, of course it is, but in my opinion if you don’t get the above right, images don’t matter. You can have the best images in the world but if the rest isn’t done right this part is a total waste of time.
That being said, let’s get to it… now, you don’t have to spend tons on these. Yes, of course you can, I have in the past, I’ve had several different logos, and did a rebrand a few years ago but didn’t feel it suited me completely and I was lucky enough to mention it to a friend, another author who’s got a talent with working with images, and straight away she said to me, okay, let’s work on this and so we did. And voila, we ended up with something I was much happier with and when I asked about it in my reader group and in my newsletter… the feedback was wonderful.
So, for this part of it, I’d say to go with your gut and work with someone you feel comfortable with but not to tackle this yourself unless you have a first class knowledge in that department. And even if you do, it’s sometimes difficult to decide these things when you’re designing something for you and not a client.
So I’d say to ask for plenty of input before deciding on a final product and remember, always, your brand and what you’re trying to put over to reflect it. Sometimes simple is best.
You can, of course, look at other authors in your genre to get some inspiration if you have no clue what you want, but of course, don’t copy someone else’s design. You want something that’s unique to you so that when people see it they’ll automatically think of you and only you and not get confused and wonder, hmm, is that so and so… or? You want your own brand, not someone else’s.
That’s all I have, I hope I’ve helped you get some insight to branding as a whole and not just the logo side of things and I hope I’ve not bored you to death.

by Jack Waymire
Everyone claims to be a financial advisor who is also a trustworthy financial expert. They make these claims to win your trust and gain control of your assets.
Unfortunately, most financial advisors are not really advisors. They are salesmen who masquerade as advisors to lower your sales resistance – 92.7% of investors say they do not want salesmen investing their assets for them. Unscrupulous salesmen overcome this hurdle by changing their job descriptions.
In this article, I will answer five questions that describe the type of professional you should select to help you achieve your financial goals:
- Who should you trust?
- How do you measure competence?
- How do you measure ethics?
- How to identify a real financial advisor?
- Why select a fiduciary financial advisor?
Who Should You Trust?
You should trust financial advisors who can prove they are competent, ethical professionals who produce competitive rates of return for reasonable risk and expense. Easy to say, but very hard to do. It is very difficult to measure financial advisor competence, ethics, and past performance.
What About Competence?
It is difficult to measure competence when financial advisors do not provide audited track records for the returns they have produced in the past. Instead, they describe their results in sales pitches, that does not include any legitimate documentation for their past results.
In the absence of audited track records, you have to review advisor education, experience, and certifications to begin to measure competence.
You should ignore verbal information. It is not a substitute for a documented track record.
You should notify the authorities if an advisor claims he can produce exceptional returns for low risk. Scam artists make this claim when they sell Ponzi schemes.
What About Ethics?
You should trust financial advisors who have a record of doing what is best for their clients. The historical treatment of clients is a primary indicator, but it does not guarantee the ethical treatment of clients in the future.
View advisor and firm compliance records at FINRA.org/BrokerCheck and SEC.gov.
Who Are Real Financial Advisors?
This one is simple. Real advisors have two key characteristics that differentiate them from sales representatives.
First is their registration. Financial advisory firms are Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs). Financial professionals are Investment Advisor Representatives (IARs). RIA and IAR registrations permit them to provide financial advice and ongoing services.
Second, their registrations allow them to be compensated with fees and not commissions. They may be paid hourly or fixed fees for planning advice and services. They are usually paid asset-based (% of assets) fees for their investment advice and services.
Select A Fiduciary Financial Advisor
RIAs and IARs are real financial advisors. They are also financial fiduciaries. Fiduciary is the highest ethical standard in the financial services industry. Fiduciaries are required to put your financial interests first.
Non-fiduciaries, for example stockbrokers, are not required to put your financial interests first. They are held to a lower ethical standard that is called suitability.
Imagine selecting a “financial advisor” who is not required to put your financial interests first. Prudent investors always select fiduciary financial advisors.
Get It In Writing
All of the information that you are going to depend on to determine advisor quality should be provided to you in writing.
Why written? Verbal information is contained in sales pitches. It is easy for advisors to misrepresent and omit information when there is no...The payment system Okpay was registered in 2009 in the Virgin Islands.

Playing Costa Bingo
I quite enjoyed playing on this bingo site, the chat was quite friendly and the other players were nice as well. There is a choice of 12 rooms which include both 90 ball and 75 ball bingo.

As Bell has gotten to know Darnold since joining the Jets Sam Darnold Jerseys Stitched , however, he’s realized that there are similarities between the two.Bell called Darnold “a competitor” who is always looking to get better on the practice field and said he’d describe himself the same way.“It’s hard to describe someone that’s like that because I’m like that Youth Nathan Shepherd Jerseys ,” Bell said, via the team’s website. “A lot of people go to practice and you’re just practicing.

JD.com Stages Largest Recruitment of Graduates in The Industry by Providing 40,000 Openings in The Past Three Years
by Yuchuan Wang
JD.com announced on Aug. 17 that the company had provided nearly 40,000 job opportunities for graduates in the past three years with 358 types of positions. This July saw almost 400 new hires born after the year of 2000 joining JD.com.
With rapid development of businesses, JD has been leading in the industry in recruiting the most graduates in the past few years. Earlier this month, the company announced that it will provide 150 types of job positions for class 2022, covering the company’s major businesses across retail, technology, logistics, healthcare, property management, international business and industrial solutions.
While increasing the quantity of recruitment and types of positions, JD also continues to increase the incentive measures for talent. In July this year, JD.com announced that it will increase employee annual pay (including bonuses) from 14 months to 16 months over the next two years.

California is burning — on track for the most savage fire year in its history. Drought and scorching temperatures have turbocharged fires that are more extreme than ever. Two of the biggest fires in state history have laid siege to more than a million acres in Northern California, burning dangerously close to Lake Tahoe. Firefighters haven’t had a day off in months. Fire chiefs warn there aren’t enough aircraft to go around. “It’s a war,” one told us. Now, fire chiefs from Southern California have stolen a page from the military: take the fight to the night. A new fleet of hi-tech helicopters will fight wildfires 24/7. And for the first time, the giant Chinook — you’ve seen them in other war zones — will lead the night assault. It’s an $18 million pilot program the fire chiefs hope will be a game changer.
The U.S. Forest Service was already short-staffed when the Caldor Fire exploded last month, churning toward South Lake Tahoe. Thousands of residents were forced to flee. To the north, the Dixie Fire has been rampaging for months, demolishing historic gold rush towns. The drought-parched forests burn so hot they generate their own fire tornados. Between the two infernos, more than 8,000 bone-weary firefighters have been waging a relentless battle. Orange County Fire Chief Brian Fennessy — a former Hotshot who’s been fighting fires in Southern California for 44 years — told us there is no more give in the system.
Brian Fennessy: These fires get so large that there aren’t enough firefighters, aren’t enough airplanes, helicopters, bulldozers.
Bill Whitaker: I would think that would be worrisome .
Brian Fennessy: You know, we’re to the point where if we were to send much more, we’re going to have firehouses that are empty. And for the people that we’ve sworn to serve, you know, our taxpayers, it’s not acceptable to have firehouses empty for any length of time.
Bill Whitaker: Everything is stretched to the limit.
Brian Fennessy: Everything is stretched.
We met Brian Fennessy at the Truckee Airfield, about 45 miles from the fires. After Caldor destroyed the town of Grizzly Flats, Fennessy volunteered to send his new firefighting choppers north. More like flying computers with rotors on top, they’re called the Quick Reaction Force. Fennessy calls the fleet, “The Hammer.”
Brian Fennessy: This is The Hammer!
Bill Whitaker: So if someone calls 911
Brian Fennessy: If something breaks out
Bill Whitaker: You hit it with everything you’ve got, these big guys and knock it out.
Brian Fennessy: In case of fire, break glass.
The star of the show is the massive Chinook – this one used to fly in Afghanistan for the U.S. Army. It’s been retrofitted to fight a different war, dropping water or retardant. Now, Fennessy told us they have this powerful new tool to take that fight to the night.
Brian Fennessy: The ability to lay retardant line, to continue to drop fire retardant after sundown, that’s a first.
Bill Whitaker: That’s gonna change the way you fight fires?
Brian Fennessy: We hope so.
The Chinook can drop 3,000 gallons. That’s about 10 times what most firefighting choppers drop. No bigger helicopter has ever fought fires at night.
Wayne Coulson, the CEO of Coulson Aviation — which built the fleet — is a pioneer in night firefighting. He showed us the specially-designed tank. Computers control the tank’s doors, opening at precise GPS points.
Bill Whitaker: You can zero in exactly on the spot you want to drop?
Wayne Coulson: We can fly the aircraft to those GPS points and the doors will automatically open and close between those two points.
Coulson told us it’s a more surgical strike. Flame retardant can be dropped in almost straight lines. At night, there’s an added advantage: the fire usually dies down.
Bill Whitaker: Is that a better time to hit the fire?
Wayne Coulson: It absolutely is. That’s when it’s its weakest.
Bill Whitaker: Usually its weakest?
Wayne Coulson: That’s the time to attack an enemy, at its weakest point in time.
The Quick Reaction Force works in pairs. The Chinook gets its orders from this aircraft. Think of it as a traffic control tower — but in the air. Wearing night vision goggles, Orange County Air Attack officer Joel Lane uses infrared cameras to see through the smoke to map the best targets for the Chinook.
Lane has spent the last 23 years in the air. Improved night vision technology has revived night firefighting — most agencies halted night flying after a mid-air collision in the 1970s. Lane told us the technology means they can attack fires at any hour.
Joel Lane: If you time a fire let’s say for one minute, and its 2 acres, in two minutes, it’s not gonna be 4, it’s gonna be 9. And in three minutes, it’s gonna be 27.
Bill Whitaker: And the fire’s going faster.
Joel Lane: And the only thing that stops that is speed and force.
Bill Whitaker: And that’s what you get with the aircraft?
Joel Lane: That is exactly what you get with the aircraft.
In early September we flew with Britt Coulson, Wayne’s son and tech wizard at Coulson Aviation. He turned on the powerful thermal imaging camera and the Caldor Fire burst into view.
Britt Coulson: Those flames are higher than the trees.
As we flew closer, we watched a fountain of flames exploding over the treetops. There was fire everywhere, every point of light a potentially hellish new blaze.
Britt Coulson: The embers that come up when it’s really intense, they’re gonna spot out far ahead.
Zooming in, Britt Coulson showed us a spot fire that had leapt over a containment line dug by firefighters.
Wayne Coulson: So let’s say if they were trying to catch it along that ridgeline there.
Bill Whitaker: This has already jumped over?
Wayne Coulson: It’s jumped over. Without this type of technology, they’re never gonna see that.
We circled the fires at 13,000 feet. Below us, we spotted the command helicopter with Joel Lane. A thousand feet below that is where the Chinook flies. Lane directs the big chopper to the drop zone. From our perch, we could almost count the trees as we flew over a blackened landscape. Then we saw boats, docks and houses: South Lake Tahoe.
Wayne Coulson: That’s South Lake Tahoe airport right there. And then you got the fire right there.
Bill Whitaker: Right behind it.
Wayne Coulson: So there, you’ve got all the individual embers coming up.
Bill Whitaker: That’s burning heavily.
Wayne Coulson: Yeah.
The Chinook sweeps across the flames, drops its water, then heads to the nearest lake to refill. Unlike fixed-wing craft that have to return to base, the Chinook can refill anywhere. Hovering like some prehistoric bird, it sucks up 3,000 gallons in 90 seconds.
This doesn’t come cheap. A helitanker can cost up to $15 million, and $8,000 an hour to operate. But Joel Lane told us it’s money well spent.
He told us about the Tuna Fire, which ignited in dry brush near Malibu in July. It was promptly doused by a Quick Reaction Chinook at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, a fraction of what it would have cost if the fire had gotten out of control. If you never heard of the Tuna Fire, says Lane, that’s a win.
Joel Lane: So the 10-acre fire that you—that we catch 98% of the time, it’s never gonna make the paper, you’re never gonna hear about it. Public wakes up the next day and unless they drive by it, they never know it happened. And we do that very successfully, especially in Southern California.
Bill Whitaker: The finances that you’re laying out, that, yes, it’s expensive to have these aircraft but it’s more expensive if you don’t catch the fire.
Joel Lane: Exponentially.
Bill Whitaker: Exponentially more expensive?
Joel Lane: Correct.
In Northern California, the Dixie Fire is now the largest single fire in state history. Exhausted firefighters are still fighting the Caldor Fire. The cost? More than a half-billion dollars and climbing. Yet during our trip, the helitankers flew only one out of four nights. We wondered why? So did Orange County fire chief Brian Fennessy, who had sent his best equipment to fight the state’s worst fires.
Bill Whitaker: Did they not put it to work as soon as you brought it up here?
Brian Fennessy: Not not initially, no.
Bill Whitaker: Why not?
Brian Fennessy: It took a lot of— they didn’t have any familiarization with you know flying at night. And so we had to slow down.
Bill Whitaker: But it’s proven.
Brian Fennessy: And we’re in the middle of chaos and uncertainty and homes are burning, that doesn’t work.
In the week we were there, the Caldor Fire grew by 40,000 acres. Perhaps as alarming: we discovered the slow down was fueled, in part, by infighting between the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees federal lands, and Cal Fire, responsible for state forests. Chief Fennessy told us he twice offered up his new fleet, and twice met with discord and confusion.
We saw the forest service sign off on decisions, only to have them changed by Cal Fire. Firefighters told us the agencies disagreed about night missions, radio frequencies, how to feed firefighters. They both challenged the credentials of the Orange County flight crews.
Bill Whitaker: That doesn’t seem like the most efficient way to handle the resources, especially in the face of a huge fire?
Brian Fennessy: Extremely frustrating. We have a system, the Fire Service, where we honor each other’s qualifications. Yeah, it is frustrating because you know when there’s a delay in accepting these qualifications to the detriment of the public, yeah, that’s a concern.
When Chief Fennessy first sent his choppers, two crews sat on the tarmac for 48 hours. Fed up, he protested in an email, which we obtained through a Freedom of Information request.
“I don’t think the public will understand this nonsense,” he wrote. “Especially if our crews are grounded and there are no aviation safety issues to address.”
Cal Fire told us the crew check was a standard safety procedure and that smoke and wind prevented flying some nights. Chief Fennessy told us only when he threatened to take his choppers back south, did the agencies give the green light to fly.
Still, Brian Fennessy and two other Southern California fire chiefs were so dismayed the fleet was being used so little, they complained in an email to the Forest Service: “there was ample opportunity for the safe consistent operation of the [Quick Reaction Force] both during the day and at night, but this did not occur.”
Brian Fennessy: Well I have an expectation that if I’m going to loan you, you know, my stuff ’cause you’re having an emergency, you’re going to put it to work. If you’re not going to put it to work, send it home ’cause I’ve got work and I’ve got citizens here to protect. We’re going to go to work.
Fennessy told us the intensity of these fires demands a new approach to fighting them.
Brian Fennessy: I’d heard from agencies at the highest level, that there was not a concern for aviation safety. It was more of a concern for–
Bill Whitaker: Bureaucracy….?
Brian Fennessy: You said it.
Bill Whitaker: The fires are changing …
Brian Fennessy: The fires are changing. We’ve got to be more—
Bill Whitaker: The climate is changing
Brian Fennessy: Oh— we— we’ve got to be more nimble. We’ve got to be able to pivot very quickly —
Bill Whitaker: Fires aren’t going to wait for you to get your act together.
Brian Fennessy: No, they’re not.
We repeatedly asked Cal Fire and the Forest Service why the night-flying choppers weren’t used more. Weeks later, they did get together to issue a joint statement about their “shared mission.”
They wrote: “Each fire presents its own unique challenges and fire managers stand shoulder-to-shoulder every day to overcome these hurdles…”
The day after we left, Chief Fennessy took his Quick Reaction Force back south where the Santa Ana winds and the number of fires are picking up. Fennessy told us, with fires getting more extreme, Cal Fire and the Forest Service can’t afford to sideline the Big Hammer.
Brian Fennessy: These aircraft are being credited with saving countless property because they were available at night to do that.
Bill Whitaker: And you’ve proven it.
Brian Fennessy: We’ve proven it. It’s a program that I believe needs to expand not just to Northern California, but throughout the West.
Bill Whitaker: What’s the resistance? Why the resistance?
Brian Fennessy: You know, my gut tells me based on decades of experience in the Fire Service that there’s just an inherent resistance to change. But we’ve got to evolve. We’ve got to pivot. We are standing, you know, in a new world. It’s not a new norm. It’s the norm.

"It's a war": California turns to new, high-tech helicopters to battle wildfires — 60 Minutes – CBS News
Bill Whitaker reports on the largest helicopter to ever fight fires at night, now being used in California as the state faces one of its most intense fire years ever.A horrific crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike killed 5 and injured approximately 60 people according to reports. The accident happened early this morning at milepost 86 westbound between the Donegal and New Stanton exits in Mount Pleasant, Westmoreland County.
Officials reported that multiple vehicles including two commercial tractor-trailers, and a passenger vehicle, were involved in the crash. Crash victims were taken to several different local hospitals including UPMC Somerset Hospital in Somerset, Excela Frick Hospital in Mount Pleasant, Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville, UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, and UPMC Children’s Hospital Pittsburgh.
The Pennsylvania Turnpike is closed in both directions between the New Stanton exit and the Breezewood exit while police and the National Travel Safety Board investigate.
According to Pennsylvania State Police, the tour bus was traveling on a downhill curve on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Mount Pleasant when it struck an embankment and flipped on its side. Two commercial trucks and a white car who were traveling behind the bus, crashed into the bus.
During a press conference the Pennsylvania State Police reported the bus, which is with Z&D Tour, Inc., was traveling from Rockaway, New Jersey to Cincinnati, Ohio.
The American Red Cross Greater Pittsburgh region is assisting several of the injured and their families. Pennsylvania State Police reported that many of the injured may not speak English as a first language.Age reduction Academic atmosphere Beef tendon bottom Straight buckle low-heel cowhide Lefu shoes Mary Jane shoes Spring and summer Women's shoes 0.73

DIAL 911Mattel showed off a lot more new MOTU stuff than I usually expect to see from them on preview night. First and foremost for me was an updated Grayskull prototype. I’m so pleased with the changes they made. By lowering the Jawbridge into the base, they addressed the main concern I had with the playset. He-Man has a good amount of head clearance walking in and out. It looks to me like there is more room in the interior and seeing this in person, I really have no issues with the size. Woo! I’m excited about this whole thing again. Did you see that box art? So nice.
Another cool reveal was the Sky sled portion of the battle ram will be released with Sky-High the Wind Raider pilot! I’m so stoked to see we will finally get at least the jet sled portion of the 4H’s amazing Battle Ram sculpt. Sky-High is also a great addition to the Fighting Foe-Men team and will definitely be piloting the Wind Raider on my shelf. I love his little wings. It looks like maybe they could be used as a weapon as well, but I like the idea of this guy having a backup plan if he gets shot off that Jet Sled.
A nice thing to see was that Geldor is looking really cool. He had some bland potential there, but I think the final sculpt came out nice. Also on hand is the not incredibly impressive Nepthu. Sorry to say this one feels like a bit of misstep. On a nicer note, the production versions of Castaspella, Mantenna and Batros all looked amazing.
Another cool reveal is the next weapons pack featuring Kowl, Sir Laser-Lot’s weapons in gray, some green He-Man weapons, Hurricane Hordak stuff in Black for Trappy, Trappy stuff in gray for Roboto, Raptor’s armor, a new sword for Netossa, and a gun for Strobo.Beyond Bizplan - Get the entire Startups.com platform with Startups Unlimited.

And that conversation was probably not much different than the one Kristen had with her husband when she decided to take the plunge and launch her coaching business. This week, join her in welcoming her partner-in-crime and spouse of almost 10 years, Scott Boss, as they discuss how they navigated the choppy waters of running a business and household in tandem.
This behind-the-scenes episode sheds some light on a few of the real-life decisions most couples face when mixing marriage with business. Listen in as they explain the steps they took to propel themselves from two people who never had a day off together, into the power couple who strengthened their bond as a married couple and parents through this journey.
- Why you should never use your income as leverage in the relationship
- The importance of learning to communicate effectively early on
- Adjusting budget expectations when your network marketing income grows from hobby money to household money
- Why retiring your husband shouldn’t be your goal
- Learning to be ok with ‘parting with profit’ in order to make life more manageable
- The all-important lesson of investing in yourself and your business
In marriage, it’s always in your best interest to communicate expectations on both sides. When adding in the possible complications of a business, it becomes even more essential. Being open and honest about money, business goals, and setbacks gives your partner the opportunity to participate and builds a better team dynamic in the end. #76: Business and Marriage Part Two
Kristen Boss (00. Hey bosses. Welcome to another week of the podcast today. We have a special guest. It has been somebody I’ve been talking about bringing on the podcast for quite some time. And today you all get to hear from my partner in crime, my bestie, my husband, Mr. Scott Boss, you’re on babe. I told them, I told them before he came on today, I’m like, you have got to bring the dad jokes down to a minimal actually don’t have any.
Scott Boss (00:01:19): So this will be the most boring episode you ever listened to.
Kristen Boss (00:01:23): No, I think they’re going to love it. So I asked my listeners what they wanted to hear from us. And there’s been a couple things just in my journey and what I’ve talked about, that people ask me on a regular basis that we’ll talk about. But I think what my listeners really want is to hear from your perspective, what this kind of journey has been like for both of us, because you know, in the early days it was really hard and we were balancing gosh, for the first six years in our marriage. I think we didn’t have a day off together. We were ships passing in the night. You were working, non-profit doing youth ministry at the church. I was building you know, my clientele at the salon while also working my online business. So we had some pretty rough years and a lot of people when they first start out, especially specifically the women when they start out. Cause I think I really got into building my business when our youngest was born our daughter right when she was a newborn. And that was just the hardest season because then we were balanced balancing parenthood. So what do you remember of that season in our marriage and like lessons we learned in that?
Scott Boss (00:02:49): Well, first of all, its a blur, I think your second, it turns into a little bit of a blur. We look back on pictures and we’re like, did we even have a second kid? Yes we do cause they’re here, but there’s no pictures of them as a baby. So it’s, I mean it definitely a blur, but I think about that season, it was a lot of bouncing. It’s a ton of communication. It’s a ton of trying to figure out who’s going to be where and without that line of communication, I think building anything is impossible because you have people in different places, people in different mindsets, different heartbeats, you know, the rhythms are not sinked. And so there’s a lot of give and take that we’ve had to do over the years, just because of our schedules aside from, you know, your current business and our current schedule. But just figuring out who’s going to take certain ownerships of things. Right? So things about the home things with kids things from, you know, babysitters, all of those pieces were just a little bit different than maybe the cultural norms, just because of how our, our, work schedules.
Kristen Boss (00:03:51): Yeah, I think with both of our work schedules and that we had two young kids who were 15, not quite 16 months apart, I think we were forced to learn to over-communicate early. Cause I think those were some of our biggest pain points was when it was like, oh, I thought you were going to do that. Or can you do that? So we just had to communicate a lot and do a lot of navigating. I just remember for me at one point figuring out like, I think I had assigned to gender roles to certain tasks in the house. There still is you do the yard work. That’s always going to feed no one cares about your lawn. Like you do. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
Scott Boss (00:04:35): It’s true. No one does care about my lawn like I do. That’s why no one touches my lawn.
Kristen Boss (00:04:40): That’s your full-time job now. That’s what you do. But I think we just had to really gosh, make it work just because yeah, we didn’t have a day off together for years. Was it six years?
Scott Boss (00:04:57): Yeah. Our day outs, our days off were different, you’d never had two days off in a row.
Kristen Boss (00:05:00): I never had two days off in a row. You worked nights all night
Scott Boss (00:05:05): All the time. So I’m sure there’s people that have that same kind of story in their own, in their own journey. As they’re figuring out either how to start something or create a side hustle or whatever, it might be in the sense of another, another stream of income for the family. And so we, we tried a lot of that and it wasn’t just our main jobs, but you had a number of other jobs that you were getting off the ground. Normally we just got a letter in the mail from one of them
Kristen Boss (00:05:31): Clothing, the clothing boutique. Yeah. Like my husband was there for a lot of my startups. Like, let’s try this, let’s do this. And I think that provides a really good kind of leeway for a really big question. People have is the idea of me being the breadwinner in our marriage. And I think a lot of people have genuine concern that if they’re gonna, you know, out earn their husband or make more than their spouse, that suddenly there’s going to be this there’s going to be a lack of equilibrium and the relationship that the marriage is going to suffer. And I, I honestly think some women are afraid to make more money than their husband because they’re fearful that they’re going to quote, like emasculate him. So can you speak to the listeners a little bit about what that’s been like for you because you were in ministry in nonprofit. So I’ve kind of always been the breadwinner in the marriage.
Scott Boss (00:06:31): Well there’s that piece. I mean, there’s so much, there’s so much to talk about when it comes to this to money and equilibrium, if you want to call it that and the relationship. But yeah. You know, going into ministry, I knew that we weren’t going to make, well, I wasn’t going to make a, a fatty paycheck. Right. I mean, I just, wasn’t going to be the one to bring home a large sum of money, at least not for a number of years, unless I was, you know, an author on top of it or, you know, whatever it might be, you know, some kind of nonprofit president or something. But so there was already that expectation in our, in our, in our relationship that I never forget when I first met you. I remember you telling me about a a client that you were going to do some hair for something one day, and you told me how much you were going to make after that one visit.
Scott Boss (00:07:17): And I was like, man, I wish I made that much an hour. That would be amazing, you know, but but that was kind of the, the understanding from the get-go is that you were, you were in a position that was going to bring in more dollars than what I was going to do. You know, our, my focus was on serving and and unfortunately in some, in a lot of cases, you know, ministry just doesn’t pay as well as maybe it should to, to care for a family. But we knew that going in. And so we made, we made some choices there. Now. It wasn’t easy. I do think that there were moments that we had conversations where I had to be somewhere. And you had an opportunity to either work late or to add a client or something. And it was kind of like, well, how do we decide? Who goes to what spot? Because we do need the money. Right. And so who wins in that conversation? If you will quote,
Kristen Boss (00:08:12): I’m so glad you said that. Cause I was thinking there was a time where there was attention for like who not, I don’t want to say deserved, but fighting for work hours. Like it’s my time to work. And I think often because my time was leveraged better or we made more money with my time. I think it was an, and I think this was growth for me. Cause I do remember at one time you did tell me like, Hey, I just feel like your, you feel your work is more important than mine. I do remember that you saying that to me at some point. And I think I kind of did default to that being like, well of course my work hours when, because I make more money, not realizing that I was kind of sending a message of like your work isn’t as important as mine because you don’t make as much.
Kristen Boss (00:08:58): And I think maybe that’s where I maybe had contributed to the harm in that. Like you, I don’t think you were walking around wounded and emasculated that I was making more. I think that I was just kind of, I made my work more important than yours and therefore I can see how that probably caused some hurt. Cause you, you ended up telling me you’re like that hurt. And so that was, I had to learn that. But I think in that season when it just felt like we were hurting for money, it was just like too bad.
Scott Boss (00:09:32): But you know, back, you know, back to that question about what does it mean if you make more than your husband, is that going to take away some of his identity or whatever it might be? You know, I think the conversation really there, the question is is if your authority or your purpose is coming because of money, that’s a, that’s a deeper question that needs to be solved and communicated and talked through. Then me making more than my husband.
Kristen Boss (00:09:54): Like your authority as a man, like how much your authority as a man and a woman.
Scott Boss (00:09:59): Oh yeah. Or as a wife, your authority comes from how much money you make. And that gives you the leg up to schedule or to go on vacations or to get away or to take a break or you know, what, or to work late, whatever it is. If you’re using that, leverage the dollars that are coming in, I make this much, therefore I deserve this. That’s a whole nother conversation that needs to happen in your marriage because your authority can’t come from that. Right. I can’t be the place in which your authority comes from. And so I think, you know, early on we had this discussion not, and it’s kind of just carried into now with your business even now is just like, what does it mean to be the master of your schedule? And what does it mean for me to be the man of the house? Even though you pay me,
Kristen Boss (00:10:46): I do, that’s your best paying job you’ve ever had.
Scott Boss (00:10:48): That is true. Right. But that’s where, you know, my, my pride and my authority doesn’t come from the dollars I make and it doesn’t get taken away by the dollars you make. Yeah.
Kristen Boss (00:11:03): And I never, and I don’t treat you differently. I don’t, I don’t use my money as like, I actually that’s the first time I’ve ever said my money in front of you. Like I have, I’ve never used my income as leverage over you and so much so that I still defer to you for like purchasing. And I’m like, Hey, what are your thoughts on this? Like, and I think that’s really big is that we’ve always talked about our money as ours instead of your money that you bring in from your job, my money I bring in from my job, I think because we viewed it as like, it is ours, we’re in this together. It kind of, it almost like I don’t want to say levels of playing field, but it kind of neutralizes this, a tug of war that could potentially happen of like, well, I’m bringing in this, you’re bringing in this.
Kristen Boss (00:11:51): And I guess for me, I don’t look to you as like, oh, you’re my provider because you bring in money. I view you as my provider of like emotional support, support stability in our home being my sounding board, you know, helping raise our children. Well, and you were so good at reminding me about rhythms and pausing and like, Kristin, put your phone down, look around like my, I think my audience still needs to hear like, I’m, I’m working on this. I have not arrived, but I have come a long ways, but you have always been really good at like pause, like encouraging me to just pause, take in the moment, be here, be present. This is what’s important for our family and in my eyes, that is how you are. That SU that role to me. Like that is how you are. That’s how I look up to you. I’ve always respected you.
Scott Boss (00:12:48): This is a great podcast.
Kristen Boss (00:12:50): Like, you know, this I’ve just always respected you because you were, you started as my friend and that hasn’t changed. And man, maybe we could just talk about that in a, in a bit here about keeping friendship and marriage and why it’s so important. But I mean, I just think because I don’t your masculinity and your ability, like provision when I look to you like as like provider or head of home, which I think is a cultural message more than it is anything else. And it’s when I grew up with, I see, I just see it different, like, I don’t need you to be out there making all the money. You are like the sturdy place for me to land.
Scott Boss (00:13:31): Yeah. And I remember when we had our first and we had to use formula, right. And I remember you as a mother had a hard time with that, right? Because your body is to make, to support this life. Right. And for whatever reason, this is not happening for whatever reason. But we have to remind ourselves that like our job isn’t just to do it one way, right. That our job is as a married couple is to provide for the home. And whether that means you’re making more dollars than I am, whatever, or I’m making more than you are, we are both providing and stewarding those dollars. The same is true in the example of like our job is to care for that child. And our job is to feed that child. However we can, however we need to do it. However, you know, if a buyer isn’t working out should be, you know, this is how we’re going to do it and we’re still going to care for that life.
Scott Boss (00:14:16): And so in, in a home, I think, you know, maybe one issue that happens and I’m just guessing, cause I don’t know your audience as well as obviously you do, but I’m guessing, you know, something that might happen is maybe a spouse and it starts doing you know, their direct sales and it starts as kind of like, well, if you want to earn a little more money, so you can go shopping or you can go, this is why this is very stereotypical, but if you can go on vacation or if you can get away with the girls or whatever, like you need to go make more money to do that. And so maybe that’s how it starts. And then all of a sudden it starts bringing in a lot of money and it started off with that. The money that you’re making with that with your direct sales is yours.
Scott Boss (00:14:57): Now that’s outgrowing the husband. Right. And so maybe now he’s like, well, what do I do? And I think that, that right there is part of the, I think maybe the tension is when you know, we started when we were married and we started talking about money and that was not an easy road either. That’s another, another story for another time. But it was always an understanding of like, w you know, this is ours, we’re going to steward it well. And we’re going to allow each other to, you know, we got to pay our bills and so forth, but we’re gonna allow each other to use it for things that we enjoy as well. Right. Whether it’s together or you know, vacations or whatever. Right. so I think what I’m trying to say is, you know, if it started off as like, that’s your, that’s your money that you’re going to earn on your own to do things you want to do. And then all of a sudden it balloons because you’re doing so well. That’s a hard conversation to have to enter into, to be like, Hey, with that money needs to also help carry the family too, when it really that’s how it should be from the beginning.
Kristen Boss (00:15:55): I think that’s, I think that’s really accurate, cause that is what happens. A lot of women will join just for a couple of hundred dollars. You know, and some of them, it’s not for fun. It’s like, I just need to, we just need to close that gap for a mortgage or for us when it was student loans and Gus student loans, you know, those things. And you know, some people just do it for that, but then as it grows and now there’s all this spending money and now like the conversation has to change. And I think people shy away from the conversation we have had to learn. Okay. I have had to learn, I have had to learn how to, how to talk about money differently. And now it’s no, it’s easy now. It’s now it’s so much better. But in the beginning it was really bad. It was very painful. I like threw a tantrum the first time Scott said the word budget. I thought I like, I literally, Scott has memories of me falling on the floor.
Scott Boss (00:16:50): Like a toddler, no joke in our apartment, eyes are wide. I was like, well, what, what happened? What did I just say?
Kristen Boss (00:16:57): And you said budget, you said budget. How dare you? So I just think this idea of, you know, the business, the money starting out having a certain purpose and then it grows. But I also think there’s this really big narrative in, I think in all industries, it’s starting to, you know catch some wind in the coaching business, but this concept of like retire husband, get him out of his job. And I think sometimes that message can be emasculating. Like I want him out, unless he’s saying like, I want out, I don’t want to be there. And that wasn’t the, actually that wasn’t the case for you. I don’t think I ever sat around and said, I’m gonna retire you. I think I said, you know, I want you, I want us to have options. I want, I think I said, I want you to be able to have choices and money, not be the issue behind your choices. Like you could do whatever you want and it not be about that. But I think this message of like retire your husbands to what, like, I don’t want to take purpose from you. I want to help enable you into purpose. So I think some of my listeners might wonder, like, how did we talk about you leaving your job and when to leave the job, why you left the job when you came home to work for the best boss ever
Scott Boss (00:18:20): The best boss ever, the one I gave the name to. The wife, the wifey. Yeah. That’s a big question. Yeah. I think, I think if the purpose is to retire husband, you know, first you have to ask the question, does your husband even want to be retired? I mean, let’s start there. You know, there’s a lot of, there’s a lot of guys out there that love what they do and probably complain a lot about what they do. Cause that’s, that’s our culture. It’s just what we do. We, if you’ve got nothing to complain about, then something must be going wrong, which is really a twisted way of looking at the world. Right. but I think, you know, there’s some, there’s some guys that really love their job, love what they do. And there’s some that don’t and are, and are miserable and are there because there’s no other option.
Scott Boss (00:19:03): Right? Yeah. And that’s also an unhealthy place. And so there is a conversation that needs to be had about that. You know, we, we talked about this early on. I mean, we talked about it a little bit kind of in passing for awhile and I didn’t give much credit to it I guess, or much weight to it. Because I didn’t think I needed to stop working. And not that I have quote unquote, stopped working. I just do something different. Right. But in the, in the, in the more normal sense of, you know, clocking in, or you know, I guess at this time I was working for a para-church church and organization and, and trying to figure out what does it mean for me to walk away from this? I, I find great joy, great purpose in what I was doing.
Scott Boss (00:19:47): But there was also a lot of things that were not great and that I didn’t have a voice to change. And and so I think, you know, as we came to a place of discussing, okay, what would it look like for us to change some things? I think it was one, you know, your, your business was, was growing to we were, I think we were hitting even more scheduling conflicts. At, at that time of talking about me stepping out of my position then when we had younger family, I mean, cause we were trying to, because we were that at that time we were figuring out I hate when an even busier schedule actually believe it or not mornings afternoons, evenings every day, always something to be done. And so we’re trying to figure out how to make meetings and make things happen and get to places while having two kids. I think kind of made us force that conversation, not in the sense that we, you know, on a whim made a decision, but made us have to have that conversation about whether I was gonna leave or not. Because my decision to not leave at this particular junction was either going to mean we had to spend some money to hire someone to help us manage our home. Or I was going to handcuff your business.
Kristen Boss (00:21:07): Yes, I am so glad you said that because I also, there was a season where you were unemployed for a year and you were a stay at home dad for two, nine months, nine months. Okay. But that was, I think the hardest season for both of us. Like I look back and I kind of get emotional thinking about that season. Like, man, that was really hard. I was so deep in hustle. I was on my laptop all the time. And I think that was because, because you were home, I felt this permission because you weren’t distracted by a job. I lost myself in my work. It’s just like, well, you’re here, you can. And you did the hard thing. And it was, oh my gosh, how old were our kids? I think Colette was like,
Scott Boss (00:21:49): I don’t remember. It’s a blur.
Kristen Boss (00:21:51): It is a blur. I think we’re both like what I think she, no, she was a year. She was a year old. And so you were home with a 12 month old and a, not quite two and a half year old, not even just over two and four, nine months. And I remember that being a hard season because you truly were holding down the Fort and we were just trying to get by so far. And then you went into the para-church ministry and you went into fundraising, blah. That’s tough. But I, I remember thinking if you, I was very fearful of you leaving your job and I didn’t want you to feel unfulfilled. Like I, I wanted you to be happy. That was so important to me. And I was afraid of you coming home and like not liking being Mr. Mom, which was interesting because, so we talked about this.
Kristen Boss (00:22:49): We talked, we realized that my business was growing and I, I noticed that your mind was, we’re busy working for another organization and thinking how to grow that organization. And it took your mental bandwidth. And my business was growing so much that I needed you. I needed your bandwidth to come with me and help grow the business. I needed your brain to be available for growing my business. And like you said, we noticed that it would handcuff the growth because it would be two people divided. And, and had you not wanted to leave your job. We would have hired somebody full time. Like we would have had a full-time, you know, nanny running like a house engineer, all those things. And we had a really important conversation. And it was so genius that you said this before you left, you told me I want you to write me a job description. And so..
Scott Boss (00:23:45): Cause if you fired me, I want to know why.
Kristen Boss (00:23:48): You’re still in good standing.
Scott Boss (00:23:50): Can we get past the 90 day? You know? Okay, good. I never got a review, so we’ll have to talk to HR.
Kristen Boss (00:23:55): You have a great 401k package. So he wrote down, he had me write down a job description and I wrote down everything. And then I showed it to you. And we talked about like, what’s reasonable. What are you going to be doing? And so I think people are very curious, like what your job looks like now, but before we go into that, speaking of like society and gender roles and cultural norms, when you left that job, you know, someone said to you, you know, oh, you going to go be Mr. Mom, I remember feeling so enraged. I’ve never been more angry on your behalf. Like really? Really?
Scott Boss (00:24:37): Yeah. That was it didn’t, it didn’t hit me as hard. I mean, it, obviously, it’s not what you want to hear. Right. Cause I’m already thinking through that as I leave my job, you know, you know, what are people gonna think? And, you know, whatever, but really that’s not up to me to control so you can think whatever they want. And that’s fine. But but yeah, that was, it was something that was said. And, and you know, that person later recanted from saying that, but it’s still, I mean, it’s, it was, it left the lips and it’s like the toothpaste model, right? Like when stupidest comes out, you can’t put it back in the tube. So but at the, at the end of the day, I’m reminded of, you know, what they say is fine. They can think what they want, but we’re in a place where we’re able to be working together, being stewards of a great business, a great home. And so there’s going to be things that are going to be said to you throughout your life, not just in business, but even as in the social realm, they’re just going to cut you and they’re going to leave you a mark and you can allow that to have whatever power you want it to have. And so in the moment it was a bummer, but now it’s a, it’s a behind us and that’s okay.
Kristen Boss (00:25:44): Yeah. And I feel like we’ve kind of grown closer because we’re doing something that’s not normal. Like and people kind of give us looks.
Scott Boss (00:25:54): The side eye, like what do you do?
Kristen Boss (00:25:57): Yeah. And you know, maybe some family doesn’t even understand and it just caused us to like lean more into each other. And you’ve done that for me so much. Just so people are like, what does Scott do? Do I tell people what you do?
Scott Boss (00:26:13): Well, what part do you want me to say? I have a long list. I wear many hats.
Kristen Boss (00:26:17): You do wear many hats.
Scott Boss (00:26:18): I’m an electrician, I’m a plumber. I’m a housekeeper.
Kristen Boss (00:26:21): He’s Mr. Fix It, yes.
Scott Boss (00:26:23): I’m a landscaper. I mean, so you’d be talking about in terms of the business, what I do for the business.
Kristen Boss (00:26:29): Yeah. And the house, I think, I think people would be very curious to know like what you do in the house. Yeah.
Scott Boss (00:26:36): Oh, so from the house, start with the house. Well, right now I’m a project manager for our rentals. We’re in a renovation right now. I didn’t apply for that job. It was given to me another episode yeah, I think, you know, at home I carry rhythms so that she can focus on her, on her business. That doesn’t mean that she doesn’t continue to be a mom. And it doesn’t mean that I missed her mom. Right. Yeah. I can’t be Mr. Mom. That’s impossible. It’s just not, it’s not good for our kids. It’s not good for our family rhythm, so forth. So, but when it comes to it you know, I do drop off if you pick up I help kids with homework when I can, and I’m signing up for doctor’s appointments and extracurricular activities and we have swim coming, you know we can take care of the house, put things away, picking things up, you do the laundry, do dishes. But you know, I, I grew up in a home that was I would say a Galatarian in the sense that in terms of like chores and things.
Kristen Boss (00:27:42): Now everyone knows egalitarian.
Scott Boss (00:27:44): Well equal. Right? They were, they were both shared. In fact, my mom actually did landscaping. So we will talk about this another time. But you know, there was an expectation that this is a home that we all live in. We all make a mess and we all have the responsibility to take care of it. And so whether that means dishes or laundry or whatever. So, you know, I do the mage, I would say I do the majority of those things. And Kristen still does some of those things on occasion too. I think the thing that you can still carry a lot is cooking and that’s because you don’t like anything that make, so that’s the truth. I grew up with a dad that like, if, if dad was cooking, it was spaghetti or tuna melts. That was it. So sometimes it was four nights in a row. So, you know, so that’s kind of, that’s my role. I basically, in terms of the home I own the rhythm of the family. And I, I set that rhythm in a lot of ways. So yeah.
Kristen Boss (00:28:45): Yeah. And you also take care of all the financials, you make sure all the bills are paid.
Scott Boss (00:28:51): I forget that that’s two separate things now, but I started doing that from the get go from the time you hit the ground. When I said budget, that’s true. That is true. And because I think it’s, again, I think it’s important that you have an eye on your dollars, be a good steward of your money. And even if it’s not very much of it, you got to know where it’s going. And it make decisions wisely based upon, you know, the dollars are coming in and out of your house. And so, you know, I’ll never forget this might, this might be a tangent, but I tell this story all the time. I remember in California growing up and driving on the freeway and there was a big billboard from Dave Ramsey, whether you love him or hate him, who cares, but th th the billboard said this, it said, act your wage. And that has stuck with me for forever. It was a billboard, like it’s crazy act your wage. And it, it just consistently comes into my head and it makes me, it reminds me of how to be a good steward of your dollars, but also not just dollars. You think about time, social capital your, your influence as being a good steward of all of those things based upon what you have and what you’ve been given. So
Kristen Boss (00:29:55): Yep. You’re also in charge of helping with charitable contributions run that, and you run, and then business wise, I’ll start by saying, you are like, you’re one of my key emotional support coaches. Like you are a safe place for me. You are helped me process a lot that that is support. That is just invaluable to me. I mean, you’ve, you’ve seen me on bad days on good days. And and you are, you’re there for me. That’s why I paid the big dollars, you know, that right.
Scott Boss (00:30:27): I didn’t, I that’s, because I did a really good job sending envelopes in the mail
Kristen Boss (00:30:34): Two, and then you run all the financials of you’ve just helped me understand where all the dollars are going with the company. You’re my CFO. And you make sure all of our contractors are paid you’re on top of business communications. So, which is a lot it’s, it’s busy, busy.
Scott Boss (00:30:51): Yeah. but it’s good. I mean, the other piece there is, I think I here’s how I would say this. I would, I think I would struggle if I wasn’t in that part and had left my job. When I say by that, and I, I’m not, and I think that’s because it gives me a bit of you know, ownership or at least no knowledge of what’s going on in the business and allows me to speak into the business. And you know, and I, and I’m never in a place where I’m, you know, disagreeing with where you’re going or anything like that, but I am a sounding board. And so in order to be a sounding board, I got to know what I’m sounding. Right. I mean, I got to know what’s happening in the business. And I also know that I just, I’m more meticulous, very much more meticulous. She’s looking at me like way more than me. Don’t give away my secrets.
Kristen Boss (00:31:41): I’ll own it. I’m just like, let’s just get it done. And you’re like, yeah. But like, it was like, when we used to build furniture together, like, I’m like, yeah, square enough. You’re like, what? No, no, you can’t have square enough. The entire table will be terrible if we don’t. And you’re the exact example of measure twice cut. Once I’m like, measure enough, cut it. Hope it works.
Scott Boss (00:32:03): One degree off.
Kristen Boss (00:32:04): That’s actually, I think that mindset has served me so well in business because it just, I just keep moving forward and it’s like, it’s good enough. We’re gonna keep going. I’ll refine it later. But you’re there to remind me, like, okay, but.
Scott Boss (00:32:18): Well, it’s a bit, it’s, you know, it’s a balance in marriage is a balance in businesses amounts. You need to have that, you know, gung-ho mentality, you know, let’s just go for it. And, and that’s how you learn a lot, right? If you are, if you were, if you’re shackled by the unknown, then you’ll never take that step. Right. but you, you also need to learn in that step. Right. And so what are some educated things that you can mix anyways? But I think it’s, it’s been, it’s been good for me to be able to have that the ability to, you know, work with the business do the dollars. Is it financials? I do it for a house and because I do it for a house, I know that you don’t do it for our house, so that’s true. But we also have someone that helps us with that too. So this is a good note too, is we, she has a financial coach who she also talks numbers with. And most of the time says exactly what I say, but is a neutral.
Kristen Boss (00:33:14): Yes. Oh, that’s so that’s really helpful. It’s and we joke about this sometimes Scott’s like, so you’re paying a coach to tell you what I say to you. I’m like, yes. So you get to know you’re right. But I’m also hearing it from a neutral third-party place. But also I am, you know, that financial coach is, you know, he does offer things differently than he does. He’s, he’s amazing. But let’s, let’s talk about that a little bit of just like how many people we outsourced to for our life to be what it is and how we are okay. With partying, with profit in order to be more present for our family. So I want to backtrack a little bit before we talk about all the people that help make our life run as smoothly as it does, because we do have a lot of people. I think I want to rewind back to something that might be a little more relevant to where the majority of my listeners are now. And it’s when the first time I invested in a coach, when I knew where I wanted to take this business, where we were financially, things were tight. They were, it was not a fun season. But I wanted to work with this coach in 2019.
Scott Boss (00:34:39): So that would have been, I started fundraising.
Kristen Boss (00:34:42): Yeah. Yes. Okay. yes. You, you had just started at your para-church role, you officially had started. Yeah. So is that right? Nope. Cause I think you started para-church a year before. It doesn’t matter. So I wanted to work with this coach and it was going to be $2,000 for six weeks and we’re going to put on a credit card and I think people need to hear a little bit about what that decision was like for us specifically for you. When I came to you saying like, I want to spend this money on this business, you had seen me start a lot of things. You had seen me start things. So walk my listeners through a little bit of like, if they’re, cause I know there are a bunch of listeners that really want to invest in the academy, but the expense terrifies them and they don’t know how to talk to their spouse. They don’t know how to get their spouse on board. Maybe they’re a little afraid of not having their own back and not making their investment back. So I think this is just a really good relatable story for them. Yeah.
Scott Boss (00:35:51): Yeah, there’s a lot, I would say there’s a lot there too. I keep saying that because there is, there’s just not very black and white, but I would say, you know, I remember that conversation and we were laughing on the inside when you’re like, yeah, I want to do this thing. And I’m like, yeah. And where’s that money coming from? We’re going to plant a money tree. Cause that’s not a thing it’s not going to happen. We don’t have those dollars. But you know, there’s also context here. There’s some history here, like, you know, you, you were already self-employed prior to this. And so we had some understanding of how taxes worked, how write-offs worked. Right. So we had some tax knowledge. So there’s some of that working in our favor that maybe some people don’t have. So first, you know, figure that piece out.
Scott Boss (00:36:33): Second, you had some big expenses that you would do for that when you were, you know, a stylist back in the day where you’d have to go do some trainings and they were big ticket, big expensive things. Right. And we didn’t have money for those either, but somehow it always worked out. And you know, making sure you were growing yourself in terms of education and knowledge and equipping yourself to be a better a better person in, in your, in your work. And then the other piece with that too, is also with with the boutique, for instance you know, I wouldn’t, it wasn’t a, it wasn’t a huge success. In fact, I think we ended up, no, I broke even. I thought you made like 500 bucks.
Kristen Boss (00:37:14): Oh, I thought I broke even
Scott Boss (00:37:15): One of the two, but it, I saw the way you worked it. I saw the way that you went after it kept inventory, you know, and balanced the books and so forth. And because of the way I think you showed up in those, in those other arenas. My, my issue with hiring the coach was not where you worth it, if that makes sense. You know, I didn’t doubt you in this, in that sense, because I saw the way you showed up in other ways, in other areas, I think the bigger issue was like, we literally don’t have the money. Like it just is not there. And you want to invest in a coach that is not going to be doing what you’re currently doing right now to make money. Right. What do you mean like the job you were doing, you were investing in a coach that was completely separate from that.
Kristen Boss (00:38:04): Oh, from my career. Yeah. It had nothing to do with growing myself as a hairstylist. Correct.
Scott Boss (00:38:09): It was a completely different trajectory. And for me it was brand new. I’d never heard of it. I heard a consultants and you know, that kind of thing, but not in the sense of what you were talking about in terms of coaching. I didn’t have a real clear picture of where you were headed with this.
Kristen Boss (00:38:23): I think that’s just, just to pause for a second there. I think that’s a great parallel because I think some husbands don’t know what their wives are getting into. They’re like what you’re selling makeup. Okay. I don’t understand. We have $500 to buy the kit for you to get started or this idea of like, you know, oh, you want to pay for this coaching program? Why? I mean, we don’t second guess, you know continuing education for careers. So kind of doing this development with a coach is not something that is talked about or even encouraged in our culture. It’s different, it’s abnormal, right?
Scott Boss (00:39:00): Yeah. It, well, it depends on your sphere, on your sphere. If you’re in a, if you’re in a, if you’re in a a bubble of people that all went to formal education for years, grad school completely, like, what is this? What are you talking about? But if you have other peoples that have gone through, you know, certificates or getting their licenses, whatever that might be as a plumber, journeyman, whatever electrician, then it’s, I think a little more in line with what people would think of, but it’s not traditional. Right? So all that to say, you know, we finally every part of me wanted to say, no, I just, and that’s the truth. I didn’t want to say yes to this. Cause I was like, I don’t know who this dude, this coach coaches, I don’t know what you’re doing. I don’t know where this is going. But we decided to have a conversation and make a compromise about how we were going to make this work. But was it, do you remember?
Kristen Boss (00:39:52): Of course I do. Because I had this aversion to not touching our budget and not owning it our entire marriage up until that point. So Scott had told me if you want to do this. And I think part of it is you wanted me to feel the weight in a healthy way of the financial decision I was choosing to make. And you’re like, you need to own the budget for, was it for the rest of the year? Cause this was in October?
Scott Boss (00:40:20): I think it was three months.
Kristen Boss (00:40:22): Yeah. So it was, yeah, it was for the rest of the year. And I was like, okay, I’ll do it. And I think that’s when you know how serious I was, because it was like pulling teeth to get me to be involved in the budget before that it was like, whatever it takes, whatever it takes. Yup. I’ll do it. And also I think, I mean, we really had to, I think a lot of people have a lot of stories around debt and putting something on the credit card. And I think that was us a little bit at the time. Like, we’re like, no, we don’t put things on a credit card. And I get that for personal things. Like for like a couch, a couch does not give you an ROI. Shoes does not give you an ROI. It does not increase your earning potential. And I think that was the first time we were spending significant money to give me a skill, to increase my income potential in the world. Right. But there was some deconditioning of like letting go of the, we don’t put things on credit cards. Would you agree to that? Would you agree with that?
Scott Boss (00:41:26): Well, and it’s in a sense we were, we were using the credit card to earn points and things cashback. It wasn’t, but it was, it was everything that was budgeted. Right, right. So everything that went on the car, we knew we had cash in the bank based upon our budget and so forth, that was gonna get paid off every month. This was a, an outlier in the sense that this was not a line item, right. This was not planned for, there was no dollars to allocate to pay this particular expense off. So yeah, that was a big kind of like, you know, are we actually going to do this, everything inside of me? That was the one doing the budget was like, I remember you telling me, I remember telling you, like, this is the things that we have to pay for. You’re like, I know we have utilities and we have groceries.
Scott Boss (00:42:07): And I was like, and all these other $2 things that add up. Right. and so when you did on the budget, that was a time for me to go, okay, she’s serious about, about it. She’s serious about it. And I know you because of what I’ve seen in your track record. Right. I knew how you were going to show up. And you, weren’t going to let that, I guess, float, like it, wasn’t going to it, wasn’t going to, we, weren’t going to sit there and just let that fester in terms of earning interest and all the, all the fun stuff with credit cards.
Kristen Boss (00:42:37): But even, even if it had earned interest for just 60 days, like look at where we are.
Scott Boss (00:42:44): I agree. But I will tell you from my out that everything inside me, cringes at that.
Kristen Boss (00:42:50): I know. But like, but we were thinking about that like think, okay. So what if it had been 90 days of accruing interest to learn the skills, to make hundreds of thousands of dollars, that interest is nothing. And I think, you know, we, and now we’re used to investing massively in the business. I mean insanely. And I think so that first $2,000 purchase that first $2,000 investment and I had just broken even. And I was like, Hey, I’m going to hire another coach And a, this one’s going to be 12k.
Scott Boss (00:43:28): Cause this one’s going to be a way. Well, no, hold on. Let’s be honest with your listeners.
Kristen Boss (00:43:32): No! Don’t tell them that story!
Scott Boss (00:43:34): You did not tell me how much it is.
Kristen Boss (00:43:36): Ok! Marriage lesson. Don’t do this, don’t do this. This was bad. Don’t do this. I can’t believe you just outed me.
Scott Boss (00:43:42): Okay. You said, well earlier you said you want to be vulnerable with your listeners
Kristen Boss (00:43:46): Well! Now it’s forced vulnerability. Great.
Scott Boss (00:43:48): Well, but here we gotta remember though, you know, when you, when you invest in those coaches there was almost, you gotta remember it like this is with a coach it’s a little bit different than, and I can say this because I went to four year, a little bit different than a four year in the sense that when you invest in a four year, you’re paying upfront and over the course of four years, you’re going to try and learn some stuff, right. That to then implement what’s different. I think with your coaching and with, with coaches that you’ve invested in and other coaches or whatever is you invest in that coach. And all of a sudden you are going to them in your exact phase right now and learning how to turn a profit immediately.
Kristen Boss (00:44:27): Implement immediately.
Scott Boss (00:44:28): Right. So it’s ..
Kristen Boss (00:44:29): It’s not student mentality,
Scott Boss (00:44:32): What I mean by that is you’re not holding off. Right. And so when you made these investments, they were, you know, and they were scary, right. Because these are big investments that we didn’t have money to do. But you were, you’re almost turning a profit almost immediately. I mean, I think it was even within that, in that same month that we’re like, we don’t have $2,000 pay this person. Oh wait, yes. We do have 2000. Where did that come from? Oh, here’s no decals. Right. and so I think that, that I don’t wanna make that promise. Right. But I think that there is something to say about when you’re getting real world in the moment, in the heat of what you’re doing in your business coaching. You’re able to turn that into action immediately.
Kristen Boss (00:45:07): Yeah. Cause it’s like you said, it’s not like a four year where you’re going to sit in the classroom for four years and then graduate and then start with an internship and hope that you’re going to then get the skills then implement and then wait for pay raises. It’s like, it’s pretty, it’s, you know, one of the best things I heard was like investing with the coaches, like writing a check to go faster. And that was a hundred percent true for me and true for people like coach. And so I’d broken even. And I’m like, okay, now I’m going to pay. And I knew, here’s the thing. I had so much belief in. Like now I know it works. I can, I’m it’s only going to get better from here. And I signed with another coach and it was 2K a month for six months.
Kristen Boss (00:45:45): And I just told Scott don’t do this. I was not honest. I think I was, I think I was just so terrified that you would, that you would tell me no. And I was just so determined to, to do it. I was like, I just knew I’m like, it’s not going to be a problem. Is it possible for me to make $12,000 over six months? And in my gut I’m like absolutely a hundred percent. So I was like, Scott I’m going to hire another coach. And he’s like, how much is it? Like 2000? And then ..
Scott Boss (00:46:12): Left off the month part.
Kristen Boss (00:46:16): And so, and then, but that month was like, that was my first massive, massive month in business. And I made $25,000 that month. But that was before, that was literally I’d invested. I had signed a contract to pay $12,000. And I, at that point, all I had made, I had just broken even from my first $2,000 investment. And so I had that proof of concept like, okay, I can do this. And then, you know, sign a contract for 12 K and then made 25,000. And then I also decided to invest in a mastermind to be in other peers at the same time. That was 8,000. So I signed.
Scott Boss (00:47:01): Three coaches. One time you had three coaches?
Kristen Boss (00:47:05): No, it was two coach. It was just two. Oh yeah. So I signed with two coaches. So people would have thought I was insane because I signed contracts before the money was in. And then my entire month of profits went immediately back into the vision and the future of the business. Instead of like, I think, I mean, we had fun. We went and bought a big screen TV. We were like, woo, this is amazing. But pretty much all of it went right back into the business and we’ve kept that investment muscle strong and that’s really served well. And now our investment conversations very different just because we’re the businesses now. But I think just, it would, I thought it would be helpful for my listeners to hear just what it was like for me with that first investment that I asked you for about a coach or like a coach. What, why do you need this? And and how that changed so much for me.
Scott Boss (00:47:58): Well, and I, and I saw change. I mean, it’s not like, you know, you made that investment and and that was, this was early. I mean, we, we were working, we were all working. I mean, then you’re working two or three jobs. I was working a couple jobs, you know, whatever. And so one of the, I think that first coach you were on with that coach in the evenings or something. And so that was tough. But you know, understanding that that growth is, is hard for a reason, right? It’s not, if it was, if it was easy, everyone would do it. Right. And so, and it does take risks and, but I saw that you were growing and the way you were showing up was changing the way that you were running, your business was changing. And so there was the track record was just continuing to be strong. Right. and so it just makes those decisions that much more easier to swallow. The next go round. And like you said, if you keep that investment muscles strong then it grows with your business. It’s not like a, all of a sudden now I need to take all of the money that I depend upon and put into my, you know, whatever, but right. So that’s, it’s important. It’s important to grow your business and important to educate yourself, but yeah.
Kristen Boss (00:49:07): Yeah, I think that’s a good story. I want to add one more thought, and that is now we invest, you know, for our company and we pay a lot of people to help keep our company running strong. And actually I think the first investment we ever had where we really understood outsourcing and we had to was house cleaner because you and I were just like, we were working so hard that our Saturdays were spent cleaning our house and we weren’t even able to enjoy each other. We’d spend seven hours cleaning. We’re like, wow, that sucks. So that, I think that was my first like outsourcing muscle. Like, this is what we’re going to do, but now I think it’d be good for people to hear. Like we have a large team, like it is not the two of us. And I think people have this misconception and I think it’d be good for people to hear, you know, what it takes to run a multi-million dollar company so that you and I do have the life we do and we’re present with our kids and we have, you know, we enjoy each other and we get date nights and it’s wonderful in that way. Right?
Scott Boss (00:50:16): No, that’s, that’s a hundred percent true. I think you said something about earlier, like sacrificing profit for what did you say?
Kristen Boss (00:50:22): Profit for peace so that we can have peace? No,
Scott Boss (00:50:24): I was thinking of one thing. You said peace. I wasn’t St Pete’s and I was going to have this deep thoughts and anyways, we were on the same page, but it’s true, you know, taking some of those profits so that you have the time. And when we hired the, the house cleaner for the first time, I was like, we don’t have this money. What how’s this going to happen? And I remember just thinking, I’ll just make more. I’m like, what do you mean you’re gonna, like, I can’t always be the answer.
Kristen Boss (00:50:46): Sure it can!
Scott Boss (00:50:50): But it was, and it was that moment of like outsourcing and allowing ourselves to have a Saturday. And I think it’s important in your business, right? Yeah. Something that, that I learned in ministry is that there’s always something to be done always. Right. And as a business owner, there’s always something to be done. And so Kristen earlier had mentioned about rhythms and family rhythms, you know, in her business, there’s always something to be done. And so if there’s only one of you and there’s always something to be done, you’re never going to get it done. So you’ve got to multiply yourself. Right. And so that’s outsourcing that’s also making sure that you have good schedule and rhythm. And so, yeah we do pay as a team of eight, 10. I think I actually don’t know how many is now that carry different parts of the business and allow her to focus on the important parts of the business and the terms of the things that are going to bring a dollars into the business. The ways that she’s going to be able to focus and really serve her clients and the people that she’s working with. Right. And allow us to have a family rhythm where we’re not working every hour of the day, every day of the week.
Scott Boss (00:51:59): That’s great. Yeah, that’s great. And so I think some people get nervous and what social sellers don’t know is they have some of the best profit margins in the world. Huge, their profit margins are insane, but they don’t know that because they’re not aware of like the industries and, you know, I was having until the mastermind, this is like, you guys don’t understand your, how much profit to your expenses ratio in the network. Marketing sphere is absolutely insane. There’s no industry like it. So, you know, bringing in coaching expenses, a virtual assistant, a house cleaner, you know a graphic design, a website person, all of those things, it’s just a drop in the bucket compared to their expenses. And so that’s something that I spend a lot of time educating my mastermind around was just like enriching their life to keep them in their zone of genius, which moves the team forward their leadership forward and have their home and their marriages and their relationships in tact and being willing to part with some percentage of profits. And also when you enter control and some control. And also when you understand tax strategy, you’re gladly, you’re like, yes, I want to pay people because it lessens my tax burden on what I pay.
Scott Boss (00:53:14): And the other side of that too, is to say, if you know, you have, you now have the ability to steward that money. You get to pay someone’s salary. That’s amazing.
Scott Boss (00:53:23): There’s both the ability to pay someone’s someone’s salary. And there’s the ability to give because of your business. I mean, there’s what, what greater gift is there than to be able to do those things. It’s amazing. And I remember, you know, so I remember early on before you started you know, doing it and doing this, this venture, like you were, you had mentioned like hustling when I had the two kids at home and, and it was, you were working all the time and you were being every single quote unquote position. And so when you went into the coaching world, I was worried about that. I was like, when we had this house conversation about job description, like, what’s the expectation, like you’re still gonna be a mom, right. Like, right. And and that’s important to me. And so for you to hire people, to help you mint to me that you were taking your family rhythms seriously well as well, right. That you needed a schedule, you needed routine, you needed the ability to, to recharge, to do what you are made to do, not what you have to do. Right. and so you got to focus on the things that really brought you life, that you had a great knack for and continue to have a good knack for it. And so you pay people to surround you to lift up the entire business so you can focus on those things. And that does mean cutting profit. Yeah.
Kristen Boss (00:54:37): And I would gladly do it over and over again.
Scott Boss (00:54:40): But! If you were to talk business, does it actually cut profit or did it actually increase profit?
Kristen Boss (00:54:43): It totally increased profit. Yeah, because it totally, but I think a lot of people’s mind, they’re like, oh my gosh, that’s my profit. Oh no, no. And they, I think when they’re operating from scarcity, they don’t want to outsource because they feel like that’s money they’re letting go of, but when they’re, you know, when I’m, when I have somebody that’s handling all of our customer service emails, all of our customer support that’s energy and time, I’m not spending doing that, which is extremely exhausting for me. And I’m focused on serving my clients, serving my students, creating new concept, writing new content. And that is what generates more money. And this is what my mastermind is learning as well. They’re having to learn to think I’m teaching them to think of CEOs of multi-million dollar companies. And it comes with unlearning a lot of things. And especially as women, we have a lot of narratives that like, I should do it all.
Kristen Boss (00:55:31): We think we have to do it all. Like, and that was something I had to undo for myself because I watched my mom do it all, but she didn’t run a company. I watched my mom have the home cooked meals and the wonderfully clean house. And she didn’t ask for a HomeKeeper or a house housekeeper. And I remember having shame the first time I needed to hire somebody because I didn’t see my mom do it. And so I’ve just had to learn like, what is the most important areas of my life I want to be present for and who do I need to hire to do other things so that I can be present for those areas. And, you know, it’s just been so great. And I think one last question that I want to ask you that I think our listeners might want to know is like, I talk a lot as you know, we joke about it. You know, leaving the hustle, becoming anti hustle and working with purpose and finding joy. And what is the difference you have from me Lee, when I left that, when I left that hustle and working in this place, now, what change have you seen?
Scott Boss (00:56:33): Well, it’s, it’s, it’s always ongoing. Right. And this is, I think I mentioned this a little earlier is, you know, knowing there’s always something to be done. Right, right. And so a hustle would be, you’re always trying to check the boxes, right. The, to do list.
Kristen Boss (00:56:50): Operating from scarcity and worrying and just fear.
Scott Boss (00:56:55): Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And trying to hit, you know, end of the month or, you know, whatever it might be. I would say, you know, I think the biggest, the biggest thing that’s maybe has been a shift is really focusing on how to show up and serve. And I think when you’re in a place of hustle it’s not about serving, no, it’s not. It’s about surviving. It’s about, you know, whatever, whatever your business is, right. It’s about sales or it’s about people in seats. Or, and I saw some that you see it’s in ministry too, right? Like we’re going to try and fill every seat in this building. And it’s like, well, does every seat need to be filled? Like absolutely sure. We, everyone want, you know, we want to reach every person, but is that at the extent of hurting people?
Scott Boss (00:57:42): Like anyways, that’s a whole other conversation. But I think what’s shifted is I see you taking the time to really sit and to rest and to find ways that are restful. And in those places are, I think some of your most brilliant moments, not just for your own heart and your own being, but I think also for your business because those are the places that you find a lot of creativity that comes out of it. You find a lot of ways to serve. And I think it’s still a work in progress for both of us.
Kristen Boss (00:58:16): It was like, I tell people this I’m like hustle, leaving the hustle is an unlearning for the rest of your life. Like you’re always learning new ways to untether yourself from the story of like, my productivity is my worth and it’s still something I die to over and over again. But yeah.
Scott Boss (00:58:35): So, and I think the other side of that too, is, you know, working every hour, finding ways to put it into every moment of the day you know, the hustle. I remember, you know, we, for instance, wait in line to order food with the kids and you’re, DM-ing somebody or whatever, right. Or we’re driving somewhere and your DME or your messaging, or, you know, and so leaving that behind and allow yourself to be present. Right. So another way it’s just, you know, when it comes to hiring people, to help you with your team is like sacrificing profit profit to be present. Right. same thing with your business, in the sense of like leaving that hustle behind, allow yourself to be present with the people that you’re working with with your team, with your family. So when you’re off, you’re off. And I remember when I had, when I was home, the two young kids that was a hard season because you were never off.
Kristen Boss (00:59:31): No, it was awful. Cause I’d be in the salon all day and then I’d come home and work the other business. And it was-
Scott Boss (00:59:38): What husband wants that. I don’t care how much money you make.
Kristen Boss (00:59:42): I don’t know how you, but you still pick, you still loved me. You still loved me. That was a hard season. I think that was like, if I look back on that, I feel like we were kind of roommates in that season. That was just hard.
Scott Boss (00:59:54): And you know, and there’s something to be said for starting something and there’s some sacrifice, but that comes with expectations and communication and saying, okay, if you’re going to work these hours work these hours.
Kristen Boss (01:00:04): Yes. Yup. Yup. and there’s like a difference between physical absence and emotional absence. And like, you could be there with your family, but if you’re emotionally absent, like that’s something to think about.
Scott Boss (01:00:14): Right. And whats the phrase I say a lot?
Kristen Boss (01:00:17): Be here.
Scott Boss (01:00:17): Be here with us.
Kristen Boss (01:00:18): Be here with us, yeah.
Scott Boss (01:00:20): Be here with us, a learning of what it means to be present emotionally.
Kristen Boss (01:00:23): And be here, be here. Yeah. Cause you know, sometimes you see me in my brains like elsewhere, I’ll be in the room and I’m like, you’re like, what are you thinking about? And like customers, people, you know, and it just happens. And it’s constantly reminder to like come back returned to the present, returned to peace, returned to purpose. But I feel like it, I’m sure my listeners just got a lot from just hearing your side, hearing us together, hearing just some of the things we’ve had to deal with. And I’m sh I have a feeling we’ll be back for another episode, probably maybe just to talk about like navigating money or even just navigating, like how not to put your marriage on the back burner when you’re growing and building a business and chasing success. Because I do think that is something that commonly happens that marriages tend to get put on the back burner when businesses explode or things like that. So I think that’s a conversation we can have for another time. You want to come back?
Scott Boss (01:01:23): Sure. If you want me to be back, I don’t know if I answered any of your questions, but
Kristen Boss (01:01:27): I think it was a good chat. It was a good conversation.
Scott Boss (01:01:29): Hopefully it’s helpful.
Kristen Boss (01:01:30): Yes. Do you have any closing thoughts you want to offer?
Scott Boss (01:01:34): Closing thoughts?
Kristen Boss (01:01:36): Not a benediction.
Scott Boss (01:01:38): You all rise. I th I, I think the biggest thing in business and marriage and raising kids is just setting expectations. You know, it’s being honest with them and and that’s hard because not every, not every marriage has that open line of communication, but I think it’s where you got to start. And that, and that, you know, the same thing happens in business. You know, you, we see some businesses that are failing because they have too many expenses cause they can’t fire anybody because no one will have a hard conversation. Right. And so with when it comes to, when it comes to marriage and business, if you’re both going to do it together, you got to set expectations. You know, if you want to work a business and you’re scared about your husband’s thoughts on that, have a conversation and just get honest and real and it’s probably going to suck and it’s probably going to be hard.
Scott Boss (01:02:32): But if you never have that conversation, it’s, it’s always going to be this looming cloud. That’s going to stunt you in some way, whether it’s going to stunt your marriage, it’s going to start your business. It’s going to stunt your growth. It’s going to stop, you know, whatever it’s going to be. You’ve got to have those conversations. There’s a our kids are in gymnastics and there’s a sign in their gymnastics room that says I think it says fail forward to success. And that’s, that’s what business is. That’s what marriage is. That’s what life is, is a lot of figuring out ways not to do things. You know, what, what did I, what did Edison say about light bulb?
Kristen Boss (01:03:06): I didn’t find a way to make a light bulb. I found a thousand ways to, 10,000 ways to not make a light bulb.
Scott Boss (01:03:10): To not make a light bulb. Right. And so it’s having those hard conversations to, to really be clear about where you’re headed and where you want to go as a family. And I think something that we really, I really enjoyed, we, we started this venture and really kind of like both dove, dove into it was like, what, what could this business allow us to do? And it didn’t, I mean, we talked a little bit about vacations. But really it was like, because I think, I think it’s because we felt this, this hurt or this longing in my fundraising was like, we would be able to ought to give, like we’ve never been able to give before. And it’s, that’s what’s happened is we’ve been able to give, we never even, I don’t think I ever dreamt of what it meant, you know, to give the way we’re giving now. And that’s simply because of how we’ve leaned in and how God has blessed the business. So, you know, as you talked about this with your spouse or whatever, you know what think about those things, you know, dream big, dream big in those ways and set some expectations and then you both have to adhere to them.
Kristen Boss (01:04:10): Yeah. And a lot of, lot of communication, compromise expectations. So much of that. Now I’ll close with this last thought. Sometimes I feel like you have to allow space for your husband to grow his own belief in what you were building, because in the beginning it might be, you are holding the majority of the belief and he might not have any yet. Scott had enough to get me going to let me start yet enough to keep me going. But I kind of view like a spouse’s belief kind of like pregnancy in the sense of like in the beginning, like we, as women, we know it, we’re aware of it. We feel it we’re dealing with all the symptoms and from the spouse on the outside, nothing really looks different other than us, like, you know, being sensitive to smells and being tired, but they’re not feeling a bond with that baby yet.
Kristen Boss (01:05:00): Where for us, we feel the bond. The moment we see, you know, that we’re pregnant. And then as they see like the belly grow and as they feel the first kick and like, it starts to become something that they can literally wrap their mind around and like, oh, this is real, oh, this is happening. And then, you know, there’s when they’re actually holding that child. And I think that’s sometimes when the business is fully realized or it’s so tangible and the money’s really coming in, that’s, they’re holding that baby and saying, oh my gosh, this is, I see it. I feel it. I love it. I’m on board with it. So sometimes like just, I’ve heard women, you know, when they’re pregnant, they’re a little disappointed that their spouse isn’t worksighted or the spouse isn’t bonding, but sometimes you just have to keep going and wait for your spouse to get on board and their belief will grow, but you are responsible for your own belief and not to delegate that to your spouse, don’t make them responsible for keeping your belief high.

But the deadly virus was particularly unnerving for those who lived through the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and '90s.
“When this pandemic first hit and we went into shelter in place, I was like, this is so unfair,” said Vince Crisostomo, a 60-year-old HIV survivor living in San Francisco. “I can't do this again.”
Crisostomo lost the love of his life, Jesse Solomon, to AIDS in 1991. Now, 30 years later, another deadly virus has killed his father. Last fall, Francisco Crisostomo caught COVID-19 inside a skilled nursing facility in Alameda County. He died the day before his 87th birthday on Sept. 16, 2021. Francisco was a retired veteran in the U.S. Air Force. He is survived by his two children, Vince and Francine.
“I lost the two most significant male figures in my life to epidemics,” said Vince, choking back tears.
In the audio above, Crisostomo shares an intimate portrait of the final year of his father's life and the painful visiting rules that kept the family apart. Listen by clicking on the arrow underneath the headline above.Economic development insights anytime, anywhere.

Latest Episode: Mid-Ohio Development Exchange – MODE
Episode 11 Show Notes
Economic development is definitely a team sport and a lot of economic development factors are not limited to jurisdictional boundaries. Infrastructure, workforce and site selection are just a few of those areas that need cross-jurisdictional collaboration.
Something that the Columbus Ohio Region is known for is doing things the “Columbus Way.” Which simply means working together to pool all our regional resources to help the growth and sustainability of our metro area.
We are lucky in the Columbus Region to have the Mid-Ohio Development Exchange (MODE), which is a membership based organization that includes municipalities, counties, public sector organizations, private-sector businesses and utility providers throughout the region.
One of the most important things that MODE does is providing a space for economic development professionals to continuously learn. Whether that is by providing educational funds for courses through the Ohio Economic Development Association (OEDA), International Economic Development Council (IEDC) and others, or the regular programming on latest trends in economic development.
We welcome Nate Strum as our guest. He is Board President of MODE, and soon to be the Director of Economic Development for the City of Gahanna.
Plus, we welcome Niel Jurist for our regular segment, More With MORPC!

'Property Grunt' Is Blog of the Day
Property Grunt
Grunt
New York City, NY
The Property Grunt is one of the original real estate bloggers. He remains nameless but he is a legend in the real estate blogosphere. He started blogging in December 2004, a month prior to my blog debut, and he was already a bloggy icon. He has a voice that is singular and unique and utterly inimitable. He is a source of inspiration for many of us. From Day One Grunt offered wonderful content and quotes that added zest to the real estate blogosphere. I was ecstatic to share his tale about a FSBO Open House that erupted into a brawl. What wonderful copy! There is nothing more luxurious than a bloggy trip to the Big Apple on a Sunday afternoon with the Grunt!
(Note: There was an impromptu meeting of the Property Grunt fan club at the 2006 Inman Connect Conference in New York sans the Grunt. Joe and Rudy at There was an impromptu meeting of the Property Grunt fan club at the last Inman Connect Conference in New York sans the Grunt. We are hoping that he makes the Blogger Connect confab!Sellsius are equally appreciative of bloggy support in the early, formative days of their blog. We are hoping that he makes the Blogger Connect confab in San Francisco!)

In the 1600s, Salem put people in trial for being witches. Today we are much more enlightened; Salem puts people on trial for not being honest-to-God, actual witches. Or something like that. In the comment section of my previous post Niklas Blanchard (I wish he was still blogging) reminded me that my impoverished imagination is incapable of dreaming up any absurd analogy that is too far-fetched to be true:.” . . .
Three years ago, Salem, Mass., famous for its 17th century witch trials “” and something of a magnet for spiritual artisans “” tightened its rules on background checks for psychics while easing its cap on the number of local fortune tellers allowed in town. . . ..”
So I’d like to amend my previous post. Any insinuation that the government is inconsistent in applying its “principles” is hereby retracted. The SEC is just following a long and venerable tradition in American regulation.
PS. Add one more to my American freak show post.

Fortune tellers have been prosecuted by the state for doing this, as of at least 25 years ago, more than once.

You’re not being pragmatic, Sumner.
Regulations aren’t going away any time soon, so why try to fight the inevitable? Socialism is as inexorable as a law of nature.
Perhaps you should cease trying to advocate for your ideal, and instead jump on board the NGDPLT (National Gross Domestic Palm-reading Legitimacy Targeting) party train.
After all, the very long term trends show that there is a significantly positive correlation between overall regulations, and material standards of living.

So why license lawyers?
And surely a BA in law and civics should be enough to start a career….
I do have one pro-regulation comment. I am in favor of decriminalizing push-cart vending, which evidently is legal almost nowhere in urban America. Egads, think of the positives for those who want to enterprise without $250k to open up leased restaurant…
But there would have to be some regulations, such as the maximum size of a cart, & a license.
Why a license? A simple fee and license would allow the city to yank someone’s license who chronically makes a nuisance of himself.
This may be what the city of Warren is after. They plan to yank the license of those who use their “psychic abilities” in fact to steal money from gullible clients.
Or they just may be a bunch of lulu’s in Warren.

And remember, when a city regulates wages, such as having a local minimum wage, that is very bad.
But when the city regulates land use, and has vast swathes of land that are mandated single-family detached (sometimes with minimum acreage specified) that is good regulation.

The Fed vs local or state government debate is a good one: the growth in employment in government has been at the state level since 1960 (Fed employment is mostly flat since then) but the growth in debt is at the Fed level (many states have balanced budget constitutions). Also state/local government is less lethal due to the Tiebout model (Google this).

An argument for licensed psychics. I know someone who was “unwell.” He went to a psychic, who told him that it was his money that was making him sick.
It is one thing for a psychic to sell you her services for entertainment purposes, but when it turns to outright theft, some sort of licensing would give a chance to track down the grifters.

Doug, You really think that “regulation” is going to protect your friend? If you want to make grifting illegal, that’s certainly a respectable argument (what was done to him is probably already illegal, as it’s a sort of fraud.) But regulation won’t fix this problem.
TallDave, Yes it is plausible. I think growth will be higher, as (probably) do the markets. See my new post on China.

Plan Description
This Plan features Block periodization and can be used in the following ways:
1) Raise FTP and sustained power
2) Micro block leading into longer macro block
**It is recommended that you have at least 6-8 weeks of base aerobic training before completing this plan!
** Interval lengths can be adjusted to 3x8min, 4x8min 5x6min etc. Training is all about time at intensity or time in zone. Adjust to get your total time in zone goal!
Block periodization is a comparatively recent organizational approach and refers to a specific way of sequencing variables of load, volume and intensity and exercise type over the course of a mesocycle (long training cycle) in such a way that “front-loads” a series of challenging workouts in the first microcycle (4 week training block) of the mesocycle, with the goal of stimulating larger adaptations in a specific ability area (e.g. VO2max/aerobic capacity or lactate clearance) than would usually be possible using a more traditional method.
This goal is achieved by inducing a large stress or adaptive stimulus via a concentrated load, which then ideally facilitates a strong adaptation or improvement in this specific ability when sufficient recovery is provided.
After this overloaded microcycle, there is typically a vast reduction in amount of these challenging ability-specific workouts in the following microcycles. High intensity training volume is reduced to provide the necessary recovery for adaptation, and improvements made are maintained throughout the rest of the mesocycle with the inclusion of a single high intensity workout in each of the following microcycles.
Power based plan.
This plan has NO data feedback, but I am available for your questions via email- I will respond within 24hrs! This plan has lots of flexibility on the endurance days and you can decrease time on these days as needed to accommodate 6-8hrs of training per week.?Home > Hollywood

Discipline without teaching him the correct or appropriate behavior does not work. For example, if your dog is barking in the back yard and every time you come to the door, he stops barking and you yell at him, he may not get that you are yelling at him for barking earlier.
The do's and don'ts do ignore your puppy and/or go limp when he begins biting you.
How to discipline a puppy for digging. Raising a puppy is somehow a tricky business but raising an untrained dog is a real nervy job. Your dog is a puppy. However, a puppy should learn the command, “quiet,” for those times when barking is a nuisance.
How to discipline a dog for bad behavior. Put them in a different environment instead. Some dogs have been bred to dig;
A puppy doesn’t understand it’s wrong to chew. You can also give your puppy lots of toys to play with outside so it can focus its energy on something other than digging. Do offer your puppy a toy to bite instead of you, and praise him when he switches to the toy.
Puppy biting can become a problem behavior if not nipped in the bud. Keep in mind that digging is a natural instinct for most dogs, and is unlikely to be completely stopped. Digging can be a great stress relief for dogs, so if something has changed in their routine or household, this can lead to the development of this behavior, even if it wasn’t a big issue before.
Look around your environment for possible dangers to your inquisitive puppy. Ideally, you want to interrupt your dog’s digging habit by first telling him to stop. Many dogs, such as terriers, are prone to digging behavior because of their hunting histories.
When your dog chews everything, it’s not only exasperating. Electrical cords should be covered or made inaccessible to prevent chewing on them resulting in electrocution. If the bad behavior continues, remove it again until it stops.
Then praise when he stops digging, and give him a toy or treat to replace the forbidden activity. How to discipline a puppy. Back to how to discipline a dog.

Likewise, you can make a soft sound indicating that you are hurt due to your pet’s mouthing, as it can tell your puppy that it’s not okay to do that. Do offer your puppy a toy to bite instead of you, and praise him when he switches to the toy.. How to not punish a dog for chewing.

Digging is totally normal for puppies, and with minimal effort from you, they will probably stop digging as they approach their second birthday. Be careful when using them that you are disciplining your dog while they are doing the bad behavior and not after they’ve quit.

But the last time i had to do this was when she was a puppy. When the puppy begins to bark say, “quiet.” when the puppy complies (this may take some time), immediately give him a reward in the form of a treat and praise. With a child, if you always said ‘no’ but never told them when they were doing something right or what was the correct behavior, you would end up with a depressed child unsure of their actions.
I am definitely not a fan of squirt bottles or scruff shakes and i don’t believe that they are necessary. They chew, tunnel, dig, and generally get into stuff because they are exploring their world. Your dog may just seeking your attention.
Respond immediately to the bad behavior and use the same routine every time to maintain correct discipline. Do work to train your puppy to use his mouth gently. How i discipline my dog.

Time out should take place in a location away from anything your dog may find reinforcing, for example, a kitchen or a quiet bedroom.
Same as it is with humans, it's easier for dogs to get the hang of things while they are young. He simply likes to dig!. If that is still not acceptable to you, you need to find a way to drain the energy they release by digging.
They sometimes repeat actions or behaviors to test the limits. It is the same with dogs. If your dog senses new neighbors, they may also dig near fences to release stress and assert their territory with the new people and animals.
Use an air horn, handclap, or short, emphatic no! How to discipline a dog for bad behavior? The do's and don'ts do ignore your puppy and/or go limp when he begins biting you.
However, this doesn’t mean that the process will be easier. None of those disciplinary measures work on a puppy especially yelling. There are many ways to discipline your dog.
Place household cleaners and chemicals out of reach along with potentially toxic plants. If you know digging will be a major problem for you, investigate a dog breed's propensity for digging before selecting a new pet. The reward for good behavior

Recently Governor Bill Lee launched a new initiative in education in Tennessee he calls a “student based approach” to education. Lee stated on October 8th that the student investment strategy he is seeking would prioritize students over systems and encourage parents to get engaged in their children’s education. Now Tennesseans will get their chance to become involved as the state of Tennessee Department of Education announced on Thursday there will be eight regional public town halls in the state over the next 5 weeks that will discuss the Governor’s new education strategy and also offer discussion from citizens and parents. The department of education says that all Tennesseans are welcome to attend these town halls, whether they be a teacher, parent, grandparent, business owner or a member of the general public. The town hall for this region will be at the Niswonger Performing Arts Center in Greeneville on Wednesday, November 3rd at 5:30pm. You need to RSVP Facebook event page. That event will also be livestreamed.

In general, he saw Trump, thought he was a guppy, realized too late he was a whale, got swallowed as a #nevertrumper, and is now out for a long cold ride in the dark. Thus he ends with this ....”He definitely means to shout it RIGHTWARD as well ... he is REALLY pissed to be spending his time in the belly of a whale!
Jonah seems totally unable to understand the concept of cutting off your legs to save your eyes -- a trade-off I'd guess nearly all of us would make if we had to. Hillary = losing eyes, Trump = cutting off legs. If most of us made that decision, everyone would be completely unsurprised to see us "making the best of it" ... continuing to say we made the right decision even from a wheelchair, driving a special hand controlled car rather than not being able to drive ... that sort of thing.
Goldberg is Jewish and I don't believe much for practicing, as opposed to Christian, so my guess is that as a really really smart guy, he lacks the sort of metaphysical humility that says that some level of tribalism is simply not avoidabe -- there is ALWAYS going to be LESS oppribum for "our side", that is really not "hypocrisy", but rather "humanity" ... throwing morals of a sexual harrassment nature completely out the window like with Harvey, Slick, etc is where the train has left the tracks.
To declare that a grandparent MUST see their won grandchildren in the same light as all other children is just not going to happen. Deep down, I always suspect that the BIG thing that Jews have against Christians is that they know the Chrisitans believe they are "God's adopted children through the Blood of Christ", and the Jew's just don't like anyone else thinking they are God's children!
"Father would NEVER adopt other children! He has US!"
Jonah's brand of "conservative" is also somewhat Jewish -- "Trump ain't no stinkin Messiah! He eats, he drinks (with sinners and publicans no less!), he fails to wash his hands when he should, he said bad things about Pharisees ..."
Since Jonah is as least as pissed that Trump won as any D, he is REALLY not happy (whale bellies are noteably uncomfortable). The BIGGEST positive of Trump is HE WON! Again, if you cut your legs off to save your eyes, "I CAN SEE" would be a pretty sweet thing ... and focusing on how bad it is that you have no legs would really not be that helpful.
So poor Jonah keeps pining away for the lovely writing time he would have had if Trump had lost and Hillary would have won -- at least he would not be in a whale, AND, the supposed "conservatives" would still have their "moral purity".
The column is an entertaining read ... lots of mxed metaphors and stories lumped together in a bit of a "whales breakfast", but never the less entertaining.

WHAT PEOPLE SAY
We were looking for a plan that would help us to be healthy and was sustainable. When Sheila shared the science about Happy Healthy U, and how it was focused on getting healthy - while losing weight was a result; we were convinced it was worth a try. Sheila is very passionate about helping others be their best and did a great job of explaining the plan to my husband Joel and me. Once we got the hang of the ease of the plan and the fact that its format was much more flexible than it was restrictive, we were set. We are so happy to have found Sheila and the Happy Healthy U plan. We are both feeling much better, are rarely hungry, have more energy and have lost weight! We look forward to continuing this for a lifetime. Thank you Sheila!

Leading video game developers are turning their attention to self-driving vehicle development as their skills become relevant to creating safe environments to test the new technology.
Oxbotica, an Oxford-based autonomous vehicle software company, says many of its staff have experience building video games in the flight simulator and racing genres.
The virtual worlds it has created to test self-driving vehicles use a video game engine similar to that used by popular titles such as Fortnite and Call of Duty, the company says.
Oxbotica has created these virtual worlds to create infinitely adjustable scenarios for its software to deal with it, from driving in cities to negotiating an off-road track in a mining quarry.
Scenarios such as changing weather conditions, traffic conditions or unpredictable pedestrian behaviour can be tested more easily than the real world.
Todd Gibbs was the first video game developer to make the switch to Oxbotica, following experience developing mobile game CSR Racing..”The following images and information are the sole property of Time-Cap Labs. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.

Wafa Kanan, MAP’s Project Officer in Gaza, and Rasha Al Moghany, MAP’s Medical Training Officer in Gaza, report on two medical missions supported by Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in Gaza in November.
The ongoing closure and movement restrictions imposed on Gaza’s population present serious challenges to the ability of medical professionals to access the training and professional development they need to provide quality care to their patients.
MAP has been working for many years to bridge this gap and ensure Gaza’s health workers can stay connected to updates and technical developments in the outside world. Where medical professionals struggle to get out for training, we bring training opportunities into Gaza instead, with the aim of sustainably improving the capacity and self-reliance of Gaza’s health system.
The final week in November was a busy time at MAP’s Gaza office, as we were supporting two visiting medical missions in parallel. The first focused on core surgical skills training, and the latter on the creation of national ‘trauma protocols’ for Emergency Departments in Gaza’s hospitals.
Trainers from the UK’s Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) travelled to Gaza for the third time since March 2017. This time, they were helping to ensure that Gaza’s health system can sustainably deliver surgical skills training to local medics in line with the RCS’ standards.
The team joined MAP to evaluate the training capacity of the Ministry of Health Human Resources and Development Department’s ‘Simulation Centre’, in order to enable its accreditation by the RCS as an internationally-recognised Core Surgical Skills Training Centre. This accreditation will enable the centre to provide high quality courses in Basic Surgical Skills (BSS) and Core Surgical Laparoscopic Skills (CSLS).
During the visit, these training courses were completed for the third time in Gaza, delivered by a local Palestinian faculty of nine consultant surgeons who received the RCS ‘Training for Trainers’ course last year as part of MAP’s Core Surgical Skills training project. The latest cohort comprised 34 general, orthopedic, obstetrics and gynecology surgeons.
“I’m so satisfied with the first day of the course, it’s amazing to have the chance to learn things from A to Z in such a practical manner, especially at this early stage of my career in surgery”. Dr. Tayseer, R1, General Surgery.
“The strongest point in this course is that the faculty as supervisors guided us and were there for us all the time, telling us what our mistakes were and making it easier for us to learn.” Dr. Sara, R2, General Surgery.
Sadly, two medics from the visiting RCS team did not receive their permits from the Israeli authorities on time, and so were unable to reach Gaza. This meant that the accreditation process could not be performed locally, but will instead be completed in the UK on approval from the RCS.
The month’s trauma mission was also a great success. Teams from the Emergency Departments of Al Shifa and Indonesian hospitals in Gaza were able to develop and finalise 17 ‘trauma protocols’ for their hospitals. These protocols are essential guidelines to enable staff working in busy Emergency Departments to know how patients with specific types of traumatic injuries should be treated, and the responsibilities of different members of the team in delivering this care.
The two teams worked alongside Grant O’Keefe, Consultant Trauma and General Surgeon visiting from the University of Washington Medical Centre. They used trauma protocols from Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in USA to guide them, as well as their real-life experiences of treating patients in Gaza.
By the end of the week, nine trauma protocols were finalised by team at Al Shifa, while four more protocols were drafted, ready to be finalised and sent to MAP. At the Indonesian Hospital, eight protocols were finalised by the team, and four other protocols were drafted and sent to MAP.
“It is really interesting to learn how to create a protocol. It is the first time that we as Junior surgeons got the opportunity to do such type of learning”, R3 General Surgeon working at Al Shifa Hospital.
With both teams in town together, MAP also held a joint educational symposium on General Surgery and Trauma Care, attended by approximately 70 general surgeons and Emergency Department staff . This is the first time that MAP conducted such an event. The cases of four trauma patients injured by Israeli forces at the “Great March of Return” were presented and discussed, in addition to one general surgery case too. The discussion panel included MAP’s delegation of consultants: Dr. Grant O’Keefe from the University of Washington Medical Centre; and Dr. Bijendra Patel and Dr. Nickolas Markham from the RCS.
On their last day in Gaza, the visiting teams attended the first part of the 6th Conference of Surgery in Palestine. Dr. O’Keefe gave a presentation on “Trauma System Development” while Dr. Patel delivered a presentation about “Reducing Bile Duct Injury”.
MAP would like to thank the visiting experts for their time and energy.
Please donate today to help MAP continue to support training and development for Palestinian medical professionals in Gaza.October 18, 2016

Achieving ideal esthetics in addition to restoring the patient’s function is every clinician’s goal. Successful outcomes in restorative dentistry are well documented in publications and readily displayed in practice promotional materials. Although most patients are happy with the treatment outcomes, achieving highly esthetic result can be challenging in implant dentistry. Successful implant integration does not equate with a beautiful smile. While the clinically/functionally successful cases are often displayed or exhibited in journals or lectures the esthetic failures are not. The usual suspects for poor cosmetic outcomes have been postulated to be: occlusion, previously grafted sites, implant brand, implant position (labial/supra-/subcrestal), tissue type, tissue volume (hard and soft), time of loading (early vs. late), intrinsic and extrinsic factors (diabetes and smoking, respectively) and any combination of these and perhaps others as of yet not documented. The root of the problem lies in the fact that implants and their prosthesis are an artificial means of replacing a natural root and tooth. The requirement for a successful implant-retained prosthesis differs from the natural dentition. Since the decision to proceed with tooth removal includes periodontal, endodontic and traumatic events that invariably leave the prospective implant sites deficient in more than one way. The lack of favourable bone volume can create insurmountable hurdles even after multiple and/or complex bone grafts, ridge preservation techniques and soft tissue augmentations. The esthetic expectations of our patients are high, and may sometimes be unrealistic especially if the already integrated implant display signs of clinical failure (such as inflammation, infection, exposed threads). Treatment protocols for the management of the esthetic failures are also difficult to find in the literature as these are often presented as case studies. However, as clinicians it is our role to help resolve the chief complaint of our patients by using the best evidence available. By and large the practitioner and patient have three options to consider following an esthetic failure: Acceptance of the status quo, explantation (implant removal followed by site development and secondary implant placement, if possible) or hard and soft tissue augmentation around the existing implant followed by revision(s) of the existing prosthesis or fabrication of a new prosthesis.
In consultation with our patients, a balance between these choices has to be struck based on the chances of success and the amount and/or invasiveness of the intervention(s) required correcting or improving their oral health. The case report presented below is one that required multiple interventions and a great deal of patience from the patient.
Case Report
A 38-year-old woman was referred for a periodontal assessment of a dental implant at the right maxillary lateral incision position. She reported discomfort and bleeding while performing routine oral hygiene. The discomfort increased since the time of implant placement. The following history of the 1.2 site and radiographs were provided by the treating dentist: trauma to the anterior teeth many years ago resulted in chipped crown and a root canal treatment; many years later, pain was reported and the extraction of an upper right lateral incisor with a chronically infected root canal treated tooth (Fig. 1) was required. An immediate implant (Osseotite NT Certain Implant 4 mm (D) X 13 mm (L); 3i) was placed with bone grafting (Dynagraft II Putty 1 cc; Citagenix) (Fig. 2). After a healing period of 5.5 months, a second stage surgery was performed with a pick up impression for a crown and UCLA abutment. A healing abutment was placed to allow for tissue healing. Two weeks after the impression was taken, the crown was inserted. The treating dentist noted slight mobility upon tightening of the abutment. The crown was cemented with temp bond. Sixteen days later the patient returned and a diagnosis of a failed implant was made. Seven months after the original implant was placed, it was removed. A larger implant (Osseotite NT Certain Implant 5 x 13 mm; 3i) was placed and a provisional crown was placed (Fig. 3). Following six months of healing, an impression for an implant-supported crown was made. Two weeks later, the abutment was torqued to 25 Ncm and the final crown was inserted and cemented with temp bond.

A second dentist referred the patient to the author eight and a half years after the second implant was placed. The reason for referral was for considering an esthetic grafting and/or bone augmentation to improve the cosmetic appearance. A clinical examination of the area began with an examination of the smile line, which was moderately high with papilla and marginal gingival showing (Fig 4). The implant-supported crown did not match with the site in color, contour and shape. A closer examination of the 1.2 site revealed inflammation surrounding the 3 mm of exposed titanium apical to the crown margin. An absence of keratinized tissue and a Siebert class 1 defect was observed (Fig. 5). The soft tissue surrounding the implant platform was observed to be mucosa. The labial surface of the crown appeared to be over contoured and there was a depression at the papilla distal to the crown (Fig. 6). Probing of the area revealed generalized 2-3 mm depths with bleeding upon probing at the implant site. The patient indicated tenderness to light pressure in the area of the implant. A periapical radiograph demonstrated that there was bone loss to the 2nd thread on the implant body (Fig. 7).

The treatment options presented to the patient were to either remove the dental implant followed by hard tissue grafting for the possible placement of a third dental implant, removal of the implant with ridge reconstruction and placement of a three unit bridge or to try and rebuild the soft tissue around the existing dental implant which would necessitate the fabrication of a new crown. The risks of each option were reviewed and the patient opted to try and save her current implant while attempting tissue augmentation(s) without having to remove the implant. It was explained that several procedures would be required to restore and supplement the missing tissue volume and to cover the exposed portion of the dental implant.
Treatment
The patient’s dentist fabricated an interim partial denture to be used following removal of the crown. After anesthetizing the area, the cemented implant crown was removed (Fig. 8) and a cover screw (0 mm) was placed (Fig. 9). Under local anesthesia, the soft tissues were probed and revealed probing depths of 4 mm at the mesial and 5 mm at the distal of the 12 implant. The area was debrided with hand and piezo scalers. The denture was inserted and adjusted by her dentist. Following one-week of healing, there was some resolution of inflammation and the true nature of the problem was visualized: the implant body was labial in position with the head (prosthetic platform) of the implant at the edge of the labial vestibule. Additionally, the first thread could be seen supragingivally (Fig. 10).

Soft Tissue Grafting
Onlay Graft:
Limited labial tissue volume necessitated the placement of soft tissue graft. An onlay graft was utilized in an attempt to build volume of tissue circumferentially around the exposed implant. Briefly, the tissue at the 12 site was de-epithelialized (Fig. 11) and tissue was harvested from the residual ridge corresponding to the edentulous 17 site (Fig. 12) and secured with resorbable chromic gut 4-0 and 5-0 sutures at the 12 site (Fig. 13). Healing was noted at 1 week (Fig. 14). Two and four weeks later moderate amount of keratinized tissue was also gained at the labial surface (Figs. 15, 16 respectively). However, it was not successful in fully covering the exposed implant.

Connective Tissue Grafting
The defect at the labial surface also included a tissue volume discrepancy. For this a connective tissue graft was utilized to help bulk up some of the tissue. It was also necessary to increase the tissue volume for further grafting. Briefly a split thickness flap/pouch was created at the 12 site. The harvested graft was sutured and periacryl (Glustitch Inc.) was placed (Fig. 17) and allowed to heal for seven weeks (Figs. 18, 19).

Temporary Crown
The tissue matured to the point where the next phase of treatment required the fabrication of a temporary crown. The cover screw was removed and the tissue was assessed. A split thickness flap was made apical to the cover screw (Fig. 20) and the tissue was sutured coronally to the band of keratinized from tissue atop the cover screw (Fig. 21). The band of keratinized tissue atop the cover screw was then transposed labially (Fig. 22) and sutured at the labial surface with chromic gut sutures (Fig. 23). A provision angulated post (4.1 mm- 15° performance Post, IPAPF454, 3i) was placed (Fig. 24) and a prefabricated stent was used to help shape the temporary crown (Figs. 25, 26, 27). After 2 weeks of soft tissue healing was allowed to occur, a fenestration in the tissue appeared (Fig. 28). Disinfection of the site with tetracycline and a coronally positioned flap (Fig. 29) were unable to resolve the soft tissue fenestration.

Gingival Grafting and Coronally Positioned Flap
The last stage of treatment before the fabrication of a new implant-supported crown was to place a gingival graft. The purpose was to close the fenestration (Fig. 30) and add more keratinized tissue. Techniques for gingival grafts have been previously described. The donor material was harvested from the right hard palate and was sutured into position apical to the fenestration (Fig. 31). Unfortunately the fenestration remained, albeit smaller (Figs. 32, 33). Following healing (Fig. 34), the thicker band of tissue was coronally positioned (Fig. 35) with the use of silk and chromic gut sutures. The tissue response was favorable (Fig. 36) but there was still about 0.5 mm of metal showing after a further 2 weeks of healing (Fig. 37). The patient did not wish to have any further treatment to cover the exposed metal surface.

Final Crown
The restorative dentist fabricated a new crown and based on the esthetics of the area decided to apply a pink porcelain margin. She returned to the periodontal office for photos to be taken and for oral hygiene instruction. The patient indicated that she no longer had any pain with brushing the area and that the bleeding subsided as well. She indicated that she was very pleased with the outcome. Following the treatment, the mucosa was replaced with keratinized tissue (Fig. 38), the Siebert defect was corrected (Fig 39) and the papillae appear to be symmetrical between the left and right lateral incisors (Fig. 40).

Discussion
The challenges presented here include the treatment time frame of 13 months from initial surgery to final crown, the multiple surgeries and office visits, the unsuccessful and partially successful treatment outcomes following each surgical procedure. The factors that led to the initial problem may be related to implant size (5 mm platform at the lateral position), the labial placement of the implant, and the lack of keratinized tissues, crestal bone loss following the initial implant failure.
This case presentation documents a complex treatment utilizing multiple procedures, long healing times, hours of chair time, high surgical skills and a fully informed and cooperative patient. It emphasized the need to proper pre-placement treatment planning of the implant team in the hope to reduce the risks of unfavorable outcome. OH

Reverse Pulse Plating at TraX
Earlier this year TraX started experimenting with reverse pulse plating , to meet the demands of customers requiring high layer count pcb's . One of the biggest challenges with high layer count pcb's is that the vias connecting all the layers require a high aspect ratio.
With traditional DC plating we have been able to achieve an aspect ratio of 6,4 : 1 but with reverse pulse plating aspect ratios as high as 14 : 1 are theoretically possible and our testing thus far confirms this.
Reverse pulse plating makes use of special high speed polarity switching rectifiers that plate forward for 20 milliseconds and then reverse polarity and plate backwards for 1 milliseconds at four times the forward plating current. This type of plating results in very even plating across the surface of the panel and through the via holes , whereas with traditional DC plating the edges of the board always tended to plate thicker than the middle of the board and the copper plating in the vias was always thinner in the middle of high aspect ratio holes. Even plating also has the additional benefit of preventing mushrooming of the plating over the top of the dry film which in turn benefits the etching.
One of the biggest challenges we soon discovered was controlling the brightners in the plating solution , in Europe one could typically outsource this analysis but at the tip of Africa this is not easily done. This ananysis of the plating solution requires very costly CVS equipment typically only found in well funded universities. Left with no choice if we wanted to do this properly, we ordered the CVS equipment from Switzerland in July and we are excited to announce that our first reverse pulse plating tank is up and running and the results have been beyond expectation and very exciting. Additional pulse rectifiers have been ordered and another two plating tanks will be commisioned before the end of the year. We will continue refining the techniques in the coming months and we look forward to sharing our improved capabilities in the near future.

My husband, Ken, was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor in February of 2010. After he made the decision to stop taking chemotherapy, I looked for alternative and holistic methods to keep him healthy. I found Sue St. Clair in the Natural Awakenings magazine and set up an appointment with her for BodyTalk. We had just brought him home from the hospital in March of this year and he was unable to walk without the assistance of a walker and two people holding him up. Three days after he had his first BodyTalk session with Sue, he was walking with a walker alone, then without it within a week. The second session showed immediate improvement with tracking in his right eye. We are very grateful for Sue’s abilities to help Ken’s body to heal itself.
Testimonial (Suzanne)
I went through an amazing journey during my BodyTalk sessions. It identified past issues I had on my anxiety, lack of worthiness, abundance, and self-worth. It helped me deal with situations differently, recognize thought patterns that did not serve me, recreated the way I thought and felt about situations in my life that I struggled with, enhanced my awareness and ability to heal within myself. It was so accurate, the healing was so fast and effortless at times. My life is so different because of it now and for the better.

Whatever you are tapping out, please continue to do so. Yesterday I felt so much better, and today is better yet. Still get out of breath, but I don’t gasp and, oh, I feel so much better! Thank you.

I am just overwhelmed with gratitude and appreciation for you and your awesome healing skills. Thank you! How amazing to be able to let go of something that has affected me so deeply and in such a personal way. Thank you, and many blessings to you! In Joyous Spirit,
Testimonial (Trish)
As a deep tissue massage therapist, I have many structural and muscular issues. I was amazed how Sue St. Clair performing BodyTalk was able to locate an untold specific chronic pain in my right shoulder between the scapula and spine. I heard Sue say “good, that cell is repaired” and I haven’t had any pain in that specific muscle even with performing massages for an average of six hours a day. I have been pain free! Thank you, Sue!
Testimonial (Andy)
At 26 years old, for as long as I could remember, I had chronic GI issues. Constipation, diarrhea, persistent discomfort. I was given the dubious “IBS” diagnosis. So I disciplined myself to what I imagined was a near-perfect diet; yet still to no relief. In fact, things appeared to be slowly getting worse. I eventually had a colonoscopy and the verdict was that I had a severe, unnatural, sharp right-angle in my colon, with this, alas, being the cause of my difficulties. The GI doctor, of course, could only offer me (dangerous, expensive) surgery. I was not satisfied with this approach. To my good fortune, I eventually came across BodyTalk and decided to give it a shot… and boy, am I glad I did. Suffice it to say, if I were a believer in miracles, I might have mistaken my results with BodyTalk for such. Many will understandably be skeptical; I, in fact, was also skeptical at times (incidentally, thus proving that there is something far beyond mere placebo at work here). Safe, effective, inexpensive, non-invasive…BodyTalk works—and Sue St. Clair knows her stuff. Couldn’t recommend her highly enough.
Testimonial (Juliet)
Thanks again, Sue, for the BodyTalk session this morning. I was really in some serious pain. I feel much better now.Acero Sae 1084 C75 Ck75 C75s C85s C80 C85 Ck85 Din17222

by Marty Goldstein on 2002-04-20
Ed McDaniel was a successful football player at the University of Oklahoma and in the AFL- not the NFL as so many stories have claimed. His crazy antics and distinctive nickname made him a local legend. He nailed a 91 yard punt in 1958, a school record.
His roots and experience in the upstart league, a media star in New York when Joe Willie Namath came on the scene, led a path to glory in the ring, to where he ranks overall as, I believe , the best all around native athlete of the second half century, and greatest Indian performer in the wrestling game possibly ever. And his ability to spot young talent and advance their careers is as deserving of recognition as his in-ring prowess.
When I tell you the Indian honoree of the first half was Olympian legend Jim Thorpe, that is lofty company.
His death in Houston was somehow fitting, as he was in the words of the late promoter Paul Boesch, the greatest draw in Houston wrestling history, the first to draw 4 consecutive sellouts to Sam Houston Colleseum.
My first memory of Wahoo McDaniel was in the 1965 Street and Smith's Pro Football Yearbook. This was the bible of football, when any other magazine was far inferior in giving accurate and detailed roster information, in depth analysis and predictions, action and posed photos- the covers are works of art in the yellow sidebar and black caption, and vivid action shots of Gayle Sayers, Bart Starr and later Walter Payton.
And there, 1 of maybe 3 Jets pictured, is Ed "Wahoo" McDaniel, a product of the great "coach Bud Wilkinson with the Sooners". His being featured like that was in the eyes of all fans of the sport of wrestling, proof of our sports legitimacy as the realm of tough real athletes. He was a real competitor, even at his hobby, as he was a scratch golfer. To native and non-native kids alike, McDaniel was a role model.
He then moved on to the expansion awful Miami Dolphins, I knew he was still wrestling but there were no cable shows, magazines, or exposure or exposing of the business. It was notable that Wahoo and Ernie Ladd were both so successful that they left football in their early 30's and made more money in wrestling than the AFL. Other AFL stars like Curley Culp and Jim Nance also wrestled in the off-season, but neither made the transition.
That time in the AFL gave Wahoo a bit of a liking to the underdog. He worked for smaller offices such as the NWF in Cleveland, and the Southwest office of Joe Blanchard that ran a world title tourney in Boesch's backyard in 1982 with Adonis, Orton, Jaggers, Terry Funk, etc. Not to mention the Amarillo office of his mentor, Dory Funk Sr.
I was already aware of his unreal feud with Johnny Valentine in Texas in 1969-70 from the rare magazines of the day. Wahoo came in to the AWA in 1971, in a period that Nick Bockwinkel has said was the greatest roster of all-time. And even there Wahoo was a standout. His bouts had takedowns, unique greco-roman exchanges, and besides his blistering chops he also used the abdonminal stretch as a finisher. He could wrestle.
The AWA used an all-time classic angle to propell Wahoo into a blood feud full of emotion against a tag-team specialist.
Wahoo and his partner, a very young Don Muraco met the Texas Outlaws. Muraco was posted in the second fall by Dick Murdoch, bloodied and KO'd, leaving Wahoo to work alone against the heels, when matchmaker Wally Karbo refused to allow Billy Robinson to substitute.
After taking a pounding for like 7 minutes, Wahoo upset Murdoch and Dusty Rhodes so viciously attacked Wahoo that fans across the midwest attended in droves to see revenge meted out.
Then it was on to a program with the charasmatic, huge and green Superstar Billy Graham. In this era, Graham was humiliating jobbers by beating them at arm wrestling, spouting poetry and then smashing them down in the match. One week Wahoo, while professing to not being an expert, said he would arm wrestle Graham. Of course when defeat loomed Graham suckered Wahoo and cracked his skull open with the stand.
In the 70's that was an outrageous act. Graham would taunt McDaniel, calling him "MAC-Daniels". The strap match blow-off set an attendance mark at the Winnipeg Arena. 11,343 squeezed into the building, many of them native fans who were so into Wahoo that a riot would have surely followed had he lost.
Wahoo teamed with Robinson, Muraco, Ramon Torres, and of course the Crusher over his AWA years. The 1974 AWA yearbook does not have a profile of Wahoo, but includes him in a section of photos of other spotshow headliners like Red Bastein, Blackjack Lanza and Dusty Rhodes, and enhancement talent like Rick Flair and a skinny Paul Perschmann (Buddy Rose).
The picture of Larry Heiniemi (Lars Anderson) shows him with a strap dangling from his left wrist as he launches a bloody Chief to the buckle.
The next page has pictures of woman's champion Vivian Vachon, Bob Bruggers, Bull Bullinski and again, a bleeding McDaniel. Not even 30 years later, and none of those 4 wrestlers are still alive...
Wahoo went on to the Mid-Atlantic wars. Wahoo brought a young Ric Flair to the Carolinas and when Johnny Valentine went down in the plane crash and Flair returned, a legend was born.
He won the Southern title in Florida from the Spoiler and lost to Dick Slater in 78, and when he returned to the AWA in the latter 70's he often fought Nick Bockwinkel for the crown. Classic battles.
I almost saw Wahoo live at the Convention Centre in 1979, when he was being brought in "from Atlanta" as a special partner for Greg Gagne against I think Bob Duncum and Stan Hansen. But as I recall he missed plan connections and was replaced by Billy Robinson in the match and Mad Dog Vachon in the angle.
He appeared in a great AWA TV angle in the old studio. With Lanza and "Mr. V" Jesse Ventura waiting, Jake Millimen's no-show partner was replaced with McDaniel. He pinned Lanza in the first fall and survived a triple-team assault replete with brass knuckles after the second fall. When Baron Von Raschke came to even the odds, the Chief got his hands on Heenan inside the ring when Heenan slipped, and beat the living daylights out of Heenan. It was frightening. Bobby took an awesome post and came up a classic crimson mask.
The studio crowd was steaming and chanting and whipped into a frenzy.
The interview after with Lanza staring wildly at the soaked white shirt that had been torn off Heenan, and Bockwinkel intoning " You do NOT take liberties with the manager of the heavyweight champion", put Wahoo in the spotlight again. So over and believable that despite his weight gain and slowing down, he was again positioned as the top contender, to the re-crowned Bockwinkel. (Wahoo was off a hot run as US champ for Jim Crockett promotions, beating Roddy Piper in '81 and Sgt. Slaughter in '82 before losing the belt to Greg Valentine.)
In a 6 man tag against Jesse Ventura, Ken Patera and Bockwinkel, Greg Gagne took a major beating until the hot tag, not to Jim Brunzell but to Wahoo. The film of the main event from the Winnipeg Arena was incredible. The heat was insane and Wahoo proceeded to clean house with an arsenal of chops. 11 of them. Nailing the heels as they interfered, with Ventura doing that awful pitter-pat ass bump, he whipped Bockwinkel into the ropes, chopped him, dropped a tomahawk on Nick's skull, and pinned the champ. Eleven chops and the roof came off.
That, wrestling fans, is a guy who is over. I showed that to more than a few aspiring wrestlers who didn't believe me about the simple finish. 11 chops. And the fans believed.
In an interview at the time, he spoke openly of the amphetimines that were common in football in his day, of his love of steak and potatoes and of the outdoors. He also spoke of the personal cost to his marriages and familty from being on the road.
Wahoo returned to Mid-Atlantic Crockett territory and shocked everyone when he turned heel and joined Tully Blanchard. His heel heat was genuine. So much so that the cage match on March 23/85 where he lost the US Title to an emerging Magnum TA elevated the youngster to superstardom.
I have that tape and it was so odd, seeing McDaniel as a heel. Oh they hated him.
Back in Florida in May '85, Wahoo had won the tag belts with Billy Jack Haynes when the team died after BJ walked out. Then Wahoo was allegedly involved in a locker room fight that resulted in Hercules Henrnadez being fired while holding the Florida title. McDaniel took the belt from Rick Rude and then on Nov. 19 put over a very huge and very green Lex Lugar for Lex's first big push.
After a 1986 strap match run against Jimmy Garvin on the Great American Bash Tour for Crockett, Wahoo was again used to elevate a young star.
On Sept. 28/86 in a rare Los Angeles appearance, he defeated old nemesis Blanchard for the Georgia-based NWA National title, and then one month later dropped the belt into oblivion in a unification match loss with US champ Nikita Koloff.
Nikita had beaten TA in a legendary cross-country best of seven series on the Bash tour, but TA wrecked his Porsche and his career just weeks before. But the lineage- Nikita beat TA and Wahoo, TA beat Wahoo who beat Tully who beat Dusty- that was all the top talent around and in his mid-40's McDaniel still rated with them, in the most physical matches imaginable. I haven't even mentioned his feud with Nature Boy Ric Flair. Or Ivan Koloff.
Then he hopped onto the AWA train for it's dying days. Again showing his guts and selflessness, a series of great TV bouts had the aging vet narrowly lose to the man who beat Bockwinkel, culminating in a ferocious ESPN strap match for Cool Curt Hennig's AWA belt.
The fans in Las Vegas in fall of '87 were screaming for blood, and a gusher or 2 was hit. Hennig was at the peak of his athletic powers and he sold for Wahoo's chops like- well, maybe he wasn't selling, cause they were blasts. Hennig bumped like a madman. The finish, when Adrian Adonis rushed to ringside and cut the strap just as Wahoo was touching the fourth corner, pissed off the crowd.
As the ESPN era continued, Wahoo teamed with DJ Peterson and had one more blood feud, when Manny Fernandez attacked him during an interview and tore up the ceremonial feathered headdress. On TV the angle fell flat but the houses that came out saw the now 49 year old vet battle with the Raging Bull like a warrior. On Dec. 26, 1988, Wahoo made what I believe was his final appearance in Winnipeg, beating Fernandez in a cage match.
After teaming with Greg Gagne for awhile, McDaniel gave up the book and left the AWA for the last time. His final bouts were a series of retirement matches in his Carolinas home base on small indy cards in the early 90's. I can only imagine the awe felt by the young men entering the sport to sit in a room with Wahoo, and see the physical scars and marks he endured for the sport he loved.
He made a WWF appearance on Raw in the mid-90's with Chief Jay Strongbow in an angle designed to elevate his protege Tatanka. He looked dignified and tough.
Look at the guys he elevated. Graham. Flair. Lugar. TA. Koloff. Hennig. Feuds with Rhodes, Johnny and Greg Valentine, Bockwinkel, all the Andersons, Piper, Blanchard. Angelo Mosca. Abdullah the Butcher. Paul Jones. Don Kernodle. Gino Hernandez. Steamboat and Youngblood learned from him. So did hundreds of others.
What a total pro, and a credit to the sport. Not a perfect human being, no one is. But he was the genuine article.
Ed McDaniel was profiled last year in Sports Illustrated, a tender look at an old warrior fighting deteriorating health while raising his 12 year old son Zack, and praying to see him to adulthood. Wahoo left us, at age 63 much too soon, without pain, and millions across the world mourn his loss, pray for his son and family, and cherish the memory of a great competitor who always gave his fans 100%.. “Human Trafficking Identification and Service Provision in the Medical and Social Service Sectors.”

We’re not quite sure if this is pure genius or plain insane.
If you’ve been dreaming of comforting slow-cooker meals in the lead up to winter and are considering purchasing a pricey model, you might want to stay your hand.
Your washing machine may be the answer.
Yep, you read that correctly. An Israeli industrial design student, Iftach Gazit, has developed a revolutionary product that will save you time in the kitchen — slow-cooked washing machine meals.
MUST-SEE: PSA: Pink Pineapples Exist and They’re Deliciously Beautiful
It sounds crazy (and slightly unhygienic), but Gazit has thought it all through.
Image credit: Iftach Gazit
His prototype sees full meals, from the mains to the sides, placed inside water-resistant Tyvek paper bags that are then vacuumed-sealed. Inside is another waterproof bag to prevent leaks, ensuring clothes are kept clean and your food stays soap free.
It’s called the Sous La Vie and uses the principles of the high-end French sous vide method of cooking to turn out easy and nutritious dinners.
“Instead of following a sous vide recipe and cooking a piece of meat at 58˚C (136.4˚F) for two and a half hours, just set your washing machine to ‘synthetics’ for a long duration program,” Gazit explains.
“Cooking vegetables? Set your machine to ‘cotton’ for a short duration program.”
Image credit: Iftach Gazit
The idea was inspired by the rise of fast food, TV dinners, and a desire for consumers to reflect on the importance of a slow food — homemade and shared with the family.
But if you still think that’s not a good enough reason to mix food and clothes, this might change your mind.
It was actually the needs of the homeless that also played a big role in Gazit’s design, after he discovered laundromats were often a temporary haven for those living on the streets. As patrons, the homeless using the services now also had access to electrical outlets to recharge mobile phones, use free WiFi, and get some uninterrupted rest.
MUST-SEE: How Long Past the Expiration Date Does Food Last?
“So why not cook some food while there, too?” Gazit asks.
We’re still not quite sure if we would give it a try, but one thing’s for sure, all of you who are splashing cash on takeout meals just to avoid doing the dishes (we feel you), this is probably your next best solution!

95Brown recluses are spiders that range from light to dark brown and measure up to a half inch long. While they do some good by eating cockroaches and other pests, their bites can be serious.
Brown recluse spiders bite people when defending themselves. Both the males and females are capable of inflicting venomous bites that need prompt medical attention. In most cases, these bites aren’t painful when they occur, but they tend to cause pain and stinging up to eight hours later. If you’ve been bitten by a brown recluse, the bite typically shows up as a small blister that eventually turns into an ulcer. This results in skin damage that can quickly spread unless you seek care. You might also have a fever and restlessness. Without treatment, you can suffer serious skin and nerve damage.
These spiders are usually found outdoors, but they can enter your home and find places to hide, such as inside closets or basements. They refer to stay in dark, quiet areas where they’re not likely to be disturbed, such as clothing piles or storage boxes. If you see these spiders in your home, don’t hesitate to have Monmouth County pest control experts remove them. This helps reduce the risk of being bitten.
Keep brown recluse spiders out of your home and away from your family. Contact our Monmouth County pest control professionals to get rid of these harmful pests.Euro-Par 2019 -A Domain-Specific Language for Scientific Computing on FaaS – Accepted paper!

While we often think of August as the “end of summer” as kids are going back to school, it’s usually one of the warmest months of the year. The average high temperature in St Louis during August is 88 degrees. Twice since 2016 has St Louis experienced even higher averages than that. During the midpoint of summer, your AC unit has been working at a high rate for the past couple of months. There isn’t a better time to make sure everything is working properly. Nobody wants to be stuck without AC during the hottest time of the year. Here are some common issues that you can run into after your air conditioning unit has been running consistently throughout a warm summer:
Failing Capacitors
This is a common issue during late summer. Inside of your AC unit are capacitors that send electricity to the air conditioner’s motors. When they begin to fail, your AC unit will struggle to provide enough energy to keep the motor working properly. Motor failure can result in your air conditioner not working. Trained AC technicians can usually spot and fix this problem easily.
Motors Issues
The summer can be strenuous on your AC’s fan motors. It is common for these motors to experience wear and tear as they are constantly running. Oftentimes, the fan motor can be the first thing to start experiencing issues. This is more common in older AC units. If the fan motor stops working, then your house stops getting cooled. If you notice strange sounds coming from your AC unit or less and less cool air being pushed throughout your home, it would be smart to have the motors checked out by an HVAC technician.
Low Refrigerant
Refrigerant leaks are not uncommon. A leak can lead to increased energy bills and poor performance from your air conditioner. Leaks can also cause damage to the compressor of the machine. Low refrigerant can cause the evaporator coils inside of your AC unit to freeze, which puts a large strain on the unit as a whole. It makes the machine work much harder than it needs to and can cause serious damage that may not be repairable. Luckily, proper AC maintenance can minimize the likelihood of a leak occurring.
Frozen or Unclean Coils
It’s easy to think the coils of your air conditioner can’t freeze during the hottest months of the year, but it’s simply untrue. AC units don’t just cool the home, but they also dehumidify the air. By doing so, air moisture can create condensation build on the evaporator coils. Frozen evaporator coils are typically caused by airflow or refrigerant issues. These could be dirty or clogged air filters, or a refrigerant or duct leak. If you notice frost build-up or a frozen AC unit, call a trained HVAC technician to come to perform AC maintenance and make sure no serious damage is done to the air conditioner.
Dirty or Clogged Air Filters
Odds are, your air conditioner is going to run all summer long, or at least a large majority of it. After constantly pushing air through an air filter, at some point, the filter is going to get dirty or clogged with debris. It is usually easy to tell when there is an issue with your air filter, as the airflow throughout your home decreases and isn’t as strong as normal. We have so many things going on in our lives that it can be really easy to overlook or forget about cleaning our air filters. Our air filters should be cleaned regularly to ensure peak performance from our AC units and for clean air quality in our home.

Hundreds protest Indonesia’s COP26 reversal on deforestation
After Indonesia appeared to back away from pledges made at the COP26 climate conference to halt deforestation, hundreds of activists have begun protesting. A rally took place on Friday in the streets of Jakarta. The protests come a day after Indonesia’s environment minister criticized a plan to end deforestation by 2030 and cut carbon emissions. The minister called the global plan at odds with the country’s development plan.
Activists claim the government does not appear to be serious about cutting emissions of greenhouse gasses or halting deforestation. Indonesia’s natural resources account for a third of the world’s rainforest. Activists claim the production of coal has been raise in the country while the government is making false claims to support ending climate change. Indonesia does plan to phase out using coal for electricity by 2056. More than 100 countries promised to end and reverse deforestation by the end of 2030. These countries include Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which collectively account for 85% of the world’s forests.

In the past few years we have read comments asserting that colleges are not providing high quality teacher training programs. These disparaging comments usually are made without any supporting data.
Such unsubstantiated statements undermine perceptions of teacher education among the public and do not contribute in any meaningful way to dialogue about how best to improve programs.
In the spirit of adding some facts to any discussion about the quality of teacher education programs, we offer the following information about our program, which has been successfully preparing teachers in this community for many decades.
•We are held to rigorous national accreditation standards and have been engaging in data-based program evaluations since 1999.
•We work collaboratively with public, private and charter schools in site-based research, professional development, field placements and clinically rich courses.
•Our Teacher Opportunity Corps prepares teachers of color to address the learning needs of students in high-need schools. Since 1989, more than 120 TOC graduates have taught in RCSD schools, and TOC graduates have an extraordinarily high retention rate.
•Last year, in addition to student teaching, our undergraduate students spent a total of 17,410 hours in site-based learning and our graduate students spent 9,665 hours.
•All of our full-time teacher certification program faculty have doctoral degrees and Pre-K-to-12 public school teaching experience.
•We prepare teacher candidates with a foundation to teach in a wide variety of contexts — public, private, charter, urban, suburban and rural schools in New York state and other states, as well as international schools.
•We assess our teacher candidates continuously based on their content knowledge, pedagogical skill, and professional dispositions, and dismiss those candidates who are not well suited for a teaching career.
•We recognize that teaching is a skill and a craft that is acquired and honed throughout a professional career, and we strive to prepare teachers who continue to learn, question, advocate and grow throughout their careers.
•We work closely with liberal arts faculty and departments to prepare teachers who are well-rounded, curious, critical thinkers and life-long learners.
•We require all education students to major in a discipline (such as math, history, and English) in addition to taking teacher preparation courses in order to assure a strong grounding in content as well as pedagogical knowledge.
•Our School of Education teacher candidates’ pass rate on the new rigorous and nationally normed performance assessment (edTPA) is 96 percent — much higher than state averages.
We take seriously the obligation to provide school children with the highest quality teachers. To be sure, our teacher education programs, like all other programs, strive for continual improvement. We all share the goal of ensuring that every child receives the highest quality educational opportunities.
To achieve this goal, we need to move from unsupported disparaging comments to meaningful dialogue about ways to achieve that goal.

About this title
A refugee from the dark realm he was born to rule as wizard, Ilaron Highborn comes to the aid of Denise Sheridan, curator of an art museum in New York City threatened with destruction by a Sumerian demon. Original.From Library Journal:
A war between Light and Darkness rages in the streets of New York City as a renegade Unseelie prince tries to defend his adopted world from a deadly rival and an ancient demon. Sherman (The Shattered Oath, Baen, 1995) excels in creating modern myths that draw their imagery from multicultural folk tales. Her latest fantasy adventure combines the seductive glamour of faerie legend with tales of Sumerian demons in a fast-moving crossworld fantasy that belongs in most libraries.

By default, the land surface is hard and can support very heavy loads, including those of trucks, buildings and much more. However, at times, some surfaces are not stable, either due to natural or human causes and can actually sink several meters into the ground and with them, anything that was on the surface, like houses, cars and roads. These are sinkholes and this article will describe them in detail.
As the name suggests, sinkholes involve land sinking, causing holes on the ground. They are cavities or pits in the ground that form when water erodes an underlying rock layer, or if the rock is limestone, salt beds, or carbonate rock, which can naturally dissolve by groundwater circulating through them.
As the rock dissolves, spaces and caverns develop underground causing the surface to be susceptible to sinkholes. Sinkholes are very dramatic as land can stay intact for quite some time until the underground spaces get very big. If there is not enough support for the land above the spaces, a sudden collapse of the land surface will occur, resulting in sinkholes.
Depending on the location, the damage was done underground and many other factors, a sinkhole can be about one meter in depth and width and can go as deep and as wide as hundreds of feet and beyond. One of the largest sinkholes known is one in the limestone mountains of Nongle in Guangxi Zhuang region in southern China. The sinkhole measures 656 ft long, 328 ft broad and 387 ft deep and when measured from the access point on the mountain ridge, the sinkhole is even deeper, at 1,476 ft. The world’s deepest sinkhole is in Chongqing, China, reaching down 662 meters.
There are two types of sinkholes. The first one forms when the roof of a cave collapses and exposes the underground cavern. The second one forms when water dissolves the rock beneath the soil and creates an underground chasm. Without rock to support it, the layer of soil eventually collapses and creates a hole on the surface.
Additionally, sinkholes can result from both natural and human causes. Man-made sinkholes are created when a city development compromises the structural integrity of underlying rock. Roads, buildings and other infrastructure can cause water to collect in certain areas and wash away any supporting layer of rock, resulting in sinkholes.
Contents
Various Causes of Sinkholes
1. Water
Water is responsible for about 90% of all sinkholes and this is how:
a. Weathering: If the rocks below the surface are made of materials that dissolve in water like limestone and gypsum, the water dissolves these minerals and opens spaces within the rock. This process is known as weathering and results in sinkholes. Over hundreds or thousands of years, underground water trapped beneath the surface causes natural underground currents that dissolve these rocks and forge chasms under the ground.
The top of the chasm gradually grows towards the surface and, eventually, the surface layer gets thinner and thinner until it becomes too weak to support what is above it and falls in. Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and the areas around the Dead Sea are often riddled with sinkholes as the rock layer in the area is easily dissolved
b. If the rock does not dissolve in water: This occurs when the rock under the surface doesn’t dissolve in water but instead is made of grains that are small enough to be carried away by underground water currents, resulting in sinkholes. In 2010 in Guatemala City, for instance, a three-story building vanished into a sinkhole, killing 15 people, as the underlying rock was predominantly weak crumbly volcanic rock, fine ash and other debris that had erupted from a volcano.
c. Surface-water: This third situation has nothing to do with underground water currents, but rather is all about water movements above-ground. They are triggered by intense rainstorms or floods and burst or long-term leakage from a sewer or storm-water pipes. If these currents are too strong, the water will not go where it is used to but rather, will find new paths.
If it travels on a surface without ample support from below ground, it will result in sinkholes. Additionally, the water may settle in one location, causing the surface to become impermeable with water but as it leaks into the ground, it will result in sinkholes.
d. Weather changes: Sinkholes can also result from seasonal changes in the groundwater table, freeze and thaw of the ground and extreme precipitation, showcased when there are heavy rains following droughts.
2. Human Activities
Some human activities are resulting in more sinkholes today. For instance, Louisiana is reporting sinkholes forming from abandoned mines. In Florida, many sinkholes are as a result of many underground voids and drainage systems carved from the carbonate rocks throughout the state. If these overlaying layers of ground collapse into these voids, a sinkhole is born. Also, drainage systems may break and drain water into these rocks that are weak against such waters. The result will be a sinkhole.
3. Induced Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a natural occurrence, which might result in sinkholes, assuming they hit areas with a weak rock below the surface. However, there are increased induced earthquakes, which are as a result of both industrial and human activities, which also causes sinkholes. Careless mining and hydraulic fracking can impact an area especially its stability as well as water quality, resulting in earthquakes that result in a sinkhole.
In August 2012, a massive sinkhole opened near Bayou Corne, 77 miles west of New Orleans and grew to 34 acres in size over four years. The sinkhole was attributed to seismic activity and baffling bubbling on the Louisiana Bayou, which was caused by the Texas Brine Company which drilled too close to the salt dome’s outer edge
Sinkholes can be natural or man-made. Natural sinkholes occur due to erosion or underground water. They start developing a long time before it actually appears. groundwater sinkhole. This is how sinkholes are formed.
Humans are also responsible for the formation of sinkholes. Activities like drilling, mining, construction, broken water or drain pipes, improperly compacted soil after excavation work or even heavy traffic can result in small to large sinkholes. Water from a broken pipe can penetrate through mud and rocks and erode the ground underneath and cause sinkholes. Sometimes, heavyweight on soft soil can result in the collapse of the ground, resulting in a sinkhole. Sinkholes can also form when the land surface is changed.
Areas that have a bedrock made of limestone, salt deposits or carbonate rock are most susceptible to erosion and the formation of such holes. These rocks tend to erode as acidic water passes through them. When rainwater passes through decaying plant debris, it tends to become more acidic.
Over a period of years, overlying sediments collapse and a sinkhole gets developed. Sometimes the holes are small, measuring a few feet wide and ten to fifteen feet deep. Others can be hundreds of miles wide and deep. However, all of them can be dangerous for those that get caught in them. There are three major kinds of sinkholes. Their formation is determined by the same geological processes, barring a few differences.
Types of Sinkholes
The three major types of sinkholes know to us are Solution, Cover Collapse and Cover Subsidence.
1. Solution Sinkhole. Cover Collapse Sinkhole
The second kind of sinkhole is known as a Cover Collapse sinkhole. These take place when the bedrock is covered by a deep layer of soil and earth. Once the bedrock begins to get eroded, the crack starts. Cover Subsidence Sinkhole
The last kind of sinkhole.
How Are Sinkholes Formed?
1. The effect of water: As already mentioned, groundwater is the overwhelming reason for the formation of sinkholes. They often occur in ‘karst terrain’ which are areas where soluble bedrock such as limestone or gypsum can be dissolved in water. The bedrock becomes exposed to the water and is gradually worn down over time, some holes become ponds as they are filled with water and at any second, sinkholes could appear and swallow huge chunks of land with anything on them including roads, houses and even human beings and animals.
2. Naturally-occurring cracks: These cracks and small voids underneath the surface are hollowed out by water erosion, with only a cover of soil or sediment remaining on the top. If the hole continues to expand, the cover can no longer support its own weight and will collapse, revealing the cavern underneath
3. Heavy rains after a drought: After a prolonged drought, the surface is exposed enough and loses its strength. If heavy rains follow, they will cause immense pressure on the ground, that it sinks, creating sinkholes
4. Human activities: Human activity can also result in sinkholes. These activities include drilling new water wells, over-withdrawing groundwater, artificially creating ponds of surface water and even diverting surface water from one large area and concentrating it in a single point. Other activities like mining, construction, drilling, improperly compacting the soil after excavations, broken water or drainage pipes, and even heavy traffic could result in sinkholes.
Effects of Sinkholes
The effects of a sinkhole vary depending on where and how it was formed. Natural sinkholes can form on land and in the ocean as well. When they are formed on land, they can change the general topography of the area and divert streams of underground water. If they form suddenly in areas with a heavy population, they can cause a lot of damage to human life and property. Some holes are formed due to the leak in underground storm drains and sewer systems. When they collapse, the damage can be seen for many miles due to the repairs that become necessary.
They can be dangerous to the foundations of the building. Toxic chemicals beneath the earth can come up and may pollute the groundwater. Sinkholes occur commonly in Florida as the state has many underground voids and drainage systems carved from the carbonate rocks.
Natural sinkholes cannot be prevented, as they are bound to occur. However, the ones caused due to human negligence can be prevented in time. Practices such as maintaining the underground systems and plumbing are the best to make sure that a sudden deep hole does not appear in the middle of a city!
Where Do Sinkholes Occur?
Sinkholes can occur anywhere in the world if the conditions favor it. However, they are concentrated in certain areas and here are some of these areas with some notable sinkholes:
1. Crveno Jerezo, Croatia: There is a 530m sinkhole with nearly vertical walls
2. Great Blue Hole in Belize: It is a perfectly round hole in the middle of an atoll that is 124m deep
3. Sima Humboldt, Bolivia: There is a 314m deep crater, formed from extremely resistant sandstone
4. Xiaozhai tiankeng, China: This is by far the deepest sinkhole known to date. Tiankeng is the local term for ‘heavenly pit’, or sinkhole. The Xiaozhai sinkhole measures 662m deep and 626m wide
5. Bowling Green, Kentucky: In 2014, a 40ft wide and 20ft deep sinkhole opened under the floor of the Skydome area of the National Corvette Museum, causing eight rare and one-of-a-kind Corvettes to sink. The vehicles were estimated to be worth over a million dollars. Other US states that are prone to sinkholes include Florida, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, California, Missouri, and Alabama.
6. Guatemala City, Guatemala: The sinkhole swallowed a three-story factory, killed 15 people and measured approximately 60ft wide and 300ft deep. It was triggered by tropical storm Agatha but it was because the city was built in a region where the first few hundred meters of the ground is made up of pumice fill, a material deposited during past volcanic eruptions
Can a Water Leak Cause a Sinkhole?
The answer to this is a definite yes!
Sinkholes occur when water erodes underneath the surface of the earth. The ground beneath your home, for instance, is not all solid. It contains pockets of air and water, which is commonly referred to as the water table. The stability of the ground is ensured, even if there are these gaps feet below the surface. If large amounts of water pour in and move the dirt, that stability is not entirely assured.
If there is a water leak, the excess water can help in eroding the ground. If it moves enough dirt, the ground could collapse into the gap, resulting in a sinkhole. A whole section of the ground could suddenly drop down even if the erosion has been happening over quite some time. This makes leak detection very crucial in preventing sinkholes, especially those that affect homes.
In most circumstances, it takes a very serious leak to create a sinkhole, unless the water condition beneath your home is very unusual. Nonetheless, there are warning signs of an impending sinkhole on your property before it falls through. To understand if there is a leak in your home which could one day result in a sinkhole, look out for the following sings:
- Cracks in the foundation;
- Decreased water pressure in the home;
- The home is leaning;
- You hear water running especially when it should not;
- Cracks in the driveway and sidewalks;
- A growing water bill than usual;
- Areas on your lawn are becoming greener or browner than normal;
- The doors do not close properly

The following nominees (listed alphabetically) were nominated for French Polynesia's Leading Boutique Resort 2007.Purpose: A patient's willingness to consent to a procedure may be influenced by various factors, including the patient's rapport with the physician, nonverbal cues he or she receives during the discussion of risks, and other elements of the discussion of risks. Previous reports address these influences, but the effect of the actual wording used to describe risks is unclear. The purpose of this study was to better understand how framing the risk involved in a procedure affects a patient's likelihood to consent to the procedure.
Method: In a 1997 study at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the authors randomly assigned 116 patients to view one of two short videos describing angioplasty and its associated risks. Sixty-three participants viewed the first video, which framed the procedure as 99% safe, and 53 viewed the second, which framed the likelihood of complication as 1 in 100. Participants were then asked to rate their consent to two hypothetical treatment scenarios on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = definitely, 4 = definitely not).
Results: When asked to consent to a treatment scenario that would relieve chest pain but offer no survival benefit, respondents who viewed the first video were more likely to consent than were those who viewed the second (p<.001). There was no significant difference in the two groups' likelihoods to consent when the potential health benefit was to reduce the risk of future heart attack.
Conclusion: This study's finding provides evidence that how a physician describes a procedure's risks when obtaining a patient's informed consent significantly influences the likelihood of consent. This fact should be considered when teaching communication skills, including interviewing and patient education skills, so that patients will be more likely to make health care decisions that are consistent with their own values and beliefs.Watch the hottest 2 kombinator 2012 07 16 12 58 129

We’re excited to let you know that Kite and the RNLI have teamed up again and added more styles to our bespoke range of baby clothes.
Designed for the youngest members of your crew, your little one can look the part this summer and support their good work.
This year has already been a busy one for RNLI lifesavers. The charity, based right on our doorstep in Poole, Dorset, has been saving lives at sea all around the coasts of the UK and Ireland.
Read on to learn more about the RNLI and the collection we’ve developed together, and to pick up some tips to help you stay safe at the beach.
About the RNLI
The RNLI is the charity that saves lives at sea. Funded by donations, their volunteer lifeboat crews provide a 24-hour rescue service in the UK and Ireland, their seasonal lifeguards look after people on busy beaches, and their Flood Rescue Team helps those affected by flooding.
The volunteer lifeboat crews and lifeguards have saved over 143,000 lives since 1824 and their youth education and water safety work has helped to prevent countless more from getting into danger. Today, 95% of the RNLI is made up of volunteers - ordinary people doing extraordinary things to help save lives at sea.
This year, with so many more of us holidaying at home, their lifesavers are under pressure like never before.
The collection
We have been working in collaboration with the RNLI for three years and this season we’ve added new options to the collection. The fun, lifeboat inspired designs are all made with 100% organic cotton offering perfect comfort and fit. Not only that, but all purchases help raise funds towards saving lives at sea.
The garments can be purchased directly from the RNLI's online shop or you may find them in one of the various RNLI stores around the UK. You can find your nearest RNLI shop here.
Staying safe at the beach this summer
With summer in full swing we wanted to share with you some of the amazing information that the RNLI have prepared, all designed to help keep you safe at the beach. We always appreciate how lucky we are to live near the coast and many people come and visit during the summer months, so here’s some really useful information that we all need to know to make sure we stay safe and have fun.
Three important things to remember are:
1. Always try and visit a lifeguarded beach so that there is someone on hand should you get into difficulty.
2. If you get into trouble in the water, remember to float.
3. In an emergency, dial 999 for the Coastguard in the UK or 112 for the Coast Guard in Ireland.
Beach signs and flags
Keep a close eye out for all signs and flags as they let you know key information:.
Things to look out for
Rip currents - Rips are strong currents running out to sea that can be difficult to spot. They can quickly take you from the shallows out of your depth.
Tides - A beach can seem like a vast playground, but the tide can come in surprisingly quickly. Getting cut off by the tide contributes to a significant number of RNLI rescues every year.
Waves - Playing in the waves is great fun, but can also be dangerous. They have different characteristics depending on the beach and conditions so understanding how they work will help keep you safe.
Cold water shock - entering water below 15°C can seriously affect your breathing and movement. Average UK and Ireland sea temperatures are just 12°C so this is a risk for most of the year.No. 188, Xinhai Street, Fushan high-tech industrial development district, Yantai, Shandong, China

There, we will go through the process of obtaining Violet’s US documents in order to return home.
We had a quiet morning here, going for a long walk and looking around a mall for a bit. We found a delicious bakery too, which gave us some comforts from home. Violet loves the stroller, with some breaks to be carried. She’s even getting more and more comfortable with me as the days go on.
This girl has quite the personality. She loves to wear bows, and will point to her head and makes sounds as if to say, “Where is my headband?” Nicole will put one on, and then she looks up with the biggest grin! If we’re in the hotel room, she reaches to be picked up and wants to go check herself out in the mirror. She is also incredibly observant. Today, she grabbed Nicole’s chapstick and pretended to put it on. She’ll catch your eye and shake her head at you, or cover her eyes and then peek out. She’s constantly making us laugh. Brody and Joia will get a kick out of her – and she will enjoy the two of them!
Enjoy some pictures below:

RALEIGH — North Carolina Democratic lawmakers unveiled four bills on Tuesday they say are aimed at ensuring LGBTQ residents have greater legal protections.
Most of the legislative package mirrors what was put forward in 2019 although a new addition seeks to eliminate a “panic defense" in criminal cases through which perpetrators of crimes can blame a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity for violent actions.
House and Senate Democrats also renewed calls for banning gay conversion therapy and fully repealing House Bill 2, the state's so-called “bathroom bill” that was passed in 2016. HB2 was partially repealed in 2017. North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature hasn't previously shown much interest in advancing proposals similar to the ones Democrats put forward on Tuesday.
But Sen. Natasha Marcus, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, hopes Republicans will rally around a message of ensuring children can avoid mental health risks associated conversion therapy, or the practice of trying to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity.
“Conversion therapy causes a lifetime of harm and often results in teen suicide,” Marcus said. “We can't allow that to happen in North Carolina, and so, I believe that regardless of party, we can come together to protect our kids.”
Equality North Carolina and the Campaign for Southern Equality backed the string of bills. House Bill 449 bars the panic defense, while HB 450 expands nondiscrimination protections for all LGBTQ people in North Carolina. House Bill 451 would completely do away with the bathroom bill passed in 2016, and HB 452 would prohibit conversion therapy.
The groups cited improved public opinion polling and greater public awareness of LGBT issues as factors that could lead to further legislative progress.
“There is a coordinated attack across multiple states and there's a greater need now than there was two years ago," said Allison Scott, a transgender woman affiliated with the Campaign which advocates for LGBTQ southerners. "North Carolina would be just one of many states to step up and do this. It wouldn't even be leading the pack. We're just asking North Carolina to join the pack.”

It is sure to be wildly expensive in the upcoming future of travel, so why not check out somewhere closer to home… say, Canada, eh? As the worlds 2nd largest country, there is much to see and discover, from East to West.
10. Othello Tunnels, British Colombia
The Othello tunnels, found about 2 hours outside of Vancouver, are a series of old train tunnels and bridges over the Coquihalla River.

This park is a definite must-see if you are in the Alberta region, so go rent a car in Edmonton and explore everything and more Jasper has to offer.
8. Lake Superior Provincial Park, Ontario
What is lacking in 55 million-year-old Rockies, Ontario’s Lake Superior National Park makes up for in awe-inspiring scenery.

Marie Ontario, await hundreds of ancient Ojibway images at Agawa Rock, a sacred lakeside site in Lake Superior Provincial Park. Well worth the drive, you will want to explore this route during autumn as the trees appear to have been set ablaze

The city of Montreal is a spectacular combination of both old and new—be sure to set aside a few days to truly discover the beauty of this city.

What are the best smart scales?
After testing several of the best smart scales ranging in price from $20 to $180, our top pick is the Withings Body Plus. At $79, the Withings Body Plus is not the least nor the most expensive smart scale, and it measures far more than just your weight. The Wi-Fi-based device syncs with the company’s proprietary app, which is an intuitive tool for seeing a complete picture of your body composition. Better yet, Withings Body Plus pairs with all of the top fitness apps, including Weight Watchers and MyFitnessPal.
Withings also makes a $59 version of its smart scale called the Withings Body. It doesn’t track as many metrics as the Body Plus and can’t read your heart rate, but most people will find it suits their needs. It also benefits from Withings’s Health Mate app, meaning you can see your body’s changes over time. The Withings Body is a great choice if you're looking for a low-cost smart scale that syncs with your MyFitnessPal goals.
Of all the best smart scales, though, the Wyze Scale is what we’d recommend for people on a budget or who are trying out a smart scale for the first time. We're pretty impressed by what this $20 gadget offers.
As one of the best home gym equipment devices that won’t break the bank, the Wyze Scale supports up to eight unique users, offers 12 different health metrics, and even displays some of those metrics directly on the scale’s display. The Wyze Scale’s main caveat is that it’s Bluetooth enabled, meaning your data will only update when your smartphone is within range.
Here are the best smart scales you can buy today
Overall, the Withings Body Plus is the best smart scale. It sports an attractive design, gathers more information than any other scale and presents the data in an easy-to-understand app. Each and every weigh-in appears in the companion Health Mate app automatically, via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth sync. And with your measurement history available at any time, you can see what parts of your routine are bringing you your desired results. The Withings Body Plus also has a useful pregnancy mode, which can give you readings without raising safety concerns when you're expecting.
For an upgrade, the $150 Withings Body Cardio offers heart health features, including a Pulse Wave Velocity measurement that is only available to users in the European Union. That data can be an indicator of hypertension, but the scale itself doesn't diagnose medical conditions..
If you don't need a scale with quite as many features, Withings' $59 Wi-Fi scale, Withings Body, delivers the basics in a stylish package. The scale measures your weight, of course, and does so accurately. We compared it to the $150 Body Cardio and a dumb (er, not Internet-connected) $20 digital scale, and the scale was within 0.2 pounds of both.
The Body, which comes in black or white, has a 2.4 x 1.6-inch display that flashes your weight, weight trend (up or down), BMI and the weather forecast. That's useful if you're weighing in at the beginning of the day before you head outside. The screen isn't the biggest, but it's easy to read and the numbers are big and bright.
The scale syncs with the Health Mate smartphone app, which is where its Wi-Fi connection comes in handy. There you can view your data as a dashboard and see how your weight and BMI fluctuate over time. You can also set goals and pair the scale with apps such as MyFitnessPal. And like Withings's higher-priced scales, the Body offers a pregnancy mode.
The Body doesn't measure your heart rate or your home's air quality, but those are bonus features you can do without to save some money. Plus, this scale works with both iOS and Android devices.
Eufy's Bluetooth scale, which pairs effortlessly with the EufyLife app for iOS and Android, displays your weight almost instantly on-screen. As one of the best smart scales, it nailed the weigh-in. The BodySense scale then syncs that number, along with a host of other metrics, to the app. Those other data points include BMI, what percentage of your body fat is made of water, and how much of your weight is muscle mass, bone mass and body fat mass.
Some Amazon reviewers have noted that the measurements appear to be based on percentages rather than actual fluctuations. But the scale highlights trends and lets you know whether numbers are considered normal for your age, height and weight.
There are a few drawbacks, though, when you compare the Eufy BodySense to the Withings Body. Eufy's scale lacks a pregnancy mode, which makes it a no-go for women who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant. The scale also doesn't give you a weather report during your morning weigh-in the way Nokia's does.
But it does support up to 20 different users and offers detailed analysis for a $30 scale, which makes Eufy's BodySense an excellent budget pick.
The Fitbit Aria 2 is a refreshed version of the original Aria, though it doesn't look much different with its all-glass body and backlit LCD display. The next-generation smart scale is more accurate than the first Aria, Fitbit says, and that proved true in our testing.
The Aria 2 measures the weight, body fat percentage and BMI of up to eight users, which it then automatically syncs to the Fitbit app. If you use any of the best Fitbit models, the app's dashboard syncs information about your weigh-ins with your daily workouts and the food intake you manually input for a true overview of your body on any given day.
The scale takes several seconds to display your weight, which is annoying. It also lacks support for pregnant women. But if you're deeply embedded in the Fitbit ecosystem, the Aria 2 is worth a look.
The best smart scale for those who care about design, the new QardioBase is about an inch larger in diameter than its predecessor, which makes it more stable. This version is also rechargeable and lasts up to a year on a charge instead of needing all those batteries.
The QardioBase 2 is one of the most stylish scales around, if you care about what you're looking at when you weigh yourself. A scale takes up a not-small amount of space in your bathroom, so at least this one looks good.
However, one drawback to QardioBase 2 compared with other smart scales is the time it takes to display your weight on the display, which is located in the center of the device (where you stand). In testing, it took about 12 seconds for a number to pop up, rather than the near-instantaneous readings we get from other smart scales.
RolliBot is an unfamiliar name to most buyers, but the company's attractive Bluetooth $30 Rollifit F8 scale is attractively priced. Other scales are worth the extra money, but the F8 is a decent option that works with the biggest health apps: Apple Health for iPhones, Google Fit on Android and Fitbit’s cross-platform app.
The Rollifit F8 has a slightly smaller footprint than most, coming in under 12 inches, and both black and white models of the scale appear to lack a display until you step on the tempered glass. The display shows just one metric: your weight.
The additional stats, such as visceral fat and bone mass, are interesting to see in the app's dashboard, although I'm not convinced they're accurate.
Our biggest issue with the Rollifit F8 is its Bluetooth-only connectivity. It took forever to pair the scale with our phone, despite the scale showing up as connected in our Bluetooth settings. The app disconnects itself from the scale when not in use, which makes sense to save power, but then it takes several attempts to reconnect the two.
How to choose the best smart scale for you
A smart scale isn’t a device you want to replace often, so you want it to be reliable, well-rounded and fill all your fitness tracking needs. In other words, don’t let price be your ultimate decision-maker. It’s worth it to stretch your budget for one of the best smart scales that will last you at least a few years, and supports the exact data you’re interested in following. Review all the metrics a given smart scale offers before buying.
That said, if you’re in temporary living quarters or are working towards a short term fitness goal, a budget smart scale, like the Wyze Scale, is an excellent choice. It won’t last a lifetime but will satisfy your immediate needs.
Another thing to pay attention to is whether a smart scale has some kind of ‘safe mode’ for people with pacemakers or people who are pregnant. Safe mode, or ‘weigh only’ mode, disables bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), which uses a weak electric current to determine body fat percentage and could pose a safety threat to certain users.
Reasons to buy a smart scale
Like we've already mentioned, a smart scale can tell you so much more than just your weight, which isn't always the best indication of whether or not you're actually healthy. You also don't have to look at the number on the scale if you don't want to - as smart scales connect to the health apps on your phone, you can send the data across without having to stare at the number.
While obsessing about the number on the scale is never the answer, if your overall health goal is to shed some weight, smart scales are a great way to stay motivated. Everybody loves new tech, and often a lot of the linked apps will display the data in easy-to-understand, motivating ways.
How we test the best smart scales
For our review of the best smart scales, we take a number of factors into consideration. First, we check that the scale offers an accurate reading using a dumber digital scale, the highly rated EatSmart digital bathroom scale. If the readings are within a fraction of a pound of each other, we can recommend them. The readings shouldn't take more than few seconds, either.
Aside from price, we also explore the variety of metrics a scale offers, how many unique users the scale supports, the scale’s connectivity options and the user-friendliness of the scale’s companion app. We like to see whether the app provides background information on your body’s statistics, too. Plus compatibility with third-party health programs plays a role in our testing.
The last thing anyone needs is more anxiety, so we look for the best smart scales to make stepping on the platform less intimidating. A smart scale’s metrics should reveal to you that your body is more than your weight.
So I built an app called Smart Scale Sync that syncs weight from Withings to Garmin/Strava/TrainerRoad. I'll be adding support for fitbit scales soon.All entries for the 2022 edition of the Octopus pre-season will be shown here.

It seems like no matter how much you plan, schedule, or motivate yourself — you just can’t find the momentum to get things over the line. It’s ok, we definitely know the feeling…it happens to the best of us. The good news is it doesn’t need to stay that way.
Enter Dr Stephanie Burns: A woman who has dedicated 35 years of her life (and a Ph.D) to understanding human behaviour, success in adults and how to actually achieve your goals in todays fast paced world. Here are some insights to why really capable people don’t achieve their most important goals.
We move away from the uncomfortable
“We are biologically wired to move away from what’s uncomfortable,” says Dr Burns. We need to make a connection between our biology and our actions. When we perceive something hard or strenuous (like writing that business plan) our brain tells us to conserve energy and ignore the task at hand. Aka procrastination.
So, what do we do if we find ourselves falling into procrastination, the Netflix bubble or the mindless Facebook scroll?
First off, go easy on your self judgment; and instead employ two behaviours that successful people use to achieve their goals:
1. Don’t ask yourself “do I feel like doing this task?” Just don’t think, and start it.
Take action and just take the first step. If you think about it, you’ll come up with a “great” excuse on why you should be doing something else.
2. Initiate and sustain action in the direction of your goals
Once you’ve started, make it really uncomfortable for yourself to back out. For example, you get home from a hard day at work and you don’t feel like going to the gym. Tell yourself that you’re going to the gym, but you’re only going to do one exercise for 10 minutes — it’s a mind hack that works. Once you get to the gym and get started, it will take more effort to cool down and drive home and get changed than it will to just keep exercising; after all, you’re already right there.
We’re too good at making compelling excuses
“We’re just too smart for our own good” as Dr Burns would say. “When we stop doing what we said we were going to do; we get a feeling of guilt. And we use the big part of our brain (cerebrum) to construct a story and rationale; *cough excuses, as to why next year would be a far better time to start that business, or apply for that promotion because you got too much going on in your life right now. As long as the excuse sounds good enough to us, and we can convince other people buy it, we let ourselves off guilt-free.”
Here’s the catch: when people fall into this trap of making excuses, they tend to label themselves as procrastinators and non achievers. They get so used to not achieving things that they stop focusing on things to strive toward. People think of procrastinators as having a lax personality trait, but it’s actually a consistently learned behaviour — but so is persistence, and that’s something we can learn, too!
…And, if you really want to be successful, if you really want to achieve your goals, if you really want to live your best life — the good news is that you can learn persistence, and the success you deserve will follow.

Speak Your MindLitter box furniture is the ultimate upgrade for any cat owner.
Being a cat parent and keeping a chic, stylish home don't usually come together. Our cats imperil our couches and recliners with clawing. So we buy scratchers to distract cats from the furniture, and we spray the furniture with feline repellants. Then there's the litter box, which no matter where we put it, is an eyesore. Sigh. Litter box furniture might seem extra to those of you who have a great spot for your litter box, but it can be an absolute lifesaver for pet parents living in small homes or apartments.
There is one place where cat and furniture work together: the litter box disguised as furniture. Check out these end tables, night stands and more. They look--and act as--functional furniture, but their secret identity is litter box holder. Here are our fave pieces of enclosed litter box furniture that actually improve the look of our homes.
Best Litter Box Furniture
Feandra Hidden Cat Litter Enclosure
Meet your new nightstand or end table. A distinctive rustic brown color, it would look great in your living room with a lamp or a plant gracing it. But beneath that exterior is kitty's litter box. Made with rugged particleboard, the piece has doors designed to look like a barn's. It's water and scratch resistant.
Unipaws Cat Litter Box Enclosure
This example of litter box furniture opens from the top, making it look almost like a traditional stereo cabinet. (It also has front doors that open). It's made of wood, and like most litter box enclosures can double as a nightstand or end table. We love the color, a unique weathered gray.
Ecoflex Jumbo Litter Box Cover
This unit adds to the typical table design with a front door that flips down. It's made of a non-toxic, recycled plastic. It comes in versatile hues of Antique White, Grey, Espresso Black and Russet Brown.
Baxton Studio Cat Litter Box Cover
This end-table style litter box furniture is distinguished by a lower shelf that supplements the tabletop space. Place a photo or two on the tabletop and a few artsy books on the shelf; kitty does her business down below. A single door gives access to the litter box for cleaning.
Arf Pets Cat Litter Box Enclosure
The top of this wooden unit is elevated, creating a shelf underneath. So you have two surfaces to put your stuff on. Meanwhile, underneath, cats have a place to relieve themselves.
Good Pet Stuff Cat Litter Box Planter
This litter box is concealed inside a planter. This is ideal if you have limited space and can't quite accommodate the larger table style models. It comes with realistic looking plants. The pot is made from a material that looks just like clay. Plus, it has a filtered vent system to control odor and dust.

Large-scale computation is a tool that enables research and advances in different fields, such as personalized medicine, climate prediction, or genomics, to name a few, whose results may have a social impact. Most of these research disciplines have as a common factor a large number of input data, heterogeneous in nature, generated by different type of sources (remote sensors, major scientific instruments, satellites, myriad of distributed sensors from the “Smart Cities” projects, etc) which requires a tremendous amount of storage. All these input data undergo different pre-processing steps to transform the raw data into usable input data, like homogenization into a single format, reduction, filtering, etc.
This data is used as input data to complex simulation or modelling processes that traditionally are executed in large High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures with the objective of generating predictions or performing simulations of the real processes (like forecasting tomorrows weather or modelling of the behaviour of a given drug against a specific disease). These HPC processes generate themselves large amounts of output data, in some cases of heterogeneous nature as well, which are later analysed and reduced, used to validate with experimental data the predictions and hypothesis and are the source to derive new scientific discoveries. For example, the Climate change experiment Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) will be performed between 31 centres and will involve 52 weather and climate models. The estimation of storage required for the output data of this experiment is 60 PBytes[20].
What has been described above matches what is described in a recent white paper from the Computing Community Consortium, which presents a generic view of the “scientific process” [28]. This publication supports the classic view of the scientific method as a complex inferential process which seeks to understand the nature by means of a thorough and controlled observation. According to this view, the scientific process is composed of three inference steps: abduction (i.e., guessing at an explanation), deduction (i.e., determining the necessary consequences of a set of propositions), and induction (i.e., making a sampling-based generalization).
Figure 1 presents a version of these key logical elements of that model as seen in the recently published white paper [7] by the Big-Data and Extreme-Scale Computing (BDEC), an international initiative in which we participate, which focuses on how to achieve the convergence of High-end Data Analysis (HDA) and HPC. While the abduction and induction phases imply the use of analysis and analytics processes (HDA techniques), the deduction phase is typically an HPC process. However, the three different steps of the scientific process have been realised until now with separated methodologies and tools, with a lack of integration and lack of common view of the whole process. The main BDEC recommendation is to address the basic problem of the split between the two paradigms: the HPC/HDA software ecosystem split.
While HPC and HDA are necessary for the progress in science, the traditional scientific computational workflows are fragmented into separated components, with HPC and HDA phases using different programming models and different environments, resulting in a lack of a global perspective. What is more, the huge amount of data and its format heterogeneity, hinders the generation of scientific conclusions.
Besides, the focus of the different technological and scientific profiles involved in the process may differ. While the emphasis from the computer science point of view has traditionally been on the programming models and applications used to make predictions/simulations, developers of scientific application give more emphasis to the data aspect of the problem: metadata and traceability are crucial for them.
All these differences and concerns are increased by the complexity of the current computational infrastructure: it is common to find scientific workflows that run very inefficiently in large HPC systems (using a low percentage of the possible performance). We are faced with new processor architectures and of different types (general purpose processors, graphic processors, programmable devices), new persistent storage technologies and new ways of interconnecting all the elements of these complex systems. HPC systems will be coupled with public and private Cloud infrastructures, and what is more, the systems where future scientific workflows are to be executed will also include edge devices like sensors or scientific instruments that will stream continuous flows of data and similarly the scientists expect results to be streamed out for monitoring, streaming and visualization of the scientific results to enable interactivity. Also, the carbon footprint of ICT processes is a concern and its reduction will be one of the objectives of the 9PM Horizon Europe. Scientific application developers struggle with all these problems, what makes the development of holistic scientific workflows very complex.
This paper presents our research proposal in workflow environments and tools for the development of scientific workflows following a holistic approach where data and computing processes are considered at the same level and are integrated in a single flow, based on simple and high-level interfaces, that at the same time are enacted by intelligent runtimes that are able to exploit the performance of the underlying computing continuum infrastructures in an energy efficient way.
The paper is structured as follows: section II presents the state of the art and related work in topics involved in the proposed research. Section III describes the infrastructure that is considered in the BDEC initiative and in this research, while section IV presents our vision for the development of workflow environments for these infrastructures. Section V present some thoughts on the existent multidisciplinary user profiles in workflow environments and necessary abstraction levels required to match these different profiles. Section VI presents the ongoing work at our group towards the presented vision and how we plan to achieve it. Finally, section VII concludes the paper.
Ii State of the Art
The vision presented in this paper proposes doing research in new environments and tools for the development of holistic scientific workflows, where different aspects of the scientific process are integrated: data management and analysis, high-performance computing processes and machine learning processes. However, in current best practices we find all these elements in separate components and environments.
Ii-a Scientific workflows
A Workflow Management System can be defined as a software environment able to orchestrate the execution of a set of interdependent computing tasks that exchange data between them with the objective of solving a given experiment. A workflow can be graphically described as a graph, where the nodes denote the computations and the edges data or control dependencies between them [51, 17]. Workflows can be graphically described, with a drag and drop interface where the workflow is totally specified with a graphical interface by the user like in Kepler [3], Taverna [29], or Galaxy [2]. They can be described textually, by specifying the graph in a textual mode, indicating the nodes and its interconnections like in Pegasus [18] or ASKALON [21]. Workflows can also be described programmatically, using all the flexibility of a programming language to describe the behaviour of the workflow that is dynamically built depending on the actual dependencies found by the workflow system like in PyCOMPSs/COMPSs [33], Swift [50] or Parsl [8]. A particular case of this is the use of simple tagged scripts that are processed by the actual engine, like with Cylc [39], Autosubmit [35], or ecFlow [34]. Another alternative is to describe the workflow through a set of commands with a command interface, like in Copernicus [42].
A key component in a Workflow Management System is its engine. The engine is the responsible for coordinating the execution of all the tasks, scheduling them in the available computing resources and storage devices, transferring the data between distributed storage systems, monitoring the execution of the tasks, etc. The information that can be obtained about the engine in the literature is very variable: while for some systems (i.e. Pegasus, PyCOMPSs/COMPSs or Swift) the bibliography details sophisticated engines that implement various optimizations, either to schedule in parallel the workflow to be executed, to improve data locality, to be able to exploit heterogeneous computing platforms, etc; for others, the information is very scarce and difficult to find.
Another characteristic of these systems is the computing platform where the workflows are executed. Most systems can execute in distributed environments (either composed of regular servers/clusters or HPC systems), also support for Clouds is common, and some systems are starting to support containers. While in most scientific communities the tasks in workflows have been serial tasks (i.e., each individual task is executed by a sequential process), the trend in general is to take benefit of current multicore architectures and accelerators such as GPGPUs or FPGAs to execute the tasks, including tasks in the workflows that require some level of parallelism although with a low degree and only intranode (up to a few threads). However, there are communities that have been using large clusters or supercomputers to execute some of their workflow tasks (like in the climate or fusion communities, where the workflows compose large MPI simulations).
PyCOMPSs/COMPSs [33, 47] is a task-based programming environment developed by our group at the BSC and is the result of most of our research during the last 10 years. PyCOMPSs/COMPSs supports Java, C/C++ and Python as programming languages, and through basic annotations is able to parallelize the applications at task level, being able to execute them in distributed computing platforms. The COMPSs runtime takes care of making all the scheduling and resource management decisions. Also, it offers to the programmer the view that a single shared memory space is available, and takes care of all the necessary data-transfers between the nodes of the computing infrastructure. The COMPSs runtime is able to execute the applications in supercomputers and large clusters, public, private clouds and federated clouds, containerized clusters [44], mobile environments [31] and in fog computing environments [32]. PyCOMPSs/COMPSs has been used to implement scientific workflows from life sciences [9, 43], earth sciences [14] and other disciplines [5, 45, 4, 24] .
Ii-B HPC programming
The Message Passing Interface (MPI [25]) is a programming model for parallel application which provides an interface to enable the exchange of messages between the different processes involved in the application. MPI is based on the idea of having a large number of concurrent processes that exchange messages with the objective of solving a large problem in a cooperative way. While MPI is the programming model used in most of the HPC applications, with the appearance of fat nodes (nodes with several processors, each of them with several cores) in current HPC systems, two-level alternatives “MPI+X” are very common. In this sense, MPI is used to exploit the parallelism between nodes of a supercomputer, and the ”X” programming model is used to exploit the parallelism inside the node. The “X” alternative programming model can be instantiated by the OpenMP [15] standard, or by alternatives oriented to specific hardware [38, 48], as for example OpenACC [22] for accelerators or even threads [11, 23]. OpenMP can be used either in the more traditional work-sharing approach (parallel loops) or with the more recently proposed dependent tasks approach. Alternatives to these programming models for HPC are the PGAS based family of programming models which assume a global memory address space logically partitioned and a portion of it is local to each process. Representatives of this family are Chapel [10], GASPI [26] and UPC [19].
Ii-C Big data
Programming models for big data are dominated nowadays by Spark [52]. Spark provides a set of operators that can be called by the applications, which internally are optimized to be executed in distributed environments through the Spark runtime. Spark is in fact an extension and generalization of the MapReduce paradigm [16]
and its popular open source implementation Apache Hadoop[49].
Ii-D Programming machine learning
There exist multiple libraries/environments for machine learning which are very popular: Tensorflow[1]40]
, to mention a few. Most of these environments provide a Python interface and are easy to use. Some of these environments support some type of parallelism, like Caffe that runs on GPUs or Tensorflow, which supports data and model parallelism. Keras[12]
is a high-level neural networks API that was designed with the objective of offering a simple and intuitive interface for the users and with the goal of enabling fast experimentation. Based in Python can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. MLlib[37] is the Spark’s machine learning library, and as Spark is based on the RDD data structure. MLlib is composed of several algorithms for classification, regression, collaborative filtering, clustering and decomposition. Another popular machine library in Python is Scikit-learn [41] which provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. The library is built on top of the optimized Python libraries NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib and it is open source under BSD license. However, only coarse grain parallelism is supported. An environment that leverages big data and machine learning libraries and very popular in those communities is the Jupyter notebooks [30], a web-based application that allows the development of code in multiple programming languages, its interactive execution and sharing documents that include code, data, comments and results. PyCOMPSs/COMPSs runtime offers support for Jupyter notebooks with the goal of providing an interface for interactive execution.
Iii Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Platforms (ACPs) and the BDEC2
The advances in computing is facing the researchers with complex computing infrastructures, which couple large High-Performance Computing systems with public and private cloud infrastructures. What is more, the systems where future scientific workflows are to be executed will also include edge devices, sensors and scientific instruments that will be able to do computation in the edge and to stream continuous flows of data. The complexity of the infrastructure is increased with other aspects, since we are faced with new processor architectures and of different types (general purpose processors, graphic processors, programmable devices), new persistent storage technologies and new ways of interconnecting all the elements of these complex systems.
The Big Data and Extreme-Scale Computing 2 (BDEC2) initiative111 will focus on the problem of defining and creating consensus around a shared cyberinfrastructure for science in the data saturated world that is now emerging. Since massive amounts of data will soon be getting generated nearly everywhere, massive amounts of computing and storage will have to be available for use at the edge or in the fog, as well in commercial Clouds and HPC centers.
The BDEC2 is starting a new workshop series, beginning with a comprehensive study of application requirements, in order to help the BDEC2 explore and capture their communities application/workflow requirements. The analysis of requirements will have to focus on the locations and flow rates of relevant data sources, on the types of processing that needs to be done, and on the when and where of the necessary processing and storage/buffering, etc. The problem of how to draw out and express such requirements is an intellectual challenge in its own right. Our group is actively contributing to the BDEC2 initiative by proposing new methodologies for workflows to be developed and executed in these infrastructures.
Iv Vision on Workflows for a computing continuum
The vision we have about the workflow environments needed for ACPs is of new environments and tools that enable the development of scientific workflows following a holistic approach, where both data and computing aspects are involved at the same level of importance, and compose together a single flow, with metadata of applications integrated in the workflow. The workflows we envision may be composed of data analytics, HPC simulations and machine learning components, integrated in simple, high-level, abstract interfaces, where the developer of scientific applications will be able to focus on the solution to be developed and the scientific results to be obtained.
To achieve this objectives, we consider that a multidisciplinary approach should be followed: experts from different Computer Science (CS) fields (machine learning, parallelism, distributed computing) and from application fields (i.e, Personalized medicine, Earth sciences) should be involved, in order to define these new methodologies that will support advances in scientific research and knowledge progress.
In this process, application providers will contribute to the research together with the CS experts in order to design the workflow environments that better reflect the specific way of understanding their scientific workflows. In this sense, for the different areas of application, different solutions could be designed. What is more, different abstraction levels on the workflow methodologies will be considered to meet the expectations of different scientific and technological user profiles (final user, application developer, research support, computer engineer; see section V).
These high-level interfaces should be complemented with powerful runtimes, able to make autonomous decisions in order to execute the scientific workflows in efficient ways in complex data and computing infrastructures, both in terms of performance and energy consumption. The runtime should be able to take decisions in a very dynamic fashion, to enable the exploration of the workflow design space in an intelligent manner, to boost the time to solution. Techniques such as automatic parallelization, machine learning, optimization of data and metadata management, can be present in the runtime. Also, the runtime should be able to deal with the vast and heterogeneous nature of the infrastructures, being able to get the best from them, but keeping the scientific workflow agnostic of them.
V Multidisciplinary approach for holistic workflows
One of the important aspects of our vision is the multidisciplinary approach that we consider it should be followed. In this multidisciplinary approach we differentiate different technological and scientific user profiles of the workflows:
Scientist or final user: expert in the science field, is the one that will be using the developed workflow to obtain new scientific findings. Usually has no programming skills or very low.
Application provider or owner: still a scientist, the one developing the scientific workflow. Usually has knowledge on the processes needed to implement the scientific workflow, although is not necessarily an expert on the results that are aimed to obtain. May or may not have programming skills.
Research support: is the one dealing with lower aspects of the application. May have some expertise on the scientific field and good programming skills.
Computer engineer: expert in HPC or machine learning, or both. Is able to understand the complexities of the infrastructure, and to perform optimizations to get the best from the hardware. Usually does not have knowledge of the scientific field.
Most of the current workflow approaches have been designed only focusing on one of these profiles and we believe that this is the reason for the gap that appears between the different points of view. For example, a computer scientist may develop a programming model or workflow environment and she considers that it should be very easy to be used to implement scientific workflows, but the research support or application owner may not feel comfortable developing his application using this environment. Similarly, an application owner may develop an application and the final user does not adopt it due to different expectations of what the application should do. The reasons for such gaps may be different in each case, but we believe that can be reduced by means of multidisciplinary approaches where a team with a combination of different user profiles works towards a unified solution.
We consider that the different user profiles can face the scientific problem at different abstraction levels:
Application: Is the scientific workflow solution, with graphical and high-level interfaces, that can be easily used by a scientist to solve a complex scientific problem. The application is able to exploit the complexities of the underlying infrastructure thanks to the levels below.
High-Level abstraction (HLA): Is a high-level abstraction language or environment that enables the application developer to easily design the scientific application without the need to understand the complexities of the infrastructure.
Patterns: Is an intermediate programming environment, where developers can express in a simple way parallel structures (embarrassingly parallel, fork, join, …), data reductions, etc. Enable to express complex code optimizations in a simple way.
General purpose: Is a lower level programming environment, where the optimizations are implemented manually or in a semi-automatic way thanks to hints from the programmer.
Runtime API: It is the level closer to the infrastructure and implements all the optimizations to exploit its complexity. An expert programmer can consider using a runtime API to deal directly with this lower level, although it would not be the more common case.
Figure 2 shows a mapping of the user profiles to the levels of abstraction. This mapping is not always fixed and there may be overlaps. For example, although most application developers will feel more comfortable in a higher level of abstraction interface (for example, using a graphical workflow definition tool), sometimes they may be willing to use lower levels and be skillful on lower programming interfaces.
Our research will study the required abstraction levels for the interfaces with each of these user profiles and the equivalences between these levels (which can be generated through manual conversion or automated with compilers or code generation tools). For example, automatic or assisted parallelization methodologies implemented by the runtime engine can benefit higher abstraction levels, such as the general purpose or HLA levels (see Figure 3).
Vi A possible approach to develop our vision
Vi-a COMPSs programming model and its integration with persistent storage systems
The roadmap to implement the vision described before is based on an incremental development from the current state of the art in our group. The Workflows and Distributed Computing group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center has been developing for the last years the COMPSs programming model.
COMPSs is a task-based programming model which aims to ease the development and execution of parallel applications in distributed computing infrastructures, such as Clusters and Clouds. A COMPSs application is composed of tasks, which are annotated methods. At execution time, the runtime builds a task graph (or workflow) that takes into account the data dependencies between tasks, and from this graph schedules and executes the tasks in the distributed infrastructure, taking also care of the required data transfers between nodes. COMPSs is written in Java, and supports applications in Java, Python and C/C++.
Tasks in a COMPSs workflow can be of different nature:
Sequential task, written in a traditional programming language that runs in one core of a node.
Parallel task, programmed in a shared memory paradigm (threads, OpenMP, OmpSs,…), that runs in several cores of a node.
Parallel task, programmed with a distributed memory paradigm (MPI) that runs on multiple nodes.
An invocation to a web service, previously instantiated in a node.
A COMPSs workflow can combine the different task types and its runtime is able to perform the corresponding resource management to allocate the required computing nodes, as well as performing the necessary data transfers. Also, a whole COMPSs application can be published as a web service.
Another feature of COMPSs is that their applications are agnostic of the actual computing infrastructure where they are executed. This is accomplished through a component that offers different connectors, each bridging to each provider API. COMPSs can run in different Cloud providers and federation of them, and in clusters and supercomputers. COMPSs runtime also supports elasticity in clouds, federated clouds and in SLURM managed clusters.
PyCOMPSs is the python binding of COMPSs and has recently emerged as an excellent solution to enable the convergence of HPC and HDA. Although languages such as Fortran and C/C++ are the more popular in HPC, Python is also largely used. Similarly in the HDA world, Python is one of the big players. For this reason, the ability of PyCOMPSs to orchestrate workflows that contains HPC components (i.e. MPI simulations, multi-threaded or OpenMP tasks) together with data analytics written in Python, as well as the possibility of interoperate with traditional machine learning environments such as TensorFlow or Pythorch, makes this environment a very powerful tool for our objectives.
Another feature that better positions PyCOMPSs/COMPSs is the possibility of expressing resource constraints on a task type. These constraints can be of computing resources (for example, that requires a specific type of processor, such as a GPU, or that requires a number of cores), memory available for the task or the existence of a specific software in the node where the task has to be executed.
With regard the computing platform, COMPSs application remain agnostic of the computing resources, and the runtime enables the execution of applications in large supercomputers or clusters, clouds and federated clouds, as well as any of these type of resources managed with container managers.
With these features we have been working with final users on developing their applications, on fields such as Life Science or Earth Science. For example, GUIDANCE is a tool for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) developed by the Life Science department at BSC, with collaboration from our group. An example of scientific application of this tool are the genotype imputation and association analysis of type 2 diabetes case and controls with 70,000 subjects[9]. The application is developed as a Java COMPSs application that orchestrates a quite large amount of external binaries. For a whole genome exploration involves 120,000 files, more than 200 GB of storage and generates between 1-3 million COMPSs tasks. One of the characteristics of the binaries involved in this workflow is the requirement of a variable amount of memory for its execution. The possibility of adding memory constraints that are dynamically evaluated by the COMPSs runtime simplifies the management of the application from the user side. The application has been executed with up to 100 nodes of the Marenostrum supercomputer (4800 cores), showing good scalability. The use of variable memory constraints and the asynchronous execution of the tasks inherent to the COMPSs programming model has enabled to reduce the execution time by 50%.
Another example is the implementation of the NMMB-Monarch application [14] with PyCOMPSs. NMMB-Monarch is a fully online multiscale chemical weather prediction system for regional and global-scale. The NMMB-Monarch workflow is composed of five steps, that involve the invocation of multiple scripts and external binaries, including a Fortran 90 application parallelized with MPI. Our group has ported NMMB-Monarch to PyCOMPSs and demonstrated how we can effectively orchestrate workflows that involve MPI simulations and data analytics, offering a easy-to-use interface for the programmer. In addition, the code with PyCOMPSs was able to achieve better speed-up thanks to the parallelization of the sequential part of the application, composed of the initialization scripts.
Vi-A1 Integration of PyCOMPSs/COMPSs with persistent storage
With the objective of enabling transparent access to persistent storage backend, we have defined a storage interface [13]. The goal is to enable the access to persisted objects from the programming model, the same way that regular memory objects are accessed. By persisted object we mean either objects stored in data-bases and objects stored in novel devices such as NVRAMs.
The storage interface is composed of two main components: the Storage Object interface (SOI) and the Storage Runtime interface (SRI). The SOI is offered to the developers as part of the programming interface, and the more relevant method is the make_persistent one which allows the developer to define when an object has to be pushed to the storage framework. After invocation of this method, the object will be stored in the persistent storage backend but accessed from the application using the regular access methods. The SRI includes methods that are used by the COMPSs runtime to interoperate with the storage backend. For example, the getLocations method will enable the runtime to exploit the locality of the data by scheduling tasks in the location where the data resides.
The BSC is developing several storage technologies that implement this storage interface, as can be see in figure 4. Hecuba [27] is a set of tools that aims to facilitate programmers the utilization of key-value datastores. Hecuba implements the common interface and translates the accesses to persistent objects into accesses to the database. The current implementation supports both Apache Cassandra [6] and ScyllaDB [46]. While Hecuba supports the mapping of different data types to the back-end data-base, the most representative case is the mapping of Python dictionaries into Cassandra tables.
Another solution that implements the storage interface is dataClay [36], a distributed active object store which enables applications to store and retrieve objects with the same format they have in memory. In addition to storing the objects themselves, dataClay also holds a registry of the classes where the objects belong, including their methods, which are executed within the object store transparently to applications. This feature minimizes the number of data transfers from the data store to the application, thus providing performance improvements. The benefits are multiple: sharing becomes trivial in a distributed computing platform, from the same application or between several applications, implementing producer-consumer schemes; it enables the possibility of using larger memory space than the memory available in the node; etc.
Vi-B Adapting COMPSs for a fog-to-cloud scenario.
To take on the yet-unaddressed challenge of fog-to-cloud and cloud-to-fog offloading, we have extended the COMPSs runtime to, on the one hand manage distribution, parallelism and heterogeneity in the fog resources transparently to the application programmer, and on the other hand to handle data regardless of persistence by supporting a single and unified data model.
The architecture of this programming framework is designed following the OpenFog Reference Architecture (see Figure 5). computing intensive applications started both from the same layer deployed as a microservice and executed in a Docker container (Agent in Figure 6). Such deployments are independent of the behavior of the runtime; containers can be deployed though Kubernetes, Swarm, or any other tool that properly configures the network in order to let agents communicate through a REST interface. Each Agent is independent of the other and can execute the same application code acting as a worker whenever needed. The application is instantiated as a service and listens for execution requests submitted to the REST API. Once the runtime is deployed, the user starts the application passing the appropriate parameters (Start Application in the REST API) and the runtime instruments the code and starts the execution. The application code, in its turn, contains the calls to the methods that the programmer has selected to become a task. The Access Processor (AP) is the component of the runtime that receives calls from the instrumented code and builds a dependency graph. When all the accesses of a task have been registered, the AP sends it to the Task Scheduling component for execution. The list of resources available to the runtime can be configured at execution time; such resource can be local computing devices on the agent that starts the application or remote in another agent. In the latter case the runtime interacts with a remote agent using the same operation of the REST interface. On the other hand, it needs to provide a means to get information on the finished tasks, and eventually get their results. One agent can execute multiple applications at the same time; therefore, computing resources are bound to one single execution. The runtime monitors the amount of available resources and the usage done by the application at the scheduling time. Additionally, the set of available resources can be updated through the REST API.
COMPSs leverages the functionalities offered. Whenever a task is submitted to a remote agent, the COMPSs runtime persists any not-yet-persisted object passed in as a parameter of the task. Likewise, any value produced during a task execution is stored on dataClay so any other agent – including the one running the main code – can use that value for succeeding executions. BSC is developing this scenario in the European Funded project mf2c222.
It is important to remark that despite the changes in the COMPSs runtime architecture and behavior, the COMPSs syntax remains the same, and applications that previously were running on a more traditional computing scenario can run in the fog-to-cloud scenario.
Vi-C Closing the loop: going beyond
With the developments in the mf2C project, we have made advances towards including sensors and instruments in the computing platform that we are considering. However, there are still many aspects to be extended and considered in order to be able to deal with platforms as the ACPs considered by the BDEC2. One of the aspects that are reflected in section V
is new user-friendly interfaces. Recently we have been working on the runtime extension and to some extent on the expansion of the current programming interface, but new user interfaces, probably more graphical, should be explored to fill the gap with the considered users’ profiles.
Another aspect still to be researched is how to better integrate the compute workflows with the data flows. On one hand, there are data processes that are currently performed by the application researchers that should be automated and integrated with the compute workflows. On the other hand, the compute workflows should be able to better integrate metadata, and enable data traceability which is of high importance for the application stakeholders.
While we have been able to do progress in the integration of traditional HPC compute workloads with data analytics ones with PyCOMPSs, further tight integration is necessary. Similarly to the integration of machine learning with other workloads, with PyCOMPSs we have been working on the integration with Tensorflow or PyTorch, which is quite straightforward given the use of Python. Our group is also doing developments on a distributed computing library (dislib333) for machine learning which is internally parallelized with PyCOMPSs. The goal is to provide a simple and easy to use interface, which enables the use of optimized algorithms that run in parallel.
Regarding the integration of PyCOMPSs/COMPSs with persistent storage, the support to store data on databases designed to support HDA applications allows scientists to check partial results before their long-lasting simulations end the execution. This checking enables to detect in early stages if the simulation is not behaving as expected and should be steered to get interesting results or to improve the execution performance. Our vision is that the workflow environment should provide scientists with tools or mechanism that facilitates this steering.
Finally, a very important piece of all the system is the runtime. We aim at do research in dynamic strategies that enable the runtime to explore the solution space in a smarter way. Instead of running the workflows following traditional brute force approaches, the runtime will use machine learning techniques to make intelligent decisions on the execution of the workflows, and learning from previous executions, to come up with better application results while reducing the execution time and energy consumption. We also aim at doing theoretical research in workflow modelling and in the definition of data-computing metrics. Once we have some workflow modelling methodologies defined, this will be used to give feedback on the solutions designed and in subsequent stages to drive runtime decisions. The data-computing metrics will be used to compute the trade-off between the cost of storing data generated or re-computing them. While storing results has been since now the followed approach, the project will propose new unconventional strategies to reduce cost of storage and optimize computing.
Vii Conclusions
The paper has presented our vision and roadmap to develop novel environments and tools to support scientific communities and to enable a huge increase in productivity of the scientific workflows. There are multiple variables to consider: scientific applications are becoming more and more complex; the amount of data is huge and of diverse nature, and this issue is getting more complex; the number of software components and tools available to the scientists is large and difficult to be used by them; the complexity and diversity of computing, storage and other infrastructures resources is also increasing.
All these aspects prevent the scientist to focus on the actual problem to be solved, and contributes to the time and resources wasted by the scientific communities struggling with them, delaying the progress of science. Better methodologies for the development of scientific workflows will have impact, first by boosting new discoveries that will be possible in faster ways, and new scientific applications that are not possible now will become a fact. This has a potential direct social impact thanks to these scientific advances. Also, and non-negligible, scientific communities are using large computing and storage infrastructures in inefficient ways, and this has an economic and energy cost.
With this novel workflow environments and tools, scientists will be able to deal with workflows that involve at the same time HPC applications, machine learning and big data components. The new methodologies developed by the project will enable a more efficient usage of the infrastructures, with a reduction in the required cost and energy, thus reducing the carbon footprint since the energy consumed by HPC and other infrastructures is not negligible.

Playboy Plus presents Sun Soaked: spend the day in the sun with your playful and absolutely beautiful, Playboy Muse of the Month, Elena Generi. On location in beautiful Mexico with the photographer, Cassandra Keyes, Elena is having a blast cooling off with a garden hose and a giant pink flamingo. Eager to get the party started, Elena gets wet from head to toe — and trust us when we say, you won’t be able to take your eyes off her. “When I’m not creating with ceramics or mixed media art, I’m gardening or appreciating the Earth in other ways,” she says thoughtfully. “The perfect first date would be something simple,” begins Elena, “Like going on a hike in nature — maybe we would press flowers or listen to music and have a picnic by a waterfall!” Totally in her element, Elena first encountered Playboy in college at her friend’s house. “He let me keep the magazine because he saw that it brought me joy and a feeling of empowerment,” she says smiling. “I’d thumb through the pages occasionally, but then my other friends enjoyed it so much that I passed it on to them,” she says. “I had received the message that I needed from it and was ready to go forth on my own modeling journey, so when I was given [this] opportunity, I did not hesitate to say, ‘yes, please!’” If you’re loving everything there is to know about the gorgeous, Elena Generi.Interview by: Harry Wagner- 12/2002
Editor's Note: The following is the next of our new feature focusing on the talented people who run shops specializing in Toyota 4x4 components. 4x4Wire's Harry Wagner spoke with Inchworm owner Jim Christiansen after he recently returned from Moab, Utah.
4x4Wire- How did you get involved in four wheeling?
Christiansen- It seemed to me like a natural progression from the BMX, go carts, and motorcycles that I enjoyed growing up. I had a friend in high school with a Toyota pickup and I helped him work on it. I guess that had something to do with it also. My friend's truck had a blown motor and he purchased a rolled truck for the motor. I helped him put the motor in and got to keep the rest of the truck, which now belongs to my brother and is still on the trails.
4x4Wire- What was your first trail rig?
Christiansen- I had a '77 2WD Datsun pickup that I did plenty of off-roading in! Datsun didn't come out with a 4x4 model until 1979. I found a burned '80 4x4 and put the body from my 2WD on that. I drove that for quite a while before I bought my Suzuki SJ-410 [now owned by Darren Seabass Sinkey] in 1991 with a 3.8L Buick motor in it. It was too tall and skinny, so I put the body on a shortened Toyota frame and used the Toyota running gear. I eventually built my own frame for it in 1997.
4x4Wire- What prompted you to make the transition from enthusiast to businessman?
Christiansen- I wanted a dual transfer case adapter for my Samurai but I could not afford one. This was about ten years ago when there were not many options out there and adapters cost over $1000. I was taking classes at Diablo Valley College to become a machinist and I had a lot of equipment at my disposal. So I ended up taking some measurements and making my own adapter for my rig and my brother's truck. My friends saw how well the dual cases worked and wanted their own adapters. Since I had already done the tooling and measurements it was not hard to make more. Things just took off from there.
4x4Wire- So how long has your shop been in business then?
Christiansen- Inchworm has officially been in business for three years, but I have been making adapters since 1995.
4x4Wire- You mentioned taking machinist classes, what sort of background do you have?
Christiansen- I am a certified machinist and I also have business experience from a previous venture that I started with my father.
4x4Wire- How many people work for you?
Christiansen- I don't have any full time employees, so in that sense Inchworm is a one man show. When customers call or e-mail the shop, I am the one who answers all of their questions and takes care of the orders. I do, however, get a lot of support from my family and friends on a part time basis. My wife, Kate, does the accounting for the shop. My brother, Kevin, manages the website and makes all of our stickers. My other brother, Rob, helps to maintain our computer systems and is a great salesman out on the trail. My good friends Clint Borel and Matt Stoffregen help to get the product put together and read to ship when we get busy.
4x4Wire- How do you find the time to do it all?
Christiansen- I focus on taking care of the customers first and foremost. I find that my customers tend to do all of the advertising for me. I've never paid for publicity, my business has always come from word of mouth.
4x4Wire- Where do you see the four wheeling heading in the future?
Christiansen- I see a wider gap forming between recreational wheelers and extreme competitors. Though the competitions started with normal trail rigs, they hardly resemble them these days. Most people wheel their daily drivers and I hope that people who are first exposed to our hobby by competitions realize that you don't need a tube buggy to hit the trail and have fun.
4x4Wire- How do you think rockcrawling competitions have affected four wheeling?
Christiansen- Competitions have resulted in a lot of new technology, some of which is applicable to the rest of us. It has provided a lot of publicity to our hobby too.
4x4Wire- Would you sponsor a competitor?
Christiansen- I actually help out a couple of local guys already. Doug Kennedy had an Xtra Cab Toyota, but he is working on a new buggy for new season. Matt Padgett and I went to school together at Diablo Valley College and I help him out when he needs something.
4x4Wire- What about competing yourself?
Christiansen- Unfortunately I do not have time to do everything and in my limited free time my preference is just to relax on the trail with my friends and family.4x4Wire- So you have family that is interested in four wheeling?
Christiansen- My father, two brothers, and five of my cousins are all involved in wheeling. We could have our own club!4x4Wire- Your family is important to you, is there someone in particular whom you admire most?
Christiansen- It would have to be my father. If it were not for him, I would not have the knowledge or even the interest in manufacturing and four wheeling. He deserves a lot of credit for what I have accomplished. My dad always provided me the tools and encouragement that I needed while growing up.
4x4Wire- How often do you get to wheel?
Christiansen- I wheeled a lot in the summer of 2001 before I sold the Suzuki. Business has kept me busy lately, but I've still found time to go to the Rubicon and Moab. I only bought the 4Runner in June and it was stock at the time. I didn't have it trail worthy until August, so I missed a big part of the summer wheeling season.
4x4Wire- What are you driving these days?
Christiansen- I've got a clean 1986 4Runner that I am using for my daily driver for the time being. I aslo have a stock 4WD Toyota pickup for a parts truck that I will be using for a daily driver soon. The 4Runner has Inchworm dual cases, of course, plus crossover steering, a Budbuilt crossmember, rear springs in the front, and Chevy's in the rear. I just took it out to Moab and it worked very well for me. The 4Runner also has 35 BFG Mud Terrains and our new TIG welded nerf bars. It will be sporting electric lockers front and rear as soon as I have time to install them.
4x4Wire- You mentioned your nerf bars, are there any other new product ideas you would like to share with us?
Christiansen- Inchworm is looking into producing a lot more tube products in the future; items such as front and rear bumpers and cage kits. I am interested in making more Tacoma products too, but I have not started development on anything like that at this time, they are still in the idea stage.
4x4Wire- Do you do fabrication and/or installation work in addition to selling products?
Christiansen- I build dual transfer cases and do all kinds of installs. I can do fabrication work and I don't want to rule it out, but typically I am busy trying to fill orders and bring new products to the market. Lets just say that there are other things that I would rather focus my time on.
4x4Wire- What other product lines do you carry, or do you just sell Inchworm products?
Christiansen- I stock BudBuilt crossmembers, OTT steering arms, and Advance Adapters transfer case gears. I can get nearly anything for your truck that you want though. I'm also starting to carry more differential parts like ARB Air Lockers, Detroit Lockers, spools, and Precision Gears.Emulsified Norwegian Cod Liver Oil

“I think it is a lost art on this campus,” Ryeon Wedley, a junior majoring in film and vice president of Phi Beta Sigma, said. “The last time there was a step show here at UT it was 2009. I think this is an opportunity for the teams competing to show the people around campus what stepping is all about.”
Step is a percussive dance that incorporates the entire body to create unique beats and movements through a mixture of stomps, claps and spoken word. In the late 1960s, historically black fraternities and sororities began embracing stepping on college campuses.
Wedley said that the event also will give African-American Greek letter organizations a chance to show potential members an exciting way to get involved.
“I think it will breathe new life into UT and the organizations competing,” Wedley said.
Five teams will compete for a $1,500 prize. In addition, there will be four exhibition step teams from the Toledo area showing off their skills.
Greg Smith, a UT student who passed away last semester, also will be honored at the event.
Pre-sale tickets for the event are available at Ask Rocky in the Student Union.

Regenerate the coral reef systems with Coral Gardeners
We wanted to share with you a little bit about Coral Gardeners. Titouan Bernicot, founder & CEO, grew up on Ahe, a small atoll in the North of the Tuamotu islands, where his parents had a pearl farm. When he was 3 years old, he moved with his family to Moorea, the sister Island of Tahiti (French Polynesiain) in the Pacific Ocean. Since he can remember he spend most of his time in the water, freediving and surfing, developing a deep connection with the ocean.
France is the only country in the world with coral reefs in all three oceans. 8 French communities are home to 10% of coral reefs in the world (Coral Guardian). In French Polynesia, almost all the 118 islands have coral coastal marine ecosystems (with the exception of the Marquesas Islands). These islands are not located in the famous coral triangle, but they gather nearly 200 species of corals, 1200 species of fishes and 1000 species of crustaceans. Coral reefs are, along with tropical forests, the richest and most productive ecosystems on the planet. Due to climate change the ocean water temperatures are rising and consequently (between many other negative factors) the coral reefs are bleaching.
The origins
The project was born on April-28, 2017, in Moorea. The team is composed by young surfers and fishermen nicknamed the children of the Ocean. By seeing the degradation of reefs in recent years, they have decided to take action. Young and motivated, launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2017, supported by former swimming world champion Florent Manaudou. Once achieved the objective, had press coverage in many media outlets, such as Le Parisien, Elle magazine, Le Figaro, Paris Match, amongst others. Thanks to these funds, they were able to embark on the adventure, and Coral Gardeners was officially created. Today, counts with more than 20 international volunteers, more than 7000 corals adopted and transplanted into the lagoon, and thousands of supporters, either local students, tourists or young people from all over the world. The team aims to take the project even further and launch a global movement of Coral Gardeners.
The biggest daily challenges
Coral is a unique and complex creature. From the family of jellyfish and anemones (cridarians). It resembles a tiny anemone called a polyp. Barely visible to the naked eye, a polyp builds a calcareous skeleton and lives in a colony. Each polyp in the colony contains millions of algae called zooxanthellae in its cells. These two organisms live in symbiosis. This means that while coral provides protection and nutrients to algae, they provide energy, food and oxygen to the coral. The association of all corals forms coral reefs. True underwater forests, they are home to 25% of the marine biodiversity known to date.
We are increasingly facing coral bleaching events. When the seawater temperature rises, it can upset the symbiosis between the coral polyp and its algae. The algae becomes toxic for the polyp which therefore expels it. As it is the algae that gives the coral its colour, colonies lose their colours to adopt that of the limestone that makes up the exoskeleton of polyps: corals whiten. If the situation lasts for too many days, as it will be the case more and more often due to global warming, corals die.
The importance of saving the coral reefs
It is estimated that 75% of the world’s coral reef suffer threats from pollution, overfishing and human activities or global warming, and coral reefs coverage has already declined by 30-50% since 1980s. Without proper action, all coral reefs are at risk of disappearing by 2050 with disastrous consequences for marine life. Why are coral reefs so important for our environment?
While covering less than 1% of the oceans, coral reefs host 25% of known marine life (source: IUCN);
Marine plants, including coral’s symbiotic algae, produce up to 70% of the oxygen we breathe (source: National Geographic);
Coral’s are estimated to directly support over 500 million people worldwide (source: IUCN);
Coral absorb CO2, via their association with algae;
With their beautiful submerged landscapes coral reefs generate US$36 billion in tourism every year (source: ZME Science);
Coral reefs provide a protective barrier against storms and erosion (source: IPCC);
Corals have medicinal properties for treatments against diseases such as cancer or AIDS.

Coral Gardeners’ mission
Coral Gardeners was created to save the coral reefs of Moorea, Polynesia and the world. They are raising awareness around the world of the disappearance of coral reefs, restoring damaged areas and working with scientists to improve their coral restoration techniques and by taking action to solve the problems that the reefs are facing. They create hope for coral reefs through education and coral reef restoration.
Raising Awareness – They truly believe that raising awareness is key to build a better future for the oceans, by telling the story of the reef worldwide, through conferences, school lectures, ecotours or social medias, they hope that everyone gets to know the importance of coral reefs.
Reef Resoration – First step is to collect broken pieces of corals and then put them on bamboo stems. They let them one month on the nursery tables before planting them back on the reef. That is the most efficient way to bring new life to the reef.
Science – Their scientists are monitoring the growth of the corals and improving the reef restoration methods and knowledge.
The team from Coral Gardeners is working to educate the world about threats to coral reefs and implementing ways to restore the island’s reef. The group transplants healthy coral fragments onto the reef to rebuild habitats and encourage growth in vulnerable areas. Through Coral Gardeners amazing program Adopt A Coral, you are able to help the conservation by adopting your own coral or a complete coral nursery table, you get to name your coral(s), receive updates and an adoption card, which you can proudly share. Is very simple to make the difference.

What does it mean to represent fireworks? Or, to be more precise, how might we use this question to interpret James McNeill Whistler’s 1875 Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket? (Fig. 1). And, to expand this line of questioning yet further, how may we use this painting to explore a far larger question; namely, what takes place when a spectator encounters a work of art that both provokes an intensely affective response, and yet also clearly references elements of the recognizable contemporary world inhabited by both artist and viewer alike — one in which, in this instance, fireworks figured on a very regular basis?1
The dominant move in art history is to see Whistler’s painting as a proto-abstract piece, one concerned with conveying atmosphere. I use ‘atmosphere’ in a threefold sense: as signifying, in Whistler’s terms, the ‘artistic impression that had been carried away from the scene’ by the artist himself;2 as suggestive of the smoky night air in a pleasure garden on the banks of the Thames; and as descriptive of the distinctive, auratic quality of the work itself — the emotional and aesthetic response provoked by the tone and application of paint. Whistler’s testimony during the 1878 Whistler–Ruskin libel trial (initiated by Whistler, who felt that Ruskin had defamed him and his art in print) constitutes one of his clearest statements concerning his aesthetic priorities. Compared to his ‘Ten O’Clock Lecture’ — an aesthetic manifesto delivered, in sweeping rhapsodic language, at the Prince’s Hall, Piccadilly, on 20 February 1885, and subsequently reprinted — he spoke with precision, albeit, at times, somewhat sardonic and pointed precision.
In the courtroom, Whistler made his formal priorities clear. ‘A nocturne’, he said, ‘is an arrangement of line, form, and colour first’ (Merrill, p. 144). This suggests that he saw a canvas as providing a circumscribed, two-dimensional space on which to try out artistic challenges — ‘a problem that I attempt to solve’ (Merrill, p. 144). The canvas’s flat surface is more than a plane on which to arrange shapes and colours, however: thin washes — often with the canvas texture showing through — also made an impact on the spectator, as did patches of denser, rougher paint, and specks and touches of yet thicker pigment. Plenty of critics, however, even if sympathetic to these formal impulses, saw no point in exhibiting publicly such ‘studio-experiments’, to use Henry James’s term.3
This question of appeal and, by extension, of monetary value, was central to the trial. Asked by Sir John Holker, the Attorney General and counsel for the defendant, what the ‘peculiar beauty’ of the picture might be, Whistler replied that ‘I daresay I could make it clear to any sympathetic painter, but I do not think I could to you, any more than a musician could explain the beauty of a harmony to a person who has no ear’ (Merrill, p. 153). A clear put-down of Holker’s tone-deafness in the matter of art, this also speaks to Whistler’s appeal to the qualities of music: imageless, except for the impact on the imagination — the inward eye — of the listener. His patron, Frederick Leyland, first suggested the applicability of the term ‘nocturne’ to him, and as the painter explained at the trial: ‘By using the word “nocturne” I wished to include an artistic interest alone, divesting the picture of any outside anecdotal interest which might have been otherwise attached to it’ (Merrill, p. 143).
Whistler’s titling was part of his developing battle against the popular preference for pictures that told stories. He was to repudiate the anecdotal particularly forcefully in the ‘Ten O’Clock Lecture’. Rather, he hoped that the spectator might become absorbed in, or be absorbed by, a generalized sense of place, of time of day, or of colour and tonality, with, in this case, the fluidity of paint set off by carefully applied dots of bright pigment. Whistler looked to stimulate an affective response, expecting the painting to spark reactions in the spectator for which an adequate vocabulary might not readily be available — a response registered more somatically than intellectually.4
The term ‘nocturne’ is the clearest indication of Whistler’s own concern with the importance of going beyond surfaces, of regarding the image as a starting point for personal affective response. As has long been pointed out, the use of the word ‘nocturne’ signifies far more than a work depicting night-time. In the sense of a piece of music designed to evoke dreaminess, reverie, and introspection, ‘nocturne’ was an early nineteenth-century coinage, first used by the Irish composer John Field. It was especially associated with the twenty-one pieces for solo piano written by Frédéric Chopin between 1827 and 1846. Free flowing, and using melody in the same way that one might employ vocals in an operatic composition, these works sought to convey and produce emotional depth. Interested in the idea of aesthetic synaesthesia, Whistler experimented with various labels. The two works that he exhibited at the Dudley Gallery in November 1871 were almost certainly Nocturne in Blue and Silver — Chelsea (then titled Harmony in Blue-Green) and Variations in Violet and Green. Away at Leyland’s home, Speke Hall, beginning Symphony in Flesh Colour and Pink: Portrait of Mrs Frances Leyland, he referred to them as ‘harmonies’ in a letter to Walter Greaves.5 He thanked Greaves for sending him a copy of The Times with Tom Taylor’s review of the exhibition, which picked up on the significance of this musical nomenclature:
They are illustrations of the theory […] that painting is so closely akin to music that the colours of the one may and should be used, like the ordered sounds of the other, […] that painting should not aim at expressing dramatic emotions, depicting incidents of history or recording facts of nature, but should be content with moulding our moods and stirring our imaginations, by subtle combinations of colour, through which all that painting has to say to us can be said.6
The mode of interpretation that Whistler implicitly advocates is one that — however ephemeral the subject matter might be — relies on slow looking on the viewer’s part; on spectatorial immersion.7 Such immersion is very different from the type of watching invited by fireworks, when, however much the viewer may be drawn into the moment, the objects of vision are continually moving. Duration of spectatorship is not a matter of personal choice, but choreographed by the display’s organizer. Yet, with the Nocturnes careful observation is not required in order to tease out the associations behind a painting’s component parts, as was customary with many of the narrative-based mid-Victorian canvases that Whistler so despised, reliant on the middle-class viewer deciphering the cultural connotations of furnishing, dress, and gestures. It is primarily directed at the work’s formal properties — composition, colour, tone, and texture — rather than its subject matter. Whistler’s foregrounding of these aspects does not, however, imply that they are ends in themselves; that the spectator is to be concerned with technical recognition and admiration. Indeed, to receive a full impression of the overall effect, one has to stand back from the painting — a quite different mode of occupying spectatorial space.8
If we bring together the type of spectatorship implicitly demanded by the Nocturne in Black and Gold and belonging to the captivating activity of watching fireworks — abstract, beautiful, transient apparitions in the sky — some telling questions emerge. Is Whistler implicitly distancing himself from firework spectatorship, offering a critique of such popular entertainment by emphasizing, via painting, the importance of individual response? Yet how do we account for the individualized associations that may be set in motion for the painting’s viewer? After all, this viewer provides the knowledge that these apparently stationary spots of light traverse the sky, and supplies further elements belonging to such a scene — the fizzes and bangs, the press of crowds, the smells, the other visual attractions — not to mention the cultural familiarity with fireworks derived from other representations, both visual and literary.
Before turning to the full cultural context of Victorian fireworks, let us first consider the painting itself. Whistler’s familiar image shows several cascades of golden sparks falling down the green-black night sky above the Cremorne Pleasure Gardens, with a few red, pink, and, more startlingly, lime-green fiery outliers descending somewhat closer to the assumed spectator. On the left-hand side of the picture, almost three-quarters of the way down the canvas, a more intensely incendiary band of light breaks through a mass of darkness: this is the silver-gilt oyster shell-covered grotto, or the platform from which the Cremorne fireworks were set off, with a large, near-black tree on its left-hand side. The air is thick with the hazy grey smoke from exploding pyrotechnics. In the foreground are a few diaphanous female figures; they seem disconnected from one another, linked only by sharing the space with the fireworks display. If we follow their gaze upwards, to the rocket’s apex, our eye then travels down again, along with the sparks, to the other bottom point of an elongated triangle — one occupied by the painter himself, in the form of his trademark butterfly signature, here rendered in decidedly Japanese fashion.
Or we could describe the Falling Rocket another way, in terms of paint and brushwork on canvas. Whistler’s Nocturnes were painted on a dark background; according to his studio assistant (and artist in his own right), Walter Greaves, ‘For the fireworks there was a lead ground.’9 The dominant colours were applied in large, sweeping brushstrokes, creating bands of colour, and Whistler adjusted the tone as needed, then turned to the remaining colours ready for use on his palette. Although the subject matter may be kinetic — light in motion — as the catalogue entry to the major 1994–95 Tate Gallery Whistler exhibition explains, the effects of the soaring and then slowly descending rocket ‘are achieved not through spattering paint on the canvas, but by carefully painting in each separate fleck of colour’.10 In The World in Paint (2004) — which bears the Falling Rocket on its cover — David Peters Corbett considers the broad implications of this technique. Whistler’s visible brush strokes and patches of colour, he maintains, affirm the materiality of paint, and hence the ‘sensuous character of experience’.11 Their flagrant assertion of difference from verbal language offers a form of modernity in dialogue with the foggy, urban atmospherics of the London in which he was painting, and in which his works were shown. We are tacitly exhorted to be aware of the tools of mediation, which — like language that calls attention to its own rhetorical moves — underscore the gap between external world and thing represented. But, unlike verbal language, we are invited to see the texture, the colours, the compositional properties as having affective power in their own right, irrespective of the subject matter.
Corbett, at this point, makes a crucial turn, pointing out that rather than critiquing the conditions of the industrial metropolis, Whistler beautifies them. In Whistler’s own terms, these conditions are, courtesy of the transforming power of Nature (which Corbett reads as responsible for the softening effects of evening mist, rather than attributing these to smoke from polluting chimneys), the source ‘of brilliant tones and delicate tints, suggestions of future harmonies’ (p. 207). Whistler, says Corbett,
affirms the capacity of the visual as a means of engaging with modern experience. […] The irrationality and material opacity of paint detached from mimesis and frankly declared on the surface of the painting serve, in Whistler’s work, as a metaphor for the perceived opacity and resistance to understanding of modernity, of modern experience itself. But it is also a means through which that threatening otherness can be ameliorated. (p. 125)
Such a claim, however, through considering the material properties of medium alone, puts to one side the nature of the subject of representation, simply generalizing it as ‘modern experience’. Fireworks are transitory, rapidly moving artefacts that when set off, as here, in multiples, create intersecting patterns and traces that may entertain the eye. But outside of representation, a firework display does not allow this eye to rest on a stable point of light. In failing to consider this, Corbett places fireworks on a par with the other lights that shine out steadily in Whistler’s crepuscular scenes, like the lit windows of the Chelsea shore in Nocturne: Blue and Silver — Chelsea (1871), or the lights coming from the small industrial establishments in Lambeth in Nocturne: Grey and Gold — Westminster Bridge (1871–72), or the single riding lamp in a boat in Nocturne: Grey and Silver (1873–75) (Fig. 2), or the delicate illuminations of Cremorne Gardens themselves in Nocturne: Blue and Silver — Cremorne Lights (1872) (Fig. 3). In each of these cases, the lights are doubled and elongated, reflected in the limpid waters of the Thames. Corbett thus, to be sure, detaches the pyrotechnic displays from the systems of mass leisure and celebration in which they played a commercial role, but in so doing he diminishes the difference between Black and Gold and the other Nocturnes. The other paintings show scenes in which the viewer, had they been present, could have engaged in contemplation of reflections and colours that would have slowly changed in depth and shade with waning or growing daylight, but were nonetheless available for introspective reverie. By contrast, Black and Gold holds a moment still, serving something up for immersive spectatorship in a way completely unavailable to a visitor to Cremorne Gardens.

For to paint fireworks is to attempt something rather different from representing a lamp in a window. For a start, the artist engages with many of the same challenges facing those who depict other forms of rapidly moving light that stand out against darkness, like the branches of a lightning flash, or the streak of light left by a shooting star tackled by Jean-François Millet in Starry Night (c. 1850–65) (Fig. 4). However, fireworks are distinct from celestial light shows since they are human-made, and, as Laura Anne Kalba has so ably shown, have their own cultural and material histories. Moreover, in aesthetic theory, fireworks occupy an interestingly unstable position. In Chapter 4 of Theodor Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory (Ästhetische Theorie, 1970), the Frankfurt School philosopher turns to the representation of fireworks in his discussion of art, beauty, and what he calls ‘the apparition, the heavenly vision’, with which a true work of art stands in close relation, since such a work ‘rises above human beings and is carried beyond their intentions and the world of things’. If an artwork does not display such immanence, such magical quintessence, that it transcends its own materiality, the conditions of its making, and its subject matter, it is no more than a husk. ‘The phenomenon of fireworks’, Adorno continues, ‘is prototypical for artworks, though because of its fleetingness and status as empty entertainment it has scarcely been acknowledged by theoretical consideration.’ This is, incidentally, a manifestation of mass culture, and indeed of mass spectatorship, that Adorno is atypically prepared to celebrate, because he regards fireworks as temporary, detached from material earthly existence:
They appear empirically yet are liberated from the burden of the empirical, which is the obligation of duration; they are a sign from heaven yet artifactual, an ominous warning, a script that flashes up, vanishes, and indeed cannot be read for its meaning.12
This, with typical Adornian allusiveness, is an equally brief flashing up of the artistic problematic faced both by Rembrandt (Belshazzar’s Feast, c. 1636–38) and John Martin (Belshazzar’s Feast, 1820) (Fig. 5): how to convey, visually, the supernatural flaring light and mysteriously appearing, doom-laden letters, written by a divine hand, that prophetically appear on Belshazzar’s wall in the Book of Daniel, foreseeing his imminent death. These can only be interpreted by Daniel, the seer. By extension, the story of Daniel’s superior interpretive ability may also be an allegory for those who can, indeed, read meaning into fireworks — not, however, as representing anything, but as standing for a principle of pure aesthetics, a principle which is simultaneously tied to the empirical (as in the pigment, brushstrokes, and forms of a painting) and floats free of it. ‘It is not through a higher perfection’, writes Adorno, ‘that artworks separate from the fallibly existent but rather by becoming actual, like fireworks, incandescently in an expressive appearance’ (p. 107).
As Rei Terada usefully explains, the importance of fireworks to Adorno, like another of his examples, ‘the water fountains of the seventeenth century’ (Adorno, p. 106), is that they rely on ‘nonconceptual sensuous appeal’.13 This principle may be extended to the appeal of purely abstract art, and clearly has something in common with Whistler’s ‘artistic interest alone’. Yet, to regard fireworks solely in this light limits the possibilities inherent in their spectatorship. Philosopher Joseph Margolis, building on his strong commitment to relativism, an evolved version of pragmatism, and historicism, attacks Adorno’s view of fireworks head on, calling it
preposterous […]. Fireworks are not ‘apparitions’ at all, though they certainly feature transient visual displays; they are not delusive appearances that are or must be confused with the ‘real appearances’ of real things — any more than are lightning strikes. They plainly involve the mastery of a perfectly real technology […] their effects are entirely actual, known, and controlled.14
Just as a firework manufacturer can anticipate the effects of the pyrotechnics that they have constructed, so an artist who ‘works in a deliberate way and is genuinely aware of what he or she is doing’ should have an awareness of the ‘import’ of their work (Margolis, p. 438). (Margolis sidesteps the word ‘meaning’, and hence avoids falling into too much of an intentionalist trap.) Margolis stands back, like Adorno, to consider not so much fireworks, but artworks themselves. More than this, he takes the spectator (of a work of art, or indeed of fireworks) into account. ‘Meanings’ — and here he does use the word, pluralized — are not out there in art and history, ‘waiting to be plucked — latent, independent of our interpretive labors. No. Not at all! Rather, we construct those meanings in a way analogous to constructing works of art themselves’ (Margolis, p. 438). I explore, in what follows, how we negotiate the aesthetic representation of a visual display that can well be taken as an abstract form — a set of moving, coloured lights usually with, by the mid-nineteenth century, no referential properties — yet is also a display inseparable from the developing culture of mass entertainment. Like art in public exhibitions, or engravings in the pictorial press, fireworks are simultaneously consumed communally and by a perceiving individual.
A painting like Nocturne in Black and Gold, at once representational — those scattered gold and red flakes of light are unmistakably fireworks — and achieving its effects through an obliteration of detail and the substitution of carefully calibrated swathes of pigment, throws down particular challenges to our ‘interpretive labors’. This was made abundantly clear by numerous critics who grappled with it, both when first exhibited in 1875 at the Dudley Gallery, and in 1877 at Sir Coutts Lindsay’s new Grosvenor Gallery — highly innovative as an exhibition space.15 In 1875 the Building News sneered that the painting ‘might, if it were come upon unframed and unglazed, be mistaken for the first efforts of an artistic Japanese baby with a blacking-bottle’.16 Punch, in 1877, summed up the reaction of the Nocturne’s detractors: ‘Above, all fog; below, all inky flood; For subject — it had none.’17 Reviewing the Dudley show, Tom Taylor, influential art critic of The Times (and also editor, at the time, of Punch), while acknowledging that ‘what Mr. Whistler calls his nocturnes and symphonies have a real beauty and suggestiveness of their own’, treated them as though they were exercises, studies in colour, rather than finished canvases.18 As Clive Wilmer has discussed, the relationship of incompletion to the artwork’s evaluation was to play a major role in the well-known trial that followed Ruskin’s accusation against the painter that ‘the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the aspect of wilful imposture’, since he dared to charge two hundred guineas for a work in which he had done no more than ‘[fling] a pot of paint in the public’s face’.19 Whistler won his libel case, but received only one farthing in damages — something of a damp squib in financial terms, and a verdict that was to ruin him financially. All the same, the trial itself provided him with an opportunity to articulate his aesthetic doctrines, and to see them publicized.
Even those critics who spoke admiringly of Whistler’s work — Nocturne in Black and Gold was by no means universally reviled — could express particular qualifications. Significantly, William Michael Rossetti, writing of the Dudley show in the Academy, had reservations about the subject matter. As he describes it,
The scene is probably Cremorne Gardens; the heavy rich darkness of the clump of trees to the left, contrasted with the opaque obscurity of the sky, itself enhanced by the falling shower of fire-flakes, is felt and realised with great truth. Straight across the trees, not high above the ground, shoots and fizzes the last and fiercest light of the expiring rocket.
Yet he does not feel able to rate it as highly as a crepuscular Thames view — which now seems a far less remarkable work — the Nocturne in Blue and Gold, No. 3 (now known as Nocturne: Grey and Gold — Westminster Bridge), ‘a chef-d’oeuvre of tone; tinting, solidity, and sentiment too’ (Fig. 6). For with respect to the Nocturne in Black and Gold, ‘its artificial subject-matter places it at a less high level.’20 At the Whistler–Ruskin trial, he again expressed scepticism about the choice of topic: ‘There is no reason why fireworks should not be represented’, he cautiously opined, ‘I have seen them represented before in pictures — but I do not think it is a good subject’ (Merrill, p. 158).
Rossetti, like other reviewers, constructs his meaning — to use Margolis’s terms — in relation to other works of art, whether these be paintings hung alongside Whistler’s, or whether they belong to a far broader body of works stored in his memory, providing norms and expectations and used for comparison. In his hierarchy — one strongly indebted to Ruskinian values — nature trumps the artificial. But I want to consider what it might mean to reinsert this canvas, and two others, not only into a context formed by paintings on gallery walls, but into various other discourses, both literary and visual, that surrounded pyrotechnics themselves.
Other Whistler paintings besides Nocturne in Black and Gold depict fireworks. A startlingly dark canvas (although, by Whistler’s own testimony, deteriorating varnish made it even darker than he had intended), Nocturne: Black and Gold — The Fire Wheel (c. 1872–77) shows a huge blazing Catherine wheel, whirling off sparks at its edges. Depicting a chrysanthemum-like vortex of flame, The Fire Wheel suggests a persistence of vision — the sense that the fiery impressions linger on the retina — that shows a different form of painterly experimentation, representing the physiological effects of fireworks on the viewer. Nocturne: Blue and Gold — Old Battersea Bridge (1872–75) is a painting predominantly in a lighter sea-green shade, suggesting an evening lit by a luminous full moon. Under the tall, dark grey span of the bridge can be seen a thin splatter of descending golden firework sparks and, on the right, the upward and more rapid trajectory of a rising rocket. Here, indeed, we are invited to compare the reflection of sparks with the reflection of lights on the river, the painting creating the illusion that fireworks and lights on the shore are equally static. Only our knowledge that comes from information outside of the painting tells us otherwise.
In all three works we come face-to-face not just with moving lights held in visual suspension, but with the whole history of rockets and other pyrotechnics designed for entertainment and display, and with the occasions and sites of their being launched into dark air — an important part of the cultural context available to contemporary viewers. As I signalled earlier, any consideration of a painting’s spectatorship has to take into account not just the affective atmosphere of the canvas itself, but the associations, however faint, that are set into motion for each individual when faced with the work — something that blurs the edges of what constitutes affective response. As we have seen, Whistler’s titles link the works to practices of reverie and contemplation evoked by the synaesthetic parallel with music. In what follows, however, I want to discuss the implications of spectatorship not so much in relation to individual subjectivity, but in relation to interpretive communities bound by common exposure to fireworks, by shared cultural connotations concerning fireworks (including their visual and literary representations), and by their experiences of visiting public exhibitions of art. The spectator’s body may be stationary, but the mind is not.
Setting matters. In the case of Nocturne in Black and Gold, we might hypothesize some diversity among people who saw the image when it was exhibited in 1875 and 1877. The Dudley Gallery and the Grosvenor Gallery were very different kinds of sites. The Dudley Gallery was situated in the Egyptian Hall, in Piccadilly — almost opposite the Royal Academy — which was the location for many popular entertainments in the mid-nineteenth century, including the Ojibwa whom George Catlin brought to England in the 1840s, Laplanders giving sleigh rides, illusionists, and, at the end of the century, ‘animated photographs’ — as advertising on the hall’s facade called the new medium of film. From 1865 the Dudley Gallery (from 1883, the Dudley Gallery Art Society) held exhibitions there. Though the original aim was to provide a venue for watercolourists, whose work was not admitted to the Royal Academy, watercolour exhibitions alternated with shows of oil paintings. Whistler’s two canvases, hung at the exhibition of works in oil that opened in October 1875, appeared alongside paintings that appealed fair and square to the tastes of the middle-class public. They hence potentially functioned as a very direct provocation: ‘defiantly enigmatical’, the Art Journal’s critic termed them.21 They flanked the painting that held pride of place, George Dunlop Leslie’s Anthylla (much admired by the critics), which showed a young lady sitting by a classical fountain and gazing at flowers in the stream by her feet. The other 447 works included: a very different kind of treatment of the Thames, G. F. Watts’s oil sketch for Found Drowned (c. 1850), depicting, with sentimental realism, a young woman’s body on the bank of the river under Westminster Bridge; idealized portraits, like Edward Fahey’s Lily and Her Butterflies (a much happier young woman standing in a conservatory amid a huge flutter of coloured wings) and Mary Ellen Edwards’s A Golden Hour; genre paintings, from J. W. Waterhouse’s Margaret, Scottish Martyr, ‘bound to a stake on the seashore to be drowned by the approaching tide’,22 to Alfred Dixon’s The Broker’s Man, with the agent — firmly in possession of home and furnishings — trying to make nice to the bewildered children of the house; flower paintings; some examples of French Naturalism, including Lhermitte’s The Cloth-Market, Landerneau, and several representatives of that mid-century genre that one might term ‘animal comedy’, like J. C. Dollman’s How D’Ye Do?, depicting a kitten surprised by a jack-in-the-box, and Briton Rivière’s A Double Entendre, in which a pig winds the rope by which he is being led around a milestone. Faced with this exhibition, it is small wonder that the Athenaeum’s critic — almost certainly Frederic Stephens — writes of Anthylla in words that sum up the whole show: ‘We must not be ungrateful, but we really should next season like to be enchanted by something novel.’ At the same time, while observing that Whistler’s titles, like his two paintings themselves, act on some people ‘like red rags shown to bulls’ — and while noting that these works are, for him, more ‘studies’, or ‘exercises’, than finished pieces — Stephens claims that ‘they are examples of high and precious art, and they illustrate in a sublimated fashion certain peculiarly pictorial qualities of inestimable importance, but of which the English school is prodigiously ignorant’.23
In contrast to the Dudley Gallery, the Grosvenor was from the start largely identified with artists who saw themselves as part of the Aesthetic Movement. Many of them emphasized formal aspects over the narrative appeal of scenes taken from everyday life. While narrative subjects were certainly present, they were, at least initially, frequently drawn from mythology, poetry, and religious subjects (although this was to change with the younger, French-trained artists working under the influence of Naturalism, such as George Clausen and Edward Stott, who exhibited there after the mid-1880s). Many of the initial exhibitors were often engaged with decorative projects that moved beyond painting. Furthermore, the gallery was distinguished by its mode of hanging art, grouping all works by one artist together, yet placing them in individual wall bays so that one could pause and examine each artist’s style as a whole. On the occasion of the Grosvenor’s opening show, for example, Whistler’s eight canvases were placed together, allowing the group to be brought into comparative dialogue with, say, Edward Burne-Jones’s idealized, elongated figures in The Days of Creation, The Mirror of Venus, The Beguiling of Merlin, and some smaller allegorical works; or with Albert Moore’s long vertical panels depicting static, classically draped women against decorative backgrounds (Sapphires, Marigolds, The End of the Story); or with William Holman Hunt’s carefully painted, chromatically brilliant Orientalist/Mediterranean subjects (The After-Glow in Egypt, An Italian Child, On the Plains of Esdraelon, above Nazareth, A Street Scene near Cairo). In this company, Whistler’s work not only seems strikingly different by virtue of a mode of painting that encouraged viewers to pay attention not to the surfaces and decoration of the objects represented, but to the surface of the canvas, and to obscurity, not clarity, of line and shape. It is sharply distinct from these other paintings, moreover, because Whistler places contemporary London at its centre. To be sure, it is a deliberately softened, beautified London, but it is, nonetheless, a London of public space and popular entertainment.
Fireworks were a regular component in London’s recreational landscape. They were commonly set off at commemorations and celebrations — for the end of the Crimean War or the Queen’s Jubilees, for example, and they formed part of regular displays in pleasure gardens like Cremorne or Vauxhall, or the Crystal Palace, on piers during the summer holiday season, and, of course, on Bonfire Day, 5 November, which marked the anniversary of Guy Fawkes’s attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament. This national day of firework ignition provided periodicals with an annual opportunity to run pieces about the history and making of fireworks. Despite the short-lived nature of each pyrotechnic launch, fireworks themselves have a long past. Victorian publications almost always traced them back to thirteenth-century Chinese practices, while also emphasizing military uses of rockets.24 Following the Victorian journalistic fascination with explaining how things are made, a writer for All the Year Round in 1874, for example, visited the ‘dozens of little huts at wide intervals’ that constitute Mr Brock’s firework factory, noted the ‘formidable list of rules’ that are posted to ensure safety, and before going on to give a detailed account of their construction, relished describing components of the fireworks:
Here also are stores of peculiarly fine, thick, and heavy brown paper, hand and machine made from brown rope, and many reams of cartridge and other varieties of white paper; many hundredweight of pins for attaching ‘quickmatch’ to set pieces; barrels of steel and iron-filings and turnings, for producing bright starry coruscations; and chemicals for ‘colouring’ — nitrate of strontia for producing red, nitrate of baryta for green, sulphuret of antimony for white; oxychloride, carbonate and arsenate of copper for blue fires and stars.25
Firework making was also considered a pastime that could be carried out at home, and a number of publications explain that one would just be making smaller, domestic versions of the rockets, crackers, sparklers, golden rain, blue candles, Roman candles, pin wheels, star lights, and ‘saucissons’ that were set off commercially — even though the space of their consumption, and the spectatorship they encouraged, were inevitably very different.26
The Dudley Gallery and Grosvenor Gallery exhibitions seem to have attracted somewhat different picture-viewing audiences in terms of class and aesthetic expectations. Fireworks themselves, however, provided entertainment that crossed class lines. This was an inevitable result of them patterning the sky, visible from very many vantage points, but depictions in the illustrated press also show the assumed heterogeneity of crowds. The Illustrated London News’s 1856 image of fireworks being let off in St James’s Park to celebrate the Crimean War’s conclusion, for example, not only displays a melange of social types closely crammed together — as evidenced by the range of headwear — but also people standing on balconies in the elegant buildings to the left of the image (Fig. 7). Later in the century, social, generational, and racial diversity is even more carefully indicated in the rapt crowd shown in Edward Brewtnall’s ‘Firework Night at the Crystal Palace’ (Fig. 8), which, even if not necessarily an accurate transcription of the mass of people in front of the artist, is a rendition of how wonder and delight can unite a very heterogeneous body of people.27 If some fictional depictions of firework spectatorship give the impression that they appeal to a very plebeian taste — notorious here is the ‘Io Saturnalia’ chapter of George Gissing’s The Nether World (1889), in which the disdainful narrator recounts how ‘up shoot the rockets, and all the reeking multitude utters a huge “Oh” of idiot admiration’28 — Polish artist Stanislaw Bejchan’s ‘The Fireworks at the Crystal Palace’ from two years later suggests that they also appealed to a more sophisticated spectator. While some of the company in the Crystal Palace dining room clearly found flirtation and conversation more compelling, others are shown spellbound by the exploding fiery flowers in the dark sky outside (Fig. 9).
Fireworks did not solely function as visually bonding entertainment. They were transformed into metaphors on the grounds of their explosiveness and the short duration of their eye-catching flare. Dickens’s writings offer a synoptic vision of these associations at work. Jingle referred disrespectfully to Mr Pickwick as ‘Old Fireworks’ because of his tendency to burst out in fiery temperamental explosions.29 Mr Pecksniff worked on a ‘vast number of mathematical diagrams, of such extraordinary shapes that they looked like designs for fireworks’.30 Mrs Lirriper, overwhelmed by her first visit to Paris, felt ‘as if it was beautiful fireworks being let off in my head’; and, if Dickens’s prose makes it sound as though she was rummaging through her experience to find an adequately sensational metaphor, the more verbally practised David Copperfield observed that ‘conversational phrases are a sort of fireworks, easily let off, and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colours not at all suggested by their original form’.31 Elsewhere, the rapid rise and fall of the skyrocket was used to illustrate the ephemerality of short-term, worldly fame (or notoriety). Count Guido Franceschini in Robert Browning’s twelve-book verse-novel The Ring and the Book (1868–69), an abusive and jealous husband in jail for the murder of his wife and her parents, gives one long, last self-defensive monologue, and then the narrator takes over to begin the concluding book: Of brightness, how it hastes to blend with black!32
In these lines, Browning expertly uses line breaks and caesurae to mimic the rocket’s rise, and the brief moment when it appears to hang suspended before falling to earth, its train of sparks fading, just as fame is not only short-lived in itself, but in our memories.
Such associations would have been readily available both to viewers of Whistler’s paintings and to those who witnessed the nightly display at Cremorne Gardens, directly across the Thames from where he lived between 1866 and 1878 at 2 Lindsey Row (now 96 Cheyne Walk). This pleasure garden came to life at night.33 During the day it seems largely to have been frequented by tradesmen, clerks, shopkeepers, and their families and sweethearts — a relatively respectable location, with carefully tended flower beds and manicured lawns; with displays such as floral fetes and maypole dancing. But once night fell, music, less decorous dancing in the form of gallops and polkas, captivating displays, and visual illusions took the place of these signifiers of English pastoral. At various times, Cremorne’s heterotopic attractions included a Crystal Grotto, a marionette theatre, Japanese jugglers, a Hermit’s Cave, an American bowling saloon, a circus, several theatres, and all manner of other sideshows, including fiery ones: an engraving in the Illustrated London News for 18 September 1858 shows a ‘human Salamander’ — a helmeted man walking through a tunnel of flames (it seems that what appeared to be ordinary clothes were in fact made of asbestos) (Fig. 10).34 As Lynda Nead has written, ‘Cremorne was a mutable social space. To an extent, it gave people what they wanted to find’ (p. 130). Its diverse forms of entertainment bring home how popular leisure was given order not just by place and space, but by the hours of night and day.
As the evening wore on — especially after 10 p.m. — the ambience changed, becoming more rowdy and, at least by reputation, dissolute. As an engraving of Derby Day revellers that appeared in La Ilustración Española y Americana strongly suggests (Fig. 11), Cremorne had well-developed and widely disseminated notoriety as a site where sex workers plied their trade. It is impossible to tell the class and occupation of the women who appear in Nocturne in Black and Gold and other Whistler paintings of the same location, but the lack of clear delineation in their depiction suggests not just anonymity, but a sense of drifting, somewhat shadowy existence. Richard Dorment, writing in the catalogue that accompanied the 1994–95 exhibition of Whistler’s work, explicitly conflated the women who appear in the Nocturne with the fireworks themselves, saying that Whistler ‘depicts those aspects of Cremorne in which the beauty was ephemeral — the fireworks and the sad parade of prostitutes’ (Dorment and Macdonald, p. 133). Even if the elegant women, dressed in pastels and holding their fans with practised coquetry, seen in Cremorne Gardens, No. 2 (1872–77), seem far from ‘sad’ in themselves, the predominant motion is one of languor and purposelessness on the part of women and men alike.35 The colours, dominated by dull greens and tans, similarly lack energy: this is an earthbound lethargy that the fireworks seem to transcend (Fig. 12).
But in Nocturne in Black and Gold women are not the point of an implied gaze in an urban setting. Rather, they themselves appear as gazers, drawn to the celestial spectacle, not just by the explosion of lights in the sky, but by that which no painting of fireworks can show: the whooshes, bangs, and fizzles that accompany a firework display — sounds, of course, that anyone who has been present at such a display can provide for themselves, just as the thick smoky air in the centre part of Whistler’s image is redolent of the distinctive smell of sulphur. Whistler does not put spectatorship at the conspicuous centre of his firework paintings, as Félix Vallotton was to do in his 1901 woodcut Fireworks (Fig. 13). Here, light — presumably from the soaring fireworks — illuminates the faces of the crowd with a harsh glare, showing their mingled expressions of fascination, awe, anticipation, and apprehension. This anatomy of spectatorial physiognomies anticipates news photographer Weegee’s signature habit, in the late 1930s and early 1940s, of turning his Speed Graphic’s flash unit so that it lit up the faces of a crowd absorbed in the shocking scene of a murder or an accident. In Vallotton’s woodcut, the nine dangling tails of one firework, and the swooping trajectory of a rocket in the distant sky, are decoratively subservient to the expressions of the people watching.
But the spectatorship that truly matters in relation to Nocturne in Black and Gold does not involve a depicted audience for fireworks. Indeed, Whistler apparently moved away from inviting us to consider mass spectatorship: not only are the visible watchers transparently spectral, but at some point between 1882 and 1892 he removed two further figures.36 First, as already discussed, there is the viewer of the artwork: implicitly invited to engage their own subjectivity and to enter into a meditative space, where time’s suspension is evoked by the very figuration of moving sparks left hanging in the painted night sky. At the Dudley Gallery, certainly, this sense of personal engagement was further complicated by the combination of dark pigment and the painting’s glaze: the Art Journal’s reviewer remarked that
these dark surfaces are to the glass of the frame what quicksilver is to a mirror, and the visitor standing opposite these pictures is startled to see the reflected figure of himself and others passing and repassing like troubled ghosts in the mysterious gloom of the ‘Nocturnes’. (‘Dudley Gallery Winter Exhibition’, p. 45)
Moreover, the art spectator will almost inevitably engage in associative mental work, bringing in aspects of those shared sets of cultural associations. Or, they could find community in celebrating (or mocking, or puzzling at) the virtuoso effects not of Mr Wells, who mounted the nightly firework shows, but of the painter himself.
The other spectatorial position to be taken into account is, necessarily, that of Whistler, observing the fireworks prior to painting them — notwithstanding his claim that before painting a Nocturne in his studio, he said that ‘I am going to make my mind a blank’.37 Whistler was a frequent visitor to Cremorne Gardens. Whether he made any very rough sketches there himself, as he did, for example, when he went out on the Thames in a boat, or whether he jotted down what he had seen when he returned home, is not apparent: what is known, however, is the extent to which he relied on memory. Memory, too — not just of his immediate surroundings, but of a career spent translating gradations of colour and tone into paint — lies at the heart of the much quoted moment in the Whistler–Ruskin trial, when Attorney General Holker asked:
Did it take you much time to paint the Nocturne in Black and Gold? How soon did you knock it off?
WHISTLER Oh, I ‘knock. (Merrill, p. 247)
This ‘knowledge’ is typically discussed — if it is discussed at all — in technical terms: the habituated coordination of eye and hand; the understanding of the effects that will be achieved by applying diluted oil paint to canvas; the way that a tiny speck of bright yellow paint will draw the eye into the deep sea-green depths of a London night. Or it is taken up in reference to that category of ‘labour’, and Ruskin’s valorization of physical work’s importance. But I want to argue for the materiality and representation of fireworks themselves as establishing further types of ‘knowledge’ — ones that form part of the reserve of images and associations within the memory of artist and spectator alike.
In painting pyrotechnic displays, Whistler would have been drawing on a lifetime of seeing these ephemeral nocturnal shows — in his native America, in France, in London. It is hard to say for sure what we see when we observe a rocket flare and fall, because of the likelihood of its brightness and motion creating a persistence of vision, meaning that we think that we are still seeing something that may in fact have passed. This persistence of vision was solidified in very many earlier depictions of fireworks. Centuries of firework representation — images that circulated through book illustrations and as prints — tended to show the magnificent displays as sustained arcs and streams of fiery light, very similar to the graphic conventions used to display — to hark back to Adorno — the moving waters of a fountain.
This translation of fire into water — this representation of duration — is something that Whistler works to deny in his paintings. He freezes each individual spark: there is little sense of a rocket’s long tail, except in the rising projectile on the right-hand side of Nocturne in Black and Gold, just a succession of fiery droplets, some closely packed and some further apart. This distinguishes his canvases not just from many earlier prints and paintings, but from photography, since only a very fast lens speed is capable of distinguishing the segmented sparks of a firework. By the later nineteenth century, photographic magazines published instructions for how best to photograph firework displays, as well as descriptions of spectacular photographic records of, say, Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee celebrations in Delhi, or the firework displays at the Crystal Palace. Invariably, the light used to take these pictures was ‘available light’ — that is to say, the light of the fireworks themselves. The result is a pattern of connected lines and loops, arches and pillars — an architecture of illumination, even when those who witnessed the displays would have seen constant splutters and flashes and explosions and floating fire.
Yet despite the prevalence of continuous arcs and curves in firework representations, Whistler’s decision to represent singular sparks and scraps of fire is hardly without precedent. Certainly, by any standards, Nocturne in Black and Gold is a remarkably bold, experimental painting for its time. But in celebrating its achievement — its capacity to draw attention to its own materiality and its capacity to evoke, rather than to show — what has been overlooked is its overlap with the decidedly non-experimental within visual culture. Whereas no definitive claim can be made about Whistler’s detailed familiarity with such representations, we can state with confidence that they would have helped constitute the visual literacy of many of his paintings’ original viewers, shaping their understanding of how fireworks looked when on the page, rather than when soaring and fizzling through the night sky. Consider the visual material that circulated widely among the middle classes: those news engravings found in such publications as the Illustrated London News and the Graphic. While in terms of print culture critics have fairly remarked on the similarities between the Nocturne: Blue and Gold — Old Battersea Bridge (Fig. 14) and Utagawa Hiroshige’s Fireworks at Ryōgoku Bridge (1858) (Fig. 15), in fact the depiction of fireworks in many news illustrations is far closer to Whistler’s scatter of sparks than is the formalized quarter-sky of stylized, regular pyrotechnics in this Japanese woodcut.38

In an 1845 ILN illustration with an Orientalist setting far closer to home, the ‘Firework Temple at Vauxhall’, we encounter both fiery parabolas and slow cascades of falling sparks (Fig. 16), as we do in the copious illustrations for the commemorative supplement that the same publication brought out in June 1856, showing nationwide celebrations to mark the end of the Crimean War. We have already considered the crowds in the image depicting the St James’s Park display; other engravings represent similar scenes in Victoria Park, Hyde Park, Green Park, Primrose Hill, Phoenix Park in Dublin, on the Chain Pier in Brighton, and a range of other locations. All depict streaks of fire in the sky, fountains of intense light, and, like Whistler’s painting, hosts of separate sparks, some like tadpoles with incendiary trails, some like bursting stars, some like blizzards of blazing snowflakes (Figs. 17, 18).
By reinserting Nocturne in Black and Gold into a matrix of visual representation that goes beyond the walls of the Dudley or Grosvenor galleries, and beyond the categories of painting that both contemporary and subsequent critics have tended to reference, a further understanding of Whistler’s image making emerges. Unarguably, Nocturne is a work that encourages a spectator’s absorption in the act of looking, suspending their own sense of time just as the painter suspends firework sparks in the inky sky. But when one sets this painting alongside news media images of firework displays, and when one also considers the variety of print sources that encouraged the reading of fireworks in both material and allegorical terms, Whistler emerges as an artist whose most controversial work is far more engaged with popular culture than it is customarily taken to be. The world created by the Nocturne — what we might think of as the force field of its associations and affect — encompasses the fireworks found in print illustrations, as well as in the experience of firework displays themselves, just as much as it does the visual impact of rich blue-green-blackness shot through with golden dots of paint.
What we are left with, then, when we ask what it means to represent fireworks — particularly when we approach this question through Whistler’s painting — is the demonstration of the productive tension between a representational work of art with powerful affective properties on the one hand, and the knowledge, history, and prior and concurrent representation of the subject matter of such an artwork — in this case fireworks — on the other. To quote the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo, ‘Reductive or explanatory criticism, be it psychological, sociological, or stylistic, attempts to exorcize the personal character of the work in order to make it a part of the world, thus placing it within a network of transparent relations.’39 Such relations necessarily constitute part of the world of both spectator and artist, but as Vattimo sees it, in his Heideggerean understanding of the power of art, an artwork itself must constitute part of the world of the observer — indeed, create its own world — and thus helps shape the world of its observers. As Elizabeth Robins Pennell and Joseph Pennell — Whistler’s first major biographers — remarked back in 1908:
Whistler made people look at his pictures, until it has become impossible to look at Nature at night without remembering the Nocturnes. He painted the effect that the world at night produced on him, and the great artist, like the great author, moves people, makes them think they see things as he does. (I, 163)
The same may well be said, indeed, of how Whistler’s paintings make one see fireworks.
At the same time, recognizing Whistler’s role as a recorder of a commercial cultural spectacle — of ‘artificial subject matter’, to recall William Michael Rossetti’s term of disdain — should make us cautious about granting too much agency to the affective mood of the canvas taken just on its own terms. For viewing does not take place in isolation, whether we consider the comparative environment of a gallery, or the associative practices of a viewer’s mind. For all the experimentalism of Whistler’s application of paint, for all the appeals to a spectator’s feelings that are exerted by the indistinct masses of shade and smoke, he is still depicting a recognizable phenomenon. If inward, even melancholic, reverie is the customary state induced by a musical nocturne, or for that matter by a canvas dominated by deep swathes of indigo and greyish black, the interruptive effect of bright dots of colour — or of fireworks’ associations — disturb this. Nocturne in Black and Gold brings into dialogue the stasis of painterly representation on the one hand, and memories and associations surrounding a lively culture of highly mobile pyrotechnics on the other. Paying attention to this subject matter allows us to use the properties and culture of fireworks themselves to unsettle some of the claims Whistler himself made in relation to this work of art.
Notes
- Laura Anne Kalba’s excellent Color in the Age of Impressionism: Commerce, Technology, and Art (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2017), was published after I had completed the first version of this article. Her fourth chapter, ‘Fireworks: Color, Fantasy, and the Visual Culture of Modern Enchantment’ (pp. 120–47), which includes a section on Whistler’s painting, likewise considers this work in the context of the broader cultural, technological, and — of course — colourful developments and associations in the field of nineteenth-century pyrotechnics. Although our emphases are somewhat different, there is an inevitable overlap in some source material. I wholeheartedly recommend Kalba’s chapter not just for the dialogue that is created by reading it in conjunction with my discussion here, but also for the wealth of research and insight into visual and material culture that it contains.

Alan St Hill Brock, Pyrotechnics: The History and Art of Firework Making (London: O’Connor, 1922), is very valuable for understanding Victorian firework manufacture. For further works, see Chris Philip, A Bibliography of Firework Books: Works on Recreative Fireworks from the Sixteenth to the Twentieth Century (Winchester: Philip and St Paul’s Bibliographies, 1985). Very little change in the type and coloration of fireworks occurred throughout most of the Victorian period. Chlorates — which produced the blues and greens, in addition to the gold and silver — were available from the 1830s onwards. Aluminium (for more metallic colours) became commercially available in 1888, but not seriously used in fireworks until Brock employed it at the Crystal Palace in 1894. [^]

I am extremely grateful to Anne Sullivan and to the anonymous reviewer of this article for their many helpful suggestions that have helped me clarify and develop my ideas about this work, and about the properties of fireworks more broadly.Government decision on employment services likely to cause thousands of redundancies, and cuts to other community services
The ASU calls upon the minister to immediately:
- Audit the likely impact of the decision on the employment of staff
- Determine where the changes to employment services are likely to impact broader delivery of community services
- Establish mechanisms to ensure that staff displaced from services which will be stripped of their contracts have preference of employment in new services.
- Agree to provide additional funds to services that will be forced to cut other programs as a result of having employment services removed.
In the midst of a global economic crisis it is totally unacceptable for a Labor government to be restructuring its services in a way which will make thousands of staff redundant.
Not only will staff be made redundant but in addition the services that are being delivered to the most vulnerable and the increasing number of unemployed are likely to be cut.

Information - Interior equipment
The interior of the car offers car owners a lot of ways to personalize their car. On the other hand, a lot of car owners prefer to keep the original interior of the car salon. It is especially important for owners of antique vehicles and luxury cars, since their cost will reduce because of these transformations. For ordinary cars it is not a big problem.
LED interior lighting is very common when speaking about tuning. Various creative solutions are possible even for coverings. Standard gear lever knob and cups are usually replaced with sports version. The same is about the steering wheel. Often it is replaced with a small and handy one. Sport pedals, which are available in different variants, are also very popular. In any case, you should always use licensed spare parts. The reason is that in the event of an accident there can be problems with insurance. Be careful when using used parts.
Salon equipment also includes belts, door handles, chrome inserts and many other parts. For each of the original parts there is produced a corresponding spare part. Often it is possible to built-in a part that looks differently. Thus, the interior of the car can be changed both slightly or completely. Each car owner decides how far he can go when modifying the car salon. The majority of production cars look great with the original factory interior.

Lockport’s Transit Drive-In Will Host a New Year’s Eve Firework Show and Ball Drop
It won't be the usual New Year's Eve festivities in downtown Buffalo this year but if you're looking for something fun to do for the holiday, there is something fun and safe happening at the Transit Drive-In for the holiday.
According to WIVB, the Transit Drive-In will be hosting a New Year's Eve celebration that features a double-feature movie showing, the ball drop on the big screens, and even a firework show!
“We wanted to have an event where people could celebrate New Year’s Eve and do it in a social distancing, friendly, safe environment,” said Transit Drive-In owner Rock Cohen. “The drive-in has been providing that all summer, all fall and why not do it for New Years?”
The best part about the event is all the proceeds will go to Make-A-Wish WNY.
Tickets for the event will be $50 and the capacity will be 650 cars. You can purchase tickets for the New Year's Eve celebration here.
I know people usually gather together in large groups for New Year's Eve but obviously, that can't happen because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a great event for the holiday that keeps people safe and fireworks in the winter!adam4adam relationship that is homosexual

It is used by investors to determine the level of risk against risk-free investment.
Explanation:
The investors want to balance the risk with the expected return on their investments. The market risk premium is a strategy to evaluate the risk of investing in stocks compared to using guaranteed risk-free assets. More precisely, the market risk premium is the variance between the risk-free rate and the expected return on the market portfolio.
It equals the slope of the security market line (SML), which graphically represents the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), describing risky securities. The market risk premium reflects the required, historical, and expected return rates.
The historical aspect is the same for all the investors as it is based on what really happened in the market. However, the required and expected market premiums tend to vary depending on risk tolerance and investment styles of different investors.
Mathematically, the formula to calculate market risk premium has two representations:
Expected risk of return – Risk-free rate of return = Market risk premium; and
Market rate return – Risk-free rate of return = Market risk premium.
The explanations of the first method of a market risk premium formula calculation include three steps. The first step implies determining the expected rate of return, focusing on the preferences of investors.
The compensation for the additional risk directly depends on their risk enthusiasm. The second step is determining the risk-free rate of return that is the return expected in case investors would take no risk. According to the third step, the market risk premium formula is to be calculated by deducting the risk-free rate from the expected rate of return.
The second method of computing the market premium risk can be easily applied in practice. First, it is necessary to identify the market rate of return based on a benchmark index. The majority of analysts refer to the S&P 500 for collecting and interpreting past performance. Other benchmark indexes are Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and DJIA.
Second, the risk-free rate of return for a particular investor is to be established. Third, the deduction of the risk-free rate of return from the market return will derive the market premium risk formula. The country risk premium (CRP) is another important term that means extra premium or return for investors to compensate for the higher risk in investing in foreign countries compared to the domestic market. The CRP is necessary for estimating additional returns for investors working with other countries.
These calculations help the investors in determining the level of risk against risk-free investment. However, it should be stressed that they do not guarantee a rate of return or any income. While no investment can be totally risk-free, governmental bills and bonds are recognized as fail-proof, and it is unlikely that they would default on financial obligations.
As for the returns on individual stocks, they depend on volatility that is relative to the market and can change significantly. The application of market risk premia aims to increase the potential profit from assets’ risk premium via a range of financial instruments. The investors generally use risk assessments, including the market risk premium, as part of a complete investment strategy.Danish Design Pure Tiara Collection Ladies Watch IV62Q1277

FIGHTING FIREBUG – Wild Man of Borneo Attacked Firefighters and Police with Ring of Fire
GERMANTOWN, MD. – The Wild Man of Borneo – Montgomery County Police report that a Wildman threw a temper tantrum, starting a fire in a home, attacked firefighters and police with pots, pans, and burning debris. Showing restraint which appeared to be far beyond what they should have displayed, police took desperate measures to capture the bozo instead of dropping him with well-placed rounds from their service weapons.
Montgomery County Police report that on Thursday, October 11, 2018, at approximately 5:33 p.m., 5th District officers were dispatched to a three-story townhouse in the 22000 block of Fair Garden Lane in Clarksburg for the report of a violent male suspect “destroying” the house.
Just as the caller to 9-1-1 was hanging up, the Emergency Communications Center call-taker could hear a smoke alarm going off in the background, but couldn’t confirm details of a fire, other than it was originating in the kitchen. Fire and Rescue personnel were also dispatched to the residence.
Upon arrival, the complainant who was outside the residence confirmed that her boyfriend was still inside and had likely been drinking before becoming destructive and starting a fire in the kitchen of the residence.
Firefighters and one 5th District officer made entry into the first floor and were in the process of advancing the hose line to the first-floor kitchen when they encountered the suspect. He refused to leave and began throwing pots and hot/burnt debris at the firefighters and officer..
The stove was on fire with the fire extending to surrounding cabinets. Firefighters were able to begin extinguishing the fire before retreating from the residence. (By protocol, in any incidents in which there is violence, weapons involvement, barricade etc., firefighters will wait for police to secure the scene. They make every effort to attempt to create a safe environment for those in close proximity to the fire.).
The officers developed a plan that involved the use of protective shields and the possible use of a Taser when approaching the man, a third time. The plan succeeded in protecting the officers from the thrown debris and the Taser was effectively deployed, preventing the male and officers from additional injury.
The suspect violently resisted officers’ attempts to handcuff him and remove him from the home as the fire grew more intense. One of the officers used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire on the stove, with flames then reaching three feet. The front and rear doors were opened to help dissipate the pervasive smoke. After the suspect was in handcuffs, firefighters assisted the officers in removing the suspect from the home, and then fully extinguished the fire.
The suspect, a 48-year-old resident of the house, was transported with non-life-threatening injuries, to include smoke inhalation, by Fire and Rescue personnel to an area hospital for emergency evaluation.
Ten officers who responded to the incident were transported to Holy Cross Hospital in Germantown for treatment of smoke inhalation and later released. The department thanks all the emergency room staff who provided excellent services to the officers.
Fire Marshals are conducting an investigation. Their investigation has determined the fire cause was incendiary (Arson), with fire damage about $2,000 total to structure and contents.
Charges are currently pending from both police and the fire marshals. The suspect’s name cannot be released until he has been charged.

The questioner says: What is the ruling on wiping over footwraps (also referred to as foot clothes, bandages, bindings, etc.)?
Answer:
What is meant by footwraps (lafaa’if) is pieces of cloths that are wrapped around the feet to keep them warm; he wraps a piece of cloth around his feet upto the heels, such that it looks like he’s wearing khuffs or socks. This (i.e. footwraps) takes the same ruling as socks. If he wraps them around his feet and they keep the feet warm, they take the same ruling as socks; in that it’s permissible for him to wipe over them; and this was the stance chosen by Sheikhul Islam, may Allah have mercy on him; because at the end of the day, both serve the same purpose; whether a person wraps a cloth over his feet, or wears manufactured socks, the purpose is the same; to keep the feet warm.

I tried many trainers and many sports, and I was often disappointed by results. With Paulius everything is different – only if I come to training do I start smiling and the results are just excellent. Paulius not only balanced my trainings, but also created a nutrition plan, which helped me to make my muscles more visible. I lost twelve kilograms and now I am so happy every time I look in the mirror.

During workouts Paulius helps to use all of your effort, and that makes you closer to the desired objectives. When training with a coach I realized how many exercises I was doing incorrectly, I noticed that when I started exercising correctly I became much stronger. Three months with Paulius brought much greater results that exercising alone for whole year.
I started exercising with Paulius, with the ultimate goal – relax after office work and “lose my sides”. When exercising together, that became such a pleasant habit, that after half a year of sports I feel young, beautiful and flexible again. One more pros – my household began eating much healthier, though no less tasty. My whole family had problems with overweight, but eating by using Paulius’ tips is a pleasure. Although it is only I who exercise with Paulius, all of my family have benefits of that – we all lost weight and are healthier.
I came to the gym in order to strengthen my body and have nice abs, while using all of my effort. I started to enjoy my body, because after half a year of working together I receive envious comments about my improving body shape, and now I have six squares instead of my flat belly!Very excited!

Today I’m going to revisit Schoensee in my mind and memory. This was one of my very most favourite sites to have visited, because the street and foundations of the this village have actually been preserved all this time! It’s not a museum or a preserved heritage site. It simply IS. It still is. And this is remarkable for an abandoned village in the East Reserve.
I won’t show pictures of the foundations again — I’ll just post the link below. Instead, I’ll take you on a little tour through Schoensee’s cemetery, and dip into a bit of the village’s history as recorded in the Grunthal History book.
Okay, here’s where the Grunthal History book (published 1974) comes in. LOOK at the pic below!
Yes — that’s the very same headstone. Now, back in the day, all the Mennonite men were called by their first two initials. (And their wives had that very same name, just with “Mrs.” in front.) So, I wonder if maybe everyone who read this at the time nodded their head and thought, “Ah yes, A.D. Friesen. I know him well.” But I do not know who this was. There’s a clue below…
So. A Friesen from Altona. I wonder… did the Friesen printing empire have its roots in Schoensee?
Now, from here, we can piece together a bit of the break-up story of Schoensee.

Samuel Kosgei, a combat medic for the U.S. Army’s World Class Athlete Program, performed lifesaving care on a civilian while shopping at a Walmart in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with his family, Sept. 18.
“I heard a child screaming,” said Kosgei. “I told my wife to keep the kids where she was and ran over to the aisle where I found an older woman lying on the ground. She was not breathing so I told the other woman standing there to dial 911 while I cleared the area and assessed the situation.”
Kosgei gave the woman CPR and she started to breathe again. Once she was fully conscious, Kosgei escorted the upset child to his wife and kids, who helped calm him down.
“After she was awake, the ambulance did not take long,” said Kosgei. “I waited with the woman and her daughter until the first responders got there.”
Kosgei, a former WCAP marathon runner, checked in with the paramedics, then let the daughter give the first responders the woman’s information.
The WCAP staff and Soldier-athletes did not know about Kosgei’s lifesaving efforts until a week later when it came up in a casual conversation.
“Kosgei is extremely humble, and I did not hear about this until his supervisor submitted him for an award,” said WCAP Commander Cpt. Bryce Livingston. “I was shocked to find out, but not surprised, because that is just the kind of person Sgt. Kosgei is. He is a leader, and I could always count on him to get tasks done.”
Kosgei mentioned that his training as an Army medic prepared him for the situation.
“I am proud to be a medic and that applies 24/7,” said Kosgei. “I have the skills and responsibility to help others, whether they are a Soldier or a civilian. I am glad I was there to help.”
Kosgei, a two-time Marine Corps Marathon championship, joined WCAP in 2017 as a marathon runner. He was training to make the U.S. Olympic Marathon team and made it to the 2020 Summer Olympics trials in February.
“I was at mile 21 and I felt chest pain but I kept pushing,” said Kosgei. “Then at mile 23 my vision blurred and I tried to stay on the road but I collapsed.”
An ambulance transported Kosgei to the hospital where they ran tests on his heart and luckily found no damage.
“It was scary but I’m glad I am alive,” said Kosgei “That situation made me think I could be a medic for WCAP. I knew they were in need of one and I would be happy doing that.”
WCAP’s commander said that Kosgei has made a positive impact on the program as a medic especially, when COVID-19 fist hit.
“His actions say a lot about him,” said Sgt. David Stowasser, senior medic at WCAP, about Kosgei’s role as a medic in WCAP and his response to the woman in need.
Stowasser recommended Kosgei for an Army Commendation Medal to properly recognize his actions.
Although Kosgei did not know the names of the woman and her family, he said he continues to pray for them and her health.

Sometimes, taking legal action is the only way to resolve a dispute. The good news is, while civil litigation can be intimidating or seem over the top, filing a claim in no way means one will end up battling things out in court.
All civil cases start with the plaintiff filing a complaint with the court. From there, the complaint is served to the defendant. The defendant must then be given time to answer.
After the initial filing process, there is a discovery period. This is where both sides share information. There are several stages to the discovery phase. How it all works out in the end will depend on the issue being addressed in one’s case.
When all parties have the needed information, a civil case can go one of two ways: settlement or litigation. The goal, in most cases, it to reach an agreement through negotiations. This is often the best route for all involved parties, as it generally takes less time and money than it would if the matter is taken to trial. However, there are times when settlement negotiations go round and round and accomplish very little. Litigation may be the only option at that point.
If a case goes to trial, both parties will present their side of the matter to the court. When case presentation is complete, a judge or jury will then get to decide how the issue should be resolved. There is no set timeline for how long litigation should take. Every case is different.
When Massachusetts residents are dealing with legal problems that they cannot resolve on their own, it is okay for them to seek assistance, but not from just anyone. Who they have on their side matters. An experienced civil litigation attorney will work diligently to reach a resolution that best benefits the client — regardless if getting to that point is achieved through negotiations or litigation.2021-07-03

She reframes the experiences of women as central to society and draws attention to their successes and pains. In doing so, she presents women as natural beings, affording them equal dignity and complexity as with men, which is all the more significant in a highly patriarchal Nigerian society.
Isiuwe plays with the ability to convey messages in minimalistic tones and examines how intentionality fosters self and social identity. Working with oil, acrylic and watercolour, she depicts swiftly rendered freehand linear figures that evoke emotions and embrace the power of solitude. Here, solitude represents freedom and introspection.
Isiuwe’s practice interprets the meditative act of metabolizing pain and releasing turbulent emotions. The linear form of her work is a study of the body structure — its movement and language. Viewers are invited to engage with the emotion expressed and insert personal interpretations. Her works have been featured in exhibitions across Nigeria and internationally.How To Download Visual Studio 2015 for Offline Install
I don’t mind online installers. They’re convenient but if your installing a multi-gigabyte application, you don’t want to reinstall it this way. Visual Studio 2015 is one of those apps.
This, in my humble opinion, is the best software developer tool out there. If it had PHP, Ruby, and FTP/SSH, I could uminstall Eclipse. (To clarify, there is PHP available for VS but it’s a commercial product and the free Eclipse version is just as good and free. Did I mention that it was free?)
There used to be an option on the Microsoft site to download a VS ISO, but it seems to be unavailable now. You can still download the installation files (not the ISO) by running the online installer with a command line option.
First, download the installer. Then open a cmd.exe prompt as administrator. Then run the installer as follows:
vs_community_ENU /layout
You will then be prompted for a download path, then the long download will proceed.
This will download the core features of Visual Studio and you’ll still need to go online to download all of the features you might need.
Burano Lace in Venice
History of Burano Lace
The history of Burano Lace is lost in the misty nights on the lagoons of legend and poetry.
The legends about the birth of this art have one thing in common: the sea. They are simple fairy tales, inspired by the life of fishermen and the wonders of the sea and of course, by love.
One story tells of a young man in love who was fishing off the island of Burano, in the lagoon of Venice, when his boat was surrounded by a group of mermaids who began to sing a melody so poignant that the young fisherman was bewitched and about to throw himself into the sea to follow them, only his love managed to stop him.
When the mermaids realized that the fisherman’s love was stronger than their magic, they came out of the water and gave him a sign of their deep respect: a delicate moss embroidery. The fisherman took the gift and brought it to his beloved, who loved it and made a lace copy, giving birth to the tradition of Burano Lace.
Beyond the legend, lace was widespread in Venice at least since the fifteenth century, when the Dogaressa Dandola Malipiero founded her first real school.
In the following century, Venice became one of the world centers of this craft, guided by noble women who provided space in their palaces for embroidery laboratories and schools.
In the 16th century, specialized publishers printed and distributed embroidery manuals.
The activity of lace making was then extended to hospitals, hospices and all those institutes, most of them directed by the religious, which offered hospitality to young people, who learned the trade and paid the expenses.
In the seventeenth century there were very important centers of lace production: the Hospice for young people of Giudecca and the convent of the nuns of San Zaccaria.
The production was largely controlled by the members of the merchants’ guild who ordered and collected the finished products.
Then the production of Venetian lace, both needle and spindle, experienced a major crisis in the second half of the seventeenth century due to the intensification of competition from French manufacturers, structured in a much more modern and productive way, where many Venetian lacemakers were employed.
The Serenissima government tried in various ways to defend this important craft sector, prohibiting the expatriation of lace stores and granting privileges to local manufacturers, but nothing could stop an inevitable decline, so much so that in Venice itself, embroiderers ended up imitating French stitching.
Towards the end of the XVIIIth century and throughout the XIXth century, lace almost disappeared from clothing.
After centuries when lace represented an important resource for the whole lagoon area, during the long period of decadence between the XIX and the XX century when Venice lived in the shadows, the art of the lace gradually disappeared from the islands.
It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the art of embroidery flourished again, especially thanks to the love and commitment of Countess Adriana Marcello, who defended the school and the experience of a great teacher, Cencia Scarpariola, authentic guardian of the secular technical secrets.
Oriane’s Opinion
In the 16th century the lace makers of Burano invented the stitch that made this lace so famous: “The Punta in aria” Literally “the point in the air”.
It is a needlepoint that, by playing with transparency and relief, allows for the creation of both figurative motifs borrowed from nature (plants, animals), and more abstract or geometric shapes.
The lacemakers work on a kind of small short bolster, equipped with a wooden cylinder, placed on their knees: the “tombolo”.
It is on this support that they pin the motif’s design.
Angel's opinion
Be careful, a lot of cheap lace is sold in Burano too!
To see the best, and to discover the work of the real Burano lacemakers, go and visit the “museo del Merletto“, piazza Baldassare Galuppi, 187, Burano.

The master craftsmen make lace in the traditional way; an art passed down from generation to generation as a family heirloom. A small museum upstairs displays antique lace pieces and collections of 16th and 17th century wedding dresses. Today the workshop combines ancient tradition with modernity by creating linens and tapestries for very large hotels around the world, and of course for Venetian palaces.
Items start at 60 euros, Piazza Baldassare Galuppi, 205, Burano Open daily from 9:30 am to 6 pm

Hi there. The wiki is no more. It was replaced by official IT content, and there's no good way to sync with Collabsuite. Although I hear they have something from a third party, I don't use it. Thanks.

Hi Jay. Sorry, but this wiki was for employees only, and the content has been deprecated.
Thanks, I appreciate the feedback.
It sure sucks that Oracle employees are enjoying an internal solution
while us paying Oracle customers are left without one.
🙁
Do you know why it was deprecated? Was an alternative solution published
anywhere?
Is this what I'm looking for maybe?
Jay
Not sure exactly what you mean by solution, but I don't think we have one officially.
I started the wiki in July 2007, right when the iPhone debuted, to collect tips/settings on how to connect to email, etc. At the time, there were dozens of iPhone users internally, not thousands.
After the 3G iPhone came out, our IT published the same content, and I took down my wiki b/c it fractured the information and was extra cost to maintain for our team.
Sorry to disappoint.
Sorry, I was specifically looking for how to get working ical files out of Oracle Calendar so users can subscribe from Google, sundbird, etc. Some posts indicated there was a solution on the internal Oracle wiki for this, so that's what I was after.
I'll move forward with ocal2ical code on google
Cheers!
Ah, got it. If there was solution on the wiki, it would have been what you can find out on the 'tubes 🙂 We don't hold back secret stuff that's not for customers.

Footwear Leather Guide
Hard Yakka leathers are carefully selected for their suitability in industrial safety footwear. The softness and absorbency of leather assists in the control of temperature for feet, an important factor in comfort within an industrial environment. Leather has the ability to breathe through numerous small pores, allowing perspiration to diffuse, while at the same time restricting the entry of fluids, including water.
Leather also provides a significant benefit by trapping air between the fibres and becoming a thermal insulator. This characteristic is a barrier to external heat or cold damp and greatly assists in raising the level of comfort for the wearer. Another important feature of leather is its flexibility and ‘give’ as well as the capacity to stretch either in wear or by insertion of devices inside the boot or shoe. Hard Yakka leathers have been selected because of their softness and pliable surface.
One of the most important materials used in Hard Yakka footwear is the upper leather
FULL-GRAIN LEATHER
is considered amongst the best quality leather you can buy. Hard Yakka full-grain leather is made using premium cow hides, which is one of the most breathable leathers you can wear.
KIP LEATHER
is soft and supple cow hide. It is stronger, smoother and more durable than other types of leathers. Kip Leather tends to be lighter in weight as compared to other leathers.
NUBUCK LEATHER
is made from full-grain cattle hides that have been sanded or buffed on the grain side to give a slight texture (short fibres) producing a velvet-like surface.
Hard Yakka Nubuck is carefully selected from the thick side of cattle hides ensuring our boots meet 2.2mm thickness requirements for durability.
SUEDE LEATHER
is made from the underside of cattle hides. Splits from thick cow leather have a woollen finish due to the nature of its fibre.
As suede does not include the tough exterior skin layer, it is less durable but softer than standard full-grain leather.
RAMBLER LEATHER
is created by applying a pigmented finish to the surface of the leather. The process is completed by embossing or printing a grain pattern onto the surface.

In fact, the short life of my little comic is a quite accurate miniature depiction of my own life: several moments of greatness and tons of love involved, people who think I'm worth the while and my own little corner of the universe. On the other hand, there's some wasted potential, many mistakes in judgement and a feeling of inadequacy.
The comic has not given me tons of money, but it has given me some; it doesn't have a hundred thousand daily readers but it does have ten thousand three times a week. It's not the greatest comic in the world, but it's the best comic I can make.
And I'm quite glad with it all. That's not to say I'm satisfied, but I'm glad. I mean, I have a body of work! I've created the comic strip I dreamed of my whole life, in a different language than my own no less, where I can express myself and my views and that some people like. Will it be big, will it take the world by storm, will it make me rich? I don't know, but as long as it makes mehappy, I'll be here.

Today's blog post is going to be a haul as you could probably have guessed from the title.
Now I have always said to myself that I would never do a haul video, purely because I don't want to sound as if I'm boasting. Sometimes I feel haul videos can come across that way for example I spent "X" amount of money on this and "X" amount of money on that. That's just my own view on them I realise that may not be the intention but there you go...(digging yourself a hole Eimear haha)
So the first item I picked up was this e.l.f 32 piece palette. This is my first e.l.f purchase so naturally I'm very excited! I have been reading reviews about e.l.f products for a long time on Nina's blog. She is another Irish blogger/vlogger who is a fellow bargain hunter!
When I saw this beauty in Tk Maxx for only €6.99 I had to pick it up!
The next set of products I picked up are all from Catrice. My mam rang me to say that the pharmacy down the road from where we live had a sale on cosmetics. Selected products from Essence and Catrice were reduced to half price! This was around the 20th of August I think so I'm not sure if the offer is still on in the selected pharmacies. The first few products I picked up were eyeshadows. You have to excuse the packaging, they were riddled with sellotape and half price stickers haha!

280 Heidi Plum

130 Sitting On A Volcano

I love the cute little names these eyeshadows have! I think eventually when I make myself a magnetic palette I will depot these eyeshadows and put them into that, just to save space.I misplaced my receipt but I'm almost certain these eyeshadows were €1.40 each, they were half price anyway, absolute bargain! I can't exactly remember how much the quad was either as soon as I find out I'll stick in the price!
I'm not a huge fan of blusher I usually like to play up my eyes with some colour and then add some bronzer to my cheeks. I like the main focus to be on my eyes :) So my next purchase is for my kit! I picked up these two gorgeous blushes. The coral shade will be lovely for summer, oh if I had of spotted it sooner! These blushes were half price too I think I could have paid €1.40 for these aswel! If not they were definitely under €2 anyway.
Defining Duo Blush
030 Pink Grapefruit Shake
Defining Duo Blush
020 Peach Sorbet
So back to Tk Maxx with my next purchase. I actually bought these the same day as the e.l.f 32 piece palette. I've never heard of this brand before but when I saw the price I figured it was worth giving them a shot! I had seen these lashes sold separately in Tk Maxx before €5.99 each but when I was in there recently I saw they had a pack of four for €12.99. Absolute no brainer there so I picked them up! On the price tag it said they retail at €59.50, shocking! I haven't tried the lashes yet but they look like they are good quality lashes, cant wait to use them on my next night out!

I got three eyeshadows in refill form. Soon they wont be selling the eyeshadows in the circle pans anymore so they are having a sale on the last few. I already have a 20 circle palette and that is why I picked up the eyeshadows in refill form just so I could pop the eyeshadows in there when my other ones ran out. As I said Inglot are scrapping the circle pan palette system so these eyeshadows were on sale at €2.50 each!
AMC Shine 05
D.S 504
Pearl 426
Inglot Duraline
The last item I had been meaning to pick up in Inglot for a long time and that is Duraline. This basically will turn any powder to a liquid so any eyeshadow you have now can be transformed to a liner. I also own the Inglot Gel Eyeliner, the duraline will be perfect to make that more fluid as it can dry out easily. This set me back €8, I used my Inglot MUA card.
And that brings my haul to an end! I hope this was helpful and maybe you got a few ideas :)
I'll do reviews on the products after I have had a good run through of them too! So far I am very very impressed with the e.l.f 32 piece palette to say the least!
Hope you all had a lovely day and I'll chat to you again soon :)

great haul hunny! :)

Southeast Asia: An opportunity to leapfrog HFCs
As the economies of Southeast Asia continue their rapid development, demand for HVAC&R is set to increase. While this presents market opportunities for HVAC&R firms, it also heralds environmental challenges. Manufacturers of natural refrigerant-based technology, therefore, have an opportunity to make the business case for leapfrogging HFCs by moving directly from HCFCs to natural refrigerants.
Conference participants will discuss some of the challenges in adopting this technology, including technician training and the need to raise awareness of the upcoming HFC phasedown.
The conference programme is available online at atmo.org/Asia2018/Programme.
Interested parties can register until the day of the conference here: atmo.org/Asia2018/Register.

- Published: August 23, 2012
Revenues in the Village general fund budget have dropped 11 percent overall compared to a year ago this time, according to Village Finance Director Sharon Potter at Council’s Aug. 6 meeting.
Potter presented Council with a State of the Budget report following the end of half of the Village’s 2012 fiscal year. The general fund, which funds most human services in the village including public safety, is generally considered a barometer of the fiscal health of a municipality.
The total general fund budget is about $3 million.
The budget summary can be found online at; click on Aug. 6 Council meeting.
In a phone interview this week, Village Manager Laura Curliss stated that she’s relieved the general fund decline is not larger.
“On the good side, it’s not that much compared to what some other muncipalities have experienced,” she said. “I’m happy it’s not 30 percent. This is workable. We can manage.”
The largest factor in the revenue drop this year is a decline in revenues from the state. Total state shared taxes declined by about 45 percent, or $124,384 this year compared to the first six months of 2011. The drop includes the loss of the state estate tax and a decline in local government funds, according to Potter. State revenues account for about 10.6 percent of all general fund revenues in 2012, compared to 17 percent of general fund revenues last year, Potter stated in an email.
The decline in revenues also included a drop in local tax receipts, according to Potter. Total local tax revenues dropped by 2.5 percent, or $28,676, compared to the same period in 2011. So far this year, the Village has collected $1,141,301 in income tax, which according to the report, is on target at 51 percent of estimated receipts at the halfway point.
That decrease is primarily due to a drop of 7 percent, or $46,679, in income tax receipts collected this year. In an email following the meeting, Potter stated that the decline is linked to revenues from the Village’s top 25 income tax producers (businesses) rather than individual income taxes. Potter, on the advice of Village Law Director John Chambers, stated she cannot identify the sources of the tax decline. So far this year, the Village has collected 47 percent of estimated local income tax for this year.
During the same period, real estate tax revenues increased 4 percent, or $18,698.
Initial estimates are that total local taxes should remain about the same this year as last, though income taxes are down $450,000 from last year, a drop attributable to an unusual one-time payment from a local company in 2011. While Potter and Chambers said they could not reveal the identity of the company, the increase corresponds with the sale of YSI Incorporated to ITT last year, which resulted in one-time windfalls for some employees of the company.
Revenues produced by fines and permits have held steady this year and last at about 2 percent of the general fund, according to Potter’s email.
Overall, the general fund has accumulated $1,423,124 this year, compared to $1,608,582 in 2011. With expenditures added in, the current general fund balance shows a net reduction of $28,787 this year compared to last.
Enterprise funds vary
The health of the Village enterprise funds, which fund utilities and are replenished by user fees, show a varied story during the first six months of 2012, according to Potter’s report. While the electric fund maintains a healthy balance of about $2 million, revenues so far this year have decreased by about $101,694, a drop likely attributable to the mild winter months, according to Potter’s report. Expenditures over the same period have increased by $245,576, which includes an additional $129,000 spent on tree trimming this year, along with an 8.6 percent increase in salaries and benefits, mainly attributable to health insurance costs. Overall, the electric fund shows a net loss of $204,356 for the year.
In contrast, revenues in the water fund increased by 21 percent, or $52,275, compared to last year, but that figure does not yet include increased usage over the hot summer months, Potter reported. Total expenditures in the water fund decreased by $5,474 over the first six months. Overall, the water fund saw a net increase this year of $48,251 compared to the same period last year.
The sewer fund revenue decreased by about 45 percent, or $290,000 compared to last year, although the bulk of that variance is due to grant and loan funding received in 2011 for the upgrade of the now-completed upgrade of the wastewater treatment plant, according to the report. Overall, the sewer fund balance has a net increase of $23,220 for the year to date.
The solid waste fund saw increased revenues of about 19 percent, although expenditures also increased, and the balance of the first half of 2012 shows a decrease of $7,903, according to Potter’s report, which states that the Village will request that Rumpke do an audit on local fees.
The total Village budget for the first six months of 2012 compared to last shows a decrease of $14,511, according to the report.Crashserver Posted December 23, 2018 Hi everyone, Nice to see such a community still alive after all those years, I played doom when it came out made some maps, played on lan a lot (serial cable first...) and still have doom or and brutal close In case I need some satisfying relaxing. Anyway, I'd like to share a video we made loosely based on e2m2's soundtrack using a live coding technique. Obviously In this video we had some prepared stuff and then went improv, both sound and visuals. The original track has more depth and is very enjoyable but we started with the idea and finished the recording in 3 hour spawn, so be forgiving :) - we didn't go full pitch bend or drum fills like in the original, still we had fun doing it. After 25 years, I love the mood of most of doom's tracks and am planning to do more tracks, maybe next time live at a concert. Anyways I wanted to share this with you, have a nice day!

Visual Lure was recently contracted by the City of Des Peres’ Department of Parks & Recreation to design a new 10 year anniversary logo for The Lodge Des Peres. The Lodge is an indoor and outdoor aquatic facility with a fitness center, gymnasium and meeting rooms.
The Lodge provided us with the Parks & Rec logo, and The Lodge logo as seen below. During our discovery stage, we found the Des Peres crest, also show below to the right of the other two logos. The Department requested that we include some of the elements in those logos into a couple of our proposed designs. Below, you can see how we incorporated some of those components into our initial options. In the circular logo below, we used the Des Peres crest shape for the anniversary shield and in the bottom right logo we used the tree from the Parks & Rec logo along with the Lodge illustration.
Check back soon to see which logo they select, and in the meantime, check out their website at.

4 CommentsLABAND THE MANby Sean O'Toole / 09.02.2015
Let’s get the pyrotechnics and platitudes out the way first, also the exhibition of adjectives doing the high jump. Felix Laband, the ingénue Maritzburg metalhead turned dark magus of local leftfield electronics, is due to release his long-awaited new album. Titled Deaf Safari and scheduled for release in May, the album confirms Laband’s status as a maverick original. A collage of politically focussed and sometimes off-colour samples – which he recorded off SABC news, stretched in a software programme and recomposed as vocals – overlays tracks marked by their lilting but upbeat tempo. Deaf Safari confirms what is already well known: this porn-loving son of a history professor makes achingly beautiful electronic music.
But it has been a decade since the release of Dark Days Exit, Laband’s last album, during which time zef rap from Parrow, kak rock from Belville and fluorescent-coloured eish electronica from Doornfontein has set a new agenda. Youth, that prized currency of pop, has bypassed the gap-toothed teen from Saint Charles College in Pietermaritzburg. The boy who loved Tolkien and an older girl named Janine Tilley is now a man aged 37. Music, that thing Laband has relentlessly scrutinised and routinely performed throughout his adult life, has become a career.
It’s less a rule than a ritual of pop music, that anyone in it for the long haul has to perform a magic trick, the biggest one of them all being the Lazarus act. News of Laband’s comeback album, as American news pundits would bill it, has certainly been marked by a sense of him having arisen from the dead. But biblical metaphors are bunk in these polarised times. Let’s just quietly agree that Laband, aka DJ Snakehips, who performed a live set on Sunday at the Cape Town Electronic Music Festival, has had a wilderness moment. An extended one.
“For me the wilderness period was about coming to terms with …” The sentence runs dead. Laband, his flatcap pulled sideways, is seated outside Beleza, a café and emporium in Tamboerskloof. His freckled arms are dappled with tattoos, one a study of a man with glasses wearing a hat; it is fringed by a radiance of spikes. He inhales from a Marlboro. “It is often the result of things happening when you’re a little bit too young, and you’re not quite ready for acclaim, being a known person. I was just deeply confused about who I was and what I wanted to do.”
Growing up. It’s a bitch. Your vibes become other people’s irony. “It sounds pretentious, losing grip of being young, getting older, and seeing a new youth running the show.” But it was real for Laband, on a very human level. “There was no longer Rosemary DJing but some kid.” Ag shame. Not really. Sure growing up and losing his face, as Dave Hickey has described the male ageing process, played its part, but there were other things that chased Laband into that black hole. Gossip will fill you in on some, but I’m more interested in his perplexed engagement with the way digital culture reshaped musical appreciation.In some senses, Laband is a minimalist composer, not in the strict sense of emulating heroes like Steve Reich. But his swooning collages of sound are never overcrowded. His 2002 album, 4/4 Down the Stairs, released during the heyday of African Dope and launched at a strip club along Loop Street, was also produced with a minimum of external references. But then Laband started to fall, like we all did at some point, for the offer of gigabyte-sized troves of music stored on someone else’s external drive. Deaf Safari, he says, is the product of a “long five-million song journey” through other people’s music to his own. It was also a journey back into the world.
Similar to 4/4 Down the Stairs, the new album extensively uses found samples. “I woke up with a pain in my body, and the devil threatens me,” moans a male voice at the start of one track from Deaf Safari. Rather than functioning as a gimmicky fragment to kick things off, which is how many of his early influences – Alien Sex Fiend, Godflesh, Ministry, Skinny Puppy did it – the sample operates like a mantra, one that establishes the mood of this very danceable album forged on the dancefloors of Braamfontein.
In 2009, exhausted by the “fucking kak of everyone in Cape Town bitching about one another,” Laband moved to Jo’burg. It was a crucial move for him. “Suddenly, I was plugged into a society where you have a sense of being in South Africa.” He started playing Kitchener’s with his Unsound System. His “offbeat dexterity” found a new mixed-race audience. Instead of the solemnity of Cape Town’s Marvel and Evol, where everyone was the embodiment of the obscure cool parodied by James Murphy, Laband encountered an up-for-it scene. One that appreciated his particular brand of quirk.
“In Jo’burg, when I started playing, my audience became mostly black. It was really exciting. I started using samples that could be construed as racist: ‘The bleks, they’re lazy.’ The way audiences responded was really positive. I sampled Idi Amin: ‘The woman must be in the kitchen.’ People clapped when I was playing. People responded. They started whistling and putting their hands in the air.”
The enthusiastic response helped Laband rethink the role of vocal samples in his music. He realised they were a way to furnish, rather than simply decorate, the angular and sometime arid interior space of electronic music.
“One of the biggest influences of the last five years has been Burial. The way he created those weird garage vocals was really beautiful to me,” muses Laband. “Suddenly I started rethinking how I could use vocal samples by manipulating pitch and tone. You start to make people sing. Suddenly preachers and politicians offered wholesale vocals.”
Aside from his archive of Jacob Zuma speeches, Laband has also sampled members of the AWB. He has also tried to go beyond the obvious, recording “shit that rings true to my own experience,” like an entitled whitey talking to their domestic help.
Warrick Sony of the Kalahari Surfers did the same thing, albeit with two misogynist surfers, on his 1984 album Own Affairs. Sony is the granddaddy of South African electronics. “Without a doubt,” agrees Laband. “His humour is incredible. I truly love that guy.” Sony is important to Laband for the way he paired electronic sounds with political comment. “My biggest problem, and this has been what my wilderness has been about, is that social comment has been lost in music. Music has become very frivolous with the advent of Pop Idols where it is just so blatant that it means nothing. It has been very depressing.”
If Burial offered him the method to reconceptualise his new work, the deeper tones and textures of his evolving sound has been inspired, almost exclusively, by local musicians and artists. Never a house fan, Laband however embraced kwaito early on. He singles out BOP as pioneers. Coming from KwaZulu-Natal, he also understood that kwaito wasn’t simply slowed-down house, as the lazy version of the narrative goes, but deeply infected by maskandi rhythms. Music aside, art and porn are integral to understanding Laband’s eccentric sensibility.
After finishing school, Laband went to study fine art at Durban Technikon (now Durban University of Technology) with fellow Incurables and Fingerhead band member James Beckett. “I wasn’t conceptually ready for that thing at the time. I know first year is crap, it’s back to Bushman art and stuff like that, but I was into Jeff Koons.” Not the kitsch oversized balloons and puppy dogs Koons that now typify this New York artist, but his Made in Heaven series of photos in which Koons is graphically pictured having sex with his wife Ilona Staller. “I was really frustrated. I dropped out after first year.”
Alongside Koons, Laband was also turned on by the work of two graphically talented and deeply frustrated Afrikaners from Cape Town.
“Probably my biggest influence ever was Bitterkomix,” says Laband, who is also due to bring out a book documenting his collage work on paper later this year. “When I was in standard eight I went to the Grahamstown Arts Festival.” He saw satirical print describing in mock-instructional terms various Afrikaans blowjobs. “I wanted so badly to buy this print. My mother wouldn’t give me the money to buy it. I begged her. I started buying their comics and they just blew my fucking mind. The way those guys tackled issues. There was less menacing violence and more of a subconscious sexual insecurity. They are absolutely unapologetic about sexuality.”
Although restrained, that sexuality formed an integral part of Laband’s Sunday-night set at the Cape Town Electronic Music Festival (CTEMF), flashing intermittently on screen like a welcome message during his winding and wandering set. Kicked off with a long series of vocal incantations, the set scaled peaks and dropped into quiet valleys, a bit like Laband’s career to date.
“Playing live has been a real disaster for me,” says Laband. “I didn’t know how to do it from the beginning. All I could do was DJ, and that always felt cheap having been in a band.” As a compromise he has developed a live set that is an amalgam of djing, with original music and impromptu samples mixed in. It works. Unlike Kieran Hebden of Four Tet, who played a more purposefully upbeat live set, interrupted by a heartbeat-like lull near the end, Laband roamed and drifted, mooched and ambled as he searched for a horizon. Beautiful.
Laband was right to call his high school band Incurable. After everything, the junk and the disappointments, he remains a romantic behind the knobs and sliders, a maker of a dark magic. Listen out for a sample from his new album. “I know the devil will never put me down,” wails a preacher. It is Laband telling the story of his journey back to the light.

Source: Company Press ReleaseMinister Pandor takes action at troubled Vaal University of Technology
Minister of higher education Naledi Pandor has had enough of the "serious governance and management challenges" at Vaal University of Technology (VUT), south of Joburg.
She has appointed former Unisa vice-chancellor professor Barney Pityana and National Library CEO professor Rocky Ralebipi-Simela to investigate problems at VUT and advise her "how to restore good governance to the executive management and the council".
The four-campus university has about 22,000 students and is one of the largest technical universities in the country.
Senior management has been writing to the minister since last year to ask for her intervention at the embattled institution.
At the beginning of November, registrar Dan Mokoena and then director in the office of the vice-chancellor, Mpho Diago, asked Pandor to investigate the university and its council.
The university has been accused of failing to implement the recommendations of a forensic report into procurement irregularities - alongside a host of other claims, including the harassment of staff.
The minister was also asked to look at issues undermining the "academic integrity of the university".
In response, Pandor asked the university council to investigate allegations of corruption and death threats.
Diago, part of the senior executive management, claimed in council meetings that he had received death threats when trying to stamp out corruption.
Earlier his year, he left VUT with a R4m settlement after clashing with vice-chancellor professor Gordon Zide.
Pandor has now intervened and written to the council to call for an independent team to investigate, warning that the current circumstances "undermine the effective functioning of the university".
Pityana and Ralebipi-Simela now have 90 days to investigate and report back to Pandor.
They are tasked with looking into financial management and procurement practices, human resources, administration matters and any financial irregularities.
They also need to verify all the forensic reports conducted since 2013. Some of these reports investigate security company tenders and questionable procurement practices.
SowetanLIVE sister publication Times Select reported last week that the council - the highest governing body of the university - is no longer able to hold meetings as it does not have the legally required number of people as required by law.
Nine external members have resigned since October.
In February, the council's deputy chairperson Ulandi Exner wrote a resignation letter to the minister titled: "Allegations of maladministration by the vice-chancellor at the Vaal University of Technology".
Pandor responded to the letter, seen by Times Select: "It is indeed unfortunate that the disturbing developments at the university have [led] to your resignation and that of several other council members."
Pandor met with the VUT council in mid-April to discuss the allegations of corruption and the many resignations.
In her letter about the investigation, she told the council chairperson that she would not approve the "council recovery plan" they submitted to her after the meeting.
"I have perused the plan and I have decided not to approve it, as I deem it insufficient to address the serious governance and management challenges that have arisen at the university," said Pandor.
VUT spokesman Mike Khuboni said senior university management had met on Tuesday but were not able to discuss the investigation as they had other matters on the agenda. The meeting on the independent investigation ordered by Pandor would be held on Wednesday.
"The letter [from Pandor] was tabled for discussion at today's [Tuesday] executive management meeting by the registrar. However, we did not manage to discuss this particular item as we had other items to discuss. The meeting had to be adjourned as the VC [vice-chancellor] and the registrar had to attend another urgent meeting, externally.
"I hope the meeting will resume tomorrow [Wednesday] and then the executive management will make a pronouncement."
Khuboni has previously said the vice-chancellor felt targeted by staff as he has tried to stamp out corruption at the institution and ordered forensic investigations into dysfunctional departments.
Pandor's spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele said: "The minister has been concerned about the reports she has been receiving about VUT for some time. She has had several meetings with all the stakeholders to try to get to the bottom of what was going on, which yielded very few results.
"She has now decided to appoint an independent assessor, professor Barney Pityana, to investigate almost all the allegations the minister has been receiving and advise her on what should be done to bring back VUT to a sound footing."

Most people claim the blessing of a social media post and then leave it at that, assuming that the blessing would come to them on its own, but Fella Makafui has shown us that this is not the case.
Fella Makafui responded to Zionfelix’s post encouraging followers to accept the blessing of financial stability, noting that supporters shouldn’t just post ‘I Receive It’ and expect the gift to appear.
According to Fella Makafui, the only way the blessing you received online would come true is if you work hard for it, but if you claim it and then sit at home waiting for it to happen, you must forget about it.
Fella Makafui is accurate in that no blessing comes without labor, and in order to be financially stable, as stated in the quotation, you must work hard in order to accumulate enough money to be able to serve others as you see fit.

Even for Magoffin County’s sheriffs, a statewide arrest warrant search on an individual arrested in the jurisdiction was difficult.
Law enforcement now has the tools to do state-wide active warrant searches. According to the Kentucky Office of Homeland Security, there are typically around 300,000 outstanding warrants for arrests in the state. However, if you are not in law enforcement, you will not be able to access the e-Warrants database. The log-in page states: “The online services provided by Kentucky’s Office of Homeland Security KYOps e-Warrants are for the exclusive use of authorized personnel. Unauthorized access is prohibited. Usage will be monitored. “
However, you may be able to garner information from the Magoffin County sheriff on arrest warrants. How much information that office will divulge regarding active warrants, arrests, and the most wanted list for Magoffin County is unclear. However, the county sheriff does have a website,, which provides contact information and office hours for the sheriff’s department. The office is open Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 4 PM, plus every other Saturday from 9 AM to Noon.
Magoffin County Sheriff’s Office
PO Box 589

Phone – 606-349-2914, or 606-349-5744
After hours call 606-349-4403 (Magoffin Dispatch)
The Magoffin County Sheriff’s Office also provides an online contact form. The form may be used to ask questions or request information from the sheriff, and nothing indicates that requests for information on warrants are prohibited. Additionally, users may use the form to send in anonymous tips.
Magoffin County does not have a very high crime rate, but there are still several crimes reported each year, and undoubtedly there are also people within the county who have outstanding warrants in their name. On average, a dozen or so crimes are reported to authorities each year. However, violent crimes are rare. From 2004 through 2008, there were only two violent crimes reported in the County. Magoffin County Arrest records associated with those crimes are likely available through the sheriff’s office.Sunsweet D'Noir Prunes Pitted

Medical Journal Armed Forces India, 77 (S-1). S122-S128. ISSN 0377-1237
Abstract
Background: Enhancing the prescribing competency of medical students will help them evaluate each case based on their knowledge. It will help them prescribe independently and they will also be able to empathize and counsel patients effectively. In view of this, it was planned to implement a module on prescribing competency and assess the same for undergraduate medical students. Methods: Faculty training to implement the module was conducted by eminent faculty in this area. After a pre-test, a workshop was conducted for students, wherein they were trained on rational prescribing based on WHO guide to good prescribing followed by small group discussions to identify P (personal) drugs for bronchial asthma and later with comorbidities. Students had to write a prescription and practice communicating the same to a standardized patient. The module was evaluated using a check list (from the WHO guide) and compared with a pre-test. A feedback was provided to the students at the end of the assessment. Results: The scores (median and interquartile values) for prescribing significantly improved from 5 (2, 7) to 25 (24, 27), maximum score being 30. The scores for the communication also increased from 17.5 (14, 24.25) to 53 (52, 55), maximum score being 60, in the post-test. The differences were statistically significant p < 0.01(Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test). The students expressed that their critical thinking and problem solving capabilities had increased and more importantly ‘they felt like a doctor’. Conclusion: More such modules need to be prepared and prescribing competency needs reinforcement during the clinical years of the medical curriculum for its effective implementation communicating the same to a standardized patient. The module was evaluated using a check list (from the WHO guide) and compared with a pre-test. A feedback was provided to the students at the end of the assessment.pre- feasibility report for stone quarry project ,under the policy of mining in india the 'stone' is categorized as 'minor mineral'. the locations of stone quarrying and crushing are permitted at far distance from the human this cost include cost of boring, machine and manpower which is rs. 400 / ton rs. total revenue generated excluding royalty = rs. 40.0 lakh..mobile sand stone crushing plant ,project report of crusher plant project report of crusher plantroject upgrading grinding in mining operations the layout of crushing plants and ancillary equipment and structures is prev: stone crusher price type 400 next: finland ball mill iron ore . crusher stock images in hd and millions of other royalty-free stock photos, .royalty payment from stone crushing plant,paye brahmangaon mining and stone crushers owners act, 2017. building stone comes under 5 tax rate, but question 22: whether gst is stone crusher plant management software; supports royalty calculations, generates gst reports. crushing equipments in indonesia price mmmm stone crusher plant layout .stone crushing plant pictures,picture stone crusher plant chicha pictures stone crushing mine/plant sharpening stone stock photos pictures royalty free download sharpening stone stock stone crusher plant cost in india is reasonable for large and small scale stone .

Collecting Angels
The journey to motherhood felt somewhat impossible at times and it wasn't until after I had my rainbow baby that I realised I hadn't just been losing babies, I had in fact been collecting angels.
After each miscarriage I felt I had lost a small part of myself, in fact it felt like I had completely lost myself most of the time. I lost most of my interests, hobbies and desire to socialise, I became isolated, angry and above all else I hurt. The internal pain and turmoil I felt every single day was suffocating, but I put a smile on my face and carried on because the world simply doesn't accept the level of grief pregnancy loss brings.
"How can you grieve someone you've never met"
Good question, how can you? from the outside looking in grieving pregnancy loss probably seems all a bit unusual, after all you've never met your baby, you've never held them in your arms or had time to bond. The thing is, you have had time to bond, you have had time to dream and you already have hope and dreams for your child. To you your baby is very real, your baby is someone you have bonded with and your baby is part of your life. Just because society doesn't want to recognise, talk about or grieve these babies, it doesn't mean we can't.
Every year as the Wave of Light approaches I feel my anxiety rising, for me the Wave Of Light is a time for me to acknowledge my angel babies and feel that others are acknowledging them too. It brings the sense of unity and understanding, not only to me, but to millions of men and women around the world, that they need. That little flicker of light that we sit and watch beautifully dance allows us to feel connected, it allows us to feel our babies matter and it allows us time to reflect on what was, what could have been and where we are going. This year will be no different despite having my rainbow baby. At 7pm we will light our candles and watch as the flames move around freely bringing a sense of peace to our household that allows us to connect with our thoughts.
It has only been since having our rainbow baby, Rosie, that I sought help in order to manage my own mindset. I needed to do this as I found settling into motherhood extremely challenging, after all my mind had been hardwired that pregnancies end with trauma and sadness. Each day I would wake up and wonder how or what might happen to take Rosie away from us. I then started to feel myself becoming detached from Rosie and in a bid to protect myself I would avoid her as much as possible. After seeking help I was directed to a lovely lady for 'Rewind Therapy' The main aim of this was to deal with the traumatic birth of Rosie but the end results were so much more. It soon became apparent that my need to distance from Rosie was an automatic fear response stemming from the miscarriages, after a lot of talking some meditation and visualisation techniques I was able to shift my thought process. I no longer felt the pain of losing babies, I felt lighter, I felt happier and I realised all this time I had been collecting Angels.
I recognise that this is easy for me to say now because I have my rainbow. One thing I strongly disliked when going through the toughest parts of my journey, were the people telling me from a privileged place that things will be OK. Nobody knows what tomorrow may bring and although I hold every bit of hope for everyone struggling that they get their light at the end of the tunnel, we can't guarantee everyone will. There are no guarantees and that makes this journey all the more difficult, the unknown. Just know that tomorrow when I light my candles, I am lighting an extra one for everyone struggling who's hope is fading because when you can't hold hope any longer please know that there are hundreds, thousands of us holding that hope for you.
Sending all my love to each and every one of you x

Effective Date: 13th day of September, 2021This weekend I dinged 68 with Phrixus. He is currently the highest toon I have ever leveled, with Punitor coming in second at 61. Now generally I tend to spend a lot of my time doing other things than try to level. Play the auction house, grind rep, and get my professions up, but not so much anymore. Since I hit 65 I have been singularly focused on finally having one toon at 70 and with every level the urge to keep playing grows larger. I don’t remember a time since I have started playing this game that I have had this much fun and still been this focused, which presents its own set of problems. You see, the summer festival is going on, and with it some incredible buffs.
The 10% gain experience buff, to me, screams play an alt. I have a level 21 druid that really needs my attention, but alas, no. I played him this weekend and I just could not play him for more than an hour. I even respec’d to Feral, from Resto. I was originally going to try to level straight resto, but that became very boring for me since I did not have a leveling buddy along the way like I did with Protectr.
So I will happily continue my almost obsessive quest to ding 70 and I’m sure once that goal is done I will gladly find a new one. Have you ever been focused on just one goal and let almost everything else fall to the way side?
…hmm that Neatherdrake mount looks kinda nice.
So are you 70 yet?
Not yet, I am hoping to do that by this weekend.
Nice well good luck with that
Solidd is level 64 and I feel the same way. I thought of farming gold, leveling my leatherworking, fishing with my mage or gathering herbs with my priest… but I just can’t stop the drive to 70! 🙂
Oh and definitely go feral for leveling, it’s just so much more fun and quick than going resto.
Sometimes I wish I could forget I have 5 alts and all their professions… and the thought that when I get them all to 80*, I’ll be starting it all over again on the Horde side, for which I already have 2 on their way also.
* it’ll be here before even my main, now a 50, gets to 70, that’s for sure..

A line of willing victims, ready to take on one of the largest haunted attractions in America, wraps around the entire building.
A large 3D-like sign, held by the hands of an oversize devil creature may give even the most veteran of haunted house goers a bit of hesitation. The building itself oozes with a fear factor beyond those found at other haunted attractions.
The Erebus Haunted Attraction, a four-story haunted attraction located in downtown Pontiac, has reached Guinness Book level fame and received nationwide attention since it first opened its doors in 2000.
This ever-so popular haunted house held the Guinness Book World Record for the largest walk through haunted attraction from 2005 to 2009 – setting a very high bar for local and national Halloween entertainment.
This four-story monster of haunted attractions was created by brothers Jim and Edward Terebus – who initially built the venue based on a story of a mad scientist known as Dr. Colbert, who used the space to conduct experiments on anyone who dared to enter.
It’s come a long way since 2000, taking a lot of fearful fans along for the journey – and Pontiac, Michigan is the best location for Erebus as Southeast Michigan is considered the haunted house capital of the world.
To keep their fans guessing, they change things up every year. There are no shortage of special effects to put literal fear into the souls of those brave enough to walk through. Erebus is complete with zombies, monsters and clowns as well as digital effects to startle even the biggest skeptic.
The cast of characters varies – the nightly 100-person staff prepares for their dark night starting in makeup. Local makeup artists create a lot of what you will see in the four-story walk. They bring the cast of Dr. Colbert’s story to life.

The most generic type of hair loss – Androgenic alopecia has over 40% of women and 80% of men developing it as they get older.

Plasma Injections for Alopecia, bald patches, and bald spots
Alopecia is a condition that brings about patchy baldness (bald patches and bald spots) or results in total loss of hair. There is enough research to recommend using the PRP injection to slow the loss of hair and gain some back.
Our blood consists of cells called platelets, which contain several growth factors. The growth effects of the Platelet-Rich-Plasma are as a result of the platelet efficacy on the hair follicles, this helps on how to grow hair faster. We produce Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) through a high-speed centrifuge that separates blood cells and isolates platelets in a small volume of plasma.
Why PRP is Beneficial for hair
Platelets are rich with special growth factors as an epidermal factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. These growth factors are released from the platelets after they come in contact with the coagulation factor. PRP used is considered to be “off-label.”, but showed significant efficacy in alopecia, and hair loss treatment, also to enhance the results of hair transplantation and how to help grow hair faster.
Am I a good candidate for PRP?
The use of Platelet-rich plasma indicates other surgical and medical for many years. Before using PRP, we do not recommend this treatment for clients with autoimmune conditions such as Crohn disease. The immune system attacks the hair follicles through antibody that would be present in the PRP preparation
Microneedling
It is a procedure that makes use of devices that has tiny needles. Microneedling a fast (usually done in the office) and has no downtime. The treatment creates holes in the scalp thereby stimulating your body to begin the natural healing process. Research indicates when the body begins to heal, such a process increases protein production which stimulates regrowth. We use PRP with or without micro-needling to treat topical hair loss effectively. The thin needles penetrate the scalp which allows for greater absorption of any topical products. Microneedling increases the absorption of topical treatments by at least 5 times. It also helps stimulate hair growth and hair growth.
How can PRP and Microneedling work together to treat hair loss?
Combining platelet-rich plasma and unique application forms a strong combination for testing hair loss. It is safe and depends on your body’s regenerative abilities. While Microneedling triggers how your body tissue repair and wound healing response, platelet-rich plasma serves as an internal stimulant that boosts this restoration process and how to grow hair faster. The restoration process involves stimulating dormant follicles that are present in individuals experiencing baldness. With the introduction of growth factors proteins and platelets, you will experience hair growth, while the hair shaft grows thicker and help how to grow faster.

As a result, to maintain the results, we recommend doing PRP injection twice a year. There are several treatments and procedures available. Microneedling is a cost-effective treatment that can give long-lasting results when done periodically. PRP also helps hair to grow faster.

Other treatment
About half of the men at the age of 50 experience different degrees of hair loss. Therefore, we frequently get questions about hair loss treatments. Alopecia and thin hair might hurt self-esteem special at a young age in men and women. Most of the clients seek helps after they tried different home therapies that have not a scientific background. Moreover, different home therapies and wrong myths might interfere with the treatment results. Thus, it is important to discuss all past and current treatments. The less the treatment is the better the compliance is.
Minoxidil Treatment
Minoxidil’s mechanism of action is not fully known. It is important to point out that patients might experience worsening hair loss in the first eight weeks of the treatment. Therefore, it is important to discuss this point with the patients, otherwise, the complaint will be very low
How long do I have to use minoxidil for?
Similar to all chronic diseases, Alopecia, and hair loss treatment is long term. The client needs to keep using Rogaine to maintain its effect
Vitamin and Mineral Supplements
Many patients and dermatologists around the world believe that vitamin and mineral supplements may improve hair loss. According to a study performed in Saudi Arabia, 60% of dermatologists recommend supplements for at least one type of hair loss and also recommend supplements for treatment of telogen effluvium. Moreover, a study performed in the United States revealed that 66% of American dermatologists recommend supplements to their patients. We will review some of the most commonly recommended supplements for hair loss, including zinc, iron, and biotin, and will also address specific supplement containing products randomly evaluated in controlled trials.
Supplements containing zinc will increase hair growth.
Zinc is an important mineral that serves several functions in the hair follicle. Perhaps most importantly, it is an inhibitor of endonucleases, which promote keratinocyte apoptosis during the catagen phase. Acquired zinc deficiency is seen primarily in the elderly and in patients with poor nutrition, including alcoholics. Moreover, in patients with alopecia areata and low serum zinc level, zinc supplementation led to increased hair growth in two-thirds of patients. There is no benefit yet for supplementing zinc in hair loss patients with normal serum levels. Additionally, zinc toxicity can lead to negative side effects including copper and calcium deficiency.
Supplements containing iron will increase hair growth.
Iron deficiency is widespread, with an incidence as high as 12% in pre-menopausal women. The role of iron in hair loss has not yet established. Some studies have suggested a relationship between iron deficiency and hair loss conditions such as telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, and FPHL. In a study of over 5000 French women, premenopausal women with low serum ferritin reported subjectively greater hair loss than women with normal serum ferritin.
Supplements containing biotin will increase hair growth.
Many patients believe that biotin supplementation may promote hair growth and decrease hair loss. Evidence suggests that biotin is most effective for treating hair loss in the setting of biotin deficiency, which causes alopecia, brittle nails, and dermatitis. Studies have also shown that biotin supplementation may be helpful in specific hair loss conditions. There are few disadvantages to using biotin supplementation to treat hair loss given that biotin is a safe, water-soluble vitamin with no reported overdose syndrome and is also relatively inexpensive.
Patented hair-loss supplements will increase hair growth.
Several patented supplements for hair loss randomly investigated in controlled trials funded by companies that produce the supplements. Summary of supplement uses when advising patients on supplement use for the treatment of hair loss; it is important to consider efficacy, safety, and cost. In this case, the benefits of supplementation weighed should be against the cost and side effects.
Natural Topical Treatments
Patients often believe that treating hair topically with natural products from the pantry may decrease hair loss. The use of these products is appealing because they are generally affordable, widely available, and unlikely to cause damage to hair if applied topically. However, very little research has been done to investigate the efficacy of these so-called natural treatments.
Natural topical treatments, such as onion juice and rosemary oil, will increase hair growth.
Two natural products investigated in hair loss are onion juice and rosemary oil. One study examined the use of onion juice for the treatment of alopecia areata. Patients applied onion juice twice a day to the scalp, and after 6 weeks, 20 of 23 patients saw an improvement in hair regrowth. Another randomized control trial compared rosemary oil to minoxidil for the treatment of androgenic alopecia (AGA). Rosemary oil is thought to influence hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair follicles.
Hair Care Practices
Finally, the last category of myths concerns hair care practices. Here we will address the effects of hair washing, brushing, and chemical relaxation, and straightening on hair loss.
Frequent hair washing causes hair loss.
Some patients believe that washing hair less will decrease hair shedding. On average, adults typically lose 100 hairs every day. No research has been done to determine the effect of hair washing on the number of hairs lost per day. This may lead to an association in patients’ minds of hair loss with hair washing. At this time, there is no clinical support for washing the hair as a way to increase hair growth.
Frequent hair brushing increases hair growth.
There is a commonly held belief among patients that brushing contributes to hair growth. There is one small study suggesting that brushing promotes hair growth by promoting the release of growth factors to hair follicles. The results of the study suggest that brushing was associated with hair loss and that less brushing may reduce hair loss.
Chemical and heat straightening causes hair loss; natural hair is healthier.
Many patients believe that “natural is better” when it comes to chemical relaxing and straightening of hair. Despite this belief, straightening is extremely common in the United States, and 80% of African American women use chemical relaxers. Hair straightening changes the texture of hair via rearrangement of hydrogen disulfide bonds of the hair shaft. Also, natural hair subjected to heat or other potentially damaging styles, such as tight braids, can still lead to hair loss.
In Summary
Many patients have different ideas about what contributes to hair loss and how to treat it. Above, we addressed several hair loss myths concerning minoxidil treatment, supplements, natural topical treatments, and hair care practices. In general, when patients are frustrated, using treatments from poorly designed trials or those proven not to show efficacy will lead to more frustration. It is best to guide patients toward treatments with a long track record of efficacy and away from those where little is known scientifically.

January 18, 2016
After months of rumors and a year characterized by recession, high inflation and political gridlock, Joaquim Levy left his position as Finance Minister on 18 December, as Latin America’s largest economy continues to sink deeper into economic crisis. Levy’s tenure had been characterized largely by political infighting and policy standstill as a fragmented Congress and President Dilma Rousseff’s record-low approval ratings hampered the government’s efforts to pass fiscal tightening measures and economic reforms. Former Planning Minister Nelson Barbosa took over as Finance Minister on 21 December, inheriting the job of trying to correct the government’s sinking finances amid the worst economic data in over a decade. The benchmark Ibovespa stock index closed at an over-six-year low following Levy’s departure, as concerns that Barbosa, who is more left-leaning than his predecessor, will shy away from austerity measures. While an economic strategy is not expected to be unveiled for a few weeks, Barbosa has stated that he will continue to push for fiscal tightening, but has signaled that he may take a softer stance than Levy.
On top of the rampant high levels of inflation and shrinking economic output, Brazil is facing a number of challenges at the onset of 2016. The country lost its credit-grade rating late last year and a challenging external environment is limiting potential gains from the external sector. Moreover, political tensions in government came to a head in December when Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Cunha, initiated the process of impeachment against Rousseff. While at this stage impeachment seems unlikely, the process could take months and may push much-needed economic reforms to the backburner. Marcos Casarin, Head of LatAm Macro Services at Oxford Economics, adds:
“For now, our baseline scenario assumes that the ruling party (PT) will exchange political favors for the votes required to block the impeachment proceeding against the president. This process may last until the end of Q2, after which time attention will start to turn to the municipal elections this October. If this is the case then 2016 will be similar to 2015: another year of political uncertainty, fiscal slippage, GDP contraction, above-target inflation, rating downgrade and FX depreciation. What is more, if the economic reforms do not start to be discussed and voted on before the end of the year, the current economic paralysis is likely to extend well into 2017. In that case, GDP could contract for three years in a row – something unprecedented in Brazil’s history.”

Mugeni is one of over 2.5 million refugees who since 2015 have been fleeing war, poverty, torture and rape, and making their way to Europe. Many of them have been using Samos, Lesbos and several other Aegean islands as the gateway, making the short but dangerous crossing from Turkey in ramshackle boats. Initially many were permitted to continue to the Greek mainland and eventually on to Western Europe. However, the 2016 agreement between Turkey and the European Union forced asylum seekers to remain on the islands, turning them into virtual prisons. There they would stay—some of them for years—in abhorrent conditions, living in overcrowded, filthy camps that have been compared to concentration camps.
“The life in the camps is a humiliation, a shame,” said Mugeni. “It is like being in a prison. It is worse than torture. It is hell.”
Mugeni, 38, hails from Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where he lived with his wife and three children until he fled to Samos. His father, a general in the army, was assassinated in 2012, and his brother was also later murdered.
“[My father] had worked with [former president of the DRC] Mobutu, and he was poisoned because he belonged to a tribe different from that of [president at the time] Laurent Kabila,” said Mugeni.
Mugeni’s troubles began on March 22, 2019, when four cartons filled with cash disappeared from the office where he worked. The following morning, as he and his nineteen-year-old brother Christian were shopping for food, a white minibus approached. The driver motioned for Mugeni and Christian to climb in.
“I didn’t hesitate, because he mentioned something about work. When I asked about Christian, he said it was no problem; he could come, too,” said Mugeni. “There were five men sitting inside. After we got on, they closed the door, blocked the windows and drove for five, ten meters. Then it became hell for me and my little brother. They handcuffed me, began to beat us and demanded to know where the money was. What money? I have never stolen anything in my life.”
Mugeni and his brother were taken to a police prison in Kinshasa. The next day the wife of the current president came with the head of the presidential guard.
“She asked me where the money is,” said Mugeni. “She told me, `If the money is not found, you will lose your life. You have nobody who will help you.’ After that the torture became really bad. There was nothing I could do.”
For the next six months, Mugeni and his brother were subjected to horrific beatings.
“Every day we were tortured. It was hell for us. They pulled my front tooth out with pliers. I was beaten and raped by soldiers. Until today I have blood in my stool,” said Mugeni. “One day my brother died. He died at my feet. I still don’t know where he is buried.”
Finally, on October 10, Mugeni and twelve others were taken to the cemetery. I asked him if he knew he was going to die.
“At that point I was already dead,” said Mugeni. “I had no hope of living, with all that I had already experienced.”
“When it was my turn, an officer approached and pulled me aside. `I knew your father in the army,’ he said. `And because of that I’m going to free you. You have to flee. And if you get arrested, you can’t tell them about me. Because that would mean my death, as well.’”
During the night, Mugeni and his family managed to make their way to Brazzaville, the capital and largest city of the Republic of Congo (not to be confused with the DRC), located across the Congo river from Kinshasa.
“The smugglers wanted $30,000 to take all of us to France,” Mugeni said. “But we didn’t have the money. So we paid for me to go to Turkey by myself. That was the last day I saw my wife and children.”
With a fake passport from the Republic of Congo, Mugeni flew to Turkey, and a day later, on November 19, 2019, crossed the Aegean Sea and landed on Samos, where he was staying in the refugee camp.
The living conditions in the camp, which closed in September of 2021 and had a capacity of 650, were appalling. The population reached a high of nearly 8,000 in 2019, and there were problems associated with overcrowding; violence, lack of hygiene, and little access to medical care.
“It was very bad,” said Mugeni. “There is nobody, nobody who can accept to live in conditions like these. I lived in a tent that I built myself. With the 75 Euros that I got every month, I fed myself. The only people that helped us here were the NGO’s. Without them this would be hell for us.”
Tragedy found Mugeni again six months after his arrival in Samos, when he found out that his sister, who had refused to leave the DRC, was shot and killed. Mugeni believes her death is connected to his case.
“She told me before that there were always uniformed men hanging around her house,” he said. “She didn’t know why.”
A few days later Mugeni lost contact with his wife and children. He has not heard from them in over a year now.
Shortly afterwards, he began seeing a psychiatrist.
“It helped me, but after everything I experienced, I cannot forget. And I have no news of my family. Whenever I eat, I wonder if my kids have something to eat. I am suffering inside, but I am always trying to keep my nerves solid.”
Mugeni was angry at the way refugees are treated by the authorities on Samos, and he was baffled by the behavior of some of the local residents.
“The Greeks are super racist. There is no difference between the blacks and the whites. Only the color. We have all have red blood. We all have hearts,” he said. “When we would go to the church, they’d chase us away. They said they’d call the police. In Greece we are worth less than dogs. They think we’re criminals and bandits.”
Mugeni’s asylum case proceeded slowly. On December 18, 2020, he had his interview with the asylum service. Finally, in June, after more than eighteen months on Samos, he received an open card, which meant his geographical restriction to Samos was lifted. He is now on Syros, an island 150 km southeast of Athens, where a friend found him work in a restaurant.
I asked Mugeni about the fact that some Europeans believe refugees come here only to enjoy a higher standard of living.
“I want to send a message to the Europeans who think we are here just for money and work. My financial situation [in the DRC] was very good. I came to Greece, because this is a democracy. I needed international protection. It’s not for work or money. I lived better at home. At home I could support my family and send my kids and siblings to school. Here I am nothing.
“We are not bad people; we are here because we have very serious problems at home. We have a bad government, dishonest leaders who only line their own pockets. We are not here for money.
We don’t just need your financial help. We need your moral help. We are traumatized. We need you to support us.”

backIn this technologically advanced era that we are currently thriving in we are provided with all the opportunities to have access to several components which impact the growth of small businesses, business owners, freelancers, etc. Things such as collaboration, networking, and marketing have been streamlined by the advancements and use of social media, the web, and co-working spaces. A few statistics below highlight the ways in which social media marketing and the use of co-working spaces as a means of networking play a vital role in the growth of ones’ entrepreneurial career:
Social Media Marketing:
Business owners and freelancers have taken advantage of the ongoing influx of users on social media which has turned out to serve as a major platform for individuals and companies looking to market their brand, skills, or services. Statistics show that 84.7% of US companies with 100 employees or more used Facebook for marketing activities in 2015. That share is expected to rise to 85.8% in 2017. Putting this into perspective, companies have learned to rely on social media as a means of gaining exposure and even revenue through social marketing, advertisement, and networking. As of 2016, marketers spend about $8,300,000,000 a year using social media as a means of advertisement, 83% of businesses choose to invest in social media as a way to increase brand exposure, 69% to increase web traffic, and 65% to gain market insights. Though Facebook is highly important to marketers overall, LinkedIn is tops with B2B marketers—41% say it’s the most important network they use. 9% of marketers claim that effective use of social media can be directly linked to revenue.
Networking and Co-Working:
Small business owners and freelancers rely on networking opportunities which are essential in gaining exposure for ones’ skills, brand, and/or company. Traditional networking doesn’t always do the trick, but face-to-face networking is an interaction that has potential for great outcomes. Networking and co-working spaces go hand in hand and sometimes people look over this. Co-working spaces serve as the ultimate networking hub, people are able to have more authentic and easy-flowing conversations which ultimately lead to networking opportunities. Although technology serves as a crucial networking and marketing platform, there is nothing that compares to the power of face-to-face interactions. 77% of individuals’ state that they prefer in-person interactions due to the ability to read body language and facial expressions and 95% of individuals say that in-person interactions are essential for long-term business relationships. Co-working spaces provide the many opportunities to engage in those face-to-face interactions with individuals who may have the same or similar interests as you. 50% of individuals report higher incomes from working in a co-working space and 91% say they have more confidence while interacting with others after their co-working experience.Activities

Two heads are better than one? I have! Not only that I have said that very statement multiple times, because two heads are in fact better than one! Two minds, two ways of thinking, two heads coming together as one.
Or a very famous saying by CS LEWIS
Two heads are better than one, not because either is infallible, but because they are unlikely to go wrong in the same direction.CS. Lewis
Well it’s true! When two people work together on a project, or a plan, they are more likely to solve a problem, than one person doing it alone. There is more strength, more power, more knowledge, more understanding in numbers.
This is what Solomon in the book of Ecclesiastes is talking about in chapter 4 verse 9. The power of two people, verses someone who is alone.
1. The company of two is better than a company of one. In that one can always help the other person, if one falls down, the other can help the other up. This is why it is important to get around other people, especially people of like faith, people of like mind. When one person has a bad season, or a bad moment, pity to that person, because there will be no one to pick them up, but if you have friends, and people in your life you can confide in, the weight of life is a bit lighter.
2. In marriage, the company of two is better than one. In that, the couple can talk to one another, and not be lonely. They can seek for each other’s advice, and look for a way out, together! When one is set out on the mission, the other helps to navigate in return. Pity to a marriage that wants to do things alone! There is no communication there, no understanding, constant fights and struggles. It is better to be on the same page, lifting each other up, then silently tearing each other down.
3. In relationships, two is better than one. Family, sibling, two sides, the company of two, is better than one. In business, two can work up a plan, to better succeed. In workplace two can finish the job quicker. No matter where you apply this principle, the company of two is much better than one! The benefits of two are quite rewarding, and amazing!
4. In friendships, two is better than one. A fair share of both, will keep this friendship alive. But woe to those one- side friendships, that give give give, and when it’s time for them to be lifted, there is no one around. The bible speaks about this too! Choose your friendships carefully! An ungodly company does not understand those principles. Ever heard of unequal yokes? Same principle!
The bible also speaks of supernatural power multiplying when two people come together to complete a project, or even fellowshipping together, and how about spiritually fighting in war.
One can put thousands to flight, and two can put ten thousands to flight! Deuteronomy 32:30 What powerful analogy here! One can fight a good amount of soldiers, while two, coupled up, can irridicate the numbers in moment’s notice. Do you hear me Warriors? It’s about numbers, its all about the POWER of two, or three!!
Two can do a lot more than one can. Two are more powerful, two are stronger, two are unstoppable!
Whether this person is in marriage, relationship or friendship, two are better than one.

FOUR AND A HALF STARS Anthony needs more care than his daughter can provide, and he doesn't understand why.
DRAMA UK #THEFATHER
Anthony Hopkins, Olivia Coleman
The sheer awfulness of dementia is tricky to capture on film. Some are more effective than others; the upcoming SUPERNOVA is one, Michael Hanneke’s astounding AMOUR is another. Yet despite the best, most sincere and heartfelt intentions fall short. Consider STILL ALICE which left audiences observing rather than truly feeling Alice’s pain. Pleasingly, THE FATHER is absolutely in the former group, a sensational account that leads audiences down a rabbit hole of confusion, loss, anger and grief that is the lived experience of anyone suffering dementia, and those that care for them.
As with AMOUR, THE FATHER’s headline cast infuse their characters with an unequivocal authenticity. They are all outstanding. Led by Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman, supported by Olivia Williams, Rufus Sewell and Mark Gattis, everyone contributes to a story that churns and swirls in a thoroughly unsettling manner. In fact, you’d be confused for thinking it’s a crime thriller at first. The father certainly does.
Anthony (Hopkins) can no longer be trusted to care for himself and has moved into the home of his daughter Anne (Coleman). Sometimes he remembers, sometimes he doesn’t. Just as he can’t always remember where he left his watch, convinced that the cleaner has stolen it. When he’s fully lucid, Anthony is utterly charming, he flirts with the nurse Anne has arranged. Often he’s not, he’s reprehensible, and drives the nurse to tears. His decline is such that Anne recognises he needs full time care. What’s more, she’s planning to move to Paris and live with her boyfriend.
So far, so straightforward. What sets THE FATHER apart is Florian Zeller’s gelatinous production. Anthony’s apartment closely resembles both his room in a care home as well as Anne’s apartment. It’s unsettling, forcing you to constantly reevaluate their surroundings and the point in Anthony”s timeline: is this his present or some composite from his past. Compounding the confusion is another woman claiming to be his daughter, a stranger claiming to be his son-in-law, and yet another man also claiming to be Anne’s husband. Who are these people and are they, in fact, real? See above re thriller as you’re forced to tease truth from the dream-like familiarity of these nightmarish surroundings. With some effort, eventually, we can. Unlike poor Anthony.
Remarkable aesthetics aside, THE FATHER shines because of the powerhouse performances of its cast who get as close to the awful reality of dementia as a movie can. No one puts a foot wrong interpreting the screenplay by Christopher Hampton (ATONEMENT) based on Florian’s challenging play. Hopkins is a force of nature as he and Coleman deliver some of their best, most honest work. The result is a film that shines in spite of the desperate grief, and one that, surprisingly, also finds space to offer hope.Supply and Demand

 »is our summer program.
is our performing arts program, which culminates as our Christmas in July Presentation.
It allows youth to express themselves by writing scripts/poems, dancing, interacting together so all the weight is on one person, and taking on different characters which to some is an escape.
is our entrepreneurship program. It’s part of Grace Express and implemented periodically throughout the year.
In addition to their family members, the youth have an opportunity, through the Youth Member Board of Directors, to invite key community leaders. Youth have an opportunity to share a conversation with our guests as they eat.
After everyone is finished eating, we use this opportunity for youth to present a skit, talent show, or special activity. Whatever is presented is theme-based i.e., bullying, unity, hate, etc. Sometimes we’ll have our guests speak or participate in a panel discussion on a certain topic.
Big Breakfast is held on Thursday. People who are invited receive a Big Breakfast Menu on Monday. They return it on Tuesday. Youth are assigned to figure out how much groceries and money we need to fill all the orders. Youth are assigned to be greeters, waiters/waitresses, food preparers, do a formal welcome, formal thank you, an invitation to leave a donation, and clean up.
A Big Breakfast Menu typically includes: bacon, beef sausage links, fried bologna, chicken patties, grits, hash browns, biscuits, scrambled eggs, freshly made from scratch waffles with a wide variety of toppings including ice cream, juice, milk, coffee, and condiments.
On the next day, Friday, each age group is asked to discuss what they learned from their guests. Staff comes up with questions and prizes are awarded. The youth decide who they want to invite next week and the invitations are made (arts & crafts) to be distributed on Monday.
The Youth Member Board of Directors discusses the invitations for the key leaders, which most of the time is determined two weeks ahead and evaluates the activity for any changes.
After all of this is done, the youth have free time for the remainder of the day!
We believe that positive youth characteristics are developed through nurturing, educating, and training and that when they are, they are better equipped to implement positive unity in their family and their community..CHICAGO, Ill., July 5, 2002 — Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings of Peoples Energy Corp. (PEC) and its subsidiaries, Peoples Gas Light and Coke Co. (PGLC) and North Shore Gas Co. (North Shore).
The Rating Outlook for all three companies is Stable. The ratings affirmations were based on a recent review of PEC’s operating results and updated business plans.
The ratings of PEC, PGLC and North Shore are as follows:
PEC
–Senior unsecured debt ‘A+’;
–Commercial paper ‘F1’.
PGLC
–Senior secured debt ‘AA’;
–Commercial paper ‘F1+’.
North Shore
–Senior secured debt ‘AA’;
–Commercial paper ‘F1+’.
PEC’s credit profile continues to be supported by the solid financial positions and low business risks of its regulated gas distribution utility subsidiaries, PGLC and North Shore. The natural gas segment accounted for approximately 87% of fiscal 2001 consolidated EBIT and 92% of consolidated funds from operations.
PGLC and North Shore operate in mature and stable markets with a constructive regulatory environment that allows for a purchased gas adjustment clause. The utility subsidiaries benefit from solid credit fundamentals, modest business and financial risks and positive operating characteristics, including diverse sources of gas supply and access to significant storage capability.
PEC’s ratings also take into consideration the company’s four diversified business segments – oil and gas production, natural gas midstream services, power generation and retail energy marketing. PEC has taken a relatively conservative approach to its expansion into the diversified arena.
Oil and gas operations focus on acquiring and developing on-shore, low-risk natural gas reserves. Hedging practices minimize commodity price volatility. Investments in power generation have been and are expected to involve experienced partners and cash flow will be supported through contractual arrangements with creditworthy counterparties.
Any material deviation away from this strategy or a decline in the operating or financial performance of the diversified businesses could pressurize PEC’s credit quality. Earlier this year, PEC indicated that a lack of suitable and attractively priced oil and gas production properties has slowed the company’s growth plans, causing PEC to lower its earnings outlook for fiscal 2002.
Fitch will continue to monitor developments in PEC’s financial condition and business position.
PEC has improved its debt and coverage ratios through debt reduction and related interest expense savings due to the October 2001 non-recourse project financing of the Elwood generating facilities.
The proceeds from the project financing were used to reduce debt at the PEC parent level, resulting in PEC’s consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio decreasing from a high of 61.1% at fiscal year-end 2001 to 53.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. PEC’s consolidated debt ratio is projected to remain around 53-54% level over the next two years.
A continued conservative financing strategy is expected at PEC, including pursuing non-recourse debt where warranted, particularly in power generation segment, and the use of tax-advantaged debt at the utilities, where approximately 78% of debt is tax exempt.
PEC’s core operations are its two natural gas utility subsidiaries, PGLC and North Shore Gas, that together serve nearly 1 million customers in Chicago and northeastern Illinois. PEC’s diversified energy businesses focus on oil and gas production, midstream services, power generation and retail energy services.27th Nov, 2021

Georgia Powerball Odds
How to Play Georgia Powerball
When it comes to Georgia Powerball, the rules are plain and simple — match all five white balls and the red Powerball to hit the jackpot. To do so, you need to buy tickets and participate in the draw, which can be done physically or online.
First, let’s see what playing Powerball in a GA Lottery retail parlor looks like:
- Visit a GA Lottery store and purchase a Powerball payslip.
- Pick five white ball numbers ranging from 1 to 69, and a red Powerball from 1 to 26.
- Choose a number of plays you’d like to participate in. The maximum is five, and each one costs $2.
- Select the number of consecutive drawings to partake in. You can choose up to 26 drawings and play them with the same numbers each time.
- The Powerball payslip allows you to use the Power Play feature and multiply the non-jackpot winnings 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.
- After completing the payslip, sign your name on the back and secure it.
- Follow the live results on the GA Lottery app or on the official website.
However, if you’re planning on playing online, here are the steps to follow:
- Choose the number of tickets to purchase and then select the number of times you want to play with each ticket.
- Pick five numbers from 1 to 69 and add one red Powerball number by choosing from 1 to 26. The Quick Pick feature can generate random numbers and help you complete the payslip.
- You can choose the Power Play feature and boost the non-jackpot prizes even while playing online.
- Once you've completed your tickets, review their details and confirm the purchase.
- The tickets will enter the next draw. If you win less than $600, the money will be transferred directly into your account.
GA Powerball Drawing Schedule
The Georgia Lottery organizes Powerball drawings every Wednesday and Saturday at 11 PM EST. If you want to participate, you can buy the ticket up until 10 PM on the night of the draw.
Georgia Powerball Payouts, Prize Amounts, and Rules
As mentioned, Powerball has simple rules, like any other lottery game. Just pick five numbers from 1 to 69 for the white balls and one from 1 to 26 for the red Powerball.
To win the main prize, you need to match five white ball numbers and guess the Powerball. The drawings occur twice a week, and the main award continues to grow until someone hits the jackpot.
Those who match five white ball numbers but not the red one get a second-tier prize of $1,000,000. Additionally, the GA Powerball features seven other levels that also generate rewards. The table below demonstrates the odds, payouts, and rules of GA Powerball.
How to Claim Georgia Powerball Prizes
Regardless of the prize, Georgia residents can collect their rewards in a few ways:
- Prizes lower than $600 can be claimed at any GA Lottery retailer, either by mail or in the Georgia Lottery office.
- Prizes over $600 need to be claimed at the Georgia Lottery headquarters or the Georgia Lottery district office. They can also be mailed to GA Lottery.
If you’re collecting a prize over $600, you’ll need to fill out a claim form and present two forms of identification, such as a driver’s license, passport, or other form of ID. You should also bring documents that show your Social Security number so that you can receive winnings hassle-free.
People who have won by playing Powerball online will receive an email with instructions on how to claim prizes. Players who have bought Powerball tickets online have 180 days to claim the prize, while those with instant tickets have only 90 days to do so.
Georgia Powerball Biggest Winners
Although it seems impossible to hit the jackpot, there have been some notable winners of the GA Powerball. Here are some of the lucky Georgia residents of recent times:
- In 2010, Gerald L. Render from Mableton bought a ticket and won $116 million.
- A year later, in 2011, there were two winners. One of them was Kathy Scruggs of Decatur, who went home with $25 million. The other prize of $77.1 million was never claimed. Can you imagine missing out on such a reward?
Most recently, a couple from Brookhaven, William and Heather ten Broeke, won a whopping Powerball jackpot of $246 million. They purchased the lucky ticket in Publix Super Market.
Georgia Powerball History and Facts
- Georgia began organizing Powerball draws in 1995. However, it was forced out in 1996 for selling tickets for both Powerball and The Big Game.
- The state rejoined Powerball in 2010.
- The Peach State collects lotto funds, including those from Powerball, and puts them into education.
Other Georgia Lotteries
The Georgia Lottery is packed with various events that attract players from around the state. Depending on your preferences, you can choose among Mega Millions, Jumbo Bucks Lotto, Fantasy 5, Cash 3 Night, Cash 3 Midday, Cash 3 Evening, Cash4Life, Georgia FIVE, and many others.
Georgia Powerball FAQs
How do you win in Powerball?
The gist of Powerball is this: you need to match all five white balls and the red Powerball number to hit the jackpot. Those who match only the five white numbers will get a second-tier prize of $1,000,000.
If you want to boost the non-jackpot prizes, you can opt for the Power Play feature and choose to multiply the rewards 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.
When is the Powerball draw?
Georgia Powerball draws numbers every Wednesday and Saturday at 11 PM EST.
How late can you buy GA Powerball tickets?
You can purchase Powerball tickets as late as 10 PM, approximately one hour before the draw.
How much tax do you pay on GA Lottery winnings?
By law, 24% of the winnings are withheld for federal taxes, while 6% goes to state income taxes. If you need help calculating this, you can use the Powerball Tax and Payout Calculator.

Ever get a plot idea play out in your head where you’re literally vibrating with excitement after? Got a really brilliant scene for Saving and I know it won’t create the same vibe through words but I enjoyed the scene.

The reason the work you’ve done on how you feel doesn’t seem like it’s working is because you need to do it until it works.

What is a catchment
A catchment is an area where water is collected by the natural landscape.
Imagine cupping your hands in a downpour of rain and collecting water in them. Your hands have become a catchment.
The outside edge of a catchment is always the highest point. Gravity causes all rain and run-off in the catchment to run downhill where it naturally collects in creeks, rivers, lakes or oceans.
Rain falling outside the edge of one catchment is falling on a different catchment, and will flow into other creeks and rivers.
Some water also seeps below ground where it is stored in the soil or in the space between rocks. This is called groundwater.
Greater Sydney's drinking water catchments stretch from north of Lithgow in the Blue
Mountains to south of Braidwood on the Southern Highlands.
We use the water collected by the natural landscape to help supply water for our needs, by building dams and weirs, or tapping into groundwater. This is called the water supply system.
Sydney's water supply system includes 11 major dams that store water collected from rainfall in five catchments: Warragamba, Shoalhaven, Upper Nepean, Woronora and Blue Mountains.
Rain in Sydney does not mean an increase in dam levels if the rain doesn't fall in the drinking water catchments.
Greater Sydney's water catchments stretch from north of Lithgow at the head of the Coxs River in the Blue Mountains, to the source of the Shoalhaven River south of Braidwood - and from Woronora in the east to the source of the Wollondilly River west of Crookwell.
The five catchments cover 16,000 square kilometres of land. This is only 2% of the land area of NSW, but it supplies drinking water to 60% of the state's population - over 4.5 million people who live in Sydney and the Blue Mountains, Illawarra, Southern Highlands, Goulburn and Shoalhaven regions.
Human activities affect the health of our water catchments. WaterNSW manages and protects the drinking water catchments of the Greater Sydney region, and supplies high quality raw water. WaterNSW works together with local councils, landholders, government agencies and industry so that daily activities in the catchment - particularly building, industry and farming - do not harm the environment that our drinking water comes from.Arawak Peppermint

Knives Out! is indeed back and once again features drummer Tommy Sickles, vocalist Todd Smith, guitarist Jasan Stepp (Who, ahem, steps into the lead gee-tar with Tom Maxwell absent from these recordings), and bassist Bill Gaal replacing David Cullen this time around. But if you’re looking at this as a Nothingface reunion featuring some guys from Dog Fashion Disco and Polkadot Cadaver then please get the fuck outta here right now. Sure, the framework for each of those bands lies within but Knives Out! has always been wholly a different beast altogether.
Heavier, more brutal, and more EVIL than its predecessor, Left In The Lurch is the Knives Out! record fans have been clamoring for in the years that followed the band’s initial outing.
“Deny Your Maker” is a riff-fueled master course in how to metal properly with Todd Smith leading the proceedings like a veritable madman. Y’all still drooling over Mike Patton? Smith is the real deal. Equal parts maniacal ringleader, whispering serial killer, and undeniable crooner, Smith has a range that is unparalleled in the world of modern metal. With commanding lines like “I am your god now/Look in my eyes/I am your master of pain and suffering!”, Smith owns the mic and in turn, all his followers.
“Mysterious Ways” is like being on an out-of-control rollercoaster. It’s Tommy Sickles’ insane fills and constant pummeling, Stepp and his maximum riffage, Gaal’s gruesome low end rumbles, and Smith’s crazy range.
You know what? Every song is like a rollercoaster!
“Give Up The Ghost” speeds along at a frenetic pace thanks to Sickles’ incendiary drumming then settles into these obscene grooves that’d make Lamb Of God weep with envy until the title track comes along and Stepp’s guitars sonically mesh into an unholy aurgasm.
If your brain is still intact after all of that then songs like “Gomorrah”, “Fuck My Way To Hell”, and “Cherished Possession” (Which features an anthemic chorus akin to “Hysteria” from their debut) are still waiting to ruin all other metal for listeners because of their brilliance.
Left In The Lurch is out now via Razor To Wrist. Bundles are still available here but if you seek instant gratification then head on over here and here.The first buildings in La Clairière, the new Raby district, are just starting out in Bron. 1,000 homes are expected and the first occupants should arrive in mid-2022.
The former gendarmerie barracks covering 16,000 m² have begun to change. The housing buildings of the first phase of work are emerging from the ground, to accommodate the first 58 occupants from the second quarter of 2022 at an average price of € 3,500 / m². These housing units located to the north-east of the plot are the first of the 1,000 expected in this project, the land of which is supported by Lyon Métropole Habitat (LMH) in partnership with developers Icade, Nexity and Sier Constructeur. Three residences – one senior, one student, and one social – are also scheduled in this future new district, as well as a crèche with 40 cradles (2023).
Work for the future Place Jean-Raby will take place during the same period for delivery in 2023, while the large central park is not expected before 2025.
The first building permits have also just been filed for the start of the tertiary component of the operation, 42,000 m² of which “32,000 m² in front of the building against the Bonnevay ring road, which functions as a noise barrier by going up to six floors”, specifies Marjorie Dumont, director of development and planning at LMH. The last lots will be delivered in 2028.Showing Collections: 1 - 2 of

Restored Newtown school before full landing was added in the front.
"Find a fit" in one of the old desks that fill the one-room school.
Check out the water cooler and lunch pails used by students back in earlier days.
Imagine the heat produced by burning coal and/or wood.
"Meet" Cyrus True who receives credit for building the first Newtown school in 1858.
The old Newtown School House (Knox No. 1) rests quietly at the north end of Avoca's Edgington Park on old Highway 83 as a last reminder of the once thriving settlement of Newtown which was located two miles south and a little east of Avoca.
It seems that in 1855 a man named Buck Townsend had been instrumental in laying out a settlement named Wooster in Section 21 of Knox Township. Then John Krutzinger bought 40 acres across the road and laid it out, naming the new site Newtown.
Cyrus True had arrived in the community in 1857. He saw the immediate need for a school house, so he built the first frame school house in 1858. The school was in use until the school year 1956-57 after which it closed. It had remained open for a total of 99 years.
Rather than having it demolished, Mervin & Noyon Schaaf purchased the school building at a December 1967 auction for $135. They later presented the building to the Newtown-Avoca Historical Society. The building was moved to Edgington Park April 23, 1971 by Mr. Art Arkfeld of Panama, Iowa for a cost of $400, which included 75 cement blocks and fixing the windows.
Visits to the Newtown School can be arranged through the Newtown-Avoca Historical Society.Photo/Somali Times
The governor of the Jubaland State of Somalia, Ahmed Madobe has today arrived in Garowe, According to sources told Somali Times, Ahmed Madobe’s trip came after governor Said Deni asked them to meet, to focus on Deni’s ambitions for the presidency of Somalia.
The sources added that Deni’s plan is to help his counterpart Ahmed Madobe to indirectly control and control the lawmakers leaving Jubaland, as they are political allies.
They will also discuss the start of the Parliamentary elections, which have already begun in the country, and are important for the upcoming presidential election, which is widely contested and part of the administrations.
Governor Deni and Ahmed Madobe are close political allies and have strengthened their alliances since the election debate began.
According to Somali Times, Said Abdullahi Deni’s presidential candidacy is all he needs to announce, as his recent political actions show.
Deni’s candidacy will make a big difference in Somalia’s presidential election campaign, and will have consequences for many candidates.
He will be the sole candidate to directly and indirectly administer the election of more than 100 members of the Upper House and the House of the People.
No candidate for the presidency has such a direct impact on the parliamentary election process, and it is the only thing that creates hope for the president of the Said Deni dream.HTML code editing

Which code would you be adding? We might have another option for that.
zilahiliviaMemberOriginal poster
We use the matomo analytics tool, but by no means do we want to work with the plug-in version, so we would need the source code into the head section. Could you help me find out where the beta version is? We have already subscribed for the Business Package.
Thank you, for your help!
Hello there,
Many thanks for that information.
To insert that code into the head section of the site, you would need to use a separate plugin:
The above plugin will inject the code, without having to edit the theme files themselves, which means the theme can get updated and you can change themes (if you need to) without having to worry about inserting the tracking code each time.
I hope this helps.

Mushroom Coral
The Mushroom Coral (Fungia scutaria) is a specie of the Actinodiscus genus that populates the rocky reefs and seabed of tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. The mushroom coral is also referred to as a Corallimorphs, Mushroom Anemones, or Disc Anemones because its composition is between the anemones and stony corals.
This smaller than average sized (1-3 in diameter) coral is relatively non-aggressive when compared with other invertebrates of the ocean variety. Like other soft corals, the mushroom coral does not have an exoskeleton and instead grows out from a rock when young. Using a limestone pedestal, it attaches itself to the framework of the reef, but will break off when they reach sexual maturity. From this point on, the mushroom coral lives unattached on the ocean seabed with its mouth side up (this position is extremely important to ensure the coral receives enough nutrients.) If the coral gets overturned during a storm or extremely strong current, the mushroom coral has the exceptional ability to right itself. The corals gut cavity enlarges on only one side of its body, with the imbalance acting as a wedge to raise the coral higher and higher until it tips over onto its proper side, a process that takes place over several hours.
A short stem branches the mushroom coral out from the rock, barely visible before the round or wavy cap tops off the stalk. There single polyps on a mushroom coral, from which tentacles are attached. These tentacles serve a variety of purposes in both feeding and self preservation. The mushroom coral is a carnivore, trapping small animals for nutrients by pointing its tentacles in a vertical fashion and snagging them as the ocean currents bring them by. A slit-like mouth exists in the center, with rows of hairy cilia on the surface that act as a conveyor belt delivering particles from the sea water into the mouth. The cilia also work in the opposite direction, removing sand and other debris to be disposed of. In addition to this method of eating, the coral is also a symbiotic creature, extracting small algae known as zooxanthellae from the creatures it snags in its tentacles, then hosting under its skin for photosynthetic energy.
Mushroom corals run the gamut of colors and textures- some or monochrome, others brilliantly multicolored, both smooth and bumpy, and some even have delicate knobs, small spots or bold stripes. The wide variety of mushroom coral colors depends mostly on the environment they are living in- how much access to sunlight they receive daily, the frequency and strength of the ocean currents, and neighboring creatures.
Very few subtypes of mushroom corals have been named, ironic considering the prevalence of the species. Although the mushroom coral does not grow in colonies like most soft corals, they do grow in clusters on natural reefs, so closely together that various types overlap one another. When the mushroom coral becomes overly stressed, it will withdraw in on itself, appearing to shrivel up into a lifeless blob.
The mushroom coral reproduces in many different ways (both asexually and sexually)- budding being one of the most frequently used processes. When a small coral breaks off from the reef to live along the sandy ocean floor, there is leftover tissue that remains on the original limestone pedestal. This tissue buds into a new mushroom coral. Mushroom coral also produce sexually through spawning- adult corals release eggs or sperm into the ocean which unite to develop a planula. The planula drifts along with the ocean currents until it settles on a different coral reef and begins to create a polyp, which is the basis of life for mushroom coral.Enter Your Own Comments For Carpe Mortis: You Only Live Once by Graveyard Greg

Luke Williams was back on the scoresheet for Hartlepool United as they were beaten 2-1 by Middlesbrough under-23s in a behind closed doors friendly at Rockcliffe Park.
After drawing 1-1 at Stockport County in the National League on Saturday, Pools boss Dave Challinor wanted to take a closer look at the players who didn’t feature at Edgeley Park.
Pools trailed Boro’s youngster’s 2-0 before Tom Crawford’s long free-kick released Williams who finished well to reduce the deficit with 10-minutes to play. Despite a strong second half showing, Challinor’s side had to settle for a narrow defeat.
Williams’ goal will come as another boost in the midfielder’s road to recovery after he made his first National League start for Pools against Woking just over a week ago.
And the Hartlepool boss will have been pleased with the manner of the goal after paying particular attention to Pools’ set-piece routines in training.
"We did a bit on our set-pieces on Friday but we’ll be looking to do more of that because that’s what can make the difference in those tight games towards the back end of the season,” Challinor told The Mail ahead of the game.”
“It’s a game where some of our lads need 90-minutes, 70-minutes and it’s an opportunity for us to look at potential options for this season and next season too.”
Two unnamed trialists, a left-back and a winger, made up Pools’ starting line-up at Rockcliffe on Tuesday afternoon with Challinor still assessing his options regarding further signings before the April 22 registration deadline.
Pools XI (4-3-3): Ravas; Trialist, Odusina, Cooper, Donaldson; White, Crawford, Williams; Ofosu (Macdonald), Trialist, BloomfieldCareers

It's one of my most favorite albums ever. I love looking through it and seeing the changes in our friends and family over the years. Pure happiness.
In this week's video I give you a look at my album plus talk a little about my process for scrapping these yearly photo cards and handmade cards. For a complete look at the pages in my album please see the bottom of this post for links to every layout included in my Friends and Family album. :)
This week's layout was one of those that changed a lot from my original plan once I got into the layout. I switched out a lot of the product I thought I would use in lieu of other things, etc. It happens. Don't be afraid to deviate from your original path. I am so happy with my finished layout and that is all that matters!
A huge showy title isn't necessary for this kind of yearly layout. It's okay to do one (and sometimes I do) but I decided to draw attention to my "2011" title with some circles, a couple of phrase stickers, banner stickers and a big showstopper poinsettia flower. Just lovely.
I added a couple more of these pretty poinsettias in the lower right corner of the 2-page spread to help draw your eye across the design and the page. Love the combination of a stamped a layered flower next to the die cut one.
Random border stickers, brads, buttons and these punched stars layered on the same patterned paper and sewn on with mini clear buttons add a subtle but effective page element.

Superior Spider-Man #10 [Review]
I thought this was a really good review of the current Superior Spider-Man…and since I’m not getting around to doing a last week’s pulls any time soon, take a moment to check this out.
Writer:…
View original post 343 more words
Shadowman
Trying something new out here. This is all about the best comics you have probably never read. Some of these you may know the names of, some you may have seen around. Others I promise you you have never heard of.
We’re going to start off easy though. This column is about Shadowman.
Not the current valiant series, but the original. You have to go back a ways to find that. The original book predates the video game….and a LOT of people only know the Shadowman story from that game. that’s fine, except the game isn’t really what Shadowman was designed to be. The reboot that Akklaim forced on the character to get out of some outrageous contracts it had gotten itself into. The original Shadowman kicked around the corners of the original Valiant universe form almost the beginning. Some will say he was the company’s analog to Batman, but that’s not entirely true since Shadowman had some powers. The compulsion to fight evil at night wasn’t based on neurosis, but voodoo. It’s likely you saw him in crossovers and maybe picked up an issue or two, but this isn’t a character you can drop in and out of. This is one you have to follow from beginning to end to understand the arch.
What makes Shadowman such a brilliant title is that more than anything, this is the story about how being a superhero can really mess up a person’s life. Jack Boniface never really wanted to be a superhero. NEVER. He was picked by a voodoo cult to be this generations Shadowman, then seduced by an alien who infected him with a poison to dilute the power and render him far less effective.
Being a musician, he works at night. But he can’t work at night if he’s out chasing the evils of the night. Through the course of the series we explore his past, where he grew up and his parents, and we see him thrust in the future where he is told the date of his death.
The series never ended…not exactly. Remember a few years ago and the media circus that Daredevil had to deal with when he was outed? Imagine that only worse. Matt Murdock was an attorny with some power on his side. Jack is nobody. He ends up drug before the court and finally finds himself on a ledge. the last shot of the series is him jumping….but we don’t know what happened next. The series was left open ended like this because at the time no one knew what was going to happen to Valiant. It’s a little bit of a drag to end it like that, but the ride is absolutely worth it.
I picked all of my Shadowman comics up out of .50 -.25 cent bins. With the valiant revival, that may be a bit harder, but definitely give this a shot if you can grab a majority of the series. You won’t be sorry.

Just a reminder, Lake Effect Comic-Con is this Sunday. There’s free admission, free movie screenings, a costume contest, comic creators and TONS of sales.

She’ wearing her She-Ra costume and I’m wearing my new Iron Man costume. Hope to see you there, then back here for new Violent Blue on Monday!
Prometheus and Expendables 2
I got around to revisiting some of last years blockbusters, just to see if my initial reactions held up.
With the Expendables 2, I see more holes in the story, but really, who’s going to this movie expecting a deep narrative? This is a vehicle, and vehicles have formulas : Start with the actor(s), create a character and then work your way backwards to build a story around them.
E2 is really the delivery of the promise made by the first film. It’s not that The Expendables was a bad movie, or even a bad action movie. What it was, it was a Statham/Stallone movie and that’s cool….except it billed itself as an action star reunion. Look, I’m in my late 30s. Jet Li, Statham, Couture and all the wrestling guys in the world…those aren’t my action heroes. They’re good, but they aren’t my heroes….that’s all I’m saying. I wanted to see Arnold, Bruce, Jean-Claude and Stallone together. Those are the guys (and to a lesser extent, Chuck Norris, and Dolph Lundgren) that my generation thinks of as action stars. Those are the guys we wanted to see. The nice thing is that E2 delivers that, and when that’s what you’re really coming in to watch, it still holds up just fine. There are no surprises here, no plot twists, it has infinite rewatchability.
Prometheus on the other hand…..
Truthfully, this film got a lot better with the second viewing. I previously commented on the expectations and how no amount of warning would convince anyone this wasn’t an Alien prequel. Having watched it once already, the anticipation is gone, allowing you to sink much easier into the story. It’s still annoying that the monsters are SO like the Alien monsters in behavior but not in form. It’s still half hearted in that respect, but being able to really get into the story without spending the entire time waiting for something familiar to appear or not….it helps.
Still, the movie suffers from being a part of this series. If this is sitting on my shelf and Alien is sitting on my shelf next to it….I’m choosing Alien every time, plain and simple.
And then I’m going to go read some Violent Blue. Sounds like a plan to me….
FX work
Last week I mentioned I was starting CG FX for the movie “Attack of The Killer Cyborgs From Beyond The Grave”. Once I got the ship design done, it was time to create the scenes and then set up a render farm to produce the actual shots.
One of the real challenges here was to create a radiation field for the ships to fly through. Clouds are complex bits of work and take FOREVER to render properly. I had five workstations running 24 hours a day with a sixth one used for plotting and occasional overflow. After a week of render time (well over 600 combined hours) We’ve finally got all the necessary clips done, though I may play around with a few scenes I want to try out later. We’ll spend this week adding extra effects – electricity and lighting, then sound and editing. Stay tuned and I’ll let you know where to get the movie from Baron Morbid. In the meantime, go check out todays new Violent Blue!!
My Found Footage marathon
A while back we talked about Grave Encounters 2 () and by extension the previous film Grave Encounters.
Found footage really isn’t new, The Blair Witch Project pretty much created the genre and Paranormal Activity has made it profitable, grabbing the attention of other studios, indie and big boys alike. Especially in the digital age, it’s much like the zombie movie. Anyone
with a handheld camera and a little bit of creativity can create one .
I’m not really a fan of Paranormal Activity. Of the modern found footage films, I think Grave encounters is one of the best. It’s certianaly the one I judge against. That’s why I’m looking at the set of movies I’ve got today. These all are done in the same vein, some almost directly coping the film itself.
We’ll start off with “The Tapes”. This movie tries to exploit the whole reality tv genre, much like Grave Encoutners. Of course, these guys aren’t actually looking for ghosts, they are investigating an alleged sex cult. What they find is a Satanic coven and hilarity ensues.
The movie would be far better if I could actually get behind some of these characters, but they are all just
completely unlikable and you really kind of root for them to get hacked up. The gore doesn’t disappoint, and if you are into occult movies, I suppose this is a fun way of getting your fix…if you can keep you popcorn down.
This is the first movie to ever give me motion sickness. I got hit really bad, surprising since shakeycam doesn’t usually do that to me. All in all, this one is really a pass.
Next up is “The Asylum Tapes”. Also goes by the name “Greystone Park” This movie is noteworthy because it’s the directorial debut of Oliver Stone’s son. After watching it however, I really hope he can just be content with being a trust fund baby and not unleash anymore of this on the unsuspecting public.
Okay, perhaps I’m being unnecessarily harsh. Really, this is not the genre for what he was trying to do. This film is pretentious, and more than a little artsy. It has SOME interesting concepts and some great lines…and all of them are more than this kind of movie deserves.
Real people don’t talk like this.
We have the main characters breaking into an abandoned insane asylum, pretty much just for kicks, but there seems to be a kind-of idea floating around that maybe they could make a movie out of this… The filmmaking aspect of the story however feels completly secondary. And afterthought, nothing more.
I think I would have forgiven more if this had been a straightforward cinematic style. When you go shakeycam, you live and die by it, in the plain realism of it. These guys wax philosophical, and jump in and out of first person POV to wide shots and quick cuts of scary images. The idea is to build atmosphere, but all it ends up doing is take me straight out of the movie. I can’t suspend my disbelief so easily when you jump styles like that. This just doesn’t work as a found footage movie. When we do have the shakycam going it was another one that made me sick to my stomach, but interestingly enough it would frequently be just….TOO good. Perfectly framed shots lit for the sheer soul of it……again, a found footage film just isn’t the place for this. It makes me wonder why they choose this form of storytelling in the f
irst place.
The final nail in the coffin for this movie is the lack of monsters or any real threat. It’s all poorly constructed atmosphere, a few quick and simple scares but nothing significant. We get one evil shadow for about three seconds and a brief flash of the girl on the cover – that’s right : she’s not the main antagonist and is hardly in the film. Funny, marketing seemed to figure out what this movie needed far more than the filmmakers. Oh, and don’t read too much into the inspired by true events stuff. Essentially the “true events” there is Sean Stone and a buddy exploring an allegedly haunted place one night and feeling unnerved. Sure. Whatever. Did I use the word “pretentious” yet?
Seriously, this movie reeks of it. From the beginning scene (which we cut back to occasionally) of the family and guests having a deeeeeep discussion around the family hooka (seriously) to the final shots of Oliver stone tipping his hat to the camera as his shadow walks away from him, this movie doesn’t earn any of it and it just kind of pisses me off.
I want to do a quick shout out to “The Amityville Haunting”. It’s a watered down Amityville Horror done in found footage style. This one is a real shame. It’s not bad, It’s really not, but if it had been give just a little more time and a little more money, this really could have been a great film- it could have rivaled Paranormal Activity and built on the power of the name. As it is, this movie is really just a cash grab trying to capitalize on that name alone and the popularity of the genre. There are scenes copied right out of Paranormal Activity and that’s a real shame. The ghosts are uninspired and not scary looking enough. The writer obviously knew a bit about the original story and throws in a number of great references, it’s kind of like the later Hellraiser movies – you can see some people really trying to create something here, but they just don’t have the time or money or support of the studio who just wants to keep pushing out product, not matter how good or bad it is. A real shame and a real lost opportunity.
Finally, we have “The Speak”. Like The Asylum Tapes, this is a groups of people exploring a haunted site, in this case an abandoned hotel in the middle of the city (not isolated or tucked away like the other movies we’ve been talking about). Of the bunch, this is probably the most like “Grave Encounters” in that these guys are trying to create a “Ghost Hunters” kind of show. Once inside, they preform a ritual called “The Speak” which is designed to open the door to the spirit world and let the ghosts in.
Really, this is the best of the bunch I watched
here. It has an interesting style in that it is billed as one continuous shot through the entire hour and a half film. First and foremost let me just poke a couple of holes in this claim, because I was really excited to check this out. There is at least one sequence late in teh movie that is a cut, but possibly it’s just an insert….they cut to footage they are watching on a camera, then back to the characters in the movie. There are at least two other moments that could he bidden cuts in the film. The last minuet or two of the movie are cut normally, but that may not count as it not necessarily supposed to be that first person POV anymore. So yeah, not a TRUE one take deal, but close enough that it’s still impressive what they did here.
You have to keep this in mind too. We get some pretty good performances from these actors considering it’s basically one long take. I spent twenty years on stage, and I get how hard that can be in of itself, but you got to understand this is WAY more complex than theater. You’re performance is constant, going up stairs different floors different rooms, up on the roof, the scope of the blocking and choreography in this film is staggering. It makes what might otherwise be considered average performances shine a lot brighter.
I liked this one. Good monsters and possession, incredibly creepy atmosphere (far creepier than Greystone Park and with fewer resources- imagine that) good ideas, and really a genuinely well done film. It’s definitely worth a rental, though it might not really be a buy. If I have this on my shelf next to Grave Encounters, I’m still going with Grave Encounters, but of the lot, this comes the closest and works the best by far.
Okay. I’m sufficiently creeped out for the night. I think I’ll read some Violent Blue to clear my head before hitting the sack. Happy nightmares everyone!
Ship comission
So I reached out to a filmmaker I know from Cinema Wasteland to see if he’d like some help with his current project “Attack of The Killer Cyborgs From Beyond The Grave”.
The job was to design a ship that would be used for one of the characters and a bounty hunter chasing him. Because it was a cheesy 50’s sci-fi vibe I got stuck on the idea of a flying saucer and came up with this:
I emailed it off and the client was happy and I started some early animatics. The problem was, I wasn’t so happy with it. The more I looked at it the more it felt – I don’t know, half-way done.
I decided to scrap the entire design and start again from scratch. Something dirtier. More teeth.
This design starts off way more as a travel pod from the early Star Trek movies, but is built up to be uglier, more like something out of Blade Runner or Aliens. From behind I wanted it to look like a Jim Lee drawing out of Wild C.A.T.S.
I an SO glad I did. I’m so very much happier with this one.
The model is done, but I’ve fallen behind schedule a bit due to a family emergency. Beginning some animation this week, and may have to take some time of from doing new Violent Blue (we’ll still post strips every MWF of course). Can’t wait to see the final product!
Thank you Julie Newmar!
I do believe Julie Newmar is my favorite Catwoman. I liked Michelle Pffiefer, but her Catwoman was definitely a Tim Burton creation and not at all a reflection of anything in the comics. Anne Hathaway kind of captures that not-quite-a-villian feel, but really, she’s just to…nice.
We don’t talk about Hallie Berry.
There were of course, other Catwomen in the Batman TV series, but they were all imitations of Julie Newmar. She did it first and best and I’m thrilled to have her autograph!!

I vote for Bill as the winner on this one. Anyone who gets flak for wiggling his butt while conducting is my kind of conductor!
I guess I need to wear tighter pants so that my butt wiggling is more obvious!
Bill wins.Since President Trump assumed office in January 2016, there has been substantial concern that the Department of Justice would take a harder line on state-legal cannabis than DOJ’s relatively tolerant approach during the Obama presidency. Recent comments by William Barr during his confirmation hearings for Attorney General of the United States suggest there is not likely to be a significant change. When asked by two senators whether he intended to use federal resources to prosecute cannabis businesses operating in compliance with state law, Barr said that he did not, and called for Congress to act to resolve the tension between state and federal law.
Barr’s comments signal the latest development in a series of policy positions taken by federal law enforcement towards states which have legalized cannabis. Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Justice issued memoranda—commonly known as the “Cole Memoranda” after their author, Deputy Attorney General James Cole—setting forth a policy de-prioritizing prosecution of those involved in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis in compliance with state-law in states which had legalized medical or recreational cannabis. In January, 2018, former-Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Obama-era guidance and stated that prosecutors should “follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Nothing in the Sessions memorandum directed United States Attorneys to begin new prosecutions or change the standards they previously used, but there was understandable consternation that rescinding the Obama-era policies signaled a forthcoming federal crackdown on state-legal cannabis operations. That crackdown never materialized and Attorney General Sessions left office without realizing his dream of eradicating legalized cannabis from the United States.
Now there is more reason to believe that Jeff Sessions’ likely replacement will continue the federal government’s hands-off approach to state-legal cannabis. On December 7, 2018, President Trump nominated William Barr to be Attorney General of the United States. Barr has a history as a tough-on-crime drug-warrior, and at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Senators Kamala Harris and Corey Booker both pressed Barr on his anticipated approach towards the growing number of states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. Both senators specifically asked Barr to confirm that he would not use federal resources to prosecute cannabis businesses in states which have legalized cannabis, and Barr agreed that he would not.
When asked by Senator Booker whether he believed Sessions was “right” to rescind the Obama-era policies, Barr responded that his approach “would be not to upset settled expectations and the reliance interest that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memoranda.” Barr then said that he would not “go after companies that have relied on the Cole Memoranda.” Perhaps noting the possibility that Barr was limiting his response only to companies or investors which began participating in the legal cannabis industry while the Cole Memoranda were in effect, Senator Harris asked Barr explicitly if he was “intending to use the limited federal resources at your disposal to enforce federal marijuana laws in the states that have legalized marijuana?” Barr responded: “to the extent people are complying with the state laws, you know, distribution and production and so forth, we’re not going to go after that.”
Of course, Barr has not yet been confirmed and if, as widely expected, he is confirmed, his answers to the Senate are not binding policy positions. Nonetheless, Barr could likely expect a sharp rebuke from Senators Booker and Harris if he implements policies towards state-legal cannabis that differ substantially from his responses to them. The hearings provide some hope that DOJ will continue its relatively hands-off approach, even if it does not move towards greater certainty by issuing new and clear guidelines to guide participants in the industry.
Other statements at the hearing indicate the growing support for a federal solution to the tension between state and federal laws on cannabis. Barr said that he, personally, thought the appropriate solution is “a federal law that prohibits marijuana everywhere.” Sharp-eyed readers will note that an existing federal law—the Controlled Substances Act—currently prohibits marijuana everywhere and is the cause of the same tension about which Barr was speaking. But Barr correctly noted that “we can’t stay in the current situation” and that it is “incumbent on the Congress” to resolve the current uncertainty. The growing tide of popular support for legal cannabis, the success of the cannabis industry in those states which have legalized it, and the recent legalization of hemp and hemp-derived CBD in the 2018 Farm Bill all suggest that when Congress does act, it is less likely to ratchet up federal prohibition, and more likely to implement a federalist approach in which legalization is left to the discretion of the states.Students For Safe Water’s goal is to educate students, teachers and the general public about the world water crisis and to raise awareness about the way to help save the lives of those in need by providing clean, safe water and basic sanitation to those living without.

Theophilus Mwangi is a washed process coffee from Kenya and roasted by Vote Coffee in Berlin, Germany. Their packaging did not include any tasting notes, but as it is a Kenyan coffee we expected it to be bright and juicy.:
This coffee starts and ends with flavors of caramelized brown sugar. As the coffee cools, its brighter, more acidic elements come into play: caramelized pineapple, grapefruit, and cranberry. We also tasted a slight pine needle herbaceousness. The finish is all cocoa nib and brown sugar, with a sweetness that lingers.
Our take:
A delicious Kenyan coffee from Vote. Perhaps slightly less acidic than the norm, flavors of sweet caramel and brown sugar make this coffee an approachable, delicious introduction to Kenyan coffees.Case Studies

Creating a unique retail shopping experience for Sunglass Hut.
Creating a unique retail shopping experience for Sunglass Hut..
THE CHALLENGE
Designing a Kiosk for Retail
The average customer won't try on more than 5 pairs of sunglasses.
The tedium of physically trying on multiple pairs of sunglasses to find the right one was a major reason customers do not make a purchase in store. Through research and interviewing Sunglass Hut associates, I learned that this pain point affected both customers and sales associates and negatively impacted the shopping experience. Customers were likely to get frustrated and give up or run out of time to shop around if they didn't find "the one" quickly.
"There are too many choices."
"It's annoying to put on multiple pairs to figure out what looks good on me."

"It's tedious and annoying to put on multiple pairs to see what looks good on me."
My Role
I was the sole designer for the kiosk experience. I was in charge of the full design process, including setting the design vision, conducting the user research, and the UI design. I worked on a cross-functional team that included one PM and two developers.
Our team partnered with the Brand Experience Innovation team at Sunglass Hut and with a hardware design agency to create the physical kiosk enclosure.
As of May 2018, I continue to be the main point of contact with the Sunglass Hut store manager for all kiosk-related issues.
DESIGN VISION
I created wireframes, conducted design reviews, and tied design decisions to research to gain alignment and optimize the user experience. I also advised on the hardware components and physical kiosk enclosure build to ensure they considered the user experience.
DESIGN VISION
I created wireframes and prototypes, conducted design reviews to share the vision, and tied design decisions to research to gain alignment and optimize the user experience.
RESEARCH
I partnered with a research agency and conducted independent research to understand the challenges of the retail experience, identify customer and stakeholder pain points, and synthesize insights into useful and delightful features.
LEADERSHIP & BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS
I made key connections with retail stakeholders, including the regional manager for Sunglass Hut. I presented work to gain buy-in & alignment from stakeholders and retail teams, including hosting an expo for SF Bay Area retail managers.

PRODUCT STRATEGY & SCOPE
I worked closely with a product manager to identify challenges and opportunities, champion customer goals while balancing business goals, and validated assumptions to inform the product roadmap.
CHATBOT & MOTION DESIGN
I created a chatbot UI & script to guide retail shoppers and provide recommendations & product knowledge education.
I designed animations in Principle to prototype with users and stakeholders and to understand feasibility with developers.
UI DESIGN, HANDOFF & EXECUTION
I worked together with 2 developers to understand technical restrictions, handoff designs via Zeplin, and provide relevant input and feedback. I worked with the product manager to QA and approve delivered stories.
TECH SUPPORT
I was the primary contact if the Sunglass Hut store had any issues with the kiosk regarding anything ranging from a misaligned webcam to it not turning on. An great user experience includes customer support!
INTRODUCING
In-Store Virtual Try-On Kiosk
Enabling discovery of new styles and opportunities to engage customers
Multiple iterations of kiosk designs for both the UI and physical kiosk were created and tested based on interviews, frequent check-ins with retail stakeholders, and observations of customer behavior.
Since research insights revealed that time was a major factor in why customers left before finding a style they wanted to purchase, the user experience prioritized browsing and discovering as many styles of sunglasses as quickly as possible.
RESULTS
More Styles, More Purchases
Customers tried on over twice as many pairs of sunglasses
The Sunglass Hut Regional Manager saw a 200% improvement in purchase conversion of customers who engaged with the kiosk. At its peak, he reported over a 500% conversion improvement compared to customers who did not use the kiosk. Customers were trying on an average of 11 pairs of sunglasses on the kiosk, over double the number of physical pairs customers would try on.
In addition, the Union Square San Francisco store manager and store associates reported the following qualitative improvements in the shopping experience:
THE NITTY GRITTY
(a.k.a. the Process)
CONTEXT
Ray-Ban Kiosk Proof-of-Concept (Nov 2016)
Dealing with Ambiguity
Our group was asked by the CEO of Luxottica to create a fast proof-of-concept to showcase the potential of Luxottica's Virtual Try-On technology as an in-store shopping experience. The team was given 2 weeks to define the concept, build a completely new interface, determine the hardware used, allow our developers to code it, and package it for our director to bring to Milan for a demo. I was given 2 days to create a new UI design that would be able to do the following:
Lessons learned from implementing VTO on Ray-Ban's mobile/desktop sites and researching customer shopping behavior were leveraged whenever possible. Given the short time frame and since this would be an internal demo, no additional research was done to understand retail customer needs at this stage. I worked with our PM with the understanding that, if the project continued, we would allocate time for research and iterate the design as needed.
Hardware and Design Decisions
We decided to reuse the desktop VTO javascript component, meaning the kiosk interface needed to function within the Chrome browser. I recommended that we use a touchscreen 1080p monitor in vertical-orientation to take advantage of VTO's default portrait-orientation output to it's fullest (non-cropped). I suggested an Intel Compute Stick, both for its portability and as a budget-friendly option. An Intel NUC was chosen by the team as a more powerful option (the hardware cost ended up being less than 6% of the total cost of the kiosk).
An ideation session with the team director and PM to quickly brainstorm features and understand the scope of the project and what would be possible within the short timeframe.
An Opportune Summit at Oakley HQ (February 2017)
An Opportune Summit at Oakley HQ (February 2017)
The Ray-Ban demo was a success and the demo was shipped to Oakley HQ's lobby, which served as a testbed for many of Oakley's projects. Luxottica Innovation Labs attended a summit held at Oakley HQ to present Virtual Try-On insights to Luxottica's brands.
Partnering with Sunglass Hut
Through meeting the Sunglass Hut Brand Experience Innovation (BEI) team at the summit, a partnership was formed to create an in-store kiosk to trial for 3 months at the Sunglass Hut located in Union Square in San Francisco. Fortunately the store was located a block away from our office, which enabled us to check in frequently and remain aligned with the store manager and associates, as well as observe customers using the kiosk in the context of their shopping experience.
DEEP DIVE INTO RETAIL
Project Pre-Brief
Project Pre-Brief
As a first step in collaborating with the Brand Experience Innovation team, my PM and I drafted up a pre-brief that listed our must-haves and nice-to-haves from both a user experience and technical perspecive. A few of these items included:
Sunglass Hut 2-Day Kiosk Trial (April 2017)
Sunglass Hut 2-Day Kiosk Trial (April 2017)
Establishing Connections:
The first thing I did knowing we'd be testing in the store was to introduce myself, meet the store manager and all of the associates, and take photos of the store, power outlets, and discuss potential areas for the kiosk. Being aware that they may perceive a shopping tool as a way to eliminate need for sales associates, I positioned our experiment as a social tool for them to engage with their shoppers. I wanted to understand how to build a multipurpose tool that would achieve a healthy medium between self-sufficient shoppers and an additional "in" for sales associates to engage with their customers.
Designing for Retail:
Up to this point, we had focused on optimizing VTO for an e-commerce shopping experience. This was an opportunity to start fresh and learn if and how an in-person shopping experience at a brick-and-mortar Sunglass Hut would differ from e-commerce. The BEI team took the lead in coordinating a 2-day trial with our demo kiosk setup: a basic monitor and PC on a metal pedestel that we borrowed from Oakley. We collaborated with a research agency to help us recruit and interview participants and all teams involved contributed to drafting up the research script and topics.
The UI was reskinned with taglines and branding to reflect a Sunglass Hut experience, focused on Ray-Ban products.
Day 1
We set up the kiosk and a poster provided by BEI to attract customers.
Hypothesis:
Location in direct view from front entrance and near the cashwrap would get customers' attention and maximize traffic.
Key Observations & Learnings:
Day 2
Hypothesis:
Placing the kiosk to the front entrance would be more discoverable and gain more interest from passersby.
Key Observations & Insights:
Day 3
Based on what we've learned so far, I convinced the team and the SGH store to allow me to run another day of tests at a third location: up against a column, facing the fashion section, located near the cashwrap, and conveniently next to a power outlet (no cord management, tripping hazards). The BEI team and research agency had only planned for a 2-day trial so I ran the study on my own this day, with help from associates working with customers to understand how the kiosk helped both sides.
Hypothesis:
Placing the kiosk out of the way, but still in a discoverable location, would not block associates' view of the store, the kiosk would be positioned at a more relevant moment in a customer's shopping journey (after browsing physical products), and facing the fashion aisle would provide consistent lighting throughout the day for the webcam.
Observations & Insights:
This seemed to be the optimal location for the store, despite not being as noticeable from the entrance (the side of the monitor was visible, not the front).
After 3 days, it became clear that this tool was more effective as an associate-introduced, customer-driven tool, rather than as a self-sufficient customer shopping experience. This key insight defined the product strategy, future iterations of the design, and the dimensions of the physical kiosk enclosure.
KIOSK DESIGN
Physical Kiosk Enclosure (April 2017, installed June 2017)
Physical Kiosk Enclosure (Begun April 2017, installed June 2017)
My PM and I flew to Portland to meet BEI and the enclosure design agency to preview their work. I enjoyed being able to leverage my DIY and photography experience: sharing ideas about the building the frame, mounting the LEDs for optimal lighting, routing cables, heat management, and discussing the diffusion panels to soften the light surrounding the frame. The enclosure was built according to the width of the column from the day 3 trial and the monitor was enclosed but tiltable to account for customers of different heights.
Kiosk Interface v2
Kiosk Interface v2
Several changes were made based on our research above and shifting to use the Sunglass Hut online catalog. Since we were rapidly iterating on features, the designs shown below are a culmination of insights over several months.
Learnings and Observations (June-July 2017)
Learnings and Observations (June-July 2017)
The newly designed kiosk was installed for a 2 month trial period and a full day of research was planned early August. Along the way, I checked in 2-4 days a week with the Sunglass Hut staff (luckily only a block away!) and developed a wonderful working relationship with them. By making a personal connection with the staff, they were more willing to share what worked well, what didn't, and any ideas they had for how the process could be better. My team continued to iteratively add features and fixes based on my research.
Some of the learnings I shared with my team:
3M Command hooks are easy to remove, so staff could remove them if it posed a hazard. The step ladder I chose was sturdy, but intended as a temporary solution.
KIOSK IMPROVEMENTS
Kiosk Enclosure v1.5
The tilting monitor height adjustment was a major issue: nobody shorter than 5'3" could use it, which represented a significant amount of foot traffic entering the store. In addition, many of the store associates couldn't demo the kiosk to showcase its usefulness for customers who weren't willing to try it on their own.
Our hardware partner came up with a solution: a track based system with a latch to adjust the height. A counterweight was planned so the weight of the monitor + metal shroud would be easily moved, but was not installed as part of the retrofit. The monitor was quite heavy without the counterweight, requiring associate assistance for safety.
Since we knew that nobody read the "Picture Perfect" transparent acrylic panel in the front, we requested to have it removed and replaced by front access to the hardware inside the kiosk enclosure. Prior to this, maintenance and troubleshooting required me to move the kiosk off the column, and dismantle the back panel (a metal sheet held on by 8 screws) which was time consuming and disruptive to business.
We pushed to have the retrofit done several days prior to our second round of research.
EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
Recommendations and Chatbot
Recommendations and Chatbot
(This is a summary of the chatbot design. A separate project detailing the chatbot research, design, and execution is planned. If the chatbot project isn't ready yet, please contact me for more info!)
There had been great interest in having the Luxottica Innovation Team build a recommendation engine for Luxottia's brands to use on e-commerce sites to help show more trendy and relevant products. While our developers worked on building an MVP recommendation engine (recommend frame shape by detecting user's face shape) in partnership with Sunglass Hut, I proposed revealing the output of the recommendation engine via a conversational UI.
Factors that led me to recommend implementing a chatbot on the kiosk:
The chatbot script and responses were iteratively written and tested with the Sunglass Hut staff to be in line with the tone of voice and energy they used when interacting with customers.

The prototype had 4 main steps: introduction to build rapport, provide or skip a recommendation, education about frame shapes, and conclusion.
Testing - Round 2
The BEI team returned for another round of testing and brought the same researcher back to facilitate. We focused on understanding the kiosk's role in the Sunglass Hut shopping experience, and allocated time to run through usability testing and understanding the usefulness of features my team had built, including the chatbot. I recommended that we start participants at the store entrance, rather than at the kiosk, to provide a holistic view of the shopping experience. We had the Sunglass Hut regional manager (Brian) and store manager (Taylor) help introduce participants to the kiosk if they hadn't discovered or interacted with it on their own.
Key Observations & Learnings:
In it's current form that only recommended a frame shape, we realized the chatbot didn't have enough compelling content to fully engage and delight users. The feedback showed that it took away from the initial goal for the shopping experience — see sunglasses on yourself in under a minute and quickly discover the right styles for you — and wasn't the right fit for an associate-assisted experience. As the recommendation engine was still in its infancy, the PM and I planned to enhance the chatbot experience once the recommendation engine was further developed.
MAKING FRIENDS AND GAINING ALLIES
Sunglass Hut Expo
My PM and I hosted an "Expo Day", a half-day showcase inviting Sunglass Hut and Oakley regional and store managers to come learn about Virtual Try-On and how the kiosk augmented the experience at the San Francisco Union Square store. Brian and Taylor, the Sunglass Hut regional manager and Union Square store manager, were our champions — pulling together a list of relevant invitees, participating in a live demo, and hosting the 2nd half of the expo to discuss metrics and methods for how the kiosk benefitted the sales process.
UX goes beyond the product:
I coordinated the event and provided snacks, Blue Bottle coffee, and catered lunch for our audience. Appreciated attendees are happy attendees 🙂
"I would kill to have my customers try on that many pairs!"

OPPORTUNITIES AND LESSONS LEARNED
Making Connections
This project was an amazing opportunity to design a kiosk — both the digital experience and contributing to the enclosure design — and have it tested in a retail store for a full year. What started as a 3 month trial became a solid addition to the store and, as of April 2018, is still currently in the Union Square Sunglass Hut. I continue to provide weekly metrics to the regional manager to calculate the conversion rate of kiosk users, which is still holding strong at 200% the rate of customers who don't interact with the kiosk.
Meeting the dedicated Sunglass Hut retail employees and getting to know their pain points, the KPIs they're required to reach, and how they engage with customers helped me create a holistic solution to the shopping experience to delight customers while remaining useful to retail stakeholders.
I loved working with them, and still stop by to chat or bring them coffee or snacks as a thank you for collaborating and sharing their experiences with us.
Next Steps
Increasing Usage
We've seen significant gains to the conversion rate for kiosk users but kiosk users only accounted for approximately 10% of shoppers coming into a retail store. We planned to iterate on the splash screen, moving from an animation of sliding sunglasses to a more interactive splash screen, allowing shoppers to select current, trendy sunglasses to place on the model's face before trying it for themselves.
Measuring Conversion
We began measuring conversion rates starting late 2017 to collect solid data for senior stakeholders. Currently this is a manual process, with store associates tallying up customers who use the kiosk and make a purchase. Finding a way to track this digitally and tie it to our analytics would increase the accuracy and confidence in the data.
More Stores
Initially BEI planned for a 20-store pilot, but unfortunately a company-wide reorganization put that on the back burner, as budgets and priorities were shifted. The PM and I stayed in touch with the SGH regional manager and proposed a 2 store trial in the SF Bay Area, to understand the benefits of a VTO kiosk in other environments. Union Square was a tourist destination — how would the kiosk be received in a tech savvy area such as Stanford Shopping Mall in Palo Alto? Working with the regional manager to examine various store metrics, we hypothesized that the VTO kiosk would benefit a "neighborhood store" (mainly local shoppers) in a different way, by boosting sales of ship-to-home products not stocked in the stores.
Wall Mount
Sunglass Hut had various retail store designs that ranged from large flagship stores to small and narrow stores. For stores where a full standalone kiosk would not be possible, we began discussing a wall mount solution and drafted a project brief to obtain a quote for a more compact solution.
Kiosk Enclosure v2.0
The v1.5 retrofit was a huge improvement in ergonomics for shoppers but the lack of a counterweight made it cumbersome to adjust. We worked with the agency to implement a motorized lift, with up/down arrows that moved the monitor and webcam assembly effortlessly and quietly. We ordered a second kiosk built with the new lift, shipped it to Milan, and our director presented it to the CEO of Luxottica to gain more visibility for the project.
Ray-Ban Store in Milan
There was interest in putting the Milan kiosk in the flagship Ray-Ban store. I reskinned the latest Sunglass Hut designs to incorporate Ray-Ban branding. This project was taken on by the retail team in Milan.
Driving Traffic Into Stores
After the expo, we attracted the attention of the Sunglass Hut General Manager and he was interested in creating a concept for an interactive VTO digital display in a mall setting to drive traffic into Sunglass Hut stores.

Learn how to interpret punchcard components.
Visual elements
Lanes
Punchcards aggregate the first data dimension into horizontal lanes. Each lane represents one field or category in the dimension. For example, if the first data dimension is days of the week, lanes represent each of the seven days.
Axes
Y-Axis
- Categories in the first data dimension appear on the y-axis.
X-Axis
- The x-axis shows values in the second data dimension.
Circles
Circles in the punchcard show aggregated metric values where the two data dimensions intersect. For example, in a punchcard tracking rental popularity over days of the week and hours of the day, a circle appears at the intersection of Thursday and 3 PM to show typical rental counts at that day and time.
Size
Circle size shows relative metric values. Larger circles indicate a larger aggregated value at a particular intersection.
Circle size relativity is determined using one of these radius scales.
- Local
- Show circle size relative to the lane in which the circle appears.
- Global
- Show circle size relative to all lanes.
Color
Circles can use one of the following color modes.
- Categorical
- Circle color is determined by source_field values.
- Sequential
- Circles appear in different shades on a spectrum between a minimum and maximum color. color_field values in the data determine the particular shade for a circle.
- No color mode
- If no color mode is used, the diagram shows all circles in the same color.
Interactive elements
Hover
Hover over a circle to see its aggregated metric value.
Drilldown
You can click on a circle to open a search in a new page. The new search uses the data dimension values for the selected circle.

Goods need packaging, a beautiful, distinctive packaging can make a product from the dazzling array of counters stand out. Advertising is also a kind of packaging, a refreshing advertising, can make goods sell like hot cakes. In the era of market economy, "good wine needs no bush" has long been replaced by "good wine needs no bush". The power of packaging is huge. People need packaging, too. Entertainment star appeared, which is not glamorous? A piece of handsome face, match with fashionable hairstyle, plus a suit or expensive or strange and novel jacket, in the twinkling of a spotlight stage, will achieve better stage effect. Of course, make up also should have a comprehensive and correct understanding to the age of the person, facial form, color of skin, bodily form, otherwise, although use again much popular fashionable element and make up skill, also won't let a person coruscate gives real beauty. Imagine a man in his forties being dressed like a young man in his twenties. If a person does not have a comprehensive understanding of their own, do not know their strengths, do not know their weaknesses, just like a person who has never driven a boat in the sea, how can he confidently in the public, in front of others show talent? Know yourself, know how to make the most of your strengths and avoid your weaknesses, constantly enrich yourself, but also learn to show yourself in a timely manner. Movie star Jackie chan is one of the most successful people in the history of packaging. Since his debut, with his own strength and media publicity packaging, won countless people "star", in the world of film has its place; What's more, he has always been committed to spreading Chinese culture and devoted himself to public welfare. In 2003, he was rated as one of the "top ten people who moved China" by the media, which fully reflects his self-value. To achieve the best social effect of packaging in this can be inferred. Of course, "packaging" without packaging should be the highest level of "packaging". Why the west lake can let su shi "to the west lake than the west, makeup is always appropriate" praise? Because of the natural beauty of the west lake, the beauty of the elegant temperament is amazing. Youth men and women, have the health and vitality given by god, but, if you do not cherish the opportunity to enrich themselves, waste time, there will be no handsome appearance, no ideal, no direction; When the youth passed, can only empty hair exclamation: "young not hard, the old sad." There is a slogan: "beauty comes from the heart." Without a lively upward, struggling soul, even if there is the capacity of the United States, it is just a painting. Everyone is born a piece of jade, but the earliest is a piece of jade has not yet carved. The sculptor is you, how to carve, how to package is up to you. The final analysis of commodity packaging or depends on the quality of products, similarly, the appearance of the packaging is not the main, the most important is the inner things. To show your true essence of beauty, all in yourself.(CNSNews.

Its subject is the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds, consisting of various artists' cover versions of the album's tracks. The tribute was created to celebrate Brian Wilson's 50th anniversary performance of Pet Sounds at the Levitation festival in Austin, Texas.
The album was scheduled to be released exclusively as a double-vinyl LP at the festival before it was cancelled.
Stereogum's Michelle Laggan wrote that the album "strikes a unique balance in the degree to which it strays from the original ... the tribute mostly contains subtle modifications that find a happy middle ground between innovation and mimicry. With this, the album serves it’s ostensible purpose"
Popmatters' Jasper Bruce highlighted "That's Not Me" and "Here Today" as standout tracks, "effectively juggling vocal harmony, experimentation and positive energy to pull off ingenious takes of two of the Beach Boys’ classics. ... It’s a shame that these tracks have to be rated alongside some of the others. ... Predictably, many of the performers become too caught up in speaking to the experimental character of the Beach Boys and end up neglecting the energy of the music, the passionate tales of love and the group’s partiality for vocal harmonies."
AllMusic's Mark Deming praised "That's Not Me", "Here Today", and "Pet Sounds", but wrote: "more often, A Tribute to Pet Sounds sounds like the work of bands who may love the Beach Boys' original, but have no idea how to reconcile its magic with their own buzzy, narcotic outlook. ... Usually, even a mediocre tribute album will encourage new listeners to explore the original recordings, but the magic of Pet Sounds is so thoroughly absent here that it's hard to imagine who would turn to Brian Wilson's work by using this as a road map."

It forms part of the Lea Catchment Nature Improvement Area (NIA). The northern part is strongly influenced by open farmland, mostly on the eastern side. Here large greenhouses are commonplace, used for growing vegetables. The west side of the area is bordered by a mix of housing, warehousing and light industry. The character is heavily influenced by the numerous irregular, small to medium scale water-filled former gravel pits through most of its length. There are extensive areas of abandoned workings, which have regenerated with reedy margins, grasslands, scrub and wet woodland. In places, the land is of high value for wildlife and includes several sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs); Turnford and Cheshunt Pits, Waltham Abbey and the Cornmill Stream and Old River Lea, the first site forming part of the Lee Valley Special Protection Area (SPA), on account of the internationally important wildfowl populations found there.
For the most part, the rivers in this section have been heavily modified and the area includes a number of man-made channels which form part of a flood prevention scheme. However, there are some sections of river which exhibit quite natural forms, notably the Old River Lea at Fishers Green and Cornmill Meadows and the Small River Lea at Cheshunt. The River Lee Navigation (canal) runs through the length of this catchment.
The Water Framework Directive classifications for the (upper) Lower Lea vary from bad through poor to moderate with only the man-made New River achieving a good status. A large sewage treatment facility is at Rye Meads. Non-native invasive plants include Himalayan balsam, giant hogweed and Japanese knotweed. American signal crayfish are widespread in vast numbers. American mink are numerous and pose a continuing threat to water voles.
Much of the area lies within the Lee Valley Regional Park where management aims to balance the needs of wildlife with public use for recreation. This part of the Park is very well used, with over 1.3 million visits annually. Angling is popular throughout the catchment with carp being the focus within still waters. Of note is the presence of barbel in the Old River Lea at Fishers Green. However, structures such as weirs are a significant barrier to the movement of fish and in particular, eels.About me (Dr Deniese Cox)
I get it. Before you commit to spending your time with me, you want to know who I am and where I came from. That makes sense!
The hard part for me is knowing what part of ‘me’ interests you most.
Some of you care that I have the ‘right’ pieces of paper on the wall (I do – MBA, ML&D, PhD), while others care that I have first-hand experience teaching and learning online in a variety of contexts (I’ve definitely got buckets of that), while yet others simply want to know that my sessions really are engaging and packed with practical strategies (clients tell me that’s true too).
So here goes, a little about me…
First things first, having worked as an online educator in diverse vocational, university, and corporate training contexts, I know what it’s like to balance the demands and quirks of the organisation you’re working with, alongside student needs and expectations, and your own ideals about ‘good’ teaching … while also learning a whole range of new skills to bring your teaching into the online world. As an educator, I was always looking for effective ways to ensure my online students were actively engaged and learning. Let’s face it though, some of the ‘best practice’ strategies out there might read well in a textbook, but they’re simply not realistic when faced with a real-world teaching load, student needs, and resource constraints.
When I was doing my Masters of online learning and development, I got to experience being an online student for that whole program – and let me tell you, that did more for my understanding of what doesn’t work online than a dozen textbooks ever could (I happened to be teaching online at the same time, so talk about immersed in all things online!!).
Today, my favourite part of delivering professional development webinars and coaching is helping busy educators cut through the noise around what goes into great online education. It’s not about technological wizardry. It’s not about fitting a one-size-fits-all model. It’s about learning practical, proven strategies that can be adapted to meet the needs of your unique context.
For me, an effective online strategy is one that works for the student and the educator. Teaching online (and learning online) should be more rewarding than frustrating.
My PhD research with online educators helped me learn even more about the day-to-day decisions being navigated and frustrations being experienced. I continue to research what is and isn’t working for real online educators and students because I’m committed to keep bringing you the most up-to-date insights to ensure that you have the tools to be the educator you want to be online.
That’s where you find me today. Revelling in the fact that I get to spend my days delivering professional development that really does make a difference for educators and their students. I’m ably supported by my gorgeous husband (Jason) and neurotic toy poodle (Charlie) … both of whom correctly insist that we really should step away from the computer and get to the beach more often :)
So there you go, as promised, a little about me. Feel free to read more about my specific work experiences at
I look forward to meeting you and hearing more about where you’re at and where you want to be. Please do get in touch anytime – just use the contact me page or drop me a note at Deniese@TeachingOnline.com.au

Archaeologists are planning to excavate ancient ruins in Irrawaddy Division that could be as much as 2,000 years old.
The ruins in Ingapu Township are believed to be the remnants of an ancient city-state that hails from the Pyu era. Archaeologists are keen to prove if it is indeed a link to the ancient Pyu kingdom.
“We heard the Department of Archaeology is planning to excavate the site when they have the budget. And we are preparing more field trips to investigate the area,” said archaeologist, Bhone Tint Kyaw.
The site is around eight square miles and contains Buddhist temples, statues and an old city wall built in the Pyu style.
“The area around the ancient site is regarded as both a religious and a cultural heritage site,” said Abbot Pyinarsiri from Kyatpyin Religious Zone, an area owned by the clergy that encompasses the site. “Since it contains religious buildings, we regard it as a religious site, while the government sees it as a cultural heritage site.”
The.
The walled cities built along the Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers were part of an ancient overland trade route between China and India.
Ruins from these ancient cities are dotted all over central Burma and efforts are underway to preserve them as cultural heritage sites.
“There are a lot of ancient sites believed to be Pyu cities that continue to be discovered across the country,” said Nu Mra Zan, a special advisor to the Department of Archaeology, National Museum, and the Ministry of Culture.
“Some may be as far south as the Irrawaddy delta, others in central Burma and Shan State. Their protection must be prioritised.”
Twelve Pyu walled cities have been excavated in Burma so far. If the site in Ingapu is found to be from the Pyu era, then it could be one of the most ancient recorded settlements in the country.

Virgin’s sister AgainVirgin’s sister Againby oggbashan © Copyright oggbashan April 2005The author asserts the moral right to be identified as the author of this work.This is a work of fiction. The events described here are imaginary; the settings and characters are fictitious and are not intended to represent specific places or living persons.This is a sequel to Virgin’s sister.* * * * *My big sister Lynn had been my first. After my abject failure with my then girlfriend Eve and Lynn’s disastrous evening out, Lynn had straddled me and had taken my unwanted virginity.I loved my big sister, but until that night I had loved her as a sister. Our relationship was very different for a while. Lynn was everything I wanted. She needed reassurance after her divorce that she was still attractive. My instinctive response to her had been enough to precipitate a love we should be ashamed of.Lynn is my big sister in more than age. She stands a head taller than me even in bare feet. I still had pictures of Lynn on my bedroom wall. The one I liked most was the newest showing her in the ball gown she had been wearing that fateful night.Lynn asked me to stay with her for the weekend the next time my parents went away. I accepted and my parents had no objection. Why should they? I was nineteen, nearly twenty, and my sister just thirty and recently divorced. My parents didn’t know about that night. I hadn’t forgotten it. How could I? It had been my first time. I thought it had been a once-off, never to be repeated and had happened because we had both been hurt.On Friday evening I drove over to Lynn’s house in my own car. I had saved hard and bought a wreck that needed work. Four months of work had turned the wreck into a reliable vehicle that looked respectable if boring. Even with my parents’ help I couldn’t afford the insurance on a powerful car. It might have been small but it was good. Just like me.When I arrived Lynn admired the car and seemed to appreciate how much work I had put into it. Eve thought the car was too small. For some things it was. Once inside Lynn’s house, with the front door firmly shut behind me, Lynn took my head in her hands and kissed me full on the mouth. At first I was startled. I couldn’t avoid responding to her passionate kiss. My arms wrapped round her waist. One of her arms cradled my head. The other pulled me close. I could feel her erect nipples against my chest. Lynn let me ardahan escort go. She patted me lightly on the head.”Coffee, Giles?” She asked as if her mouth hadn’t been r****g mine seconds before.”Er… Yes please, Lynn.””Come into the kitchen then.”I left my suitcase in the hall and followed Lynn. One thing had changed since I was last in her kitchen. Just below the kitchen clock was that picture of Lynn and me at the wedding years ago. Lynn noticed me looking at it.”I put that up to remind me that at least someone loves me. You do, don’t you Giles?”I nodded. Lynn brushed her lips on my cheek.”Thank you, Giles. I do need reassurance this weekend.””Why now?” I asked.”Greg is getting married again tomorrow.”Greg was her ex-husband. He chases young women, women barely old enough to be legal prey. That is why they had divorced.”How old is the bride?” I asked.”It will be her eighteenth birthday tomorrow,” Lynn spat out.Ouch. That must have hurt Lynn. I opened my arms to her. She dropped to her knees and snuggled against my shoulder. I stroked her hair gently as she sobbed.I looked back up at the picture that reminded me of happier times when Lynn could help me with any problem I had.”What happened to that bridesmaid’s dress?” I asked. I wanted to know and I thought it might take Lynn’s mind off Greg.Lynn turned to follow my gaze.”That one? I’ve still got it. It takes up a quarter of my wardrobe. Greg and I argued about it once. He said that it was unhealthy to keep an old dress that I’d never wear again. At the time he was chasing a very young girl so I retorted that he was being even more unhealthy. After that I kept it because I wasn’t going to let Greg push me into getting rid of it.””I think you would still fit into it,” I suggested.”Of course I can!” Lynn retorted. “I haven’t lost my figure. Unlike Greg. He’s got the start of a paunch.””He hasn’t!””He has! What that girl sees in him I don’t know.”Lynn stood up. We made coffee and drank it.After a while discussing our parents and other relations Lynn said suddenly:”I haven’t tried that dress on for years. I think I still fit it. I’d like to try. If I can, it will show that I’m not the saggy old bag Greg thinks I am. Take your suitcase up to your room and unpack. If I need help zipping it up I’ll give you a call.”Ten minutes later she called.”Giles! Help me with the zip, please?”I went into the master bedroom. Lynn artvin escort had put the dress on but the zip was halfway down her back. It was slightly stiff from disuse as I pulled it up to the high collar and fastened the poppers at the top.Lynn twirled to splay the skirt wide. It had been trailing on the floor.”Can you get the big petticoat for me, Giles? It’s hanging up on the extreme left inside the wardrobe.”It was. I had a struggle getting it out past Lynn’s dresses. Once out I shook the layers to try to restore its shape after years of being squashed in the wardrobe. I wasn’t wholly successful. I held its waistband open as Lynn climbed into it. It still didn’t spread her skirt properly. Lynn looked down at her skirt in dismay.”It should stand out much more than that. Can you check that the net layers are properly spread?”I knelt down. Lynn lifted her skirt and the cotton outer layer of the petticoat. I pulled at the first inner layer of net. I had to crawl round easing the net out and down to its full length. Then I repeated my actions with the second, third and fourth layers of net. Underneath those was a three-tiered silky underslip corded at each tier. The cords had creased.Lynn looked down at me. There was a smile on her face.”Thank you, Giles. I think we need you to straighten out the cording. Hang on while I lift the other layers out of the way.”She grasped the net layers and lifted. I tried to sort out the cording but the upper nets got in my way.”Try inside…”I ducked under the tiered petticoat and sat down. Now I could see the cording clearly. I straightened the lowest cord, shuffling round on my backside. The next one was less easy. I tilted my head back and raised my hands to the top tier. I was looking straight at Lynn’s bare pussy. I gasped.”You’ve found it,” Lynn said. “Now kiss it.”I might have thought about objecting. Lynn lowered her pussy on to my upturned face and dropped all the layers of petticoat and skirt over me. The blue skirt cut out all the light as my mouth met her warm damp place. Lynn’s hands pressed through her clothing to direct me as my tongue extended and made contact.I had never been this close to any woman’s pussy. The scent and smell were amazing. I kissed and licked and sucked and tongued as Lynn’s clothing shook around me. Slowly her weight pressed me down until I was lying on my back shrouded in her dress. My head escort bayan was held in place by her thighs as her hands directed my every move. I was beginning to learn where she wanted my tongue to go, how hard to press, how to move and how to react to her prompting.I was breathing hard yet I could hear her expressions of pleasure even under the layers of rustling fabrics. Eventually she rammed her pussy hard against my face and shuddered. I knew she had reached her climax. As she lifted up again I followed. A few minutes later she shuddered again. I felt her hands unzip my trousers and slide them down. As I continued to kiss and caress her pussy her hands grasped my erection firmly and squeezed. As I became more responsive to her hands her pussy withdrew and she leaned forward over me. Swamped by her dress I couldn’t move as her tongue touched the swollen head her fingers had excited. Her mouth opened and sucked me inside. Now it was my turn to shudder as I came into her mouth.Lynn accepted all I produced as if it was her due. As I sagged under her she sat up and slowly dragged her skirt and petticoats off me. I lay with my head against her bundled clothes, looking up at the demure bodice clasping her heaving breasts.”That is how to eat a woman, Giles,” Lynn said. “Did you enjoy today’s lesson?”I nodded. “That was just the beginning. Would you like to learn some more this weekend?”I nodded again.I shouldn’t have enjoyed my sister’s pussy so much. Most of the weekend she wore a wide flaring skirt and I buried myself under it while she sat on a chair, the bed, the kitchen worktop and the stairs.I also learned how to eat pussy while she was wearing slacks. She would yank them back up once my head was in position and hold me hard against her. Saturday afternoon, at the time Greg was getting married, Lynn wore her old wedding dress and taught me how to do sixty-nine surrounded by yards of rustling taffeta, silk and satin. I tried as hard as I could to distract her from what was happening at the Registry Office. I enjoyed myself and I think Lynn did too. That evening we found out that we hadn’t needed to distract her. Greg’s bride had not turned up and had decided not to marry him not then, not ever. That really made Lynn happy. That night she rode me mercilessly until I went into a peaceful exhausted sleep in my sister’s arms.I learned more that weekend than I might have done with a succession of girlfriends. Now that is a long time ago. Lynn has remarried. I am engaged. Lynn and I have resumed normal relations as a brother and sister who are fond of each other but not lovers. Sometimes, just sometimes, I dream of Lynn’s pussy and that weekend. Is that so wrong?“Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” 1 THESSALONIANS 5:18

No matter what you face, God’s goodness and mercy will never leave you. In fact, He even prepares blessings for you in the middle of hard seasons. But these truths aren’t always easy to remember, which is why giving thanks matters. Gratitude helps us focus on the only One who is able to turn our problems around for His glory and our good. So right now, let’s take a minute to pause and thank God for all He’s done in our lives…

CBS' Magnum P.I. reboot has brought on director Justin Lin to take the helm on the pilot episode, and serve as an executive producer. The director will executive produce alongside Danielle Woodrow from the director's production company, Perfect Storm Entertainment, along with series creators/showrunners Peter Lenkov and Eric Guggenheim, John Davis and John Fox of Davis Entertainment, CBS TV Studios and Universal TV Studios. It isn't clear just yet when filming will begin on the pilot.
We first reported on this TV reboot back in October, with CBS issuing a "sizable pilot production commitment" for the show. Magnum P.I. was given a pilot order at the end of January, along with another reboot, Cagney & Lacey, and four original shows. The new Magnum P.I. series will be an update of the classic television series set in Hawaii which follows Thomas Magnum, "a decorated ex-Navy SEAL who, upon returning home from Afghanistan, repurposes his military skills to become a private investigator."
The new series will feature the same quartet of main characters from the original series, but with one gender-swapped twist. Tom Selleck starred as Thomas Magnum in the original series, with the late John Hillerman playing Jonathan Quayle Higgins III, Roger E. Mosley playing Theodore "TC" Calvin and Larry Manetti playing Orville "Rick" Wright. All of those characters will be back for this revival, although in this new series, Higgins will be a female character named Juliet Higgins, a disavowed former MI:6 agent, which suggests that the character will be British. Both TC and Rick will be former Afghanistan veterans like Magnum.
This foursome will be taking on cases that no other private investigator will take, with plenty of action, adventure and comedic elements in the series, which will also explore the brotherhood forged by those who saw combat together, the meaning of returning home after a tour of duty along with their commitment to continuing to serve their country, even in the private sector. There is no indication if casting is under way or not. There was previously a much different Magnum P.I. project in the works at ABC a few years ago, that would have followed Magnum's adult daughter, who returns home to Hawaii to take over her father's private investigation firm, but that never made it to series.
While Justin Lin is best known for his work on the big screen, including the Fast & Furious franchise and Star Trek Beyond, he is no stranger to the small screen, or to the CBS network. Ironically, two of his former Fast & Furious collaborators, Vin Diesel and writer Chris Morgan, are working on a TV reboot of another iconic 1980s series, Miami Vice. Justin Lin has previously directed the pilot episodes for CBS' S.W.A.T. and Scorpion, and he has also directed episodes of HBO's True Detective and NBC's Community, including the infamous first "paintball" episode entitled Modern Warfare. Deadline broke the news on Justin Lin directing the Magnum P.I. pilot episode.ArticlesSoft Contact Lenses for Keratoconus: Case ReportGonzález-Méijome, José M.

Contact lenses have assisted the refractive correction of keratoconus since the 19th century. In these case reports, the authors describe their experience with a new soft contact lens design. Methods. The Soft K is a new soft lens comprising a thick fenestrated design to fit in patients with mild to moderate corneal distortion and fitting problems or physical intolerance to rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses. Three eyes with mild keratoconus from two 25-year-old patients (one man and one woman) were fitted with the Soft K contact lens. Both patients had previously worn other contact lens types. Results. Improvements in comfort and quality of vision compared with previously worn RGP or soft toric contact lenses were the most remarkable advantages objectively observed and subjectively described by both patients. For one patient, a professional soccer player, the benefits were also important in terms of compatibility with the dynamic environment of his activity, satisfying the need for stable correction and constant full field-of-view demand without spectacles. No physiologic complications such as edema or neovascularization were observed during the follow-up period. Conclusions. This new soft lens design for irregular corneas is especially indicated for those with intolerance to RGP or other contact lenses and for patients for whom RGP lenses do not satisfy the dynamic environment inherent to some professional or leisure activities, particularly sport activity. This is a good option to consider in patients with mild to moderate keratoconus and good correction of slight or moderate irregular corneal astigmatism with good tolerance. Aftercare implications are also discussed. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.March 12, 2015

We are down to single digits till the most wonderful day of the year ladies!!
I am still not even ready!!! I began the process of wrapping a few gifts, but still have plenty more to get to! And not to mention those quick trips to the mall for those last minute stocking stuffer gifts for everyone on my list!
In the mean time, I have been loving anything suede lately mixed with faux leather. Even though the faux leather is very minimal on this Romwe jacket. It still gives it enough of a detail to dress it up and wear with a date night dress or more casual like I did today.

United Kingdom Weak Automobile Finance Market Perception File 2021 – ResearchAndMarkets.com – Alternate WireLuibueno’s 3 Published August 17, 2013 at 3264 × 2448 in Sunset Beach My chicken tacos. Quite possibly the best chicken tacos I’ve had in my life.
Wow. What a show! It looked like the clouds completely cooperated with the pictures. So beautiful…
I want to eat here too!
XoTake a deep breath, lady (talkin’ to myself here – nothing to look at), and lower your expectations. I know it’s not 100% confirmed, and the entire thing could be more meh than yeah when all is said and done, but the news that Cha Seung Won might be the new male lead for the next Hong Sisters’ drama has me giddy as a school girl.
Sorry Seung Gi (you know I love ya), but I’m way more interested (1) when the age of the characters get bumped up a decade and the love story matures like fine wine, and (2) seeing new faces for a Hong Sisters’ project.
For those of you who can’t envision Cha Seung Won (most recently playing the baddie in Athena) in a comedic role, please watch City Hall asap and then let’s talk. The man has impeccable comedic timing (even better than his co-star Kim Suh Na who is already a master at comedy). The leading lady for the new Hong Sisters’ drama The Discovery of Affection is still rumored to be Gong Hyo Jin, and I couldn’t be happier with this new (hopefully happening) pairing.
What’s so great about this potential new casting coup is that both Cha Seung Won and Gong Hyo Jin are eclectic actors who have great range, depth, and subtlety to their acting – which could actually temper the Hong Sisters’ tendency to go for easy jokes and pratfalls over more sophisticated humor and wittiness. If this pairing happens, count me in!
I want this OTP!! I can already feel the awesomeness!! Bring it on!
EEE! please please let this be true! loved cha seung won in city hall! I was meh about Gong Hyo Jin in Pasta, but i think it was the way her character was written, not her.
I lovedlovedloved Gong Hyo Jin in Sang Doo Let’s Go to School and Ruler of Your Own World.
She was fine in Thank You, but in that drama similar to my feelings about her in Pasta, I was underwhelmed because the character was so passive.
either Seung Gi or him, I’m fine. Like them both : )
CSW will be perfect in this drama. He did so well in City Hall and which drama drew me into loving kdramas. He is a great actor and if it is a funny scene, boy, he is very good!
SQUEEEEEEE! um, yeah. Little excited about that over here. 😎 ::remembers there are some CSW movies left to watch in the queue::
Me too, me too!!
Love, love, love CSW and GHJ.
Luckily the news wasn’t about CSW being in the drama with Seung Gi, if not I’d die choosing between my darling SG and CSW who can just eat him alive any minute.
Yeap, CSW and GHJ for the win!
kyaaaaa, yes, yes, YES!
Even though I love Lee Seung Gi, the idea of a mature, older, hotter Hong Sisters lead has me cheering. Their comedy does tend to be on the juvenile side at times, so hopefully Cha Seung Won will temper that.
And Gong Hyo Jin? Icing on that cake!
Anyone know when it starts airing?
I love LSG, too, but oooooooooooooooh boy, how excited I am for these rumors? I LOOOOOVE CSW and I agree, he has great acting chops and great comedic timing.
And honestly, when the age of the characters is bumped up like that, I can’t help being gleeful. I may relate more easily to the characters if they’re in their 30s-40s since I’m in that range of age, too.
Please kdrama gods let CSW and GHY be on Hong Sisters new drama… They will be perfect.. Perhaps, we can have GHY boyfriend be in it too for the love triangle… ^^ I love love love CSW in City Hall. I love GHY in Pasta.. Well, I love Pasta also due to NMW is in it and Mr. Voice but mostly NMW. =D
Ummmmmm, Cha Seung-won…don’t get me wrong, I love Lee Seung-ki, but I like my men a little more mature. And Cha Seung-won definitely qualifies. He was such a man in City Hall, even if he did do some despicable/slimy things in that drama. Lee Seung-ki is charming and cute, but he doesn’t possess the aura of manliness that CSW has.
~rubs hands together~ And of course, after the fiasco that was Athena, which I couldn’t even watch halfway through despite CSW and Siwon, I’d love to see him do something again soon.
That was supposed to be a “Mmmmmmm” as in “Yummmmmmmmy”. ^_~
CSW…oh God I can’t wait. He will be the perfect fit for the drama. I am not familiar with Gong Hyo Jin so can’t say anything about it. I will take anything as long as is CSW. I love LSG too but I don’t think he fit this role. He is too young!
I love Cha Seung Won! I endured Athena for him, after watching him in City Hall!! Love to see him in another drama soon 🙂
Aaaah i love that News n hope it’s true. Both of them (CSW + GHJ) are my fav actor n actrees. Can’t wait for watch this drama./cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/4566831/142847846.0.jpg)
How have you viewed Southampton's season so far?
With my hands over my eyes. Considering our opening run of games, we were playing reasonably well, though not picking up points, this then turned into playing badly, with the recurring theme of horrific defending and odd goalkeeping leading to some pretty dire performances. Recently, last week against Liverpool aside, we have looked pretty impressive, and at least shown that we are capable of dominating teams when we click. It is a little Jeckyl and Hyde at the moment. The Saints that played against Newcastle can beat anyone in the division, the Saints that played Liverpool belong in a pub league.
Has the Premier League been what you expected after a seven-year break?
Yes and no. I knew it would be tough, but I am adamant the standard of the Premier League has gradually got worse over the last 8 or 9 years. The Manchester United side today (that will be challenging for the title) is not a patch on the ones we used to face last time round. Perhaps it's sentimentality but I think the league has lost it's edge a bit. I look at teams now and think "we could get something here", there wasn't a lot of that last time round...
How have you viewed Reading's season so far?
A little similar to ours I guess, when I have seen Reading on TV, they don't seem to be playing that badly, but defensive errors and individual mistakes put paid to a positive result. I wouldn't have had either of us down as relegation battlers in the summer, but here we are...
Any fond memories of Southampton v Reading?
Not really! My memories of games against Reading are primarily away defeats and home frustrations! I enjoyed our late equaliser away last season, but we hardly deserved anything from a dire performance.
Any not so fond ones?
Last season at home. The night we conceded the title. I still think we should have won, but the ruthlessness with which you took the game from us in the second half was the mark of champions. You deserved it, and wanted it more.
Any Reading player that Saints fans are worried about?
Jason Roberts was fantastic against us last season, so I am sure we will have to keep an eye on him, other than that I like the look of Le Fondre, always did, I think he is still playing at 50% of his potential.
Who should Reading fans be worried about?
The front four. If Puncheon, Lallana, Ramirez and Lambert have a good day they are devastating up top. Ramirez is coming more into his own with each game he plays, Lallana is as good as he always is, Puncheon has been outstanding recently and Lambert is amongst the goals.
Score prediction?
I am going to be unusually confident. 3-1 Saints.
Any tips for travelling Royals?
Enjoy your last minute equaliser. ;-)
And where do you think both sides will end up?
Such a tough one. I think it is time to face facts and accept that we are both going to be in a scrap at the business end of the season. The likes of Sunderland, Villa, Wigan etc. are all going to be down there too, and it is likely to get messy. I hope we both stay up.

Skeptics of Lee’s character make much of his
thoughts and actions during the slavery debate that led to civil war. As
the
crisis rose in Washington, he was a cavalry colonel on the
southwest frontier. A strict soldier, he did not air his opinions
in public, but privately he agonized over events that were
tearing apart the country the Lees had served so long.
From Texas in late 1856, he wrote to his wife that
“Slavery as an institution is a moral & political evil in any
Country.”
At the same time, he deplored the “evil Course” of the
abolitionists. “How long [the slaves’] subjugation may be necessary
is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence. Their
emancipation will sooner result from the mild & melting influence
of Christianity than the storms & tempests of fiery
Controversy. . . . “
Lee happened to be on home leave in October 1859 when
an abolitionist band raided Harpers Ferry to incite a slave uprising.
President James Buchanan ordered him to put down the
insurrection. Lee’s force captured the raiders’ leader, John Brown, who
was tried and hanged. But Brown had ignited something that
would end in the death of hundreds of thousands and the liberation
of millions.
Back in Texas, Lee was against the cotton states’
threatening secession. He was devoted first to the land that had
produced
Washington and Light-Horse Harry—the father who said, “Virginia
is my country, her will I obey, however lamentable the fate
to which it may subject me.”
With the Deep South states pulling out, Robert Lee
wrote home that he could imagine no greater calamity than the breakup of
the Union. Still, “a Union that can only be maintained by
swords and bayonets, and in which strife and civil war are to take
the place of brotherly love and kindness, has no charm for me. .
. . If the Union is dissolved . . . I shall return to my
native State and share the miseries of my people, and save in
defence will draw my sword on none.” Later, he wrote, “I wish
for no other flag than ‘the Star spangled banner’ and no other
air than ‘Hail Columbia.’”
Thus he was deeply conflicted when he got orders to return east. As the crisis over Fort Sumter broke, General Scott, himself
a Virginian, called him into Washington.
There at the home of Montgomery Blair, across the avenue from the White House, Lee was offered command of the United States
Army. He refused and returned to Arlington.
Looking out across the city where the Washington
Monument and the Capitol dome still stood unfinished, Lee paced the
floor
from afternoon till past midnight. Only after the Virginia
convention voted to secede did he make the decision to resign from
the army that had been his life. To his sister, Lee explained,
“with all my devotion to the Union and the feeling of loyalty
and duty of an American citizen, I have not been able to make
up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives, my children,
my home.”
The next evening, a message from Virginia’s Governor John Letcher summoned Lee to Richmond.
He could not know when he left his beloved Arlington
that he would never set foot there again. He passed Fairfax, Manassas,
and Culpeper and crossed Bull Run, the Rappahannock and the
Rapidan, undistinguished towns and streams whose names would soon
burn into the nation’s history.
As the train clacked southward, he could rethink all
that had brought him to this trip of no return. Hundreds of other
professional
soldiers also had to choose, but few had historic associations,
family memories, or personal regrets so deep. Better than
most, Lee understood the enormity of the decision he had made.
Wearing a civilian suit, Lee stepped off the train at Richmond, not realizing that the protection of this city would soon
become the great mission of his life.
When Letcher asked him to be major general in command
of all Virginia’s forces, Lee agreed without hesitation. But the honor
did little to cheer him. Soon after, he was asked by Episcopal
Bishop Richard Hooker Wilmer whether he thought the war would
perpetuate slavery. “The future is in the hands of Providence,”
Lee said. “If the salves of the South were mine, I would surrender
them all without a struggle to avert the war.”
In those two sentences, the bishop heard Lee the
religious fatalist, who could lament war and slavery yet leave both in
the
hands of God, and Lee the traditionalist, who like Washington
believed that the soldier must stand apart from politics. A
British officer maintained that “his subservience [was] more
utter, more abject, than that of any other noted general to any
other Government in history.” Despite it, “what [his] bootless,
ragged, half-starved army accomplished is one of the miracles
of history.”
More than a year of war went by before the real Lee
emerged. In the spring of 1862, George B. McClellan brought his massive
Union army down the Chesapeake Bay to move on Richmond from the
east. Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston withdrew his
defenders mile by mile until he was wounded at the battle of
Seven Pines. Only then, with 100,000 invaders on Richmond’s doorstep,
did Jefferson Davis turn to Lee, who was 55 years old when he
took command of the Army of Northern Virginia.
By first ordering defensive earthworks around the capital, the new commander got nicknames like “Granny Lee” and “King of
Spades.” A young captain named E. Porter Alexander doubted whether Lee was bold enough to lead an army.
A colonel with the captain knew Lee better.
“Alexander,” he said, “if there is one man in either army . . . head and
shoulders
above every other in audacity, it is General Lee. His name
might be Audacity. He will take more desperate chances and take
them quicker than any other general in this country, North or
South, and you will live to see it, too.”
Within days, Alexander saw it. Lee threw his divisions
into a series of furious counterattacks, driving McClellan away.
Despite
grievous losses, he had saved Richmond. Never again would
soldiers wonder whether he was bold enough. The many Southern casualties
that poured into Richmond from those Seven Days battles
influenced rivals and some friends to argue later that he was too
bold.
After turning back McClellan, Lee expected that
Union army to join another advancing from Washington. He determined to
strike
first. Sending Stonewall Jackson on a sweeping flank march, he
brought up James Longstreet’s corps alongside, and together
they routed Union General John Pope at Second Manassas.
Reporting to Jefferson Davis, Lee said, “We mourn the
loss of our gallant dead in every conflict yet our gratitude to Almighty
God for his mercies rises higher and higher each day, to Him
and to the valour of our troops a nation’s gratitude is due.”
Thus he spoke after every victory, with never a hint of the
self-congratulation rife among many other generals—but with a
characteristic note of sanctimony, of assurance that he and not
the Yankees was doing God’s will.
To follow up this success, Lee took his army across
the Potomac into Maryland, confident that he could outmaneuver
McClellan.
But by pure luck, McClellan’s soldiers outside Frederick had
found a lost copy of Lee’s complex battle plan wrapped around
three cigars. McClellan moved to confront Lee along Antietam
Creek on September 17, 1862. Their armies surged back and forth
from early morning till near dusk. By the end of the day, more
than 23,000 soldiers on both sides were killed, wounded, or
missing, making it the bloodiest single day in American
history. Only Lee’s tactical skill and the bravery of his outnumbered
troops prevented disastrous defeat.
When that day was over, the Southern army was “worn
& fought to a perfect frazzle,” wrote artilleryman Alexander. He
added,
“No military genius, but only the commonest kind of common
sense” was needed to see that if McClellan had attacked all-out
the next day, he could have “destroyed [Lee] utterly.”
But McClellan did not. If the Union commander was
lucky to have found Lee’s order, Lee might seem luckier to have faced
McClellan
again instead of some less cautious general.
Lee created his own luck: Repeatedly, he gambled
against heavy odds, and his aggressiveness convinced opponents that he
was
stronger than he was. He understood that if he showed caution
more in keeping with his true numbers, the war would be short.
That December, looking on as his troops shredded Union
attackers at Fredericksburg, Lee said. “It is well that war is so
terrible;
else we should grow too fond of it.” He did not habitually
spout pronouncements suitable for framing, but his biographer believed
that sentence “revealed the whole man in a single brief
sentence”—the battle glow instinctive in Light-Horse Harry’s son,
tempered by the brooding understanding of how many men were
still to die.
Lee’s battlefield decisiveness created his “supreme
moment as a soldier” when he defeated “Fighting Joe” Hooker at
Chancellorsville.
In early May of 1863, Lee defied all textbook rules by dividing
his force and sending Stonewall Jackson far around Hooker’s
flank. In the vicious battle, Jackson was fatally wounded in
the moonlit thickets by his own men.
That battle was the summit of two historic military
careers, each lifted higher by the other. The mutual confidence between
Lee and Jackson inspired them to do things together that they
would not have dared with anyone else. The battle was won by
their teamwork, by the determination of their soldiers—and by
Lee’s reputation: The turning point came before the fight was
fully joined, when Hooker in his mind came face to face for the
first time with Lee, and he folded.
Lee’s aide, Major Charles Marshall, was with him as
bedraggled Confederate soldiers surged around their general, cheering
him in the burning woods. Marshall wrote, “As I looked upon
him, in the complete fruition of the success which his genius,
courage, and confidence in his army had won, I thought that it
must have been from such a scene that men in ancient times
rose to the dignity of gods.”
Historians playing psychiatrist suggest that Lee was
so tightly repressed beneath his austerity that in combat his inner self
burst loose and drove him to attack against all reason. But
that implies lack of control, something that even Lee’s critics
rarely perceive. Their most telling example came after the
Confederate high point at Chancellorsville, when Lee launched his
last major invasion of the North.
When his troops bumped into Federals outside the town
of Gettysburg, Lee had no Jackson at his right hand. But he still had
the troops who had fought so magnificently two months earlier.
As he wrote after Chancellorsville, “There never were such
men in an army before. They will go anywhere and do anything if
properly led. . . . “ After two days of pounding, Lee sent
those troops across the open fields in the attack that history
remembers as Pickett’s Charge.
Two of my great-grandfathers were in that charge,
in the 53rd Virginia and the 7th North Carolina. More than once I have
stood
on Seminary Ridge where they spread out before moving across
those summer fields and tried to feel what they must have felt,
seeing the mass of Union battle flags waiting for them behind
the stone wall on Cemetery Ridge, watching the Union cannon
line up hub to hub, waiting. I have knelt behind that wall and
looked back the other way, wanting to see what the Yankees
saw as my grandfathers and 15,000 other Confederates kept on
coming as solid shot and canister tore holes in their long ranks
of gray. I have never been able to do it with dry eyes.
Lee’s critics asserted that on that July afternoon his
army had not been “properly led,” that he should not have attacked
there and then—and hindsight supports them. His assault was
opposed by his balky and argumentative corps commander, James
Longstreet, and then imperfectly coordinated. On the heels of
his grandest victory, Lee’s army was repulsed in the climactic
battle of the war.
He accepted the defeat as his own. To George Pickett,
mourning his division, Lee said, “Come, General Pickett . . . upon my
shoulders rests the blame. The men and officers of your command
have written the name of Virginia as high today as it has
ever been written before. . . . Your men have done all that men
could do; the fault is entirely my own.”
Through July 4, the whole next day, Lee kept his
command in place, organizing his retreat but seeming to glare across at
Union
Major General George G. Meade, daring him to renew the fight.
Even then, Meade refused to follow up with an attack that could
have demolished the Rebel army. The Confederates limped back to
Virginia.
Once again, Lee’s reputation for aggressiveness had
protected his army. But the next spring, Lincoln sent against him a
general
who saw the hard truth beyond that reputation: After three
years of war, Lee had no prospect of replacing his losses. And
he was hobbled strategically by his mission of protecting
Richmond.
When Ulysses S. Grant came east to take command of Union forces, he understood that Lee’s army, not the Confederate capital,
was his main objective—but the way to get at that army was to drive on to Richmond and pin Lee down in siege warfare.
Grant had little in common with Lee beyond a West
Point education and a high order of generalship. He was short, often
unkempt
in a private’s coat, wholly without the aura of dignity that
surrounded Lee even in midbattle. He chewed cigars, and sometimes
he drank. But he had a decisive mind, a stubborn will, and a
strategy.
When Grant started to carry it out in May 1864, Lee
made him pay a terrible price at the battles of the Wilderness and
Spotsylvania
Court House, near Fredericksburg. In the thickets, Lee had to
be restrained from personally leading troops in a desperate
charge. An anonymous poem told of it:
“There he stood, the grand old hero, great Virginia’s
god-like son/Second unto none in glory—equal of her Washington.” Texas
troops around him refused to go forward until he moved out of
harm’s way; one of them grabbed his horse’s reins. As he watched
them charge, his “god-like calm was shaken, which no battle
shock could move/By this true, spontaneous token of his soldiers’
child-like love.”
Lee’s troops, and poets afterward, may have seen him
as “god-like,” but Grant did not. Instead of pulling back after each
mauling as his predecessors had done, Grant drove on. In a
month, he lost almost 55,000 troops in a campaign that ground down
in the bloodbath of Cold Harbor, outside Richmond.
From there, Grant sideslipped south of the James River and Petersburg. That began the siege of Richmond—and as Lee himself
had said, once that happened, loss of the capital was only a matter of time.
During that last hard winter of war, too late to
change anything, Lee was made general in chief of all Confederate
forces.
In Richmond to plead for more supplies, he told his oldest son,
“Well, Mr. Custis, I have been up to see the Congress, and
they do not seem to be able to do anything except to eat
peanuts and chew tobacco, while my army is starving. . . . When this
war began I was opposed to it, bitterly opposed to it, and I
told these people that unless every man should do his whole duty,
they would repent it—and now, they will repent.”
After Lee’s final effort to break out of the
tightening noose, his thin lines were turned at last. On April 2, 1865,
he telegraphed
Jefferson Davis that Richmond must be evacuated. Retreating
westward, Lee groaned to Brigadier General Henry A. Wise over
what was happening to his country. Wise told him, “There has
been no country, General, for a year or more. You are the country
to these men. They have fought for you.”
Two days later, at the obscure village named Appomattox Court House, Grant’s divisions caught up with the disintegrating Army
of Northern Virginia.
From Grant came a note asking Lee to surrender, to prevent “any further effusion of blood.”
Lee at first refused. Then he learned that the Yankees
had circled ahead and cut off further flight. Hearing this, Lee said
to his aides, “Then there is nothing left for me to do but to
go and see General Grant, and I would rather die a thousand
deaths.”
The way Lee surrendered the last remnant of his army has contributed as much to his legend as has the way he fought the war.
Porter Alexander urged him to let his soldiers
scatter, perhaps to fight on as guerrillas. Lee said no; they would
become
marauders, stealing to survive, bringing on “a state of affairs
it would take the country years to recover from.” Alexander
wrote later: “He had answered my suggestion from a plane so far
above it, that I was ashamed of having made it.”
On April 9, Lee put on his best uniform, with a red
sash and engraved sword. “I have probably to be General Grant’s prisoner
and thought I must make my best appearance,” he said as he rode
toward the front before dawn on that Palm Sunday morning.
Lee met Grant at the home of a Virginian who had moved
away from Manassas to escape the war. Grant, whose toughness in the
West had won him the nickname “Unconditional Surrender,” was
generous at the end. He allowed Southern soldiers to take their
horses home for the spring plowing. At Lee’s request he ordered
rations for the famished Confederates.
Lee returned to his troops. Some were burning their
ragged battle flags rather than surrender them. They crowded to the
roadside
and reached out to touch his horse’s flanks as he rode past.
Some started to cheer him, then broke down in sobs. One held
up his arms and shouted, “I love you just as well as ever,
General Lee!” Tears welled in Lee’s eyes, the first those close
to him could remember seeing.
Last April, I walked again over that most hallowed
American ground, when the apple trees bloomed as they did that Sunday in
1865. I wondered what Lee must have been thinking. How far had
these men and boys marched while he rode, day after day, battle
after battle? How many others would still be living, at home in
peace, if he had not held them together fighting for so long?
How many hundreds of thousands of widows and fatherless
children, on both sides, wished now that he and those who followed
his lead had stood by the Stars and Stripes in 1861?
Lee dismounted, beside a great oak where he would tent
for the night, and turned about. “Men,” he said, “we have fought
through
the war together; I have done the best I could for you. . . .
Go home now, and if you make as good citizens as you have soldiers,
you will do well, and I will always be proud of you. Goodbye,
and God bless you.”
His throat was so full he could say no more.
The next morning, he and Grant had a quiet
conversation on a little knoll between the armies. Grant suggested that
no one
had greater influence in the Confederacy than Lee and that if
Lee advised surrender everywhere, others would comply. But Lee
said he could do no such thing without consulting President
Jefferson Davis.
Grant backed off: “I knew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas of what was right.”
Lee’s chief of staff drafted for him an order to the
army. Lee struck out a paragraph that “would tend to keep alive the
feeling
existing between North and South.” Then he signed his final
order, which ended, “With an increasing admiration of your constancy
and devotion to your country, and a grateful remembrance of
your kind and generous consideration of myself, I bid you an
affectionate
farewell.”
Union officers, friends from before the war, came to
shake his hand. In his tent, he dined on Confederate rations captured
by Federal cavalry, now reissued. Outside, a band played
“Parting Is Pain,” whose words say, “Now the Battle din is o’er.
. . . Useless now, our good swords lie. . . . “
Lee did not want to leave his troops, but he could not
bear to watch their formal surrender, when they marched past their
former enemies to stack arms for the last time. On April 12,
with his closest aides, he started back to Richmond in the rain.
Aside from bearing the weight of his leadership
role, Lee had suffered as much as most ordinary Southerners in the war.
His
home at Arlington was seized, its grounds turned into a Union
graveyard and a camp for thousands of freed slaves. One of his
daughters died of typhoid fever. One of his sons, the cavalry
general “Rooney,” was wounded at Brandy Station in 1863, then
captured and held prisoner for nine months.
Rooney’s plantation was occupied and ruined. The
oldest son, Custis, was captured in the war’s final week. The youngest,
Rob,
had fought as an enlisted artilleryman. Lee’s refugee wife,
crippled by arthritis, was threatened by Richmond’s evacuation
fire, then protected by Yankee soldiers.
A few days after Lee returned, the Northern
photographer Mathew Brady persuaded him to pose at the rear of the house
on Franklin
Street. In that likeness, Lee is tired, sunburned, dignified,
but his eyes still show a glint of defiance. He seems older
than his 58 years.
Lee the lifelong soldier did not know after Appomattox
how he would support himself and his family. Richmond friends sent
them bread, milk, and fruit. Lee turned down every invitation
to prosper by his name—to be president of the Chesapeake & Ohio
Railway; to command the Romanian army; to be governor of
Virginia; to write his memoirs—or merely sign them written by someone
else; to be president of insurance companies; to move into an
English manor house with an annual stipend.
That summer he accepted the presidency of tiny
Washington College in Lexington. There, at a school endowed by President
Washington
a lifetime earlier, he could help rebuild the Southern youth
that had been sacrificed to the lost cause. His annual salary
would be $ 1,500. James Branch Cabell, a Virginia author noted
for his blistering sarcasm toward others, wrote that “in a
life over-brimming with magnanimities, this was [Lee’s] most
heroic action.”
Controversy over war and reconstruction flared north
and south, but Lee stayed out of it, urging his former soldiers to be
good citizens of the reunited country. To General P.G.T.
Beauregard, he wrote, “I need not tell you.”
On an evening near the end of September 1870, Lee sat late at a vestrymen’s meeting in Lexington’s Grace Church. His last
gesture there was offering $ 55 of his own funds to raise the minister’s salary.
Then he walked home in a cold rain. When he opened his
mouth to say grace at the dinner table, no sound came. He had suffered
a stroke, and for two weeks the town and the South prayed for
his recovery. In his delirium, Lee thought he was back in the
field. He called for General A.P. Hill to move up. He talked
on, in and out of sleep. On the morning of October 12, he said
quietly, “Strike the tent,” and breathed his last.
He departed without writing the history of his army,
which he had wanted to memorialize his brave soldiers. Others wrote
their
history, and his own. His admirers renamed the college
Washington and Lee and still pay respect to his tomb there. For more
than 60 years, the skeleton of his horse Traveller stood
alongside.
Why this reverence for Lee persists, when our
country has produced so many other great generals whose wars ended in
victory,
would be no mystery to those who knew him. After his death,
they found in his military valise a scrap of paper on which he
had copied a passage that defines a gentleman. Whether he
originated those words or ever repeated them to his students in
his five years in Lexington is not known. But they clearly
speak for him..”
In Richmond, Lee’s equestrian memorial has towered
above Monument Avenue for more than a century. Perhaps it will be the
target of those who vandalized his picture. But it is not
marble or bronze that most provokes contrarians who want to diminish
Lee’s place in history. Their inspiration is the monumental
biography by a man who was said to salute Lee’s statue on his
way to work each morning—Richmond newspaper editor Douglas
Southall Freeman.
In four volumes published in the 1930s, Freeman
painstakingly detailed Lee’s life—and minimized his missteps. Freeman’s
index,
for example, lists Lee’s personal characteristics, from
Abstemiousness and Amiability through Good Looks and Humility to Thrift
and Wisdom; of the 150 qualities listed, barely 10 could be
construed as negative. That work won the Pulitzer Prize and has
influenced everything written about Lee since—and more than any
other honor paid the general, it has driven the search for
faults in his image.
During the early years of civil-rights strife, I
worked at the News Leader, which had been Freeman’s newspaper. I didn’t
stay
long; I felt that in Richmond, admiration of Lee and his
soldiers was too often equated with segregationist politics and a
past that was gone forever. They are not the same thing.
The fever of those years has eased only to rise again,
stirred by the flaunting of the Confederate colors. Today’s
intentionally
provocative flag wavers do not understand Lee any better than
those who defaced his picture. Most Americans who do know him,
in the South and in the nation, see him as a historic figure,
as a decent man and brilliant soldier, rather than as a figurehead
for those who would turn back the clock.
Researchers discover individual letters, sometimes
sentences within letters, that they cite to challenge that version. A
reviewer
of one of my books wrote that “Lee’s mental and moral confusion
made him a bloodstained traitor, one who did more damage to
his country than any other in the history of the United
States.” Other critics say he was not really against slavery, and
therefore his decision to go with Virginia in 1861 was not as
painful as some who venerated him insisted.
Legally, Lee and hundreds of thousands of others may
indeed have been traitors. Whether that was true morally, under the
circumstances
of their time, apparently will be debated forever. And Lee
certainly was no abolitionist. The bulk of his writing makes clear
that though he deplored slavery, he saw no better way at hand
and left the matter for God to settle. Remember that as late
as 1862 Abraham Lincoln, soon to become the Great Emancipator,
said that if he could save the Union while keeping slavery,
he would. Like so many lesser men, Lincoln and Lee were
complicated, pulled different ways on different days by roots, duty,
conscience, politics, strategy, all the tides of their time.
The chief finding of military analysts against Lee is
that he was too aggressive, which cost the South thousands of lives.
They say the Confederacy could have fought on much longer if he
had stood more often on the defensive, as he did at Fredericksburg.
But his pugnacity had made him seem dangerous, even when his
army was crippled. Otherwise, McClellan after Antietam or Meade
after Gettysburg might well have crushed his army and shortened
the war by many months. In posterity as in battle, Lee’s main
contender for honors was Grant—yet there was no bloodier
example of unwise attack than Grant’s 1864 assault on Lee’s lines
at Cold Harbor. Both commanders were superb generals. Neither
was perfect.
The idea of Lee as godlike hero is what rival generals
resented and revisionist historians challenge today. As one who
borrowed
boots to pretend to be Lee when I was ten, who as student,
infantryman, and writer has imagined walking with him for many
years since, I consider their criticisms a needed antidote to
the legend of his perfection. Those diligently discovered flaws
round out the whole truth of Lee’s stature as man and as
soldier. He had flaws because he was not a god but a complex human
being, torn within himself as tragically as the families whose
sons separated to fight for North and South—caught with his
country in the pivotal moment of American history.

Prior to joining Markel, he worked in-house and agency-side across UK, European, North American and Asia-Pacific markets.
Simon has over 15 years’ experience delivering insight driven strategies for brands as diverse as Shell, Allianz and Honda.With the MFLL (Music For Len Lye) show, the connections between these two pioneers of oppositional art reach a rewarding fruition. Brisbane-based curator David Pestorius is well placed to bring these two autodidacts together. A long-time follower and scribe of alternative/independent music, and an art lover and scholar, Pestorius mobilised his awareness of both Kuepper’s and Lye’s art (and status) in the realisation of MFLL.
Tusalava, Lye’s first, extraordinary film from 1928 (a black and white semi-abstract film featuring wriggling microbe-like shapes, laboriously cel-animated over 2 penurious years), is now silent. Originally performed with two pianos, the score, produced by Lye’s long-time friend, Australian Jack Ellitt, has long been lost to history. According to Pestorius, the combination of Lye’s interest in “the relation between the moving image and the movement of their accompanying music” and appreciation of the “very cinematic” dimensions of Ed Kuepper’s important solo work prompted Pestorius to approach Kuepper with a concept to add music to the films, not as a pre-recorded soundtrack, but live. Kuepper came to the project with little to no knowledge of Lye’s formidable legacy, but with his manifold connections to the visual art world and his musician’s meter, he instantly appreciated Lye’s remarkably kinetic work.
Kuepper says he was “inspired by the abstract rhythms” to create the music for Tusalava, and several other famous Lye animations. Rather than try to replicate the original soundtracks, which were deeply, generatively intertwined (a result of Lye’s obsession with synchronicity), Kuepper’s interpretation resulted in freer flowing, rock-inspired pieces for guitar and drums. The Lye Foundation granted permission to use Lye’s films and Music for Films was born.
Success in Brisbane, Melbourne and a show in Sydney at the Opera House brought numerous accolades for Music for Films in 2003. While some purists may prefer the original soundtracks, the adventurous Lye would probably have approved given the energy and spirit of the Kuepper collaborations, especially in the light of Stan Brakhage’s notion of the contemporary sound/avant-garde film performance as an entirely discrete form.
MFLL sees Kuepper continuing to develop music to accompany moving images but this time for specially commissioned short video art pieces by high profile international artists. When, in 2004, the Lye Foundation chose to withdraw permission to screen the films, both Pestorius and Kuepper wanted to continue the project, and so a number of artists were contacted to produce video works. Each artist was provided with examples of Kuepper’s more cinematic music (including those pieces devised for Music For Films) and invited to produce imagery in response. Kuepper was then presented with the videos, from which he devised the final music for the program. MFLL features drumming by long term collaborator Jeffrey Wegener, with whom Kuepper played in 80s experimental “jazz-punk” band The Laughing Clowns. They were joined by cellist Jane Elliot for the most recent performance at the Queensland Music Festival.
The international video artists’ work is brilliant, contributing to the show’s appeal to European audiences (it toured to Berlin, Vienna and Paris to widespread acclaim). French artist Dominique Gonzales-Foerster is as highly sought after as she is selective—her very presence is a coup. Her video piece, After Len Lye’s Free Radicals, is an exceptional digital work, mastering subtle organic forms in 3D animation. One of only a few works to refer directly to Lye, its sparing visual quotation of Free Radicals’ white-on-black scratches teams beautifully with Wegener’s tribal tom drums, echoing the African drums of Lye’s original and creating a sublime, referential—even reverential—artwork. Liam Gillick’s anarchic theme-park work, Public Information Film, is also delightful; a colourful, ironic statement (given that Disney is widely acknowledged to have appropriated Lye’s work for Fantasia) scored with jaunty verve by Kuepper’s fast paced playing and Wegener’s merry rhythms.
The Australian work is also of very high calibre. Eugene Carchesio’s video piece continues the organic minimalism for which he is feted in his visual art and experimental music. For Ian Burn is composed of a single fixed take of a window from which can be seen gently swaying trees. The contrast between the unyielding horizontals of the blinds and the shimmering leaf and bark shapes beyond creates a meditative experience of opposites, enhanced by subdued but resonant music.
Janet Burchill and Jennifer McCamley’s video, Pangaea, also stands out for its conceptual clarity. Multiple layers of lapping waters and map outlines converge and dissolve; we see a ship sliding past, some quick night-vision shots, and bands of intersecting colours appear and disappear. As Kuepper’s jubilant guitar soars, accompanied by itself (thanks to a synthesiser device enabling multiple tracks) and Wegener’s throbbing drums, text appears: ‘Manus Island.’ In an instant, an array of associations strikes, about boats, water, Australia, the Pacific and ‘solutions’; with the musical crescendo, contemplation is inevitable, fittingly reflective of the music that was initially created for Tusalava, right at the beginning of the project.
Music For Len Lye is both a homage and a dedication to Len Lye (the music is ‘for’ Len), and also a description (the music began as scores for Lye films). Cleverly, it also conjures up MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer’s “LLMF’ (“Live Like A Motherfucker”). When asked about the process of making music Kuepper described it as “fairly intuitive initially, then (with) an element of intellectual appraisal later to see if my intuition was correct.” Judging by the success of the shows, it undoubtably was.

He first got in to design in 2010 when he came across photoshop on his family’s computer. After teaching himself the basics from watching YouTube videos, he realized he had a real passion for design and decided to go back to school that next semester. Always a creative person, he was able to learn the science/art of design fairly quick and plunged head first in to creating in various forms from artwork, clothing to visuals and everything in-between.
ELEVN10 takes great pride in our work & the details that go in to every single project. In a world where our attention is pulled in so many different directions at once, the proper presentation of elements is more important than ever. We truly enjoy helping bring people's visions to life, value the relationships built and understand that every project is a collaborative effort between ELEVN10 and the client. Our design style is a balance between minimal and urban which allows us to work with companies and individuals of all backgrounds. We specialize in logos, flyers, brochures, merch, banners, album artwork, and branding in the print and digital format but are always ready to take on a new challenge and expand our skill set.
SNO. was recognized by AAF-Louisville and given a “Silver Louie” for his work in elements of advertising.

ELEVN10 is also the home to streetwear brand BRKEMGL$. Inspired by hip hop, art, culture and life. The brand was created through a partnership with SNO. and his best friend C in 2014 when they released the inaugural collection.

The section defines as to who can apply for a PAN card, what all is required for someone to be able to apply for PAN, how the allotment of PAN is to be done, the transactions and business dealings where the parties involved should declare their PAN, how PAN is to be used in TDS certificates and returns, conditions that one individual can possess one PAN, and how an application for PAN allotment is to be made.
Rule number 114 in the Income Tax Rules, 1962 lays down the manner in which PAN application is to be made. In 2003, this rule got amended and also defined the guidelines about the documents whose copies are to be submitted as proofs of identity and address, along with the application for a PAN.
Rule number 114B presents a list of all those transactions in which a PAN number should be quoted. For all those who do not have a PAN, there is a provision that they can furnish a declaration in form number 60. Also, rule number 114C enlists all those persons for whom the section 139A does not hold. Such persons exempt from compulsory quoting of PAN are those who can furnish form 61 to show agricultural income, and Government bodies and Consular Offices, when they are making the payments.
Under section 272B, a penalty of Rs 10,000 can be levied on defaulters who fail to comply with the guidelines in Section 139A.Here at Lake Forest Optometry, schedule an appointment, please don’t hesitate to call us today at (949) 581-6880!Coronavirus Business Disruption Checklist More +Store Hours:

The performances begin at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Feb. 13 and 14. Tickets are $10 for adults and $5 for children and seniors, with Antioch College students admitted free.
This year’s event will feature an eclectic range of dance styles — including street dance, belly dance, modern dance, folk and jazz, among others — performed by local dancers with various levels of expertise and experience. Some pieces include “Our American Skin” created by event co-founder Valerie Blackwell-Truitt as a statement against racism and set to Bruce Springsteen’s “American Skin (41 Shots);” “Roses Have Thorns,” a piece by Marybeth Wolf about violence against women and set to Croatian vocal music; “Chair Dancin,” a trio by Jill Becker choreographed for the 1933 classic, “Let’s Fall in Love,” and “Rosas Danst Roses” (“We Dance Ourselves”) by Melissa Heston for the “Fabuleus Rosas Remix Project,” an international re-staging of the modern dance first presented in Belgium in 1983 and described by a New York Times critic as “ a mesmerizing, exploration in synchronicity, patterning and rhythm.”
Other choreographers and groups represented in the concert will be Greta Hill, Leslie Dworkin, Victoria Walters, Tricia Gelmini, Savanna Amos and the Egyptian Breeze belly dance troupe. Co-producers of the event are Thomas, Wolf and Heston, with help from Becker and Laryssa Ingebo.

The corps explained that the warning was in the overall interest of those concerned and had become necessary so as to reduce or totally put a stop to avoidable carnage during the ember months and the coming festive season.
Sector Commander in the state,
Corps Commander Elizabeth Funmilayo Akinlade, said while flagging off the year 2020 Ember Months Campaign of the commission in Ado Ekiti that all forms of deliberate recklessness would not be tolerated.
According to her, motorists and okada riders alike must guide against road traffic offences such as drunkenness, overloading, dangerous overtaking, kid driving, use of worn out tyres, and refusal to obey traffic lights or signs, as the commission would not take kindly with anyone caught.
“This is in line with the corporate strategy of FRSC to minimise the risk of deaths in road traffic: reduce RTC by 15% and fatality by 20%”, she said.
She added that it was also in line with the Road Safety Headquarters’, (RSHQ, operational order for 2020 Ember Months Campaign with the theme: ” Drive Safe, Stay Safe”.
The Sector Commander said the campaign was targeted at inducing the best global road use practises into the the people of the State.
She said it was also to reawaken the consciousness of all road users on the need to drive safe and stay safe, ” as we approach the yuletide season and the new year.”
DAILY POST reports that high points of the flag off include acting of a playlet both in English language and local dialects so as to get the message across to the target audience.
The event also was witnessed the distribution of flyers and goodwill messages from the representatives of various bodies present.
The Deputy Speaker of House of Assembly, Hakeem Jamiu, who stood in for the state governor, commended the corps for its efforts at reducing road crashes in the state, with a promise to continue to support its operations.

Pleasant's Page All Soccer - Girls StoriesWhen you control time of possession 90 percent of the time you're going to win the game 99 times out of 100. On Thursday afternoon from Community Memorial Stadium the Mt. Pleasant girls soccer team turned in an absolutely dominating performance as it owned possession en route to a 5-0 rout over Saginaw Valley League Conference foe Bay City Central. With the victory the Oilers (10-7-2) advance to Saturday's Division 2 home district final. They will host Cadillac, which beat Petoskey 2-1 Thursday, at 11 a.m. from Community Memorial Stadium. Cadillac beat the Oilers 3-1 a couple weeks back, but that was then and this is now. As for Thursday's win the Oilers controlled the tempo from the opening kick till the final whistle. "We came out with some purpose and some focus and did what we needed to do," said Oiler head coach John Bunting. "Our goal was to be a bit more efficient and to connect on the offensive end which we did. We also got in the entire roster which was what we wanted because everyone has been working hard and everyone has helped get us to this point." The Oilers opened the scoring at the 32:12 mark of the opening half when senior Millie Randall blasted home a shot from 25 yards out to make it 1-0. Some seven minutes later Randall upped the ante to 2-0 as she turned in a ball-possession skill seminar at the top of the 18. Randall baffled numerous defenders before turning and driving home a high shot into the back of the twine. With 43 seconds left to go in the opening half junior Olivia Laing broke in alone and closed the first-half scoring out at 3-0 with a shot to the short corner. The Oilers and Wolves played even through the first 20 minutes of the second half before freshman Maddie McBride scored her first varsity goal off a corner to make it 4-0 with 18:52 left in regulation. Six minutes later senior Cassidy Morkin headed in a corner to close the scoring out at 5-0. While Bunting was happy with Thursday's result he knows in order to win a district title and advance into the regional round his team is going to have to play at its best Saturday. "We know (Cadillac) scores a lot of goals so we're going to have to shut down some of their scorers," said Bunting looking ahead. "Playing home on the turf is going to make for a fast game. It's going to be a good matchup between two very different teams, we're more passing and technical where they're more physical and run and gun. We'll see how those differences match up."

Eddie Howe, Steven Gerrard and Dean Smith will take charge of their latest clubs for the first time, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fights to come back from another chastening loss and Antonio Conte attempts to stamp his authority on his Tottenham team.
Here, the PA news agency takes a look at some of the taking points surrounding he weekend’s games.
Ole on the brink?
Recommended
Manchester United head for Watford on Saturday with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s future a matter for concerted debate. The Norwegian has prepared for the game amid speculation that Leicester counterpart Brendan Rodgers is being lined up for his job with his side having won only one of its last six Premier League games, a run which includes comprehensive home defeats by arch-rivals Liverpool and Manchester City. Anything other than victory at Vicarage Road could prove the final straw.
Howe’s it going?
Eddie Howe will get his first taste of life in charge at Newcastle when Brentford arrive at St James’ Park for what already looks like a must-win encounter for the Magpies’ new head coach. Eleven league games have come and gone without a victory and a return of only five points has left them sitting in 19th place by virtue only of goal difference. Home clashes with the Bees, bottom-of-the-table Norwich and 18th-placed Burnley in three of their next four fixtures represent an opportunity, and one which they cannot afford to pass up.
Welcome to the jungle
Howe is not the only man taking to a different dug-out this weekend. New Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard will send his side into battle at home to Brighton, while predecessor Dean Smith will swap Villa Park for Carrow Road when he launches his spell as Norwich boss against Southampton. But spare a thought for Ralph Hasenhuttl, who has had to prepare the Saints to face Smith’s new charges having also pitted his wits against him in his last game as Villa manager. He would happily settle for the same result, a 1-0 Southampton win.
Harry Hot-spur
Marcelo Bielsa could have been forgiven for groaning his way through the international break as Harry Kane helped himself to no fewer than seven goals to take his England tally to 48. The Tottenham frontman had found the back of the net only once in seven games in all competitions for his club before plundering a hat-trick in a 5-0 World Cup qualifier win over Albania and then going one better in a 10-0 demolition of minnows San Marino. Bielsa’s Leeds head for North London on Sunday, when they will hope Kane’s goal-rush has dried up.
Gunning for the Reds
Recommended
Improving Arsenal face the biggest test of their resurgence since a 5-0 horror show at Manchester City in August when they head for Liverpool hoping to further dent the Reds’ title credentials. Mikel Arteta’s men are unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions since the debacle at the Etihad Stadium and sit just two points adrift of their fourth-placed hosts, who lost 3-2 at West Ham last time out. However, the opposition this weekend represents a significant step up inPopular Terms

The goal of the Code of Conduct is to help create an environment that fosters participation and community. Our intention is to destigmatize reporting. Both are core to creating a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. Following the Agreements that define the work of the McKensie Mack Group, we acknowledge that no space can be completely “safe” and we agree to work together towards harm reduction, centering those most affected by injustice in the room.
Because violations of this code outside BitCurator Consortium (BCC) community spaces may affect a person’s ability to participate in community events, we take an expansive view of “participants” and “events.” Our community’s Code of Conduct applies to all participants, including leadership, and all forms of participation in BCC community events, including, but not limited to, persons from member and non-member organizations acting in the capacity of an organizer, speaker, sponsor, participant, or attendee at any BitCurator Consortium event, where events include public in-person or virtual discussions during workshops, presentations, community calls, BitCurator-adjacent social events, committee meetings, or other events; and interactions include virtual chats and discussion spaces, community listservs, and social media.
Standards of Conduct
The BitCurator Consortium is dedicated to creating an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free community for everyone regardless of age, appearance or body size, employment or military status, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, individual lifestyles, marital status, national origin or immigration status, physical or cognitive ability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, race, or religion. The BCC will not tolerate harassment of or by members or guests of the community in any form. Harassment is any unwelcome or offensive verbal or written comments or nonverbal expressions intended to intimidate a person or make them feel unwelcome or uncomfortable; this also includes repeated interactions with a person after they have made it clear that further interaction is unwelcome. Harassment can occur both in person or virtually, and will not be tolerated in any form.
Examples of positive behavior:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Respecting and valuing the contributions of all members of the community, regardless of status or role
- Showing empathy towards other community members
Examples of harassing and unwelcomed behavior:
- Verbal comments or “jokes” that reinforce social structures of domination and oppression
- Repeatedly misgendering a person or disregarding their pronouns
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
Code of Conduct Violations
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you have three options: reporting via the Code of Conduct Report Form (includes anonymous option), contacting the Code of Conduct team via email at conduct@bitcuratorconsortium.org, or contacting any of the team members directly.
Reports submitted through the Form or the Code of Conduct email address will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct team, which includes:
- Elvia Arroyo-Ramirez, elvia.ar@uci.edu
- Kelly Bolding, kbolding@princeton.edu

- Hannah Wang, hannah.wang@educopia.org
- Lauren Work, lw2cd@virginia.edu
In any report, you may include:
- What happened, where, and when, including any supporting information you may have
- Who was involved
- Any members of the Code of Conduct team you’d like to not be involved with your report
- What you would like to see happen, including follow-up from the Code of Conduct team
- Your contact information
Include as much detail as you are comfortable with. This will help the Code of Conduct team to determine next steps. The team will take all reports seriously, regardless of the amount of information shared.
Immediately following any report of Code of Conduct violations, the Code of Conduct team will assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe to the greatest extent possible. The Code of Conduct team, in consultation with any event monitors who received the report or witnessed the event, will then determine what further action may be necessary. This group will do everything possible to keep reports in confidence, in accordance with any applicable host site and platform policies.
The report taker or other member of the Program Committee, Executive Council, or Educopia staff will communicate any follow-up actions to the reporter, if they have chosen to share their contact information with the Code of Conduct team. At the discretion of the Code of Conduct team’s assessment of the severity of the violation, actions may include one or more of the following:
- Discussing what happened and why it was harmful
- Requiring that a participant stops their behavior
- Issuing a formal warning
- Requiring that a participant prevents further contact with certain other participants
- Removing a participant from BCC event
- Banning a participant from any future BCC events
- Making a report to a participant’s place of work to inform them of the incident/behavior
- Making a report to relevant authorities,* if necessary and desired by person harmed
- No action (if the harasser cannot be identified, or the Code of Conduct team determines no action is necessary to preserve the safety of the community)
* Involving law enforcement is not our preferred approach but in extreme cases it may be necessary. Please consider the varied relationships that different communities have with law enforcement before involving them in a situation.
Privacy Disclaimer, Data Protection, and Host Policies
The BitCurator Consortium takes privacy and transparency seriously.
Educopia uses Airtable for the Code of Conduct Report Form. Their data privacy and retention statements are available here. Emails sent to conduct@bitcuratorconsortium.org may be retained by Google. Emails sent directly to Code of Conduct team members may fall under public records laws and organizational records retention policies.
Hosts of physical events may have their own Codes of Conduct that BCC members and attendees will be expected to adhere to. BCC members may be mandatory reporters within the bounds or policies of their home institutions. Companies that have developed and host platforms used during BCC events, such as Zoom, may have expectations and requirements for conduct. See, for instance, Zoom’s Acceptable Use Policy and Reporting Abusive Behavior.

With this cliff hanger, the terrible thing does happen to our hero, but he walks away from it unharmed. This cliff hanger can also be found in the Batman serials, as well as The Green Hornet serials, and Captain Marvel (although in that one it makes sense, he really is an indestructible man.)
Quick Facts
Released in 1937
Directed by Ray Taylor and Alan James
Written by Morgan Cox, George Morgan, Barry Shipman, and Winston Miller
Starring Ralph Byrd, Carleton Young, and Kay Hughes
Basic Story Line
Dick Tracy cracks a criminal organization, known as the Spider Ring, that kidnapped his brother, Gordon Tracy, and through an experimental brain surgery, turned him into one of their henchmen.
Dick Tracy is an iconic character that deserves, and for most part gets, a cool serial.
Today, Dick Tracy, is not as well known as some of his comic contemporaries, but he is one of those few characters that has crossed into almost every medium. Created by Chester Gould, he was first published as a comic strip in 1931. He then crossed into radio, film serials, and movies. Dick Tracy moved into both live action and animated television, as well as novels and graphic novels. He briefly returned to the spotlight in 1990 with a Warren Beatty film. Other projects were planned but the name fell into legal limbo and Dick Tracy fell off the radar. Other than Chester Gould, the name most associated with the character Dick Tracy is Ralph Byrd. He starred in all four Republic serials, two of the four RKO movies, and the 1950s television series.
There are a lot of cool things in the Dick Tracy serial. Serials are action based – usually this means fight scenes, but although Dick gets into several fights, it is the chase scenes that are the stand outs. There are car chases, boat chases and even plane chases. He pole-vaults over fences, runs along ledges, and swings from ropes. Even though some of the resolutions are weak, there are some interesting cliff hangers. At one point he is in a boat being crushed between two massive ships, in another cliff hanger he finds himself in a flaming zeppelin, at another point he is about to have his brain tinkered with by a mad scientist. The film makers use models of planes, buildings, bridges, and boats to achieve some of their effects and give Dick Tracy a grander scope than the budget of a serial can usually achieve. This serial also has what most good serials need: a cool villain.
There is a mixed bag of characters in this serial. Some of the villains are strong. Our main villain is The Lame One, a twisted man who stays in the shadows. He has a hunch backed mad scientist named Moloch. Moloch is useful at the beginning when he performs brain surgery on Gordon Tracy and at the end when he almost operates on Dick; other than that he spends most of his time petting the cat. Dick Tracy’s side has a bumbling and pointless comic relief sidekick named Mike McGurk. He also has Gwen, his lab technician, a progressive female character who is intelligent, competent and never once needs to be rescued. Finally we have Gordon Tracy who, after undergoing Moloch’s surgery, becomes as twisted and scarred as our villains.
The writers fail to capitalize on the potential of the brother versus brother idea they introduce. For the most part Dick and Gordon fail to even recognize each other. It also causes credibility issues. Dick tells his superior that his brother has been kidnapped by The Spider Ring and he wants to be put on the case full time. He is granted his request and given all the resources he needs, instead of the correct response, which should have been, “No! You’re too close. I’m taking you off the case. It’s become personal.” The story line does pay off in the final chapter giving the Dick Tracy serial one of the most satisfying endings I have seen in a serial.
Serials are generally written and shot on a tight schedule and a limited budget. This means that things that are envisioned don’t always have the smoothest of executions. The “spider brand” is an example of that. The script says that the spider shaped light that is shined on the victims of the Spider Ring actually burns into their skin and brands them. In practice it just looks like someone is pointing a flashlight at them. This also leads to inconsistencies as both Death Valley Johnny and Dick Tracy get hit with the spider brand but neither carries the scar. Another plot hole that crops up, likely do to budgetary and time constraints, is that Dick Tracy finds both of The Lame Ones hideouts (Which you discover in the last chapter are actually right next to each other and connected by a tunnel.) Despite this the villains continues to use the same hideouts unimpeded.
The serial does not have the grit or edge that the comic strip or the radio show had but it is entertaining to watch and a worthy installment in the Dick Tracy cannon.
Things to watch for
-Dick Tracy fights a man armed with a blowtorch.
The Back Row Weekly Serial Drinking Game
While watching a serial, anytime you or a friend point out a plot hole or inconsistency, take a drink. (Note: The character of Death Valley Johnny surviving a point blank shot is not a plot hole or inconsistency. The fact that while in the hospital he is lucid and vivacious one moment and comatose the next, is.)

:max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/burnt-sugar-syrup-2k-57bbd0695f9b58cdfdb3b5eb.jpg)
Diana Rattray
The burnt sugar syrup flavors this old time favorite cake. It's a 2-layer cake filled and frosted with burnt sugar frosting.
Ingredients
- For the Burnt Sugar Syrup:
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- For the Burnt Sugar Cake:
- 3 cups cake flour (sift before measuring)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)
- 1 1/4 cups sugar
- 3 eggs (at room temperature)
- 1/2 cup burnt sugar syrup
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- For the Burnt Sugar Frosting:
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 pound confectioners' sugar (about 3 1/2 cups, sifted)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup burnt sugar syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- Garnish: pecan halves
Steps to Make It
Burnt Sugar Syrup
Gather the ingredients.
Melt 3/4 cup sugar in a skillet over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it turns into a rich amber color.
Turn off heat, and very carefully add the boiling water. The mixture will spatter at first.
Return the syrup to low heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until the sugar and water are thoroughly mixed and smooth, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Set aside to cool to room temperature.
Burnt Sugar Cake
Gather the ingredients.
Adjust rack to lower third of oven; preheat the oven to 350 F.
Grease and flour two 9-inch layer cake pans. Line pans with buttered parchment or waxed paper rounds.
Sift together flour, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt; set aside.
Cream butter until smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and continue creaming until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition until well blended. To the 1/2 cup of burnt sugar syrup add enough water to make 1 cup; stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla.
Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture alternately with the burnt sugar syrup-water mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Beat until well blended and smooth. Divide the batter between the 2 cake pans.
Bake the cakes for about 25 minutes, or until the surface springs back slightly when lightly touched in the center with a finger. The cakes will contract slightly from the sides of the pans.
Cool 10 minutes in the pan on wire racks, then invert the cakes onto the racks. Carefully peel off paper liners; turn baked side up, and cool completely before frosting.
Fill and frost with Burnt Sugar Frosting (instructions below) and decorate with whole pecan halves.
Burnt Sugar Frosting
Gather the ingredients.
Cream 1/4 cup unsalted butter until light and fluffy.
Sift the confectioners' sugar with the 1/4 teaspoon of salt.
Gradually beat the confectioners' sugar mixture into the butter with the remaining 1/4 cup Burnt Sugar Syrup and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Continue beating until creamy and spreadable. If the mixture is stiff, add water, about 1 teaspoon at a time.

I discovered distance running in my late 30s and so much so it drove me to run marathons - 4 of them exactly.
My best race was Pittsburgh, 3:48 h:m. My worst was Charlotte - Thunder Road they call it and it about killed me. In total, I ran 104.4 marathon miles. After Charlotte, I literally had had enough. I hung up my metals and stopped running completely. It was no fun anymore.
Being a ‘marathon runner’ is a lifestyle. It consumes you. Eat and run. Eat and run. It’s constant. And unless you are willing to live that lifestyle completely, it will ruin you. Kind of like running a business- though I don’t want to get ahead of myself.
Then 2020 happened and a book called 80/20 Running found me - usually that’s what happens, books find me. And I started running again. After several months, my mileage was hovering around 3 miles per run and I was really enjoying it again...did I mention I am insanely competitive?
Yes, my competitive brain was starting to think about another marathon...a fifth...that would be cool. I talked myself up about it…
Well if I am going to do something that big again, maybe I should think about other massive goals to train for...oooo maybe an Iron Man! Or I am really into ping pong right now, maybe win a ping pong tournament? At that moment, I was running alongside the 14 fairway of the golf course that surrounds my neighborhood...why not win a golf tournament??
And I began a process of elimination over several weeks of debate, analysis and research and I decided on golf - train and win a golf tournament in 2022.
I signed up at the golf course, I dusted my golf clubs off and started practicing and working on my game at the end of 2020.
At the same time, the effects of the Pandemic had a profound effect on my business. Being that we were 20 years old, means that we lived and survived the recession in 2008.
April 2020 had many of the same signs as Oct of 2008. We had been here before and we prepared ourselves and our employees for a series of decisions that would ultimately position the company to exit 2020 and enter 2021 better, stronger, more profitable and with zero debt.
Some of it was luck, some of it was circumstance and much of it was because we were team able to make critical decisions at the right time.
Our business is in the automotive industry and many of the realities pre-2020 are simply not realities in 2021. We have recognized that we have to fundamentally change our business model to survive and continue to thrive. And you might be thinking, WOW after 20 years of business that’s got to be really hard - and yes it is and here’s the reality - this is our third major course change in our history or you might say it's our third stage of evolution.
Ironically, my business AND my golf game are going through massive changes as we speak heading into 2022. And the next decision or the next golf swing will determine how successful the future will be.
Being a business owner, like a marathon runner or someone who wants to win a golf tournament is all consuming. It’s a lifestyle that takes patience, perseverance, and a Practice.
This is what my TEDxCrawfordRoad talk is all about. I developed a methodology out of my golf practice that applies to any major goal in life, whether running a business or running a marathon. It’s my BOLD SOLUTION and I hope you can join us on November 13 for TEDxCrawfordRoad.Merle Haggard’s Museum is Coming to Nashville
Everybody loved the 'Hag' and it's pretty awesome that plans are in the works to honor him with a museum and more in Nashville...
Merle Haggard is one of the most iconic country music singers and songwriters of all time. Rolling Stone and Billboard magazines both named him the number one country entertainer of all-time. It's great to see that his contributions to the music world are going to be displayed in a very special way.
Bill and Shannon Miller, the founders of Icon Entertainment Group have teamed with Merle Haggard’s family to make plans for the new Merle Haggard Museum and Merle’s Meat + 3 Saloon to be built in Music City.
Visitors will be treated to some great food and drink at Merle’s Meat + 3 Saloon on the ground level, with the Merle Haggard Museum on an upper floor which will showcase memorabilia such as performance wardrobes, instruments, professional and personal possessions along with interactive exhibits.
Theresa Haggard said...'The world lost one of the greatest country singers of all time and I lost the love of my life when Merle Haggard died on his 79th birthday April 6, 2016. Now, nearly one and half years later, I have partnered with my friends Bill and Shannon Miller, owners of the acclaimed Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline Museums to open the Merle Haggard Museum. Merle would be very happy knowing that his museum will be next door to his dear friend Johnny Cash. Merle Haggard Museum and Merle’s Meat + 3 Saloon will be located at 121 Third Avenue South in Nashville and is projected to open in the summer of 2018.I’m early enough in my career to comfortably admit my errors, but there’s a difference between being wrong and acting appropriately on wrong information. Errors occur when what should have been done was not done. In the case of hypertension, I made recommendations based on what experts had recommended. Then those recommendations changed. And changed again.
This is why doctors still have regular homework to do. I explain it to my patients sometimes—and my trainees often—when they ask me questions I can’t answer. Practice groups like mine often have journal clubs to discuss the latest recommendation or studies in medical literature. However, the amount of medical information continues to grow, and the rate of growth makes staying up to date seem laughable.
Recently, I was asked to lead one of these sessions in my primary care clinic, and I chose to review the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guidelines. Knowing my fellow primary care physicians weren’t likely to read an almost 500-page document, I e-mailed everyone a link to a much more manageable summary in Annals: “Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults: Synopsis of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Hypertension Guideline” (1). We discussed the controversy of the original trials, whether guidelines can be applied to our older patients or those with diabetes or kidney disease. The conversation mirrored many of the concerns that were voiced by authors of the Annals editorial (2) accompanying the summary article. It was nice to dip back into academic discourse after so many tasks as a primary care physician have started to make me feel like a box-checker. However, the issue of checking those boxes nonetheless snuck back into our journal club conversation, driven not only by what goals to target for our patients, but also what targets we would be measured on administratively.
This was because with homework comes tests and grades. In this analogy, each patient is like a question on a test, and the overall grade is based on the number of “correct answers” (correct management decisions across the population of patients we are assigned to care for), scored against evidence-based or expert-supported recommendations, such as those contained in the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines.
Like all tests, the goal is to measure performance and identify insufficiencies needing remediation. But perhaps unlike most other tests, which measure individual performance as an end in and of itself, such tests of physician performance aspire to 2 ends: patients receive the most appropriate care, and we do our best in delivering that care.
To achieve both ends, the medical community must address a number of questions: What is the best way to measure “change over time” when physicians are graded every month on an absolute number? How can we promote “patient-centered care” when dynamics are complicated by the fact that grades determine things like physicians’ personal bonuses? How should we accommodate other factors that influence behavior (e.g., limitations on time spent in clinical visits)? Looks like we still have some homework to do.

I believe the administrative oversight of physicians' work, and the obsession with constant testing and grading is overkill and way excessive. It contributes to professional burnout for sure. Even the boards should be voluntary, not mandatory. Physicians spend a lot of time studying in medical school, residency, and throughout their careers, trying to stay abreast constantly. In addition, they are asked to accumulate CME credits on an annual basis. Isn't all that enough? I think it is more than enough. For the most part, physicians are responsible people. And they will never be perfect. Who is? And to try to justify this excessive and increasing burden of more and more regulations, and more and more testing saying that the pubic demands it is at best disingenuous. Patients love or dislike their doctors for different reasons, not lack of MOC or lack of CME course attendance. If there is a factor that directly correlates with the quality of medical care provided is not more testing or symposia on physician burnout, but limiting the number of patients we see in a day, and using scribes to help out with EHR. Practicing physicians, not clueless administrators and/or bureaucrats should be in control and in charge of our medical practices,
Dr. Gonz, thank you for reading! I agree that the measurement is certainly one of the sources of physician dissatisfaction with the workplace. As a VA physician, I see this kind of box-checking entering my clinical conversations frequently, as I described in this piece. I do think it's important to be able to establish and hold ourselves to high clinical standards. I'm not sure I have an answer to balancing these goals, but I'm optimistic that in light of the recent CMS proposed rules about billing, we may be in an era where the regulatory bodies are listening to our plight. Keep advocating! (And keep reading! Thanks!)I just looked out my window and saw that there are utility workers outside patching up my street for what feels like the millionth time. I live on West Ave just south of Edison Middle school. I live on one of the busiest sections of West Ave because people take this section of the street from 41st through to Edison every morning to drop of their kids and then on to Sanford Hospital to go to work. They also take it back from Sanford to pick up their kids then on to 41st to pick up the Interstate to head home. Edison is one of the more popular schools to open enroll into, as well as the where the honors students from the Challenge Center get placed after completing elementary school. My point being that there is a lot of traffic on my street.
Last summer every street in my surrounding neighborhood got grated and resurfaced except mine. Only West Avenue, the busiest street on the block was left out of the plan to be grated and resurfaced last summer. Now the city planners can tell me that they have plans to re-grate and resurface West Ave this summer, or next summer, or whenever, but our road is so pock-marked with potholes and is so rough and horrible with patch jobs, it is pathetic. The utility people out there will never be able to do a good enough job to make West Ave really drivable. What should have happened is, years ago, West Ave should have been grated and resurfaced. Way back when it became obvious that people were beginning to use it as a main thoroughfare — back before our “town” became a “city”. Actually, we should be ready for our second regrating and resurfacing. Only, here we are, waiting for the powers that be to wake up and realize that our not-so-little Avenue is in desperate need of attention.4.3
Introduction on MOS Approaches for KMA Digital Forecast
KMA digital forecast was born from USA' digital forecast, NDFD, but there is a distinct difference. While USA digital forecast being be produced by a spatial editing procedure in most, KMA digital forecast is finalized through three steps which are point forecasting, objective analysis to convert point forecast to gridded forecast and trimming gridded forecast. Therefore, the process of the point forecast can greatly influence on the forecast accuracy.
To improve the digital forecast accuracy, several objective guidance are provided for forecaster, such as directive interpretation of NWP products, PPM and MOS. Usually MOS is regarded as the best guidance among the three guidance and MOS guidance is prepared for eight elements in twelve elements in KMA digital forecast.
In view of objective analysis, more points of forecast guidance shows better gridded forecast. But MOS can be implemented only at observation point. There are 103 synoptic observation stations in Korean peninsula and the number can not meet the resolution of KMA digital forecast, 5km. KMA adapted two approaches to overcome this problem.
One approach is enlargement of point of MOS by including AWS(Automatic Weather Station) which is a kind of mesonet and a typical unmanned operation. The good quality of observation is essential to MOS accuracy and KMA picked up 150 AWS well managed. Temperature and probability of precipitation MOS were implement at about 250 point whose spatial resolution is 20km which is tolerable in KMA digital forecast. The temperature accuracy at the AWS was a little lower than that at the synoptic station when the MOS equations were verified with independent sample.
The other approach is regional MOS equation. AWS was designed for monitoring severe weather and equipped 3 to 5 instruments. Therefore some elements such as RH and sky cover are not observed at the synoptic station whose spatial resolution is too coarse to meet the requirement of digital forecast. For these elements, a regional MOS equation was derived and applied at each grid point in the same region.
MOS in KMA is basically developed with multiple linear regressions between predictor and predictand and the best set of predictors is screened from numerous predictors by stepwise selection method. Several additional techniques were embedded to improve MOS accuracy. MOS is one of statistical model and the MOS can remove out the systemic error of NWP during sampling period. But NWP can not always simulate perfectly and it can predict deadly wrong scenario. This case data may contribute to make NWP meaningless or MOS prediction to merge to climatic value. Therefore clearly wrong cases in NWP prediction sample were excluded when MOS equations were derived. This technique worked well on POP because we can easily find out wrong prediction such as a dry sunny prediction for rainy day.
For sky cover, preprocess and post process were developed. Sky cover in digital forecast is forecasted in four categories which are clear, scatter, broken and overcast. This element is not fully continuous value. More worse is that the frequency is concentrated at the both sides categories. When this element was applied at simple linear regression, the derived equation tended to predict only median categories. This problem was removed with the modification of element definition. The cases of median categories in observation were excluded in the sample and the both sides categories were evaluated as 0 and 1 respectively. This method resolved the problem dramatically. Finally MOS prediction and corresponding observation were compared to find out optimum threshold to convert law MOS prediction to final MOS prediction. This process is called by post process.
These techniques mentioned above seem to be artificial, but the verification consistently showed the improvement of MOS. The detailed result will be present at the conference.Gifts

I recommend that you read it if you are wondering how to communicate your end-of-life decisions.
When you see an estate planning lawyer, you will of course talk about your wills and how your property is going to be distributed after your death. You should also expect to discuss your plans for mental incapacity. You should name someone to look after health care decisions and someone (perhaps the same person but it doesn't have to be) to look after financial decisions. Most lawyers who specialize in estate planning will ensure that you have this whole package in place.

Stephen King’s Maine Haunts
Posted: November 24, 2021
The new book has the title “Stephen King’s Maine Haunts” and it’s the perfect book for every fan that wants to know more about the story behind the story. He visits the train tracks that became the tracks in “The Body”, the diner that was the inspiration for Al’s Diner in “11/22/63” and The Standpipe that can be found in “IT”, just to name a few. We also get to see where King went to school, where he worked and where he lived as a kid.
The photos and the accompanying text give a good idea as to how King came up with many of his stories and that is very interesting. It shows you how he got many of his ideas and proves that what King says is true; “Write about what you know”.
I enjoyed “Stephen King’s Maine Haunts” and it’s a new angle on King’s stories and how parts of them came to be and it’s interesting to look at the photos and imagine a 10-year-old Stephen walking there, not knowing that it would be part of a bestseller many years down the road.

An average car battery will last 4 to 5 years, maybe even up to 7. But where and how you drive and what the weather’s like in your area affect its life. Many short trips are harder on batteries than fewer, longer ones. In hot climates, you may only get 2 to 3 years out of a new battery.
Unless you’re having obvious trouble, you may just ignore it. But it’s a good idea to get your auto battery checked every fall. As cold weather arrives, the everyday work of starting up and powering your vehicle gets harder, and summer heat may have taken an invisible toll. Those battery problems you run into in the winter likely started in the summer.
What Does Summer Heat Do to a Car Battery?
Hot weather is the harshest environment for car batteries.
When it’s 90 or 95 degrees outside, it’s 140 to 150 degrees under your hood. These high temperatures can cause the water in your vehicle’s battery to evaporate. High heat can also force some of the fluid out of the battery vents in the form of gases. That will cause a chemical reaction with the lead and other metals on the battery connector. If you see corrosion that looks like white or blue crystals on the nodes with + and – signs (your battery terminals), that’s why.
The inside of a typical lead-acid car battery is like a layer cake made up of plates of lead and other components, with the “frosting” being a solution of about one-third sulfuric acid and two-thirds water. When some of that water evaporates or some sulfuric acid is forced out because it’s hot, there's not enough fluid to surround the plates. At that point, they start corroding.
About half of premature battery failures are caused by the loss of fluid in the battery. You may not see this damage, but it will reduce your battery’s efficiency.
Then there are the ways you use your vehicle in the summer. A battery can be pushed to its limit with demands from the engine cooling fan, air conditioning, stereo, and GPS or other gadgets you charge on your road trip. Deep discharges also speed up the battery’s aging. This can happen whenever you use the car’s electrical system while it’s turned off.
How to Take Care of Your Battery in Summer
Avoid deep discharges. It’s fun to park by a lake and listen to music through your car’s stereo and handy to charge your phone from the 12V socket while you’re camping, but draining the battery significantly can damage its internal parts.
Use the car regularly during heat waves. It’s not just cold weather that can damage a battery left unused — heat is harmful to sitting batteries, too. Park in the shade whenever possible. Keeping the temperature under the hood even a bit lower than it would otherwise be will slow fluid evaporation.
Speaking of battery fluid, faster evaporation in the warm months will increase corrosion. Clean any corrosion off the top of your battery once a year and make sure the cables are tightly connected. Corrosion is caustic, so make sure you wear gloves and proper eye protection to do this. Dissolve some baking soda in a bit of water and use a toothbrush to gently scrub the battery terminals and cable clamps.
Why Won’t the Car Start When It’s Cold Outside?
If it’s worked hard over summer, or the weather was really hot, your car’s battery may not be as efficient come fall, for the reasons above. If it’s not operating right it will have trouble holding a charge and delivering cranking power to the engine.
A telltale sign that your battery needs attention is if you notice your car is slow to turn over on chilly mornings but easier in the afternoon. This happens because all the fluids in your vehicle are thicker when temperatures are lower, like syrup that's straight out of the fridge versus warm. So it takes more power to move the motor oil required to crank the engine. Also, the chemical reactions that happen in the battery are slower in the cold.
With newer cars, you might not even have a slow start — your car simply won’t start.
Simply put, your vehicle’s systems need additional output from the battery to operate in colder conditions. If your battery is old, needs recharging, or isn't able to hold a charge, it will struggle to perform in the cold weather.
How to Take Care of Your Battery in Winter
First, get your battery tested in the fall, between summer heat and winter cold. A test will tell you if the battery is fully charged, how many cold cranking amps it can provide, and generally how healthy it is.
Keep a battery charger on hand and use it if you’re driving your vehicle less often in the cold months, you make frequent very short drives, or if you’re having trouble starting in the morning. If you live in a very cold climate where temps can get down to 5 degrees F, consider using a block heater or battery blanket.
A block heater will warm your engine so it's easier to start the car. A battery blanket will, as the name suggests, keep your battery warmer so the fluid keeps moving and it’s easier for the battery to crank the necessary amps when it’s cold out. Depending on where you live, you may want to use both these items — talk to a mechanic to figure out what you need.
Keep jumper cables in your car, as you’re more likely to need them in the winter.
Heading into the cold months, take a few minutes to clean corrosion off the top of your battery and make sure the cables are tightly connected.
We’ve said it twice, but it’s important enough to say one more time: Autumn is the time to get your battery checked to avoid irritating problems in the winter. If your vehicle’s battery is over 4 years old, it’s especially important to get it checked annually.16.1 Continue Reading Previous Prediksi Pertandingan Chelsea vs Leichester City Tanggal 18 Agustus 2019 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The 7th entry and one of only [1] in the original Mega Man series released for the SNES.
In the closing of Mega Man 6, Dr. Wily was finally put in jail. What Mega Man didn't know was that Dr. Wily had robots hidden somewhere is his lab. After six months without Dr. Wily's input, the robots would activate, and search for Dr. Wily.
On a side note, a fan-made NES style remake of this game can be found online.
Tropes:
-.
- Big Boo's Haunt: Shade Man's level.
- Bonus Boss: Proto Man, after meeting certain requirements, can be fought in a secret area in Shade Man's level.
- Breaking the Fourth Wall: try using the Freeze Cracker on Freeze Man.
- Bring It: Freeze Man reacts to everything you do. If you do nothing, he defaults to taunting you.
-.
- Charged Attack: The Noise Crush is a Collect Type, where Mega Man must bounce it off a wall to catch the ricochet to empower the next blast. The Wild Coil and the Mega Buster are Hold Types.
- Crazy Prepared: Wily apparently built 4 Robot Masters and put a six month watchdog timer just in case he were arrested.
- Deleted Scenes: scenes Dummied Out for the International versions, where either Roll or Auto would replace Dr. Light in giving comments every time Mega Man gets a new weapon.
- Easter Egg: There is a code that allows you to duel Bass in a one on one two-player duel ala Street Fighter.
- Guide Dang It: Freeze Cracker, Wild Coil, and Danger Wrap can be aimed by holding up or down before shooting. Danger Wrap can also be aimed "foward".
- Invisibility Cloak: the Wily Capsule's usual teleporting ability is replaced by this for some reason.
-.
- Name's the Same: Turbo Man, not to be confused with the superhero in Jingle All the Way.
- Shout-Out: To Ghosts N Goblins; hold the B button while selecting Shade Man's level and it will play the famous first level theme from the series.
-.
- Springs Springs Everywhere: Spring Man's stage, of course!
- Weather Control Machine - Cloud Man's stage involves lots of pushing wind and blinding rain (one of the few games to notice how driving rain will reduce visibility). Cloud Man uses these gimmicks as well when you fight him.
- Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?: This is the first, and so far only, game to get into this. Mega Man seriously considers killing Wily after defeating him for the umpteenth time. Unfortunately (but fortunately for Wily) Mega Man was "Three Laws"-Compliant, leaving him unable to carry out his threat.
- Your Size May Vary: compare the Mad Grinder in the intro to the actual Mad Grinder that Mega Man fights.
- ↑ Mega Man and Bass was a case of No Export for You, and Soccer is considered non-canonSeason Eleven of Supernatural promises to be a humdinger. Three if By Space SDCC attendees were able to ask a few questions about the show from several of the stars as well as the writers. We have learned that the Winchester’s will be battling an epic force throughout the season that has been labeled The Darkness. There were few real assertions about what to expect from the coming season I think mainly because the show evolves as they film and as Jensen Ackles intimated the cast has only really seen and reviewed four episodes so there really was not any juicy morsel to pass on to their fans.
Many of the shirtless demands from the querents were shot down. I have to say that even though I acknowledge the attractive nature of the actors, I tune in for the storyline. I will also say that it was highly sexist and diminished the nature of the interviews. I was not there; I am only going on the video interviews I reviewed but I have to say, especially to the fan chicks, check yourself before you wreck yourself. No one appreciates being objectified, it can be funny in a meme but for someone to sit down to discuss your work and hear them demanding you be naked… really? Not cool. Nothing wrong with naked just keep it where it is appropriate. And don’t roll your eyes at me it’s not a lecture it’s the truth.
The short interviews of the cast and writers and producers provided an interesting take on the show. It was kind of like speed dating. I found it odd to watch the actors as relaxed normal humans and not see them as the “evil-fighting,” always on edge, intense, heroes they play on the show. It makes me realize that there is much thought and attention put into the portrayal of their characters as well as own my own bias that these people are the characters.
Misha Collins who plays Castiel, the angel who fights alongside the brothers revealed that Cas is still struggling to reclaim his Grace to full proportion and recover from Rowena’s spell at the end of last season. Misha also expounded upon g.i.s.h.w.h.e.s. which stands for the Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen is a scavenger hunt, an event he hosts that you can compete in from anywhere in the world and even against famous people such as William Shatner. Watch the video on TiBS or check out their website to learn more.
Jeremy Carver writer and producer, spoke a bit more enthusiastically about the show and its direction for season eleven and promised that we would see progress within the sibling relationship that works toward resolving long standing issues. Sounds promising, let’s see if they can deliver. Mr. Carver also spoke of an episode revolving around Sam and his imaginary childhood friend. We shall see if it delivers. Much of the lore presented in Supernatural runs true to historical recounting however I am deeply disappointed in the blurring of Angelic/Demonic personae.
Andrew Dabb who writes for the show deflected many of the shirtless episode requests in excellent fashion. You can also see where Supernatural gets its humor and I applaud him for being a humorist. To wit however he could use a better verbal sparring partner to maximize the funny moments. I was a bit taken aback by the way he spoke of Mark Sheppard who plays Crowley, dismissing him as if he were no one important. I gather that the pair of them do not get along. After watching the interviews I understand why. I am interested to see how the episode that is based fully in the Impala works out – it is a definite challenge to write and not be able to change location to suit the situation. The Impala has already been defined as a place where the brothers often come to interpersonal crossroads as well as understanding so for it to embody an entire episode will be a challenge, and I look forward to seeing the end result.
Jensen Ackles discussed his part not only as an actor but as a director for some episodes of the show. I have always enjoyed watching episodes directed by those who act in any series because I believe it brings the fan more in line with the characters mostly because it is not just Jansen directing it is Dean crafting the shots as well. Keep up the superlative work sir! Jensen answered questions about demon Dean and his revamping of character to incorporate his relationships with characters who only knew him as Dean.
Jared Padalecki spoke high praises for his best friend Jensen as a director indicating he had a lot of trust in Ackles skills. Jared spoke of his own acting development within the show and how as an actor his immersion into the character can become intense. He touched briefly on the imaginary friend episode and confirmed what Jensen said that they had not seen the full script series. Jared, who is an advocate of mental health awareness, garnered a fan tribute for his Always Keep Fighting campaign as fans held up LED candles during their group interview. Jensen joked that someone was playing “Freebird” and then emotional reality hit, yes Jared, your voice is being heard and your message is being shared! To support Jared and Jensen’s efforts to help those who battle the personal demon of depression you can visit:
Ten seasons strong and looking forward to their Tunfel season.
You can watch all of the interviews Three if By Space participated in here: doctor will look for signs of glaucoma, perform tests to check your vision sharpness, determine your prescription strength, examine how your eyes work together, and check the fluid pressure in your eyes. They may also dilate your eyes or photograph your eye with a special camera to see if you have any eye conditions or signs of other serious health conditions.
Why Contact Lens Exams Incur an Additional Fee
If you wear or want contacts, you need a contact lens exam in addition to a comprehensive eye exam. Your eye doctor will perform specific tests during a contact lens exam to evaluate your vision with contacts. With the results of those tests, your eye doctor can provide a contact lens prescription that is the perfect.
Some Tests Involving Contact Lens Fitting:
Corneal Curvature
A corneal curvature test will help to ensure the proper fit of a contact lens to your eye. An ill-fitting contact can cause damage to the eye, so using this test to measure the curvature of the eye will determine what fit is best for your eye.
Pupil or Iris Size
Testing the pupil or iris size is an important part of a contact lens exam, especially if you are considering specialized contact lenses.
Tear Film Evaluation
A tear film evaluation is an important test in determining if contact lenses are right for you. A common problem in contact lens wearers is dry eyes. A tear film evaluation will help to determine if you have sufficient tear film to keep the lenses moist and comfortable..
At Complete Family Eyecare, we carry the following brands of contacts:
- Acuvue
- Baush & Lamb
- Alkon
Follow-up
Your eye doctor may request that you schedule a follow-up appointment to check that your contact lenses are fitting properly and that your eyes are adjusting properly. If you are experiencing discomfort or dryness in your eyes you should visit your eye doctor as soon as possible to avoid vision issues. Your eye doctor may decide to try a different lens or a different contact lens disinfecting solution. In addition, they may decide to try an adjustment in your wearing schedule..
Commonly Asked Question About Contact Lenses
Why can’t contact lenses be sold without a prescription?
Contact lenses are recognized by the FDA as medical devices that need monitoring by your eye doctor. Although the risk of complications to an individual patient is small, it is real. Six percent of contact lens wearers will have a complication annually. It is important that the diagnosis and treatment of complications happen rapidly to prevent permanent vision loss.
Does my contact lens prescription expire?
Yes. Contact lens prescriptions just like any other prescription will have an expiration date. The expiration date will be one. As a result, they will document that reason in your record. The medical standard of care, as described in the preferred clinical practices of the American Optometric Association (AOA) and the Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists (CLAO) recommends routine follow-up of all healthy contact lens patients on a six to twelve-month basis. Therefore, your eye doctor will advise an exam at least once a year before extending your contact lens prescription. However, at your request, your eye doctor may issue a one-time minimal extension for emergency situations. Whether you wear glasses or contacts, it’s a good idea to see if you have new or existing vision problems and see your eye doctor on an annual basis to see if you need vision correction.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask the doctor or our staff.

Construction Lien Amendment Act, 2017 Loi de 2017 modifiant la Loi sur le privilège dans l’industrie de la construction
Mr. Theodore B. Rotenberg
Ontario Association of Architects
Ontario Home Builders’ Association
Ontario Painting Contractors Association
Barrie Construction Association
Ontario General Contractors Association
Borden Ladner Gervais LLP
The committee met at 1304. I would like to remind committee members that proceedings start at 1 o’clock for this committee.
Mr. Theodore B. Rotenberg
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): We will have our first presenter: Theodore Rotenberg.
Mr. Theodore B. Rotenberg: Rotenberg.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Rotenberg. You’ll have 10 minutes for your presentation—up to 10 minutes—and then the time will be split equally between each party, up to five minutes. You can begin.
Mr. Theodore B. Rotenberg: Thank you, Mr. Chair. The people who appear before this committee on the changes to the Construction Lien Act, generally speaking, are stakeholders or people who have an ideological conviction. I am neither. I have 45 years of practice as a litigation lawyer, 37-plus of them for the new home industry, Tarion issues and construction issues on behalf of all of the stakeholders. I represent and deal with clients who are largely entrepreneurial.
My concern, in the 30-odd recommendations and a brief summary that I’m going to give you, is one concern and one concern only: Make the remedies that are granted by this act meaningful and effective. All too often you have, in theory, a legal remedy, but in practice you can’t make it work. I’m informed by my experience about the things that don’t work, and that’s what I’m here to tell you about today.
The first point has to do with the distinction between liens that attach to property and liens that only attach to a flow of money, which are basically public sector liens. The policy issue is really very simple: If there is no realistic possibility that a piece of real estate is ever going to be sold to satisfy a lien claimant, why put the lien on title? From my experience as a practitioner, this makes no sense. I understand the logic of Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel in their recommendation saying, “Put the lien on where there’s a risk that somebody could legally go bankrupt,” but in the real world, in the 21st century, if you have a lien on a building in the Darlington facility or on the SickKids hospital, realistically, are those properties ever going to be sold to satisfy a lien? If the answer is that they’ll never be sold, why register the lien? This involves costs and expense.
Our law has always provided that we don’t register liens on highways, railway rights of way, and property of the crown and of crown agencies. The suggestion that I make to you is to broaden what is in the bill to include district school boards, lands in subdivisions which are intended to become school land, parkland or buffer zones, and land in any broader public sector agency, such as a hospital or, let’s say, Toronto social housing buildings. That seems to me to be a worthwhile objective.
As a practising lawyer, however, I have a practical problem sometimes in figuring out which property is a crown agency and which isn’t. Typically, in my practice and the practice of many of my colleagues, we get called on day 42 or 43, if we’re lucky, to put a lien on. When the act changes, we’re going to get called at day 57 and 58, if we’re lucky, because the A-type personalities who exist in this industry tend to want to try and solve their problems and only come to us at the last possible minute.
What I have suggested to you is to set out in the regulations a procedure for all of us to identify who to serve. It can be referenced to a website; it can be referenced to a default position, but give us some guidance so we’re not scrambling at the last minute to try and figure out, “Do we lien or do we not lien on title, and who do we serve?” If you do that for us, I and my practising colleagues will be very grateful.
A second example of liens that don’t work in the real world are liens on condominiums. Typically, the lien on a condominium is going to arise in three circumstances.
The first: when the developer hasn’t paid everything—in which case, those liens will be paid off as the units sell, just before title transfer.
The second: some homeowner or unit owner renovates his unit and the contractor isn’t sure whether he has renovated common elements.
The third situation is where you have the condominium itself hiring the contractor and there’s a dispute. When you have a 200-unit high-rise condominium, you have 200 residential units, but typically all of the parking units and all of the locker units are unitized. That condominium could have 600 or 700 units in it. Somebody puts a lien and they register it on 700 units, and we’re all scrambling to figure out: “If the lien isn’t paid, are we going to sell 700 units?” This makes no sense.
The condominium corporation, however, has a better remedy: Unlike any other private sector group, it has the right to levy a special assessment. That assessment, if not paid, can be registered on title, and it takes priority over all pre-existing liens and encumbrances and mortgages. Put in the act that all you have to do is serve the claim for lien on the condominium corporation, and give us a procedure for service—and that will be easier now with the changes to the Condominium Act. Provide that if the condominium won’t pay off the judgment from the lien, an administrator can be appointed who would make the special assessments. It’s easy, cheap and workable. Please do it.
1310
The third point is liens on leasehold interest. This has never been a really effective remedy. The proposal that came from the Ontario Bar Association subcommittee on this issue, of which I was a member, was that you lien only, and the landlord is responsible only for the money that the landlord pays the tenant for leasehold improvements.
We wanted to turn the landlord from a prospective owner into a payer. Somehow, when this act got enacted, that idea never got picked up, and now the payment is confined to the holdback. It shouldn’t be. It should be the whole amount payable. That’s effective, that’s efficient and that money is intended to pay for the improvements that the contractors would have put into the leasehold interest.
The other change to make to leasehold interest is to make provision to protect a landlord for doing all those prudent things, and only those prudent things, that a landlord has to do: Approve the plans, make sure the work is inspected and rectify deficiencies that don’t conform to the plans. If he does that, he should be exempt from any further liability. That’s a good idea. Please follow it.
The next point I have is one where I have a fundamental disagreement with Mr. Reynolds and the expert reviewers on removing set-offs from outside the improvement.
There are three problems with this. The first problem is that, normally, it’s just to allow the set-off. If a contractor has one contract on project A and project B, and the electrician gums up and causes $50,000 or $100,000 worth of damages, the contractor should be able to set that off on the payments coming to the electrician from project B. Yes, it’s important that the payments flow down in project B, but it’s also important that the contractor doesn’t get stiffed for this money if the electrician goes bankrupt, which can and often does happen.
This was a well-intentioned mistake. Leave in the words “whether or not related to the improvement” in subsection 17(3).
If you don’t want to do that, you have to do two other things. The first is to take the carve-out for the new-home construction industry in subdivisions for lot-by-lot exemptions. That is for the benefit of those contractors so that they get their holdbacks quickly. If you don’t put that exemption in, you’re going to defeat the purpose of prompt payment and early release of holdbacks in subdivisions, because the builders will not put that provision in and will want to preserve their set-off rights.
The last point is that if you’re going to remove the set-off rights, make it clear that the common-law rules of set-off and equitable set-off do not apply. Currently, this is left as ambiguous.
Finally, have a little sympathy for the only people in large projects who have no lien rights: the subcontractors, particularly those at the primary stage. They can finish their work months ahead of the completion of the project. They can’t lien an ongoing project if they expect to get work from other people. Their lien rights will expire, and if the owner has set-off claims, they can’t protect their holdback.
The last point, on better protection for subcontractors, has to do with an early release of a subcontract once there has been 100% completion of that. Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel recommended against that being mandatory, only being optional. Because owners pay interest on the money they use to pay that amount, they’re very reluctant to do it, and these contractors can have, in some cases, millions of dollars in holdback money that they can’t get released, even though their contract has been paid.
Put a dollar value in ceilings so that a general contractor or an owner is not burdened with releasing holdbacks and dealing with 30 or 40 different contractors. My suggestion is a $2-million number where, if it’s over that amount on 100% completion of the subcontractor, payment should be made.
Those, in brief, are the main policy issues that reflect the objective I’ve said to you that I think is important, and that my experience teaches me is important. You have the framework of a very good statute. You also have the opportunity—
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thanks, Mr. Rotenberg. We have to move to questions now. The first set of questions will come from MPP Bailey.
Mr. Robert Bailey: Thank you, Mr. Rotenberg, for your presentation. I understood that you said you might not be able to complete your presentation, so if you’d like to take my time and just finish up?
Mr. Theodore B. Rotenberg: The only other point I would mention has to do with the trust provisions which require certain bookkeeping requirements of contractors and subcontractors. It wasn’t applied to owners because the public sector owners such as municipalities would find it too burdensome, and they are correct. It would be too burdensome and unnecessary because public financing doesn’t work the same as private financing.
But for private sector owners, it would be a benefit to them and to their subcontractors and everyone if those private sector owners had the requirement to keep those separate electronic records of what money is spent on each project. That would be the only other point in terms of substance that I would add. Everything else is really mechanical and it’s a lot of detail, and there are other people here who have to speak as well.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Perfect timing. Mr. Bisson?
Mr. Gilles Bisson: I’m good.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Okay. We’ll move to the government: Mr. Berardinetti.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: On behalf of the government, sir, thanks again for your presentation. In the very first part, you mentioned, about the liens on properties such as SickKids hospital and other public properties, that it doesn’t work. What would you say would work better, then?
Mr. Theodore B. Rotenberg: Treat them the same way as we treat liens on public lands. In other words, you don’t register it on title. You serve a notice of lien. I will also tell you that for universities it’s the same thing: If we renovate Hart House at the University of Toronto, nobody is going to sell that building.
The other problem—it’s mechanical, but in some universities, because of the way their land assemblies work, it’s very difficult to find the right building where the work was done, particularly if your client is a supplier who is not on site. I think there’s an easy, workable solution. Yes, in theory, the hospital could go bankrupt, but I can’t imagine a provincial or municipal government not stepping up to the plate for these players.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: Okay, all right. Those are my questions.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much for your presentation today.
Ontario Association of Architects
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): I’d now like to call upon the Ontario Association of Architects. Good afternoon.
Mr. John Stephenson: Good afternoon.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): You will have up to 10 minutes for your presentation. Questions this time will begin with the third party. If you would just state your name for Hansard, please.
Mr. John Stephenson: Thank you, Mr. Chair. My name is John Stephenson and I’m the president of the Ontario Association of Architects.
The OAA is the regulator and professional association for architects in Ontario. Established by the Architects Act and dating back to 1889, it is the legislated mandate of the OAA to regulate the practice of architecture to ensure that the public interest is served and protected.
I would like to start by thanking the government for undertaking this important initiative to modernize the Construction Lien Act. The OAA has collaborated extensively with the government over the Construction Lien Amendment Act, including three submissions and numerous meetings and discussions with Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel as well as government officials and staff, and we have appreciated the positive reception of our input and comments to date.
I would also like to acknowledge that, based on recent communications from Minister Naqvi, it appears that our concerns regarding performance bonds will be addressed through the addition of a clarifying statement to “exclude architects, engineers, and consulting professionals from the requirement.” The OAA applauds the government for this important amendment.
With that said, I sit before you today to communicate a few remaining concerns and recommendations from the architectural profession. Most importantly, there remains a lack of clarity regarding substantial performance as it applies to architectural services. Also, while attempts have been made to clarify the transition period, the OAA remains concerned about a lack of clarity as to the effective date of the new act and how it applies to existing contracts. I’ll expand on these points now.
Firstly, regarding substantial performance: Regarding substantial performance, the OAA believes that the concept of substantial performance applies, and should apply, to architectural services. During ongoing conversations that we have had with Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel, we were pleased to hear they agree with this interpretation.
However, not all lawyers share Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel’s opinion. Some construction lawyers do not believe substantial performance applies to architectural services. The reason for this is the definition of “improvement” in subsection 1(1) of the Construction Lien Act. This definition does not explicitly reference design services, instead focusing on largely physical improvements such as repairs, construction and demolition.
While Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel felt the definition of “improvement” did not require modifications as it already encompassed design services, the OAA recommends that a clarifying statement be appended to the definition of “improvement” to resolve this issue.
This statement should make it explicitly clear that design services are an improvement so as to end any debate within the legal community as to whether substantial performance applies to an architect’s contract.
If the government does not wish to modify the definition, our concern could also be resolved by adding this clarifying statement in section 2(1), which deals with the determination of substantial performance. In either case, the clarifying statement could follow the form of a similar statement currently included as 14(3) dealing with liens.
1320
Secondly, then, to speak about the transition period: Regarding the transition period, the OAA does acknowledge that the minister has provided some clarifications. However, outstanding concerns remain regarding, firstly, the effective date of the new act, and, two, how the new act applies to existing multi-year, multi-project contracts.
Architects and other members of the design and construction community should have a clear understanding of how their lien rights or prompt-payment responsibilities, and the administration of these requirements, for which architects are often responsible, are to be applied in instances such as with multi-year, multi-project master services contracts and vendor-of-record contracts.
It is our understanding that the government intends for these types of contracts to continue to be governed by “the previous regime.” In other words, pre-existing contracts will not be governed by the requirements of the new legislation. These master contracts would therefore continue to dictate the terms and conditions of subsequent work for five or more years beyond when this legislation comes into force, despite the fact that these new projects—not pre-existing work—may commence long after the Construction Act is passed. This could continue to disenfranchise architects and others from the important changes and protections that government has put in place for years to come.
The OAA recommends that all provisions of the proposed legislation apply to any individual project contract that is dated after the effective date of the legislation, regardless of whether there was a pre-existing master services or vendor-of-record contract.
I thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you today, and I look forward to addressing any questions you might have.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much. Mr. Bisson.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: My only question is: How practical is it to put existing contracts—jobs that have been started—under this legislation? Wouldn’t that create some problem down the road?
Mr. John Stephenson: In our opinion, no. The structure of a master contract or a vendor-of-record arrangement is such that you sign an agreement which is an agreement to agree at a later date to enter into a subsequent contract for a specific project or improvement. The effective date of that subsidiary or secondary contract should be the triggering date for applicability to this legislation. It seems that it would be very clear.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: That’s good.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Ms. Mangat.
Mrs. Amrit Mangat: Thank you, Mr. Stephenson, for your presentation.
We all know that architects play a key role in construction work, from design to certified payments. If this legislation is passed, do you think it will improve the way architects carry out their functions in construction projects?
Mr. John Stephenson: I think there are a number of very significant improvements in this legislation, which we applaud and which we think will, in fact, aid our profession in the work that we do in administering contracts on behalf of owners and contractors. So, yes, to answer your question, I think there will be an improved regime which all the parties will benefit from, including architects.
Mrs. Amrit Mangat: Okay. Can you expand on that?
Mr. John Stephenson: Well, I do think the added clarity which addresses the nuances of multi-phase contracts in particular will be of great benefit. The permissive language in the proposed new act will allow owners and contractors to agree to deal with progressive release of holdbacks and certification of substantial performance where there are clearly multi-phased contracts at stake that extend over great lengths of time. This will be of benefit to all the parties, particularly given that significant funds that would be otherwise tied up for many, many years could be released earlier.
Mrs. Amrit Mangat: Thank you.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Mr. Bailey.
Mr. Robert Bailey: Thank you for your presentation. Could you give a little more explanation to—I think it was the fourth paragraph down where you say you’d suggest that they make it explicitly clear that design services are an improvement, to end the debate between the legal communities. Do you see this, the way it’s written, as going to cause a lot of issues when they get into disputes, the way the present bill is written?
Mr. John Stephenson: The way it’s written, because it doesn’t specifically, expressly identify professional services as a component of an improvement, opens the door to interpretation. Our experience has been that often this interpretation is uneven and there are, in fact, members of the legal profession who have advised owners that professional services are not an improvement, and therefore not subject to substantial performance. So that’s our concern, and we think there’s a simple remedy in adding a clarifying statement which says, for greater certainty, this is the case.
Mr. Robert Bailey: Okay, thank you. That’s all.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much for your presentation today.
Mr. John Stephenson: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
The Advocates’ Society
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): I’d like to call upon the Advocates’ Society. Good afternoon. You have up to 10 minutes for your presentation. Questions this time will begin with the government. If you would both state your name for Hansard and then begin with your presentation, please.
Mr. Christopher Stanek: Hi, my name is Christopher Stanek. I’m a lawyer at Gowling WLG, and I’m here today representing the Advocates’ Society. I’m a member of the Advocates’ Society construction law practice group executive. This is David Mollica from the Advocates’ Society.
The Advocates’ Society is a not-for-profit association of over 5,700 litigators throughout Canada, and the Advocates’ Society has followed Bill 142 with interest. We previously made submissions to the expert review team prior to the release of the expert review report upon which Bill 142 is based, and the Advocates’ Society also met with Attorney General Naqvi and provided submissions prior to the introduction of Bill 142.
Following the introduction of Bill 142 in the summer of 2017, the Advocates’ Society construction law practice group executive held a town hall meeting of our members to discuss Bill 142. Most of the proposed legislative amendments to the Construction Lien Act were very positively received. In particular, the proposed changes that would allow, for the first time, a construction lien action to be litigated in Small Claims Court as well as the removal of the prohibition on breach of trust claims being heard together with lien actions were agreed to be well overdue.
But there were concerns raised about the proposed repeal to sections 53 to 57 which include the repeal of the procedural pleadings element, and sections 59, 60 and 61, 66 and 69. The theory behind this, we believe, was that the construction lien proceedings would proceed under the regular rules of civil procedure and the individual sections that regulated construction lien litigation were unnecessary. However, many of those sections are actually critical to provide jurisdiction with respect to how construction lien proceedings are now litigated. Certain concerns were raised by participants at our town hall with respect to the effect of these amendments.
To assist this committee and understanding the implication of these changes, I’m going to outline how construction lien actions are litigated under the current act and the importance of sections 60 and 61 in particular, so that the committee can better understand our concerns. If you want a comprehensive review of how lien actions are litigated in Ontario, I refer you to a case decided by Master Sandler in 2004, Pineau v. Kretschmar Inc., 2004 CanLII 24478.
How lien litigation proceedings go are as follows. In Toronto, if any party, usually the plaintiff, wants a master to hear the case—which is the usual procedure—then the party must obtain a judgment of reference under subsection 58(1), and then it will be referred to a Toronto master or a case management master. Under subsections 58(1) and 67(6), these detail how the motion for a judgment of reference is to be made. The form of judgment of reference is set out under form 16. In that form, it refers the jurisdiction of a judge to the master to determine the action on a trial. Once the judgment of reference has been obtained, then the plaintiff can make a motion to the master without notice to have a date, time and place fixed for the trial of the action. So it’s usually a routine motion. Once this order has been obtained, the party who obtained it must serve a properly worded notice of trial on all persons described in subsection 60(2), and that’s a requirement of subsection 60(4). This is a very important provision because it makes the construction lien proceeding a class proceeding—that’s the provision that directs service of a notice of trial on everyone with an interest in the land; otherwise, they’re not parties to the litigation.
As Master Sandler says in Pineau v. Kretschmar, “This notice of trial is a critical document.” Once that’s served, the date for trial is fixed. Colloquially in Toronto, we call this the “first construction lien pre-trial.” It’s really the first day of trial. Once the master conducts this first pre-trial, he or she is seized of the reference. As a matter of practice, construction lien masters do not order settlement meetings but deal with those issues at the first pre-trial, which is supervised by a master and is a more effective procedure than an unsupervised settlement meeting under sections 60 and 61.
1330
Outside of Toronto, those settlement meetings under sections 60 and 61 are often ordered. Sometimes they’re supervised by a judge; sometimes they’re not. Then these settlement conferences cover the matters usually covered by the first pre-trial under the Toronto procedure.
If the parties don’t agree on production and discovery, leave for any discovery motions goes to the judge on a motion. Once discovery is complete, then the section 60(4) notice of trial is served as required, and then a trial date is set.
It’s critical to note that under section 37(1) of the Construction Lien Act, which is not changed by Bill 142, there is a provision that if, within two years after the date of the statement of claim served, the action or an action in which a lien may be enforced is not set down for trial, the lien expires. They lose the lien right if not set down for trial. All of this has to be done within two years, which we believe is the reason for the special procedures under the current Construction Lien Act.
It is section 60(4) that provides that an action to prove a perfected lien is a class proceeding requiring notice to every party with an interest in the improved premises. The repeal of that section is somewhat confusing because the priority section, section 79, continues to remain. That identifies streams for each class of payer, and it remains unaltered.
In light of the proposed repeal of subsection 60(4), the following questions aren’t currently answered by Bill 142: Is a lien action still a class action? What mechanism exists to deal with priorities under part XI of the Construction Lien Act? How can pro rata distribution under the priority section be ensured if a party with an interest in the improved premises is not part of the action in which the lien is to be proven?
Moreover, eliminating the section 60 settlement conference and leaving the parties to the regular rules of civil procedure seems to be at odds with the desire for summary proceedings. We note that the expert review did not recommend repeal of sections 60 and 61.
Bill 142 does include a new proposed subsection, 50(3), which provides that proceedings would be of a summary nature. But with the proposed elimination of the restrictions on production and discovery of documents and discovery of witnesses, and no mandatory case management, the new legislation may not have the means through which summary procedure can be enforced. The regular rules of civil procedure would apply to all cases.
Our members are concerned that it will undoubtedly take longer to litigate construction lien actions under the proposed legislation. Specifically, the “discovery culture” that encourages litigants to produce and review every document and fact about a case prior to trial is a concern.
Also, with the deadline to set the lien action down for trial in section 37 unchanged, litigants will still need to make strategic decisions within this two-year window. We note that the period provided to set a matter down for trial under the regular rules is five years. The Construction Lien Act continues to keep it at two years.
There was a further concern raised at the town hall meeting regarding the application of rule 50 pre-trial procedures under the regular rules of civil procedure. Rule 50 of the rules of civil procedure requires discovery to be completed before a pre-trial can be ordered.
As I noted, the current practice is a pre-trial or section 60 settlement conference before discovery. Moreover, if discovery is being carried out as a matter of right under the rules of civil procedure, it may be ambitious to expect that it will all be completed within two years.
The Advocates’ Society believes that if proceedings are not of a summary nature, lien actions have the potential to increase the court’s caseload. Construction disputes are notorious for having reams and reams and reams of paper. Having all of that produced and discovered within the process creates a very real potential to overload court offices.
Many motions are currently being brought in Toronto for all over the province. In particular, there’s a potential to overload Toronto court offices.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: Excuse me?
Mr. Christopher Stanek: Toronto court offices.
Additionally, the repeal of subsection 67(2), the prohibition on the appeal of interlocutory matters, now allowing appeals where they weren’t allowed before, could give recalcitrant parties another opportunity to delay litigation. These are all proceedings, we note, that involve encumbering lands until they are resolved. It was noted at the Advocates’ Society town hall meeting that the expert review report, which was before the Attorney General when Bill 142 was drafted, recommended that the summary nature of construction lien actions be removed from the act.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): We have to move to questions now. Ms. Wong?
Ms. Soo Wong: I’m going to give you some time to talk about adjudications because I know you’re not finished.
Mr. Christopher Stanek: I have very little left. As I was saying, the expert review report recommended that these sections be removed, but it also recommended that all construction lien claims be case-managed. By removing the summary proceedings sections without including case management, Bill 142 may increase the additional overload on courts.
Ms. Soo Wong: Okay. I have a very short time. I’ve got a couple of questions dealing with adjudication.
First things first: How would adjudication help with prompt payment? I didn’t hear it in your written submission or your verbal presentation.
Mr. Christopher Stanek: Adjudication is, the way I understand Bill 142, not part of the legislative process. It’s a process that’s connected with prompt payment that the parties carry out. From what I understand in Bill 142, it’s not a litigation matter. Litigation occurs notwithstanding the right to adjudication. My comments are focused on litigation.
Ms. Soo Wong: On page 2 of your written submission to the committee, you’re talking about “in 40 days.” I think you have concerns about these days, saying that it’s a short window. How many days are you suggesting? You said, “The adjudication process is contemplated to be completed in 40 days, and access to the courts in that short window would ... be nearly impossible.” What are you suggesting to the committee?
Mr. Christopher Stanek: It has been raised among our membership that for the adjudication—
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): I’m sorry; that’s all the time for government questions. We have to move to Mr. Bailey.
Mr. Robert Bailey: Go ahead and finish. I find that interesting.
Mr. Christopher Stanek: Okay. It has been raised that 40 days to find an adjudicator, have the person become knowledgeable on the issues, set a procedure to have the adjudication conducted, hear submissions in whatever form and then make a decision is ambitious.
Ms. Soo Wong: So what are you recommending—
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): No, we’re over here. Mr. Bailey?
Mr. Robert Bailey: Just one more point: So it’s your—we can share the next time—contention that this legislation would make it more contentious and delay the outcome of the lien—the payment?
Mr. Christopher Stanek: We think that if there is not a current limit on discovery and if it is not judicially case-managed or case-managed by a master, then individual actions could run away with production and discovery issues and delay resolution.
Mr. Robert Bailey: Okay.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Mr. Bisson?
Mr. Gilles Bisson: Clear as mud. Thank you.
Mr. Christopher Stanek: It’s presented by a lawyer.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: That’s right.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Great. Thank you very much for your presentation.
Ontario Home Builders’ Association
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): I’d like to call upon the Ontario Home Builders’ Association. Good afternoon. You have up to 10 minutes for your presentation. If you’d begin with your name, please, for Hansard. This time, the official opposition will begin the questions when you’re done.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Good afternoon. My name is Joe Vaccaro. I am the CEO of the Ontario Home Builders’ Association. We represent 4,000 members across the province, organized in 29 local associations representing the new home construction and renovation industry.
Today I will provide some general comments about the legislation and will pass it on to Eric Hoffstein from Minden Gross to say some additional technical analysis.
The legislation in front of you really is a massive overhaul of the current system. As you heard from municipalities and other public sector buyers of construction services, this will add new costs through anticipated added litigation, payment certifiers and administration.
Ontario will be the only jurisdiction in the world that has both a lien process and mandatory adjudication. While this might be a win for the legal community because it provides another outlet for litigation, there’s a loss for small businesses across Ontario, which will have a difficult time adapting to this new and complicated process.
1340
Residential construction has a very different payment process compared to ICI construction. For new home builders it is an individual home purchaser as an owner, creating a complete different set of warranties, pressures and expectations. Our sector is also different as it is small business-dominated, with family business as the common model. The legislation requirement that allows 14 days to record deficiencies makes it administratively difficult when you recognize the need for municipal inspectors, engineers and other certifiers within a small window to determine the accuracy of an invoice. It takes 40 trades to build a home, and there is a minimum of 11 Ontario building code inspections before a new home can be occupied.
Considering the regulatory environment in which residential construction works, we appreciate that the government maintains the lot-by-lot lien provisions in subdivisions, contrary to the expert panel recommendations. By maintaining this provision, it means that one trade working on one home in a subdivision could not lien the entire project. This protects innocent homebuyers from liens that would delay them from moving into their new homes. This way, homeowners do not suffer because of a contractual dispute on a house or an individual condo unit in a completely different part of the subdivision or building.
This decision by the government demonstrates why residential construction is different and why we require a separate regulatory framework for our sector. One of our main criticisms of this bill is that it doesn’t differentiate between large and small contracts or between public and private. While many US states have prompt payment, a significant number of them only apply to public contracts. In some states where it does apply to private contracts, there is a minimum threshold that must be met. In Massachusetts, prompt payment only applies to contracts over $2 million.
Different sectors and construction owners have different realities. For example, the government has indicated that they would provide more leeway for AFP projects than for other projects, as was stated in the Attorney General’s email on October 23. Prompt payment for AFP projects will allow for certification of payment prior to the submission of an invoice. In other words, large AFP conglomerates will have the ability to verify work before an invoice is submitted—a different set of rules for the AFP side.
We believe we need a different set of rules for the renovation and residential construction sector, and that will be our core recommendation to the government.
With that: Eric?
Mr. Eric Hoffstein: Thank you. My name is Eric Hoffstein, from Minden Gross. I’m a lawyer. I’m here to talk about the technical aspects of the proposed legislation.
The residential construction industry is dominated by owner-managed family-run businesses with small numbers of employees and limited resources for project administration. My comments are going to focus on three areas: the prompt-payment regime, the adjudication regime, and the interplay between the draft legislation and collective bargaining agreements with unionized workers.
Looking first to the prompt-payment regime: Bill 142 contemplates that on receiving a proper invoice the owner will decide whether the work complies with the project’s specifications. If there’s any doubt about the quality of the work that has been done, then the owner would be well advised to give the contractor a notice of nonpayment. Upon receiving that notice of nonpayment, the contractor has potentially seven days to give a notice of nonpayment to a subcontractor and 14 days to refer the dispute to adjudication. This gives the contractor just 21 days to resolve the issue before the adjudication process gets invoked. During that time, the contractor and owner have to inspect the work; they have to coordinate between the owner’s deficiency claims and the subcontractor’s work; they have to complete the corrective work; and have the owner inspect the work and approve that work for payments. Keep in mind that in the residential construction business, the owner may not be an experienced construction builder or be sophisticated when it comes to construction matters, and may not always get it right. For an owner-managed business with limited resources and ongoing construction obligations in relation to the rest of the project, that timeline is practically impossible.
Furthermore, OHBA suggests that Bill 142 include a provision ensuring that contractors and subcontractors will be given access to the project site within the timelines contemplated by the statute to inspect any alleged deficiency concerning their work.
On a separate note and as a general comment, we note that Bill 142 provides several seven-day timelines for payments; that is, a contractor may be required to make a payment within seven days of having received payment from the payer. Payments in the residential construction sector are often made by cheque. Even assuming that a cheque is deposited on the same day it’s received, most banks will require up to eight days for a cheque to clear. The Legislature should consider increasing the timeline in Bill 142 to 10 days in order to avoid payment problems and additional administrative hassles in the event that a cheque doesn’t clear the contractors’ accounts.
I’ll turn now to our concerns with the adjudication process. The adjudication process contemplated by Bill 142 does not lend itself well to the residential construction sector. Because contractors are often small family-run businesses, they have limited resources to prepare for and attend an adjudication in the middle of a project while they’re working at the same time to meet the project deadlines.
The cost of lien proceedings already imposes a financial strain on any contractor in the residential sector. The added cost of the adjudication procedure will inevitably put smaller contractors at a disadvantage when they don’t have the time and money to consult with legal counsel and they face an owner or general contractor with greater financial resources. An unscrupulous owner or general contractor can use this extra procedural step to take advantage of a smaller contractor or subcontractor who has fewer resources.
Finally, I’ll turn to the possible conflict between the Bill 142 provisions and collective agreements that are common in the industry. As a general comment, Bill 142 does not take into account the timelines which are normally imposed on contractors by the collective agreements which govern unionized workers. The disconnect between the statutes and the collective agreements can put contractors at a significant disadvantage.
By way of example, one union collective agreement requires employers to inspect work within five days of the invoice and to deliver either a completion slip if the work is done satisfactorily or a deficiency list if the work is not done satisfactorily. Payment must then be made within 15 days of the invoice date. There is a provision of two to three days to correct any deficiencies that have been identified. Under the timeline set out in Bill 142, the general contractor or owner might raise complaints well after the five-day timeline, even possibly after the 15-day timeline for payments which exists in the collective agreements. This raises the possibility of a conflict between the legislative regime and the contractual obligations under the collective agreement.
To give you a very real example: Even if the invoice for the union’s work is immediately passed up to the owner, if the owner raises concerns more than five days later, as the owner is entitled to do, the contractor who engaged the union worker may be deprived of their opportunity to complain to the union or require the union worker to correct any deficiency identified by the owner. Furthermore, if the owner’s complaint is made more than 15 days from the invoice date—which, again, the owner is entitled to do—the contractor would have been obliged to pay the union worker before even being aware of the owner’s complaint. This runs contrary to the very principles on which the new legislative regime is founded: to protect payers in the construction pyramid from having to pay for deficient work without having an opportunity to adjudicate that dispute first.
In conclusion, these comments are intended to highlight the differences between the residential construction sector and the other sectors of the construction industry. While many of the principles, such as prompt payment and efficient adjudication, are very attractive to the residential construction sector, different processes and regulations are needed to better align with the nature and size of the residential sector’s players.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Mr. Bailey?
Mr. Robert Bailey: Could you speak a little bit more about: What would be the proper timeline? I was interested in the timing, the 21 days, and you talked about the 10 days for the cheques to clear. The other one was about 21 days. What would be a more appropriate time—30 days?
Mr. Eric Hoffstein: Are you talking about for a cheque to clear?
Mr. Robert Bailey: No, about the other time, when you can start—
Mr. Eric Hoffstein: That would require a more fulsome review of how long the residential sector players need. But at the very least I think there would have to be at least 30 days for the contractor to just review the deficiencies that the owner alleges.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: I think the challenge for us is that if you create an opportunity to differentiate different kinds of construction purchasers—through either a threshold of the contract or whether it’s residential, ICI, AFP or what have you—in the legislation, then we have the ability through regulatory work to drill down and figure out what fits and what is functional within those different sectors.
The challenge we have is that the bill presents itself as “every construction buyer is the same,” and I would say to you that for a small renovator in Stratford versus a large construction builder who is building a hospital, they may both be in the construction business, but they are in different types of businesses with different types of arrangements. This bill does not, at this point, create that difference or that space where we can actually have a sector-specific discussion.
1350
Mr. Robert Bailey: Okay, that’s fine.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Great. Thank you. Mr. Bisson?
Mr. Gilles Bisson: Interesting presentation. Generally, you’re not in favour of the bill, right?
Laughter.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: Generally, we recognize the bill is here and we have to make the best of it, yes.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: No, but generally. I hear your arguments around timing but I’m just wondering how you achieve that. If you have to carve out every single type of contractual arrangement, I don’t know, legislatively—is that even possible? I’m just looking over at legislative counsel to give me some—
Interjection.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: I hear what you’re saying but I’m wondering how practical that is.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: Well, I would say, with respect, that if you recognize the American states and that legislation that people keep pointing back to, they’ve already done that. They’ve already split private versus public, and they’ve also created thresholds for contracts.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: They also don’t have a public health care system so I won’t use them as an example.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: Fair enough, but, again, if you want to look back at this piece—
Mr. Gilles Bisson: It’s a different ideology, right?
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: And fair enough. So I guess the question is, we are now bringing in a new regime that maintains current lien rights and adds adjudication to it. Okay, and now we have to figure out, contractually, in our minds at least, if it’s fair to treat a renovator from Thunder Bay the same as you would a large hospital constructor.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: And I have some sympathy for you. I was a small contractor so I get what you’re getting at. But on the principle that somehow or other the rules don’t apply to me because I’m small, if we apply that to other laws across Ontario, I don’t know what the heck that would mean.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: But I would suggest that we’re not suggesting that. The rules will apply but when you get into the details of the rules, it’s the right rules for the right sector for the right reality. That’s our challenge. When I speak to members across the province, they’re challenged. They’re looking at this piece and they are looking at how lien rights are maintained and there’s adjudication and there’s this and there’s that—
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much. We have to move to the government, and Mr. Berardinetti.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: Thanks for your presentation. Do you have any written submissions to give to the committee?
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: We’ll be following up with those.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: Okay. Thank you. Following up on my friend Mr. Bisson’s question, you don’t want the bill.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: I would say that we recognize the bill is here and we have to make the best out of it. What we want is recognition that residential is different—that recognition has already been granted by the government—and then maintaining the lot-by-lot provisions of the lien act.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: But we had an extensive consultation process. Were you not invited to that process at all?
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: We were, and in that process we always maintained that if you’re going to move forward with this, there needs to be a regulatory status for residential-specific regulations. Do not group them in with ICI and other payment structures, because it’s a different reality here, it’s a different industry. We’re just looking for that recognition in the regulations. So an amendment to this bill that provides that space helps us.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: I’m going to run out of time here. This bill has been prepared and if we take one little string and take it out in one area, it’s going to affect another part of the fabric of the legislation; that was heard earlier. This is our third afternoon of two hours of hearing deputations. Some of them are in the audience here today. They understand that part and hopefully you do too, that if we change one little string here it’s going to affect something on the other side. It has been very carefully crafted. You’re asking us to make some changes.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: Well, I would say that the Attorney General has already indicated a number of amendments coming through the system, so clearly there are changes coming to this bill. I would suggest to you that, if we want to maintain some fairness around small contractors versus big contractors, thresholds, private versus public—AFPs are now going to get a separate opportunity to verify work before an invoice is submitted. Private sector members are not getting that opportunity. So what I am suggesting to you is that the government is already engaged in a series of amendments. This is well within that spirit if we want to take the time to craft it appropriately.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much. That’s all the time we have for your presentation.
Mr. Joe Vaccaro: Thank you.
Ontario Painting Contractors Association
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Now I’d like to call upon the Ontario Painting Contractors Association. Good afternoon.
Mr. Andrew Sefton: Good afternoon.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): You’ll have 10 minutes for your presentation. Questions this time will begin with the third party. Please state your name for Hansard and begin.
Mr. Andrew Sefton: Good afternoon, Chair and committee members. My name is Andrew Sefton and I’m the executive director of the Ontario Painting Contractors Association, otherwise known as the OPCA.
The OPCA represents the largest and well-established employers performing painting and coating work in the industrial, commercial and institutional sector of Ontario’s construction sector. Since 1976, the OPCA has fostered collaboration to achieve success in advocacy, education, industry standards and labour relations. The employers I represent are bound to the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, which in turn represents 10,000 workers across various trade groups.
I congratulate the government for initiating the process that led to the creation of Bill 142. I have been actively engaged in the Council of Ontario Construction Associations’ construction lien subcommittee since 2007, and we are closer than we have ever been to modernizing the outdated Construction Lien Act and introducing a fair, equitable and reasonable payment regime that ensures a speedy adjudication process for the resolution of construction project disputes.
Construction is a primary driver for the economy, providing for the employment of more than 430,000 workers, 6.4% of Ontario’s workforce, yet delinquent payment in construction is rampant. Trade contractors are commonly made to wait for periods of four months or longer to get paid for work that has been certified as being complete.
Delinquent payment drives up the cost of construction, as contractors must factor the risk of delinquent payment into their bids.
Delinquent payment strains cash flow, especially for small businesses that must meet payroll and pay bills, taxes, WSIB premiums and other costs, to the point of forcing some businesses into insolvency.
Delinquent payment stymies new job creation and restricts investment in apprenticeship training—the construction industry accounts for roughly 40% of all apprenticeships—as trade contractors must limit their payroll commitments to meet cash flow obligations.
Delinquent payment practices erode the level playing field, as those who maintain honourable practices are put at a disadvantage.
Employers that extend benefits to employees, such as pension, welfare and training, are obliged to provide such remittances within prescribed timelines. Employers extend such benefits not only for the well-being of employees but for the well-being of Ontario.
Employers bound to the painters’ provincial collective agreement must remit such payments on or before the 20th of the month following the work completed. For example, for the work month of October 2017, employer contributions for an employee’s pension, welfare and training are due on or before November 20, 2017. Delinquency or non-payment risks a lapse of coverage for the worker and/or enforcement of the penalty mechanisms prescribed in the painters’ provincial collective agreement. Furthermore, the recourse for the trust fund is to lien a construction project for delinquency, further exacerbating the problem to be solved through Bill 142.
Upon the successful implementation of Bill 142, the Construction Lien Amendment Act, construction employers may begin reducing cash flow reserves and investing in increased productivity and capacity to fulfill the ever-growing demand of ongoing construction spending, planned increase in construction permits, and resolving the infrastructure maintenance gap.
Your actions today will ensure a prompt-payment regime for construction work certified as being complete within the 30 days of the certification, monthly progress payments for a project of longer duration, and interest in penalties to accumulate where payment is not forthcoming. It will allow for contractors to suspend work where payment is not forthcoming for unreasonable periods.
Regarding the October 23, 2017, proposed amendments, overall, the amendments are beneficial. The concerns that we have relate to the amendments that are not on the list. It is important that construction professionals—that is, current or former trades and contractors—be eligible to act as adjudicators. In most cases, the best person to decide disputes within the expedited format of an adjudication will be a construction professional with years of experience in the industry. It is also believed that expanding the pool of people who are qualified to act as adjudicators will keep the cost of adjudication from escalating.
Furthermore, the Construction Act should permit the delivery of written notices of lien by any method that gives effective notice to the payer who receives it. Delivery by fax or email with a receipt should be permitted.
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before this committee.

The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Great. Thank you very much. Mr. Bisson?
Mr. Gilles Bisson: Two questions: One is, in the previous presentation, we heard that the rules should be somewhat different for smaller contractors. I’d like to hear what you have to say about that. And on the timing issue that he raised in regard to: Do you have to put in sync the timing for, for example, collective agreements as far as payment versus the lien act?
Mr. Andrew Sefton: I will address your questions, but I think what was specifically said was that residential is distinct from ICI—and I represent ICI contractors, or contractors engaged in the heavy sector. Furthermore, what I think I heard was that provisions within the residential agreement, based on the nature of that work, require a timeliness by which the subcontractor corroborates the quality of the workmanship being performed. Those don’t necessarily exist in the ICI sector, and I won’t speak to whether there should or should not be a difference between the residential sector and ICI.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: Fair enough.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Great. We’ll move to the government now. Ms. Wong.
Ms. Soo Wong: I’m going to ask you a couple of questions. In your presentation, you made numerous references to these delinquent payments—I wrote here “delinquent payments.” So who are these delinquent payers? Big contractors? Governments? Who are they?
Mr. Andrew Sefton: The contractors I represent—
Ms. Soo Wong: Let’s name them—
Mr. Gilles Bisson: The Ontario Liberal Party.
Ms. Soo Wong: Oh, yes, right. It could be the NDP too, you know, Mr. Bisson.
Mr. Andrew Sefton: I would suggest that, in general, as the payment system went beyond 45 days—30, 60 and into 90 and 120—I think that that became the expected norm of the industry, thus the requirement for the contractors I represent to—
Ms. Soo Wong: Okay; I don’t have lots of time. I’m going to ask a question. My next question here is: In terms of the adjudication, you are encouraging the government to hire former construction professionals to be adjudicators. Can you also explain to us—I’m going to assume you support Bill 142.
Mr. Andrew Sefton: I do.
Ms. Soo Wong: Okay. That’s the second question. With regard to the resolution and dispute mechanism, do you agree that what has been proposed through the legislation would help some of your members?
Mr. Andrew Sefton: Yes, I believe that it will help some of my members.
Ms. Soo Wong: And then the other piece here is in terms of—because we heard the previous witnesses from the Ontario Home Builders’ Association, where there were concerns raised, and then the first witness talking about the different liens. What is your comment about the different liens that he is proposing? I’m not sure if you were here when he made the presentation.
Mr. Andrew Sefton: Again, I can’t speak on behalf or about the residential sector. So I’m sorry, I don’t know—
Ms. Soo Wong: Okay. Your members are usually the large group of professional painters?
Mr. Andrew Sefton: Painting contractors and coating contractors. My contractors do the Burlington Skyway.
Ms. Soo Wong: Oh, the big jobs.
Mr. Andrew Sefton: They do the water towers. They do your schools. They do your hospitals.
Ms. Soo Wong: Okay, so they’re not the small home renovation—
Mr. Andrew Sefton: No, I do not represent—
Ms. Soo Wong: Okay. Thank you for your presentation.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Perfect timing. Mr. Bailey.
Mr. Robert Bailey: So if there was one thing your association would like to see, if there was a way it could be improved, what would it be?
Mr. Andrew Sefton: Prompt payment.
Mr. Robert Bailey: That’s already going to be in there. Is there anything besides that, though, that could improve it?
Mr. Andrew Sefton: No, as I said, I think that adding to the adjudication roster would be beneficial to everyone to mitigate cost, to expedite the process.
Mr. Robert Bailey: Okay. That’s fine.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Excellent. Thank you for your presentation.
Mr. Andrew Sefton: Thank you.
Barrie Construction Association
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): I’d now like to call upon the Barrie Construction Association. Good afternoon.
Ms. Alison Smith: Good afternoon.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): If you would state your name for Hansard, and then you’ll have up to 10 minutes for your presentation. This round of questioning will begin with the government.
Ms. Alison Smith: Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair and committee members. I thank you for the opportunity to appear at these hearings to represent the hard-working men and women of Barrie and surrounding areas. My name is Alison Smith, and I am the executive director of the Barrie Construction Association, the BCA.
The BCA is a mixed-trade association representing and supporting over 350 general and trade contractors, manufacturers and suppliers in and around Simcoe county. Our members operate in the industrial, commercial and institutional construction sector. The BCA is a proud member of the Council of Ontario Construction Associations, or COCA, and I would be remiss if I did not recognize their tireless efforts made on our behalf for lien act reform.
CCOA is mandated to work with its members and decision-makers at Queen’s Park to make sure Ontario’s laws and regulations support success in the construction industry and broad prosperity across the province.
The BCA and COCA have been lobbying for a reform of the Construction Lien Act for more than 20 years and for prompt-payment legislation since 2011. Bill 142 is long overdue.
Our association would like to thank Attorney General Naqvi and his government for recognizing this province’s need for a fair, clear path for payments in the construction industry. There are approximately 455,000 workers in the construction industry in Ontario. These workers build, install, repair or renovate work worth over $85 billion annually.
The 18-month study completed by Bruce Reynolds, Sharon Vogel and a 15-member expert panel included input from stakeholders on all sides. The purpose of the study was to examine and recommend remedies for the chronic problem of delayed payment on construction projects in Ontario. The result of this study was a report titled Striking the Balance. Most, if not all, stakeholders believe that Striking the Balance proposes a fair and reasonable balance point amongst all stakeholders’ competing interests. Not one stakeholder got everything they wanted.
Delayed payments have negative consequences not only for the industry workers but also for the economy. Overall, late payment increases the cost of construction services, reduces investment in equipment and machinery, reduces investment in apprenticeships and training programs, and lowers employment in construction.
BuildForce Canada reports that 85,000 new skilled workers will be needed this decade as 21% of Ontario’s construction workforce goes into retirement. Reform of the Construction Lien Act will go a long way to ensuring a thriving, growing skilled trades workforce.
Construction costs are higher for owners as bidders will add a contingency for the delayed collection of receivables into their bids as the number of companies able to carry these receivables diminishes. There are fewer companies bidding on projects, further driving up costs. The passing of Bill 142 would ensure that the construction sector prospers and drives our economy forward.
The current existing law in Ontario is costly and the lien rights of many will expire long before they realize they will not get paid. The lack of prompt-payment legislation is an obstacle to smaller contractors in terms of bidding on projects. Unless a contractor is large enough to handle delays in receiving payment, it is difficult to compete. This lack of competition drives up the cost of construction. Prompt-payment legislation would generate investment and growth for our entire economy, as well as protecting our smaller independent trade contractors.
Currently in Ontario, there is no effective remedy to late payments. The smallest players in the construction chain actually end up financing projects as they are carrying invoices well beyond 60 and 90 days. The financial risk of a project is unfairly and without justification transferred on to the smaller contractors down the construction project chain.
With the passing of Bill 142, Ontario workers would have the right to stop work on projects when they have not received payment. Currently, trade contractors are contractually obligated to continue working even when payments owed to them have been delayed. This bill protects the livelihood of over 455,000 workers, and it is the right thing for our government to do.
Bill 142 modernizes the outdated Construction Lien Act, introduces a payment regime, and introduces an adjudication process with tight timelines for the resolution of construction project disputes. Prompt-payment legislation offers government the opportunity to provide stimulus to a vital sector without spending a dime.
Bill 142 also includes other improvements that will minimize the disruption to construction schedules. Bill 142 allows for the hearing of liens under $25,000 in Small Claims Court, which will be more efficient and cost-effective for the industry as a whole. Under the current act, a lien action can only proceed in Superior Court, which is costly for liens that are $25,000 or less. If Bill 142 passes, it will create a more efficient manner of settling smaller liens.
I am confident that I speak on behalf of all of the local construction associations across Ontario to say that we are poised and ready to educate and inform our members of new legislation. Construction lawyers, many of them involved with COCA’s Construction Lien Act Task Force, will be involved in educating the construction community through seminars held by construction associations. Governments in comparable economies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and the European Union have already introduced prompt-payment legislation while we continue to work under antiquated legislation.
1410
In closing, the BCA is in agreement with the Council of Construction Associations’ stance. We are in support of the recommendations made by Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel. We believe that the government needs to implement these recommendations in their entirety. We oppose any amendments to Bill 142 that conflict with the intent of the recommendations made in the Reynolds-Vogel report. This is about doing the right thing: ensuring that small and medium-sized businesses receive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much. Ms. Wong?
Ms. Soo Wong: Thank you, Ms. Smith, for being here.
I was asked by my colleague and friend, your MPP, Ann Hoggarth, to ask this question, so here it is: She wants me to ask you how Bill 142 helps small businesses like your organization in terms of improving the payment process, because we hear the two sides of the fence. If you could answer the question, I’ll pass it on to Ann for you.
Ms. Alison Smith: Certainly. By adopting a payment regime that begins with a proper invoice triggering a payment timeline, contractors will then know when they can expect payment. Right now, they don’t know. They can submit an invoice, and it can sit there for 60 or 90 days or six months. Once an owner receives a proper invoice from the contractor, the timelines are prescribed in the act.
Ms. Soo Wong: My other question here is—I think you alluded to, in your oral presentation, the adjudication process. Can you elaborate a little bit further? A previous witness talked about having construction experts be part of this. Besides this kind of criteria, would you suggest anything else in terms of the adjudicators for this?
Ms. Alison Smith: I definitely agree with allowing construction professionals to become adjudicators. It will certainly keep prices down if there’s a larger pool to select from. They are the experts in this field. They understand the technical specifications of projects and how disputes need to be resolved.
Ms. Soo Wong: Thank you very much for your presentation and for being here today.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Perfect. Right on time.
Mr. Hillier?
Mr. Randy Hillier: Sure. Thanks. Listen, there’s one element that has come up from time time—and I’m sorry; I missed the earlier part of your presentation. Was there any concern as to why P3s are not captured in the same way under this proposal? Just if you have any comments on that—
Ms. Alison Smith: I will admit to being from small-town Barrie, Ontario, and P3s aren’t a large part of our members’ projects at this time.
Mr. Randy Hillier: Right. So no added comment on P3s.
Ms. Alison Smith: Correct.
Mr. Randy Hillier: Thank you very much.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Mr. Bisson?
Mr. Gilles Bisson: I’m good. It was clear—not a problem.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Sorry, no questions?
Mr. Gilles Bisson: No, I’m good.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Okay. Thanks for your presentation.
Ontario General Contractors Association
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Now I’d like to call upon the Ontario General Contractors Association.
Good afternoon. I know you’re been here most of the afternoon, if not all of it. You’ll have up to 10 minutes for your presentation. Questions this time will begin with the official opposition. If you would each just state your name for Hansard and then begin.
Mr. Paul Raboud: Very good. We have Bruce Karn, senior counsel with EllisDon, who is an OGCA member. David Frame is government relations for the OGCA. My name is Paul Raboud. I’m Chair of the Ontario General Contractors Association. In my day job, I’m a director of Bird Construction. I was previously chief executive officer.
The OGCA represents 183 general contractors right across the province of Ontario. Our typical member is a small business—15 or 20 employees—but we also count amongst our membership the very largest contractors. Most of the large national general contractors are members of the OGCA as well.
There are three points that we’d like to make today, and they’re pretty straight ahead:
(1) The OGCA is 100% behind Bill 142.
(2) We’re 100% behind the package of amendments that the government has floated out in the industry. In fact, we think that it’s critical that these be passed for the effective functioning of the legislation. We have two modest suggestions for you that we’d like to make in addition to those this afternoon.
(3) A lot of co-operation and collaboration has gone in the development of this bill, and we really hope that this consultative approach carries on through the development of the regulations and the implementation of the bill.
To elaborate on that, the OGCA is 100% behind Bill 142. We’ve been advocating for an update to the lien legislation now for as long as I’ve been involved with the OGCA, so 15 or 20 years. We’ve been active and, we hope, constructive participants in the development of the report, the Striking the Balance report, and ultimately this legislation.
One of the key issues, obviously, in Bill 142 is to improve cash flow in the industry. That’s an objective that the OGCA is 100% behind. A lot of attention has been focused on the prompt-payment timelines in the report, and they’re really important, but we’re here to say that if the bill stopped at those prompt-payment timelines, I think a lot of people would be surprised and disappointed at how little a difference it would make to cash flow in the industry.
In our view, the real game-changer, the difference-maker in this legislation is adjudication. I say that for two reasons. Number one, for a lot of the payment delays that we see, the root cause of that is disputes, and adjudication is a very good way to keep the money flowing during the course of a dispute. The other thing is that adjudication is the teeth behind this legislation. This is what’s going to drive people to pay attention. Ultimately, we hope the threat of adjudication is what’s going to cause people to behave better in the absence of anything to do with the legislation. It’s just going to change the norms in the industry.
I know that you’ve heard from some of the larger buyers of construction, and they’ve expressed some discomfort with the tight time frames that are mandated in the legislation. They are tight time frames in the legislation; there’s no doubt about it. But everybody is going to have to retool to meet the timelines. It’s not just the owners; general contractors, trained contractors, and everybody is going to have to change their processes in the way we do business, but we believe that it is doable. Our fond hope is that it changes expectations, that it changes what is viewed as normal in terms of sorting out disputes and what’s viewed as normal in terms of paying the bills.
So the bottom line on that is that we’re 100% supportive of the legislation. In terms of the package of amendments that the government has put forward, we’re completely in support of those amendments. In fact, we’d like to emphasize that it’s critical that those plain-language amendments that have been floated are very important, and we hope that they’re all passed.
We’d like to put two other thoughts for your consideration. One relates to mandatory adjudication timelines. If you recall, in the bill, if an owner disputes a bill—the client is to pay the bill—all the contractors in the chain can defer payment downstream, provided, though, that they commit to starting an adjudication within 14 days. There’s nothing wrong with that process, but we just think that that 14-day timeline is a little bit too tight. One thing that’s important to remember is that with 14 days, at day 14 you have to be able to deliver the paperwork to start the adjudication, so you have to back that up. Somewhere around day 7, your mind shifts and now you’re starting to put together the paperwork to start the adjudication, and that’s a pretty short time frame.
The best outcome for everybody, the best outcome in terms of being paid quickly, is not adjudication; it’s actually negotiating a solution and getting paid. That can happen in 10 days; adjudication, no matter what you do, is still a 60-day payment. So in our way of thinking, the timeline before a mandatory adjudication has to start needs to be a little bit longer, and we’re thinking something in the order of 30 days.
Our second suggestion relates to this thing called “ambush adjudication.” I think people have spoken to you about that in the past. It’s this concept where the person initiating the adjudication has got lots of time to get organized and get all their paperwork straight, and sometimes what these folks will do is they’ll launch an adjudication right up against a holiday period with the express intention of jamming people up against the holiday, which we think is unfair. One way to mitigate this, in our view, is to reference, as it applies to adjudication, business days rather than calendar days in the legislation, just to try to take a little bit of pressure off jamming people around the time frames.
In terms of collaboration, the last point I’d like to make—and, I suspect, after sitting through three days of this you’re going to agree with me—is that lien legislation is complicated. It’s a complicated and very technical piece of legislation. It’s not just legally complicated; it’s also commercially very complicated. What I mean by that is, it’s got to work in an enormously wide array of circumstances. It’s got to work for everything from your bathroom renovation to multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects, and it’s got to work for such a wide array of people, from owners to trade contractors to general contractors to suppliers, not to mention engineers, architects, insurance companies and bonding companies. It’s a really complicated piece of legislation, and for one group to sit in isolation and try to develop this legislation, it’s really unlikely that they’re going to get it right.
1420
In our view, the government did exactly the right thing in terms of taking a collaborative approach. They hired Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel, they went out and consulted widely with the industry and they drove a consensus, which is no mean feat. I see Bruce and Sharon in the back here, and it’s a testament to their skill, it’s a testament to the dedication that they brought to this undertaking that they were able to drive a consensus. We really hope that the government continues to work with Bruce and Sharon during the development of the regulations and through the implementation phase of this bill.
That concludes our formal remarks. I really would like to express, on behalf of the OGCA, our appreciation for you guys getting behind this important initiative. We’re happy to answer any questions you may have.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Great; thank you very much. I’d like to move to the official opposition: Mr. Hillier.
Mr. Randy Hillier: In our lengthy minute and 45, if you could give a lesson, an in-depth overview of the amendment package that you’ve received from the government.
Mr. Paul Raboud: There are 40 amendments. It’s a wide variety.
Mr. Randy Hillier: Do you have a copy of those? Could you show those to the committee?
Mr. Paul Raboud: I think the government has circulated those around, if I’m not mistaken.
Mr. Randy Hillier: Have we got these amendments? I’ve not seen them.
Mr. David Frame: These are not formal amendments. This is plain language.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Just for clarification: To my knowledge, the government hasn’t filed them with committee.
Mr. Paul Raboud: They’re plain-language amendments.
Mr. Randy Hillier: Okay, so they’ve telegraphed to you a significant number of amendments that you’re satisfied with. I guess maybe we should change roles and I should be over there and you should be over here. Thank you very much.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you, Mr. Hillier. Mr. Bisson?
Mr. Gilles Bisson: No questions.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): No questions? We’ll move to the government: Mr. Berardinetti.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: Thank you for your presentation, on behalf of the government. It’s not really much to ask, but the adjudicative process: I think you’ve outlined why it works. The only thing you’re concerned about is the timeline of when someone is notified of going to adjudication? Or—
Mr. Paul Raboud: It’s the timeline before you have to start adjudication. The idea for us is that ultimately, you don’t really want to drive everything to adjudication. You want people to behave properly, pay their bills, and sort out their disputes. If you narrow the window too much before you’re forced to start adjudication, you’re going to just drive too many things through adjudication rather than having them resolved through negotiation, which is better for everybody, ultimately.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: I understand that. If you hang around, the next presenters are going to be Mr.—
Mr. Paul Raboud: Reynolds.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel: They’ll be here. They’re going to present after you. That’s all.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Ms. Wong.
Ms. Soo Wong: Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, I heard from the previous witness talking about delinquent payment driving up the costs. What are you anticipating for the industry? Because if this is going to bring down the costs, will we be seeing some of the benefit for the consumers, for Ontarians? That’s what I heard.
Mr. Paul Raboud: I think ultimately you will. If you increase cash flow in the industry, it creates more capacity in the industry. More capacity creates a competitive environment, and that’s what drives down prices, ultimately.
Ms. Soo Wong: So you anticipate that’s going to be—
Mr. Paul Raboud: I do, I do.
Ms. Soo Wong: I agree. Thank you for being here.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much for your presentation today.
Borden Ladner Gervais LLP
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): I’d now like to call upon Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, please. Did I say that right? Gervais? Is it Gervais? Excellent, welcome to the committee. Your names have been mentioned a few times. You will have 10 minutes for your presentation, and then we’ll split the remaining five minutes between each party. If you’d just state your name for Hansard, and begin.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: Thank you very much. My name is Bruce Reynolds. I’m the head of the international construction projects group of Borden Ladner Gervais.
Ms. Sharon Vogel: I’m Sharon Vogel. I’m national practice group leader of the construction group of Borden Ladner Gervais.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: Thank you very much for allowing us to appear before you today. We have attended and/or monitored the hearings to date, and we just wanted to try to add a few comments, clarifications with a view to being helpful to the committee.
Item number one, just having sat and listened to the presentations today, is that—and with no criticism intended—some of the stakeholders have not been perhaps as aware as others of the development, the evolution of the legislation, and in particular the development of the amending motions. As I’m sure the committee knows, the Attorney General sent out an email on October 23 which described in plain language key amending steps that are intended. The amending motions themselves have not been circulated. Ms. Vogel and myself have been working with the Ministry of the Attorney General on the amending motions since first reading on May 31, and we can assure you they have not been circulated.
Just by way of example, you heard earlier from the Advocates’ Society that they were quite concerned about the potential loss of the very specific procedures that are associated with a lien action. If they were still here, I’m sure they’d be very pleased to hear that as a matter of legislative drafting, those sections are being removed from the act, but they are being transported directly into the regulations. The reason for this, from a legislative drafting perspective, is that to the extent that they may need to be tweaked in future, it’s much easier to amend the regulation than it would be to amend the act itself. But all their concerns are directly addressed by importing those provisions that they were concerned about directly into the regs.
Another example would be the submissions of the very first presenter at your hearings, which was the CCPPP, the overarching group that is mainly focused on alternative financing projects. They expressed a number of concerns, and we were aware of those concerns beforehand because they had written us a very helpful and informative letter. As a result of receiving the CCPPP’s letter from Mr. Romoff, who was the main presenter in that submission, with the permission of the Ministry of the Attorney General, we struck a task force that met three times for two, three or four hours a pop, which considered the AFP-related issues of aligning Bill 142 with the AFP project delivery model.
That task force produced a set of recommendations, and those recommendations fully address all of Mr. Romoff’s concerns and are embodied in one of the amending motions, which the committee will see shortly, as I understand it.
These are just two examples of areas where the post-first reading consultation process and effort to improve the bill have addressed concerns that you have heard spoken to in your committee hearings.
Having said that, we’d like to touch upon some discrete issues relating to prompt payment and some discrete issues relating to adjudication.
Number one, as it relates to prompt payment: People have expressed a concern that the timelines for payment down the contractual pyramid are tight, are ambitious, and some people have submitted to you that they’re perhaps too ambitious. But we want to assure you that we have looked at every jurisdiction in the world that has this type of legislation and considered the timelines that we’ve recommended and which are contained in Bill 142. If you looked at this as a spectrum of how different jurisdictions set these time constraints, we have gravitated to the middle of that spectrum. In fact, in certain instances, we’ve gone toward the long end of the spectrum.
I’m not disrespecting people’s concern about having to change their modalities of payment. What we would suggest to you is that the intention here is to cause people to change their cultures in relation to payment, to re-engineer their processes in order to allow funds to flow down the construction pyramid more quickly. The time limits we’ve chosen are reasonable and mid- to long-range, relative to global standards—and this is a global movement, as I’m sure you’re aware.
Second, as it relates to prompt payment, there has been a concern expressed to you about our recommendation that certification of payment and/or owner approval no longer be allowed to be a precondition to the delivery of a proper invoice. The reasons for this are that in the UK, after prompt payment was first brought in, it was realized that payers were gaming the certification process and using it to defer payments. So when they amended their legislation, they introduced a prohibition such as we have recommended.
1430
What we would like to make clear to you is two things. Number one, we’re not prohibiting the certification process. The certification process itself can continue to take place. So issues with regard to the inspection by engineers and architects of work for satisfying themselves as to its quality are still going to go on.
Secondly, with regard to the timing for the delivery of a notice of intention not to pay, which is the protection for an owner to be able to challenge the quality of work or to assert a set-off and say, “I do not intend to pay you and I’m telling you,” which is 14 days after the submission of the proper invoice, here too we’ve chosen a date, 14 days, which is mid-range relative to similar legislation in other jurisdictions.
Important, however, is to recognize that this too will necessitate a re-engineering of payment culture in terms of incenting the owners, contractors, subcontracts, architects and engineers to address the issue of payment further upstream so that by the time the proper invoice is delivered, the parties will actually be in agreement as to what the quantum of the proper invoice should be.
Finally, there has been a concern expressed about the right of suspension. Owners are obviously very sensitive to this. The last thing they want is their contractor to be able to suspend work. Here we have recommended a made-in-Ontario solution. In other jurisdictions that have prompt-payment legislation, once payment exceeds the maximum number of days, the contractor can suspend right then. What we recommended, and what is contained in Bill 142, is that once the owner—let’s use the owner as an example—is late paying, interest begins to run, which is not waivable. But before the contractor or subcontractor can suspend, they must go through an adjudication process and an adjudicator must, in essence, find that the nonpayment is invalid, order the payment to occur, and then the owner, which would include public owners, has to ignore the order of the adjudicator to pay, all before the right of suspension arises. This is a huge protection relative to other similar pieces of legislation around the world. It was a very significant compromise made in the consultation process by the advocates of prompt payment, including Prompt Payment Ontario and COCA.
Having said that, I’ll turn it over to Sharon.
Ms. Sharon Vogel: One of the most important aspects of Bill 142 is the use of adjudication as a mechanism to enforce prompt payment. We’ve listened to many stakeholders who have referred to the phrase “mandatory adjudication” in their submissions before you. We’re not forcing anyone to initiate an adjudication. The lien remedy is still there. Parties can choose to exercise their lien rights. They can choose to negotiate, mediate and/or adjudicate. If they’re not satisfied with an adjudicated result—
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Ms. Vogel?
Ms. Sharon Vogel: Yes?
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): I’m sorry; the 10 minutes is up.
Ms. Sharon Vogel: Okay.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Mr. Berardinetti.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: Point of order: Can I move a motion for unanimous consent from all three parties for them to finish their presentation?
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Is it agreed? We have a UC in front of us that the presenters—
Mr. Gilles Bisson: Hang on a second here. Do we have the time?
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): We do have the time.
Mr. Berardinetti asked for unanimous consent. Agreed? Okay. Continue.
Ms. Sharon Vogel: I’ll try to be quick.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: No, no. I just want to have questions.
Ms. Sharon Vogel: Absolutely. We want to answer your questions.
In terms of the current dispute resolution process, we’ve heard from a lot of stakeholders over the course of our review that using the lien remedy and then litigation costs too much and takes too long. We heard from some stakeholders who made submissions to you that adjudication is going to be costly. Well, it’s going to be significantly more cost-effective than a piece of litigation.
We also heard various submissions made to you about who the adjudicators are going to be, and that is going to be something that’s going to be addressed in the regulations. People made some very interesting submissions to you about adjudicators and wanting it not just to be a process that is controlled by lawyers, and that makes sense. For many of these disputes, the adjudicator may not be a lawyer, but could be an engineer, an architect or another experienced individual. There will be training programs set up by the ANA. It is possible that people who are representative and specialized in particular areas of the construction industry could be selected as adjudicators, provided they have the proper training, once the programs are set up.
You have heard from various stakeholders about surety bonds, including Mr. Ness and Mr. Bassett, who are here in the room. They’ve answered your questions about surety bonds, and you may have more for us today, but surety bonds were recommended by us as a policy-based solution to protect labour and material suppliers on a construction project, particularly in the event of an insolvency.
In conclusion, you’ve heard from many stakeholders about many ideas. We heard from those same stakeholders, and we heard many of those ideas that were articulated to you. Our report is entitled Striking the Balance for a reason: Not everybody gets everything they want. This is a compromise that is intended to work together. As we heard you say in response to some of the stakeholder submissions, the goal is to have a piece of legislation that works together, and pulling at one strand can affect so many other strands.
Thank you for your time.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much. We’ll move to Mr. Bisson.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: I have a lot of questions, but I’ll leave it at two.
The first one is: We’ve heard from one or two presenters that we should treat public versus private differently. I’d like to hear your thoughts about that.
And hang on; I’ll ask you the second question so that I don’t waste any time. The first presentation by Mr. Rotenberg talked about liens and simplifying that liens process, and I’d like to hear what you have to say about that.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: Well, maybe I can take the first question, and Ms. Vogel could handle the second question.
I think the focus of your question is the submission in regard to distinguishing between different classes of owners. The existing Construction Lien Act does make distinctions in regard to not so much public owners but public properties, and they are treated differently. You’ll recall Mr. Rotenberg mentioned that when you’re dealing with a public property, you don’t register the lien against the land, but you serve the lien, in essence.
That has been a distinction that has been maintained and broadened under our recommendations and under Bill 142. The report goes through quite an analysis of how much we should broaden the exemption of the lands from the lien. Without going into all of the granularity of it, we recommended that that be extended to municipal lands, and that was a recommendation that was accepted and is contained in the bill. Mr. Rotenberg was suggesting that we extend it further for reasons that have to do with insolvency risk. We recommended against extending it further.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): You have 20 seconds to finish that.
Ms. Sharon Vogel: In relation to the second question about lien procedures: They will be dealt with through the regulations.
Mr. Gilles Bisson: Just so you know, I’m not a big fan of delegating our authority to cabinet.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much.
We’ll move to government: Mr. Berardinetti.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: First of all, on behalf of the government, I want to thank you for your tremendous amount of work on this bill. As you said, it’s kind of a compromise, and I think we need to emphasize, too, that it’s a changing culture, because I think some of the presenters realize that this bill will cause a change in the industry of construction itself and how they shift money around.
Did you want to go any further with that? I think you explained it pretty well, in terms of—
Ms. Sharon Vogel: I think that our goal is to improve the flow of payment down the construction pyramid so it gets to the people at the bottom of the pyramid faster. That’s the goal here. You do have to re-engineer processes so that that happens, because it’s not happening now, as you heard from many of the stakeholders.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: Just a supplementary very quickly: I think you’ve heard from a number of owner-side stakeholders to the effect that they’re going to be inconvenienced. They’re going to have to redraft their standard form contracts. Collective agreements will have to be revised in order to bring them into alignment with the legislation.
That is absolutely correct. Standard form construction contracts are going to have to be revised. That’s one of the reasons that a staggered transition has been recommended, so that education and revision of standard form contracts and collective agreements can take place in order to bring the culture into alignment with the new legislation.
Mr. Lorenzo Berardinetti: Thank you again.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Mr. Hillier?
Mr. Randy Hillier: Generally speaking, the opposition is very satisfied with Bill 142. We’ve spoken highly of it. Also, more important has been the process and how it finally did get developed and developed properly.
But I do have some thoughts developing as I go through this consolidated construction act that was provided, that speaks of all these amendments or has a number of these amendments. This is a unique way of doing things. I’ve not seen it done this way in the past. Generally, we have amendments delivered in advance of clause-by-clause consideration, and we go through those. So it is very different to see an email from the Attorney General and then a change to the bill done up in this fashion.
I’m just wondering what certainty we have that your understanding of these changes, and the amendments that come through, will be the same thing.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: It’s a very good question. I have been involved in revising the amending motions, as has Ms. Vogel, along with the team from MAG every day this week. The latest versions of certain of the key amending motions, for example, I should be receiving in about an hour.
Mr. Randy Hillier: Okay.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: The amending motions are receiving very, very close attention, I can assure you. As I understand it, they will be filed by the end of the week, if I’m not mistaken.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Friday.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: Friday. At that time, of course, the committee will have the opportunity to look at the amendments in relation to the bill.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): We have about 10 seconds.
Mr. Randy Hillier: What we won’t know is what is being moved off into regulation, because the amendments can’t speak to that. The amendments speak to what is going to be incorporated in the bill. So if there are areas that are struck out, we won’t know if it’s the government’s intention just to strike them down, or if they’re going to be moved over to regulation.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): With that, Mr. Hillier, that’s all the time we have today.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: There’s a quick answer.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Thank you very much. On behalf of the committee, I really do want to thank you for your work on this legislation.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: Thank you very much.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): As I said, your name has come up virtually in every presentation. We are very thankful for all the work you’ve done. Thank you for that.
Mr. Bruce Reynolds: Thank you for allowing us to speak to you.
Ms. Sharon Vogel: Thank you.
Mr. Randy Hillier: Off the record, you can give us the answer now.
The Chair (Mr. Monte McNaughton): Yes, you can meet separately.
Presentations are over for today. I do want to remind committee, as was just mentioned, that amendments are due on Friday at noon. We will be meeting next Wednesday at 1 o’clock sharp. If I could remind all committee members to be here before 1 o’clock next Wednesday, as we consider clause-by-clause. Thank you.

This is a plea to all fans lucky enough to walk through the turnstiles at the Emirates this coming season. Since we moved there from our beloved Highbury, I can count on one hand the amount of times I wished I had been there rather than watching on TV or on the radio, those games are:
Liverpool 2008 when the crowd went ballistic against Howard Webb after sending off “he who shall not be named” with a second yellow, it was the first time I had heard the Emirates really rocking as the support got behind the team.
Spurs 2009 to have been there when Cesc nicked the ball straight from the restart and dancing round the defence before slotting home the second and sending the faithful into raptures.
Barca 2011 the atmosphere sounded incredible the result even better, that night the fans did something they so often don’t they made noise even though we weren’t winning, they were singing at 1-0 down coming in at half time, they were singing to the rafters as Arshavin came in to pass the winner into the net.
Personally I have been to one game where the atmosphere was memorable and that was Everton at home last season, again suffering an injustice the crowd made noise, pressured the ref, and lifted the team on to win in the second half.
This coming season I am worried more than ever about the lack of natural atmosphere in the Emirates.
To be quiet until given something to cheer or applaud is one thing, the growing prevalence of the boo boys (and girls) is another. I wrote a post last season about the growing moaners and groaners greeting every misplaced pass or shot, now I am asking that all who go to a home game go a little further, its time for everyone to unite in vocal support of our team.
By the way I should mention here that a long drawn out “SHOOOOOOOT” is not my idea of vocal support, if there is anything more ridiculous to be heard at a sporting venue I have not yet heard it, yes its more ridiculous than those teams in the Premier League that play a bit of music after every goal scored and the fans dance and singalong.
We need to create an atmosphere that not only lifts the players but also gives the players something to play for.
So how are we going to achieve this…….thats right what are WE going to do, no more excuses about it doesn’t feel like home, that the club don’t want an atmosphere that the stewards tell you to sit down. How many were standing for the last ten minutes against Barca, did you all get thrown out? No because they can’t they have no way of removing the whole end if you’re all standing and singing, its a football match they do expect it to happen.
The club gave us our Clock End back, and whilst the North Bank is not the same it can still be identified. So this is your mission if you find yourself sitting in the Clock End I ask you to stand on your feet, and sing loud and proud, you know the words:
“We’re the Clock End, We’re the Clock End, We’re the Clock End Emirates.”
Undoubtedly some around you will look at you like you’re the maddest fool ever to walk in the ground, but all you do is repeat again, louder if possible, and again. Now this is where your resolve will be tested trust me others want join in, they just don’t know it yet. If you still can’t get a response turn round make eye contact spread your arms wide and gesture to your fellow supporters that they might like to stand up and give you a hand in your stirring rendition. If at all possible make eye contact with the few that are singing with you and make sure they follow your lead in encouraging others to join in.
Hopefully if all goes to plan soon the whole of the Clock End will be singing and the North Bank (and RedAction) will have no choice to respond, if they choose not too I would suggest a rendition of “Can you hear the North Bank sing?” to get them stirred into action and try again with “We’re the Clock End.”
By the way I realise that I am asking that we include Emirates in the song, but if we haven’t accepted that is what our new home is called yet then we are stuck in the past unfortunately and I worry that we will never move on.
I know I am asking my fellow supporters to cast off the inhibitions but why should we care, we’re amongst friends, why should we feel we cannot express our love for the team in anyway we see fit. Its been five years since we moved to the Emirates its time we made it our home, its time we the fans built a fortress that other teams don’t like to come to and one that our team can’t wait to play in front of. The team needs us more than ever this season, I want them walking out feeling ten feet tall.
Whilst we’re discussing atmosphere we need some songs for the new additions, and a few for players who have not really been given songs unique to them. This lot either have boring songs (in my opinion) or no songs, time to get the thinking and lyrical caps on lads and lasses.
Aaron Ramsey
Jack Wilshere
Gervinho
Theo Walcott
Laurent Koscielny
Johann Djourou
Kieran Gibbs
Robin Van Persie
Bacary Sagna
Great post GIE
A passionate plea that all Arsenal supporters should take notice of.
Aaron Ramsey, Aaron Ramsey,
The ball at his feet, Defenders at sea.
Ahoy!! Ahoy!! Full steam ahead!!
Our Aaron Ramsey!
GIE, a man after my own heart, sing loud and be proud, a gooner till i die……
The fans can make a difference, unfortunately there are too many that cannot see the wood for the trees…….
I read a comment from the independant arsenals supporters meeting with Big Ivan, that just tickled me…….
Supporter” Why are Arsenal not agressively pursuing a centre back?”
Ivan “How do you know we are not?>”
Quality, some people just need to calm down and relax, wengers found his wallet and is spending, so that is a positive and with all the possible injuries AOC might get a game on saturday, if the country isnt in total melt down………
Actually really positive about season, let them all write us off……
And watch us go………COYRRG
Sorry GIE. Very eloquent and heartfelt plea my friend.
But I must disagree in part though I suspect I will be in the minority here again. yes by all means shout and sing but Stadia were made all seating for a very sound reason, good people died. So seats are made for sitting on. Many of us remember what a swaying crushing crowd was like, I like you am a big lad 6’1″ and at your age a fit 14 stone, still I was like a leaf in a brook when the crowd moved with a goal or a near miss. Tragedy was always just a stumble away
Get behind the team, sing your hearts out if that is your thing, but don’t endanger others by flouting the rules.
A few years ago there was a competition for a new tune… i think it was about rvp, the season he got 20 goals. One was
*tune of ghostbusters*
If theres trouble on the field, who ya gonna call? VAN PERSIE!
Could put jack wilshere instead…
Brought a tear to my eye, GIE…
Anyone remember the old Subbuteo adverts??
Subbuteo! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
The champion game of all…(or something like that)
One possibility for Gervinho??
Morning all, thanks for comments.
DanDan I agree about why sitting was introduced but it is frankly impossible to surge (except sideways) in an all seater. I am not suggesting we stand for 90 minutes but I am saying that it is possible to stand for a while as a group to get some atmosphere going.
I was thinking something along the tune of His Got the Whole World in his Hands for Gervinho:
He’s got the biggest forehead in the land
Biggest forehead in the land…… 😀
GIE, I respect your judgement and having never been to the Emirates would not wish to argue with your obvious experience.
Again though as an armchair fan the banking does appear steep and I have seen several articles levelling that criticism at Wembley, how do the two compare
Vishal. Are you a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan?
DanDan depends if you’re in Upper or Lower, the Lower is safe, the Upper at the back would not be food for suggested of Vertigo.
In fact a friend of my Dads went with his wife and they were at the back of the Upper. Such I’d her fear of heights she could not take more than thirty minutes and asked to leave, as they were about to exit a steward asked if they were ok, they explained and the steward found them a pair of seats in the lower tier…..class act.
Food for suggested = good for sufferers….damn iphone
Excellent Gee Up Post GIE, 🙂
I cannot help but agree with everything you say, except, like Dandan has said, for the safety issues of the standing bit.
I agree the idea is a good one, in theory, for generating a feeling of togetherness for singing and support, especially as the seats at the Emirates are generously proportioned and a bit impersonal, but I wonder, from a practical viewpoint, if it would be a good idea for children and older people around such a group who might not be able to see?
Darn! I am beginning to sound like my dad!! 🙂
Great post. Articulate and with passion. How do we get it out to those that don’t, won’t or can’t read AA cos otherwise it feels a bit like preaching to the converted (with the odd notable exception).
It’s a bit like telling mindless rioters that they are only destroying their own back yard – they just seem unable &/or unwilling to comprehend the damage they are doing to themselves.
I know we shouldn’t discuss other Arsenal blogs so I will use a code name.
I am annoyed that the Lunatic Garden has the ear of the media:
Apparently we are ALL fuming that we’ve spent £15m on the Ox. Twitter reaction attests that not all Arsenal fans are fuming and in fact they are more disappointed that The Lunatic Garden has become our mouthpiece to the red tops.
Anyone know any media types where we can put across another PoV? Seems like as with the London Looting that the actions of the minority will tear apart the majority.
RedMJ stick it on Twitter, FB wherever. Hopefully a few will drop by, but in fact I’m not sure I aim to convert the naysayers I want to galvanise the quiet majority into being a little bit more vocal.
Harry I love that Q&A excerpt with Ivan.
RA stand the youngsters on the seats like we do at away games.
GiE
The media have thier agenda and they will source anything that backs it up. They don’t usually give a damn about any fan sites/groups. I haven’t read LG today yet but I find it weird thet we’ve spent money on a 17 year oold. It’s not really what we need. We’ve got young players coming out of our ears. Has Ryo’s permint been turned down?
What about Vermalen? We have no good song for him. this is to the tune of pop eye the sailor man.
Vermalen the Arsenal Man,
Much better than Ferdinand.
He’s strong to the finish,
He pisses on Vidic
Vermalen the Arsenal Man.
The Bear is ready to growl and dance if our Manager can do us one BiG favour, bring in a defensive coach even Martin Keown on a temporal basic. Arsenal can score goals, but our singing will soon turn glans when we see holes appearing at the back again.
Mr. Wenger you cannot do it all, bring in a little Help! During these desperate times, give us a temporary fix, let us see our beloved team compete an show some character week by week! Decent defenders yes, but also a decent defensive coach could make all the difference.
GiE – brilliant idea! Can I really stand up and sing loudly, on my own without a care? How much I would love to do that…..Maybe if I go on my own, I wouldn’t do it with 26 around, he’d get me sued for being sober and disorderly 🙂
Red Arse – ha, ha, ha, I am brain ‘death’ all right
Gus – I like it very much 🙂
Gus I like that one.
I also like it when we all sing
“Tommys Gonna Get Ya”
In that ner net ner ner playground way after he floors someone.
President Kennedy didnt realise you were re-incarnated!!! Lol
Course you can Evonne you just have to make sure 26 hasn’t got his hand on your knee 🙂
GiE – on my throat more like it, I cannot sing to save my life 🙂
How about this:
to the same tune as Viera…….comes from Senagal…
Koscielny oooooh, Koscielny ooooooh,
Laurent comes from France
He won’t give Mancs a chance
Koscielny oooooh……
?
Now Evonne you told me he was Polish 😉
Not bad though I was thinking for Kozzer the tune of Rock the Casbah:
Laurent Koscielny
He’s a Gooner, he’s a Gooner
Good post
If the fans get behind the team, win lose or draw, the atmosphere will improve and that stadium could be electric
We must support the team, its our club for heavens sake.
Wonderful rousing post GiE.
I think the singing is hampered by the design of the stadium to an extent. Aren’t a lot of the songs started by the brilliant away fans and then they are adopted by the Emiratasia!
On a side note, Newcastle (the city) seems quite a calm place at the moment, maybe our game will be one of the few to take place this weekend.
Incidentally, I think the purchase of Exox means that the Nasri deal is all but done.
We’re the yellow quadrant
We’re the yellow quadrant
We’re the yellow quadrant ashburton grove.
Grvinho oh oh
Gervinho oh oh oh
He hasn’t got a song
Bet he don’t give a f**k
(i’m working on it)
Same old type of post.
even if I agree with it!
I think you wrote the same with the same article last year or almost.
Come On face it! Wenger nurtured a talented young team with now players really keen to play their hearts out for arsenal, … but unlike barcelona, we never bought the couple of world-class players who would raise the level at the right time!
man u is still looking stronger on the paper, and would arsenal have come back like they did in the community shield.. I hope so! but I doubt so!
Now WTF Wenger is ready to selll Nasri to one of the manchester teams???????????
I hope he is ready to buy SNEIJDER in counterpart.
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY CAN’T AW BUY FOR ONCE A PLAYER THAT YOU KNOW HE S GOING TO PROVIDE ?
and on top of that I think Sneijder could fill the steps of Bergkamp at Arsenal.
imagine him with Van Persie???
He definitely would suit better our type of game than the one at man u or man city or wherever in Premiership.
I really hope our team get stronger with a couple of real signings….
Because this year competition will be tougher thaan eveeer
Come ON ArsenaL!
Hi all, wonderful post GiE.
I was only saying to ‘er indoors last week how much better it would be if we could stand. Unfortunately she didn’t really understand.
I’m quite beligerant about it and I generally stand until asked to sit, but mostly I manage to last most of the game as everyone around me stand up too.
But then, I only get to go when my friends in London get me a spare or whenever I can get tickets to see them oop north.
WG
@Mikee
I love the idea of Sneider, but we will never sign him. In my opinion he costs too much money and Arsene doesn’t like big transfers, with big players, with big ego’s.
Plus, I think we’re covered in that role, even if we lose Nasri and Cesc, Arsene will buy Mata and that will be that.
I expect Mata and A N Other defender to be signed before August 31st.
I don’t expect Nasri or Cesc to be here, although I’d love to keep both I just can’t see it at the moment.
WG
HIS QUICK HIS SLICK ,HIS BETTER THAN MODRIC JACK WILSHERE JACK WILSHERE 9(petits old song)
Exile, great post that one. I’ve come to the view that the greatest threat to our success isn’t weak defending, disloyal players or complacement management; it’s the fans. Time for us to buck up our ideas in a big way, by contributing to the team’s success at games and stop constantly bleating about what we’re entitled to.
And now for some words I never thought I’d type: I disagree with Dandan (@9:53am)!
Many of us remember what the terraces were like before Hillsborough and the Taylor Report mandated all-seaters for top division clubs. Often fun, grubby and communal but occasionally dangerous, and once in a while fatal. They had to go. But there are safe seating stadia, in particular at the most fan-friendly football league in Europe, the Bundesliga in Germany.
There is a campaign to develop this new, safe version of standing (see), and I think it would be fantastic if we saw those principles adopted here. It would help rebuild atmosphere, would likely increase numbers who could attend and would help offer fans cheaper tickets. If memory serves, Gazidis confirmed at the club’s Q&A that the topic is on his agenda.
@WiganGooner
Well I think Wenger and Arsenal will be financially strong to get Sneijder and his wages if we sell and Cesc and Nasri…
and thy would be greatly inspired to get him and not leaving one of the 5 best players in Europe actually…
But as Arsene knows, … We Fans know our manager is not seriously mounting a strong challenge with his team, he just prepares future. For that we have to thank him.
But I’m sorry, although I’m happy our team is prepared to mount the 21st century; MY FUTURE IS NOW!
And by the way, I resemble any allegation that I touched Evonne’s knee, or any of her other joints. You’ll have noticed that Sharkey, the original purveyor of such scurrilous filth, now desists from such behaviour. I’m not saying I got my lawyers (Rarter-Cuck & Co) onto him, but his silence should tell you all you need to know…….
😉
26,
I know lawyers don’t speak English (UK or US) but; “And by the way, I resemble any allegation that I touched Evonne’s knee”.
In what way do you resemble this allegation or the knee? Explain, please?
I’m bent?
26 – you are the funniest lawer I’ve ever met 🙂
RA – sadly, he didn’t touch me 😦
I have a song for AA, to the tune of ‘I wish they all could be Californian..’ :
‘I wish they all could be like Arshavin
I wish they all could be like Arshavin
I wish they all could beeeee like Andrey!!!
Brilliant, init?
GiE – they are ALL Polish when it suits me 🙂 Koscielny, Jagielka, Andy Johnson and the Milliband brothers
Kelsey – I am not shocked, it was a timebomb ready to explode. There is a complete breakdown of society in London; I have lived here for more than 30 years and have never seen it so bad. Dog eats dog here, that’s all matters.
@ GiE
great post, arsenal fans must unite. The only thing worse than hearing the doom and gloom fans, is hearing them say “i told you so” as though they wanted us to lose just so they were correct. Makes me sick.
I don’t bleed red…i bleed red currant!!!
GiE
Inspirational post!
If the Ems crowd can stop the loud groaning over every mistake and actually start making some positive noise, maybe the lads will play as well at home as they do away from home.
Was your title inspired by Redders’ referencing of that famous JFK quote the other day?
Quite like that one Evonne, Aaron Ramsey fits quite well
I wish they all could be Aaron Ramsey
I wish they all could be Aaron Ramsey
Repeat
The post has been in mind for a while Rocky wanted to leave it as close to the start of the real business, and then you two were discussing along those lines and Redders did indeed give me the title.
AFC.com report that Miyaichi has been granted his work permit…

Great post. Here’s my tuppence worth.
To the tune of Back in the USSR:
Bacary Bac’ry Sagna
Na na na na na na na na
Bacary Bacary Bacary Sagna
To the base line of You Really Got Me:
Lau-rent-Ko-sciel-ny
Lau-rent-Ko-sciel-ny
Lau-rent-Ko-sciel-ny
Lau-rent-Ko-sciel-ny
(repeat to fade, or do the whole 12-bar thing)
To the tune of Delilah:
My, my, Aaron Ramsey
My, my, Aaron Ramsey
I’ll get me coat.
If you want it to fit that John D, Ballad that I think Evonne is quoting…It probably needs to be something like. ……. I wish they all could play/be like Aaron Ramsey, needs the extra word, don’t you think.
Evonnes doing Californian Girls by BeachBoys no?
Steve I need to YouTube the bassline and songs to which you refer.
I like the Aaron Ramsey one that’ll get right up the Stokie see you next Tuesdays noses.
Steve that Aaron Ramsey to Delilah we need to add some bits for the next few lines and get that one out there I really like it, singing in my head now that’ll be fantastic.
Micky @2.21……..absolutely our biggest Achilles heel is our fanbase…….they have an inate ability to suck any positivity out of the stadium and then unfurl the negativity blanket over the pitch…..
Great news about ryo, just bag any half decent cb and confirm Joel Campbell and we will rock the premiership………
how about : we are all insaaaane on this bloggggg ….to any tune you like 🙂
Harry – did Ryo get work permit??
Ok I have used the original Delilah Lyrics and come up with something that scans I think.
My My Aa-ron Ramsey da da da da da
My My Aa-ron Ramsey da da da da da
We can see, that leg is back in one piece
Now you’ll score goals and you’ll lead us to victory
Original
My my my Delilah
Why why why Delilah
I could see, that girl was no good for me
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free
Right you all need to record yourselves singing that, send peaches an email of the MP3 and she can forward it to me, and i’ll do a bit of Garage Band trickery to put it all together to sound like a crowd of us. Then we get it on YouTube and off to Twitter etc.
Well done Steve
GiE – no, that’s going too far, I am depressed, not completely mad. Not going to start recording Delilah, no fecking way, sorry
This song could apply to any of our want away players.
They’re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa….
original recording by Napoleon XIV
Yes HTM Ryo got his work permit………
The plot thickens:
Nasri and Cesc in the squad for CL Qualifier
But Arsene has used the dreaded words:
.”
Nik B’s in the squad too….has AW masterminded some crazy plan where the whole of the footballing world believes we’re in disarray but actually all is set to come up roses as everyone stays and a CB is signed?
Not bad GIE, but needs to be catchier……not sure why you have not used why why why on second line helps the tune flow…………
My My My Aaron Ramsey,
Why Why Why Aaron Ramsey,
Oh so impressed with Arsenal, he said Man U was no good for me,”
He said yes to the boss and no to fergie…………
I’ll get my coat as well
I just want the Nasri / Fabregas issues sorted, not bothered either way now…….
Rasp, Think you need to add returnees from Loans under your ins for the season, Ryo is a definite addition to the squad……..
GIE, I actually hope that Nik B stays, but he seemingly is off………

Fabianski, Jenkinson, Frimpong, Ramsey, AOC, Ryo, Djourou….
Fancy them smashing the barcodes…….
RvP in the hole….interesting. Think I’d actually stick Theo up top, let the three of AA Gerv and RvP rotate and find space and holes.
The way you have it there really is no need for the back four or Song to join in as much as they do. Can’t see Pardew putting out ultra defensive in first home game.
Outside a lunatic asylum one day
Arsene Wenger was plying his trade
When up popped a lunatic who said to him
Good morning Gunner Wenger
How much a day do you get for doing that?
Fifty quid, he replied
He looked at him with a lot of glee
And here is what he cried
Come. inside, you silly bugger, come inside
I hoped you had a bit more sense
Working for the Arsenal, take my tip
Act a little crazy and become a lunatic
You get 3 points quite regular
And the odd trophy beside
What for Fifty quid a week
And ungrateful fans to please
Come inside, you silly bugger, come inside

GIE
Lovin that 8:26
Do you remember when we played a qualifier in the CL and Rayes was on the bench desperate to get a move to Real Madrid, I can’t remember who the opposition were but Rayes had absolutely no intention of coming on.
Ooooh we can play guess the line up again, I love this game.
—————Szcznesy
Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs
—–Ramsey, Song, Wilshere
—-Gervinho, RvP, Arshavin
The thing is if Nasri is fit I can’t see how Wenger can leave him out.
That team would destroy the bar codes.
London it was against Dinamo Zagreb in 2006/07…..I see the same situation, but can we afford to name 2 subs that wont play?
GIE,
To be honest the complete top 4 can rotate, happy with GMan out wide and Theo up top……..As usual we are all so interchangeable……….
GiE – the fact that both Cesc and Samir are included in the squad means nothing, they could still be sold. If they were not included, then we would have our answers, for now all we have is faith and silly songs
GIE = 8:45. I’m with you here, I would give Theo several games up front, imo I think he would do well in this position especially with AA/RvP/Gerv/ just behind, with AA and Gerv traxking back with Ramsey and Song in the middle. Sagna Vermaelen Kos Traore.
Then we have Jack (when fit)/oxlade/rosicky/Diaby/DjourouGibbs/Chamakh/Lansbury as back up.
Send a taxi for Nasri and Fabregas, pack them off to the airport and lets move on.
Hello VCC
I’d love to see Theo getting a run-out up front. We have enough players who are capable of playing killer through balls – then his speed and finishing could really come into play.
Evening,
I think the inclusion of Nasri and Cesc in the CL is a very clever bluff/ploy to force their respective suitors to come up with a sensible offer. This way, if the buying clubs are serious, they will have to conclude their business early and so give Arsenal the time to secure the new signings it will fund.
Mr London you’re on a roll 😀
Hi Rocky.
Looking forward to the week end and Saturday evenings game, especially as I have just received ESPN upgrade for free. San Miguels in the fridge ready.
I’m sick to the back teeth over this Nasri/Fabregas saga.
Can we blame Nasri for wanting to double his weekly salary considering the lack of activity/ambition Arsenal have shown in the summer period? If my Son was lucky enough to be in his boots I think I would say the same, considering a footballers life can be short. Fabregad, well he has been a great player for us but I’m afraid to say his body language tells me he does not want to be at the Emirates any longer. We should pick ourselves up sell them both and move on the best we can. Fingers crossed we might still surprise one or two this season (hopefully)
Rasp
I was going to say which of the two do you think will play in the first leg of the CL, my hunch was that Nasri was going to be pushed on but I have just realised that he is banned for the first leg.
Wigan Gooner – I need to email you but I’m not sure which of your email addresses to use, can you email me using your preferred one please 😉
London – Camberwell Gooner had submitted a post a couple of days ago, is it ok with you to use his tomorrow?
Thanks for helping out this morning xx
Hi London,
I think Nasri will go to City and they will secure the deal before the CL qualifier – with their sort of money it would be ridiculous to let him play if they really want him.
Cesc is a much more interesting situation. It really seems that he is more of a political signing than a football necessity. They don’t really need him and may suspect that he is a bit of a crock. If they do buy him for £40m and he becomes a bench player they will get stick from their own fans (who apparently aren’t that bothered) They bought TH when he had a chronic back condition that meant he could only use his pace sparingly and was only half the player he had been for Arsenal.
When you look at it, we’ve won almost every hand of ‘player poker’ that we’ve played with Barca – and they’re still trying – laughable really.
London you have just made me realise that RvP is banned too? 😥
Hmmm, I still can’t see Nasri going to City; of course I could be wrong there was that one time in 1987 but that was just a glitch. lol
That said, if Nasri went and Cesc stayed I would be over the moon as they say in football parlance.
“Player poker” I just thought about it, that’s a clever term.
Cracking read GiE.
Evening all
Night all
Hope you are well Sharkey.
I will be appalled if Nasri goes to citeh, it can never acceptable for a player that would definitely start for us to go another Premiership club ……………………
I think City need Nasri as much as Barca need Cesc (= not a lot!) and they are paying the price for glory buys in the form of Adebayor, Santa Cruz and several others on impossibly high wages that won’t move on to take a pay cut. However, I think their disregard for the value of money (100m for Kaka) means they will press ahead and buy Nasri.
Can i buy tickets in the Family Enclosure even if i’m not accompanied by a JG or Senior Citizen?
Answer soon will be good as I’m trying to book a reasonable price ticket for Swansea Home, if not I’m gonna go on Ticket Exchange fort a ticket for Liverpool game, can you believe people are giving their tickets away on Exchange for first home game?
Has anyone else noticed how that signing of AOC has becalmed the blog world?
It has just shut people like Ghost Face and Spectrum up completely they have got nothing to moan about and as they don’t know how to say anything good about Arsenal they are flummoxed. I know AOC is not the defender that everyone was hoping for but the doomers can’t be sure now that a new CB is not on the way.
I love that question to Gazidis: well you have brought another attacking midfielder why didn’t you buy a CB.
Answer: what makes you think we won’t?
Love it.
I paraphrase of course.
London,
The row between Nasri and AW on the plane suggests a breakdown in the relationship bewteen the two. I never thought we’d turn down 20m+ now and let him go on a free but I would put a 5m premium on the price if he wants to stay in the prem = 22m to city or 17m to Inter
GiE – I’m pretty certain you can’t just buy tickets in the Family enclosure. I think I tried it once and it didn’t work.
Oh by the way a song for AOC.
“The Ox The Ox The Ox is on Fire”
To the tune of Roof on Fire natch
Evening peaches, are the fires still burning on the horizon?
I wondered what on earth you were talking about then GIE, Swansea? Has the CC draw been made already. And then the penny dropped doh.
Night, night.
Hello 26 when you come on at 3am.
Bugger to be honest not sure I want to sit in their and try to get everyone singing anyway 😀
I’ll check with wife in morning then I’m booking tickets for Liverpool through the Exchange.
Wow, do you think that row actually happened? I have not been sure whether to believe it or not.
I must go, see ya.
2 club level for Liverpool anyone? £229 each on Exchange but they are together.
i’m off ski too, frovelling time, night all
Who knows, it was widely reported and for some reason seems believable. I get the impression that Nasri is quite immature – the long standing feud with Gallas wasn’t exactly professional.
frovelling = grovelling, but you knew that
Hi Rasp – apparently the locals in Enfield are fighting back or at least were up for being present on the streets.
Rasp – I’ve put Camberwell Gooners post in drafts. You must’ve been snoozing all evening 😉 I’m going to bed, nite all
Yes peaches, vigilanteism is breaking out widely because the police are perceived as not having done enough to protect businesses. Apparently in Enfield, some far right extremists took the opportunity to attack the looters – which also leaves a bit of a bad taste.
An early evening for me on AA – but thanks London!
Anyone seen the news of Millwall fans protecting Eltham High Street?
Though their version of “protecting” doesn’t seem to exclude a pint or two……
I’ve done some work on CG’s post peaches.
Very good post GIE
26 can’t say I’m not worried by that pic, have to wonder if they’re just looking for a scrap, have just read some of Nick Griffins Twitter timeline, he is an odious little **** and he is using this to spout absolute poison. And he is giving plaudits to Millwall fans and having a pop at the Police for stopping them.
GiE
I bought a ticket in the family enclosure for the game against Celtic in the CL. That was the most swearing I’d heard at the Emirates.
😀 GM
Morning all,
I’m really not clear in my mind how to value Cesc. How does his apparent injuryness impact his value?
Also on the Cesc/Nasri fiasco, I kept hearing there was unrest in the camp last season and I can’t help thinking Nasri may have been the culprit.
Keeping Cesc and Nic (only played CF) and signing a Cahill/Jag/Subotic and I would be happy. Would still like a 6’+ DM but hey ho.
26,
“Though there version of “protecting” doesn’t seem to exclude a pint or two…”. (-:
It appears that with the introduction of the loathesome Nic Griffin mob, we are in a win win situation. Both sides can kick many bells out of each other. In place of the Wembley friendly, perhaps rounding up both sides and selling Gladiator style spectator tickets could raise cash for the clear up. Then for a Grand Finale, choppers would swing by and drop in the SAS for a final tidy up. Oh how the crowd would enjoy themselves.
Micky
Will there be a familly enclosure? Lol
London,
No, not with the likes of the 6’3″ GiE sneaking in on the cheap!
And morning.
So having foolishly just scanned the BBC gossip column and NN I have found that Nasri and Fabregas are likely to leave. According to Chamakh these deals will happen as soon as Wenger has identified replacements.
This does conjure a funny image: I can picture Wenger frantically looking down a list of players names because after all it would never have crossed his mind to do so before.
And morning Micky.
London you have such a great tone of damning these idiotic reports.
GiE – but he is right, AW has probably been preparing for it since last year.
Micky – 6’3″ GiE sneaking in 🙂 that made my day
Break out the rubber bullets, the little shits won’t be able to run away with a broken kneecap will they.
Its a win-win.

Wigan,
Rubber bullets?
You old softie!
And what should be done about the cops that lied that Duggan shot at them and the bullet was in the radio??? The looters have no respect for police, but respect has to be earned, it is not a given. I think the looting is a disgrace, but so are the police.
Evonne,
It has absolutely nothing to do with Duggan. The looters have no respect for anyone or anything.
Sorry, but this will have to be my last comment on the subject. My bad for bringing it up on a Footie/Accounting Blog.

A storm has pushed the ship Phileas Fogg and I are travelling on off course, and the captain has decided to head for Honolulu instead of San Francisco.
We don't have time for such a diversion. We are, after all, trying to circumnavigate the globe in under 80 days.
It's not going well though. I keep saying the wrong thing, turning possible allies against me as I try to drum up enough support to overthrow the ship and make sure it goes to its intended destination.
We're already short of money, short on time, and short on pretty much everything apart from shaving cream and wool trousers.Travel log
The game is essentially a choose your own adventure book, albeit presented with the sort of swagger and literacy that some examples of the genre can't muster.
The story is set in a steampunk world filled with incredible contraptions and fantastic characters. It's a war torn world, revealed in snatches of conversation and fantastically written descriptions.
You play Fogg's manservant, Passepartout. Every choice you make alters the story in some way. You might change your relationship status, find some new routes from a fellow passenger, or discover a way to make some cash at your next destination.
Planning your route means weighing up your luggage, the cost of transport, how much health it's going to cost you, and where you can move on to from your destination.Lost in a good way
You can get cash from the bank, but it takes a few days to get a decent amount. Some of the cities you end up in have markets where you can buy and sell goods. Most places have hotels, but sleeping rough is a valid tactic if you're low on money.
There are some amazing sights to see on your journey. In India you'll come across a walking city, in Paris you can chat to the creators of ornate blimps, and in Russia you'll find yourself in the middle of a robotic revolution.
The story is so good you'll want to play through it multiple times, partly to see everything the beautifully created world has to offer, and partly to experience the other side of the choices you made the first time round.
There's a clever multiplayer meta-game as well. You can track the progress of other players as they make their way around the world, seeing how far ahead of your friends you are and which routes they've picked.Steam
The mutiny doesn't play out the way I want it to, and Fogg and I are dumped on Honolulu behind schedule. It's fine though, it's another unexpected part of the journey, another conundrum to overcome with words and a map of the sea lanes.
80 Days is something special. It isn't perfect, and sometimes the decisions you make won't have the outcomes you expect. But there's a weight to proceedings that makes you push on through the wonderfully written experience.
If you've any interest in story, then this is a game you have to play. It's rich with ideas, brilliantly written, and creates a world that you'll want to visit over and over again.Benefits of 1st class train travel in Europe
I boarded the first class carriage of Switzerland’s famous Glacier Express – possibly the most luxurious scenic train in Europe – and instantly felt out of sorts. One month of travel had not been particularly kind on my Converses – they were battered and caked in a layer of mud courtesy of the Italian Alps, as was my once-red backpack that had been through the wringer. My jeans had ripped at the knee a few weeks earlier somewhere in France, and I’d stopped caring too much about combing my hair.
I found a seat two away from a man in a crisp navy golf shirt and a fedora, and a woman dressed entirely in white except for her dark glasses. As I sat down, he subtly nudged her. They exchanged a few hushed words, and when the conductor walked the carpeted aisles I’m pretty sure they adjusted their seats to get a good view of my imminent ejection. But it never happened, because clenched in my fist was a 1st class Eurail Global Pass, with which I was cruising my way across the continent.
After the conductor left I met the couples’ eyes, smiled smugly, and then shifted my focus to the scenic spectacle unfolding outside. When the waiters arrived to lay the table in front of me, with starched tablecloths, silver cutlery and actual glasses, I felt like I was living the lifestyle of the rich and famous.
Although on most trains you’ll ride in Europe there’s not likely to be a huge difference between first and second class, there are some that can create lasting memories, improve your experience, or just slightly increase your comfort. Here’s what you can get with your 1st class train pass in Europe.
Increased leg room and seat width
Your seat is possibly the most important comfort factor while on board a train, and when it comes to regional trains in Europe most are created equal – that is to say not lounge-recliner comfortable, but usually perfectly acceptable for a few hours of overland travel.
Some trains, however, throw in a few extra centimetres for first class travellers on both the seat width and leg room that can make all the difference. Some trains also configure the aisles to make them slightly wider, usually making the experience less cramped.
Superior comfort
Some trains take first class comfort further than a few added centimetres. Most first class seats now have plug points for each passenger, wider tables, more generous luggage racks, and, increasingly, free wifi.
First class in Switzerland’s scenic trains, for example, also often offer leather seats, carpeted aisles, and at-seat service. If you’re travelling through Austria, and willing to pay in a little extra on top of your first class Pass when aboard a RailJet train, you can recline in a lavish business class seat that more closely resembles a living room sofa than a typical train seat. On some routes they’ll even throw in a cold beer delivered and poured at your seat. Although these are the exceptions rather than the norm, they’re worth looking out for while planning your journeys.
Peace and quiet
The social factor is one of the biggest reasons to travel by train. The relaxed nature of second class means it’s easy to strike up a conversation with fellow travellers, and alight with a handful of new Facebook friends and Instagram followers.
First class can be slightly different, however. Most people in Europe’s first class train carriages are travelling for business, or are on someone else’s dime, so they’re less into the small talk and more into their laptops. Because of the price of these point-to-point tickets, the carriages are also often less crowded, allowing you more room to spread out and relax, and the general peace and quiet of these carriages can be surprisingly welcome after a few weeks of intense travel.
Finding a seat
Second class point-to-point tickets can cost up to 30% less than first class tickets, and at peak times or on popular routes this can often mean finding a seat is difficult. First class is seldom full, and it’s usually much easier to find a seat. This is also a factor to consider if you want to bag a specific seat, like by the window or at a table.
Ordering in
Many first class carriages in high speed trains across Europe offer some kind of on-board meal served at your seat, often at no extra cost. Depending on the route this can be as simple as crackers and a coffee, but on certain trains such as the Eurostar or Thalys it can be a full meal.
Some of the continent’s famous scenic trains have onboard waiters who’ll attend to you at your seat, and although meals usually cost extra, they’re worth trying at least once for a truly unique dining experience.
Seamless arrivals and departures
Much like first class on airplanes, many trains are configured to make it very clear that those able to afford this luxury are prioritized. This often means that first class carriages on the longer high-speed trains, like the Thalys and Eurostar, arrive in the station closest to the exit – perfect for saving a few minutes if you’re in a rush. Some of these trains also offer priority boarding to first class and business premier ticket holders.
First class lounges
Your first class Eurail Pass will give you access to first class lounges on the day of your departure at many stations in Europe with these facilities. Some of these lounges go as far as to offer free food, drinks (sometimes including alcohol), newspapers, comfortable reclining seats, baggage storage, and wifi. This is a particularly useful benefit if you have a long wait before your connecting train.The median home value in Friant, CA is $446,500.

On many boats, decks are cored with end-grain balsa or plywood with a fiberglass laminate on each side. Stanchion bases and chainplates often leak as a boat ages, and often holes are drilled in the deck for new hardware, anchoring systems or dinghy tie downs, and not properly sealed by coating the exposed core with epoxy resin. When friends on an Allmand 31 asked my husband, Dave, for advice about repairing cracks in the fiberglass near their bow cleats, Dave realized they had a much bigger problem than mere stress cracks.
Upon further inspection, he found that the entire plywood core of the foredeck was rotten. Previous owners had cut holes for the anchor rode to pass through the deck into the bow locker without waterproofing the exposed edge of the core between the two laminates of fiberglass. The plywood had been reduced to a soggy sponge, no longer supporting the foredeck, which visibly undulated when the anchor rode pulled tight or someone walked on it.
Bottom line: the core needed to be replaced. Dave opted to remove the inside fiberglass laminate in order to replace the core, rather than cut through the fiberglass deck.
Also, by not cutting the deck there is no possibility of the new seam opening up later. While our friend removed the various pieces of hardware from the foredeck bow pulpit, cleats and chocks , Dave began in the forepeak.
This overhang of remaining fiberglass would later help support the replacement plywood. The exact size of the lip was not important; go with whatever works best with the existing hardware and the location of the rot.
Dave used an oscillating saw with a titanium-coated blade to cut the core and the inside fiberglass laminate. When the interior laminate was cut, it took little effort to peel it off the rotted wooden core. With the laminate and the wood removed, Dave next attacked the remaining core between the lip of interior fiberglass and the deck. To remove the rot he broke it into smaller pieces with a chisel and then used his deck caulking reeving tools which resemble bent screwdrivers to clean out these scraps of rotten wood.
Once the area to be repaired was completely clear, it was time to build the replacement core. The demands on an older cruising boat are sometimes extreme, and the bow is often exposed to unpredictable loads when anchoring or mooring.
Dave was hesitant to overbuild the repair which can be just as dangerous as under building , but the owners will address the issue of the added weight forward with changes in stowage. Using the laminate skin as a template, Dave built the replacement core in three pieces�two triangular side pieces and a trapezoidal middle section�for ease of handling and to help the core conform to any curve in the deck.
Because the replacement core was thicker than the space between laminates, he marked off the distance of the overhanging lip of fiberglass and used a router to remove the extra thickness around the side edge of each board.
Dave then dry-fitted the port and starboard pieces, marking any spots where he needed to remove additional wood for a tight fit while still leaving enough room for a good epoxy coating on the plywood.
Using a grinder, Dave tapered the edges of the boards where they met the remaining laminate. This tapered area would make blending the two areas together with fiberglass tape easier later on. This would allow the inside laminate to lie over the replaced core without leaving a bulge where the tape was.
On the morning we were going to epoxy the new core Dave placed the epoxy resin in the refrigerator to allow for a longer cure time. Even though we were using slow-cure hardener, we knew that so much epoxy in a small area would cure more quickly than we could complete the job unless we slowed the cure time as much as possible.
After that, we dry-fitted all three pieces again and screwed several screws with large finish washers into the new core from the outside. Because Dave would be replacing the inside laminate, he could not screw the core in place and it needed to be secured while he completed the installation.
Screening the forepeak off from the rest of the boat with plastic to minimize the mess, Dave taped a shop-vac hose to his sander and sanded every surface that would be epoxied.
After wiping down the area with acetone, we were ready to install the new core. Dave alway wears a respirator when sanding, and when we are dealing with acetone or epoxy, we wear respirators with volatile organic compound filters, gloves which on messy jobs such as this one are taped around his wrists , long-sleeved shirts and hats.
He should have been wearing a Tyvek suit as well. Though he usually works very cleanly, the small space made keeping epoxy off his skin very difficult. The hardware is bolted back on, and the foredeck is good as new.
To protect the interior of the boat, we lined the hull and bunk in the forepeak with plastic before we began epoxying. While I mixed eight pumps of resin and hardener at a time, Dave used a chip brush to apply neat unthickened epoxy to the plywood and the underside of the outside fiberglass laminate.
This prevents the joint from being epoxy-starved when the wood soaks epoxy out of the thickened mixture used for gluing. Next, he used colloidal silica to thicken the epoxy to the consistency of frosting. Using a putty knife, he then pushed this thick mixture into the spaces between the two laminates. He also smeared this thickened epoxy onto the starboard piece, fitted it using a mallet, after which the owner secured it from above with screws, as we had practiced earlier.
Dave repeated the process on the port side, directing the placement of additional screws as necessary to pull the wood and laminate together to prevent voids. As he did so we were careful not to tighten the screws to the point that all the epoxy was squeezed out, leaving nothing to adhere to the wood and fiberglass. After the middle piece was installed in the same manner, Dave laid two strips of fiberglass tape along the seams where the three pieces joined.
Next, he coated the laminate skin with neat and then thickened epoxy and screwed it to the new plywood core. Though he had planned to use fiberglass tape along all four outside edges of the laminate at, this time, he decided to wait until this portion had cured. The next day he removed the screws, sanded down the edges of the inside laminate and epoxied the fiberglass tape to the edges of the laminate. He also squeezed thickened epoxy into the screw holes after countersinking them, after which the foredeck was ready for the hardware to be reinstalled.
When installing any hardware into a cored deck, it is best to drill an oversized hole and fill it with thickened epoxy. After this has cured, drill the size hole that is necessary to accommodate the hardware installation. This way, there is no exposed wood to allow moisture into the deck. Similarly, if you make a large hole, such as for a hawsepipe, in a plywood deck, coat the exposed wood with epoxy. For a cored deck, scrape out a ring of core from between the two laminates and fill this area with thickened epoxy.
After many years in the Caribbean, where they raised their three sons aboard, they are now empty nesters, meandering their way around the tropics. February 2, was a beautiful Sunday afternoon.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, it’s become more and more important for government to keep its citizens informed and involved in fighting the virus and its spread.

4 thoughts on “Bye, bye Amway Global ….”
hi this work wounderfull my life is totally change i am very happy.
FINALLY! Ive been waiting for this day to come since the day I joined when they were Quixtar!
I figured the name would eventually revert back to just “Amway.” I don’t think that will be a problem for those like me that are building a retail-based business. I also don’t think it will be a problem for those that are not deceptive in their business approach toward prospects. Most people surmise that when they are approached about most any unconventional “business opportunity” that it has something to do with direct-selling or e-commerce. Most of them want to know the name of the company up front, and I feel that it is deceptive to give them our own business name. That only delays the answer to the inevitable question. Giving them the run-around only irritates them and decreases the IBO’s credibility. I think if people are so hung up about their misconceptions that they can’t take 45 minutes to get the facts, then it’s their loss.
Yippee! Now we are all really really one in branding 🙂 That makes a difference when we are doing international sponsoring 🙂Bass (instrument)
From The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia
Bass.
As seen in the musical instrument classification article, categorizing instruments can be difficult. For example, some instruments fall into more than one category. The cello is considered a tenor instrument in some orchestral settings, but in a string quartet it is the bass instrument.
A musician playing one of these instruments is often known as a bassist. Other more specific terms such as 'bass guitarist', 'double bassist', 'bass player', etc. may also be used.custom gold bracelets-silver star earrings At Joacii Jewelry, we offer our customers who are inclined to do business with us samples for testing and consideration, which will definitely remove their doubts about the quality and performance of custom gold bracelets-silver star earrings.

Theoretical Frameworks for Analysing Interiors
Hilde Heynen
Project Period:
Type:
Program Area(s): Material Conditions
Description
The process of ‘inhabitation’, the process of appropriating interior, domestic spaces by individuals is a complex phenomenon that has not been studied very extensively. The ethnographies and analyses that do exist are based upon several different theoretical frameworks. This article sets out to map the most important of these frameworks. We discuss phenomenology, critical theory and Actor-Network-Theory (ANT). Phenomenology is the container name for the approach to home and belonging that seems to be most widespread among architects and interior architects.
It is philosophically informed by writers such as Martin Heidegger and Gaston Bachelard, and holds that the home is a place deeply needed by all individuals in order to be able to really come into their own. Critical theory – encompassing as well the theories informed by the work of the Frankfurt School as later developments such as gender studies, queer theory or postcolonial theory – rather seeks to unravel the hidden meanings of the domestic interiors as tied up with the logics of capitalism, patriarchy and hetero-normativity. ANT, which is gaining ground in social sciences and architectural theory alike, studies objects and human networks as complex entanglements that can only be fully understood when taking their interrelations into account.Google visitors found our website yesterday by typing in these keywords :

Monday-Saturday 10am-6pm Sunday 12pm-6pmBy Anna Hanks
APRIL 5, 1999:
Ah, it's spring! Nevermind that freaky Austin weather has had us swimming since January;
spring proper is marked by the arrival of a certain long-eared, short-tailed burrowing
mammal. March may come in like a lion and go out like a lamb, but in the meantime
it looks a lot like a bunny.
Apart from the myriad charms of our furry friend, even the word "bunny"
is lovely. Try it. Say "Bunny, bunny," aloud a few times. Roll it about
on your tongue. It even feels pastel -- with hints of celery and spun sugar.
And then there is the magical bunny himself. Call it bunny sexism, but most of
the bunnies hopping around in the land of commerce appear to be male -- except, of
course, for those in Hugh Hefner's hutch.
Playboy partying aside, the bunny is undoubtedly the centerpiece of the secular
Easter -- a holiday that is closer to a pagan rite of spring than to a floating highlight
of the church calendar. In all of my studious scouring of store shelves, I found
but one lonely hollow chocolate cross. Go where you want with that.
According to Easter legend, eggs on Easter eve are delivered by the Easter Bunny
-- an aurally endowed Santa who doesn't care if you've been good or not. Alarmingly,
the combination of bunny delivery and non-union egg-producing shop may lead someday
to a hen uprising. These ladies do all the work, after all, and, at least in this
country, the bunny gets all the credit. You heard it here first.
No doubt the popularity of hollow chocolate bunnies during the Easter season has
much to do with capitalism and the corporate maximization of profits. Yet the allure
of champing down on those tender milk-chocolate ears is not to be dismissed. That
satisfying crunch almost makes Lent worth the effort. An informal survey of a few
Sunday night shoppers at the local HEB reveals two important facts: About half the
people polled prefer their bunnies hollow, and, to a one, when indulging in said
bunny, they prefer to start with the ears. One wag added, "If you see someone
bite off the face first, you know they've got issues."
Friends have speculated that this overwhelming preference toward "starting
with the ears" has something to do with the ears being the most distinguishable
feature of the bunny -- the part that sets him apart from all the other animals.
Others have speculated that it is because that is the part of the bunny that most
easily fits into the mouth. Either way, the ears have it.
To heighten this exquisite ear experience, there is even a "Bunny Big Ears"
made by Palmer. With the saying "Truly ear-resistible!" on the box,
this bunny has ears longer than his bunny torso. According to the Bunny Big Ears
that I bought -- strictly for research purposes mind you -- the length of the total
bunny measures one (lucky!) foot. The torso measures 43*4", and the
ears measure a good 7" -- although they appear to be even longer in the vertical
box. And according to Cecil Adams in More of the Straight Dope,the average
human male member is about 6.3". It looks like the nice folks at Palmer took
the idea that rabbits represent fecundity and regeneration and ran with it.
illustration by Jason Stout
Actually Bunny Big Ears isn't alone in his nakedness. Most of the other bunnies
appear to be wearing only a ribbon around their necks, a look that only emphasizes
their lack of clothing. Oh, sometimes they are hiding coyly behind an Easter egg
or willow basket, but naked they are, just the same. How else would there be more
and more chocolate bunnies on store shelves every year? Of the bunnies that are dressed,
they seem to prefer dressing either in overalls or as faux 19th-century French peasants.
This Easter comes during the Chinese Year of the Rabbit -- a cultural fact brought
home by the recent postal increase and brand new 33¢ Year of the Rabbit commemorative
stamps (I've licked more bunny butts this year than I ever thought possible). One
of the more troubling aspects of this conjunction comes because of what the rabbit
symbolizes -- fertility.
Even more troubling is the fact that this year Easter Sunday is only days away
from what the British press is calling "Boink Night." This April, millions
will attempt to conceive the first child to be born in the new millennium. Doubtless,
these Boink Night babies will suffer overcrowded kindergartens and lots of competition
selling Girl Scout cookies. Worse yet, they will suffer one of the worst fates of
modern childhood -- having to fight for Easter eggs at an Easter egg hunt.
Of course the concept "bunny" is not limited to the Easter season; it
is with us throughout the rest of the year. We have Roger Rabbit and Bugs Bunny.
We have the bunny slope for novice skiers, the bunny hop for the retro dance faction,
and rabbit ears on our TVs. Bunny won the Oscar for best animated short film
this year. "Going down the rabbit hole" is Lewis Carroll shorthand for
going to a mysterious, unknown place, and no one in a waistcoat can check the time
without visually alluding to the white rabbit. In some parts of the country, you
can buy Blue Bunny ice cream. The name of the gift shop next to my favorite truck
stop in La Grange is "Hunny Bunny's." And a pretentious graduate student
might offer you a Welsh rarebit instead of a cheese sandwich.
The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter is a classic -- same with Peter
Cottontail, Pat the Bunny, The Velveteen Rabbit, and The Country
Bunny & the Little Gold Shoes. The tale of Br'er Rabbit was popular in the
earlier part of the century. These are but a few of the rabbit-themed formative children's
tales available.
Of course, the bunny doesn't have the same symbolism in all cultures. A French
friend tells me that in France it is difficult to decide what is the most popular
Easter chocolate -- the bunny, the chick, or the egg. Fish are popular as well, a
trend to which even the more affected haven't cottoned around here. These treats
are often filled with "friture," or small eggs or animals (usually
shrimp, shells, fish, etc.) also made of chocolate.
Of course, people in other cultures eat actual rabbits far more often than
do most Americans. Mention the noble lapin in a French restaurant and you're
likely to wind up with a stewed one on your plate. A Francophone African scholar
at Stanford University tells me that in French-speaking parts of Africa, rabbits
are so commonly eaten, that they are used to explain other tastes. When he was in
the Ivory Coast, a former French possession in West Africa, he was served agouti,
or bush rat. His hostess told him that "it tastes just like rabbit."
But as lovely as bunnies are as a symbol, their magic tends to dissipate when
introduced into a domestic setting. Buying a rabbit at Easter is a lot like making
a new friend after last call: They both look a lot cuter before you get them home.
Except for the dedicated hardcore bunny fancier, rabbits are not pets. Buy a rabbit
for a small child, and you deserve the bunny shit you'll have on the sofa for the
next decade. Like almost all potent magical symbols, bunnies are best not in reality
but in image -- very best of all being a hollow, high-dollar rabbit sitting in my
very own Easter basket (sigh) from a chic chocolate shop.
Strangely, the local chocolate purveyor The Three Chocolatiers sells what owner
Glenn Scott refers to as "The Monster Bunny" -- 21 pounds of solid chocolate
which retails for $110. This monster rabbit is made from the same mold used at the
White House. I don't know about you, but given everything that the rabbit symbolizes,
I hope that our wayward president doesn't start with those monster bunny ears. Lord
help us all if he does. The thought of Kenneth Starr handing the Easter Bunny a subpoena
makes my teeth ache.

Lynsey White Dasher, director of Humane Wildlife Conflict Resolution, with the Humane Society of the United States, discussed ways to resolve human/geese conflicts with humane and effective approaches. She addressed a joint meeting of the West Milford Lakes Committee and Sustainable West Milford on March 21. The gathering in the municipal building meeting room was attended by the general public as well.
The speaker said a multi-pronged approach with a community effort is the best way to resolve wildlife conflicts.
Dasher explained that there are two types of Canada geese. One type is migratory, staying in the local area in the fall and winter before leaving to nest in the arctic. The other kind are resident geese who live in the area year round and do not migrate, she said.
The difference is in behavior, not biology, said the speaker. By 1900 the geese population was decimated. By the 20th century wildlife managers bred the birds and relocated them but the giant sized geese are not strong migrants, she continued, explaining that captive-reared geese aren’t taught to migrate.
With late winter-early spring mating season, the breeding geese return to prior nest sites with new breeders looking for locations near home, Dasher said. The end of March through May 1 is the nesting season, continued the speaker. She said both parents defend the nest and goslings.
Continuing with the information, Dasher said the average clutch has five to six eggs. All are laid before the goose starts to incubate from the last of April through the summer. The goslings don’t fly until they are 10 weeks old and the parents do not leave them, she said. The geese molt each summer and cannot fly or readily leave an area, the speaker reported.
Dasher said the local geese move around and may be found with the migrating geese. She said expansive lawns, parks, golf courses and open water provide perfect habitat for the geese where they have a free buffet. She said they love fertilized lawns.
Three components were offered by Dasher as a successful strategy for getting rid of the geese. They were listed by the speaker as curtaining reproduction, aversive conditioning and habitat modification with people not feeding them. Addling (any process by which keeps the eggs from developing); oiling the eggs; removing them from the nest and replacing them with dummy eggs and nest destruction were discussed during the video presentation.
After nesting is finished, ways to rid an area of geese include use of trained dogs to harass the geese without harming or touching them in any way, laser, chemical repellent, pyrotechnics and exclusion, Dasher explained.Peshawar University, which is one of the oldest universities in the country, has offered a fellowship program on peaceful co-existence.
The History Department of the University of Peshawar is offering this fellowship.
The applicants must mention their experience in promoting peaceful co-existence in the applications and how applicants will contribute in promoting peaceful co-existence in the future.
Limited residential facility is available in the University of Peshawar (separate for male and female) for the fellows.
Peshawar University is a public research university in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and one of the oldest universities in KP. It was founded in 1950 and offers programs for undergraduate, post-graduate, and doctoral studies with approximately 14,000 enrolled students having six academic faculties with 40 postgraduate departments as well as two “centers of excellence”.While researching our new biography of Frosty the Snowman, we discovered something that maybe should have been obvious: Dude was a total copy of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
Long before it was turned into a beloved animated character, “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” was a hit single for singing cowboy Gene Autry in 1949. The very next year, in 1950, Autry had a hit again with “Frosty the Snowman.”
It was no accident. Turns out that two songwriters, Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins, had a light bulb go off when they saw Autry’s “Rudolph” sell a whopping two million copies. They quite frankly set out to write another winter-season hit just like it. The two pitched “Frosty the Snowman” to Autry (they had written the Easter tune “Here Comes Peter Cottontail” for him earlier that year) and Autry bit right away. He released the song at the end of 1950 and it went on to sell over a million copies. Mission accomplished!
Autry wasn’t the only one, either. Nat King Cole and comedian Jimmy Durante recorded their own versions the same year.
Everyone was quicker to jump on the gravy train this time around, and right away Little Golden Books released a Frosty the Snow Man book (with a rather disturbing Frosty).
In the 1960s, Frosty copycatted Rudolph again: Rankin/Bass, the nutty animation outfit that had a huge hit with its Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer TV special in 1964, followed up with a Frosty the Snowman TV special in 1969. (They also turned the snowman’s generic winter tale into a Christmas story, but that’s no fault of Frosty.)
To complete the trifecta, Rankin/Bass made an “almost psychedelic” stop-motion version of Peter Cottontail in 1971 with the voices of Casey Kasem and Vincent Price (!). The original 1950 song was straightforward enough:
Here comes Peter Cottontail
Hoppin’ down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppin’, Easter’s on its way
Bringin’ every girl and boy
Baskets full of Easter joy
Things to make your Easter bright and gay
As always, Rankin/Bass writer Romeo Muller took a simple holiday story and added his signature bizarro touches. To wit:
Colonel Wellington B. Bunny, the retiring Chief Easter Bunny, names Peter his successor despite his boasting and lying. Peter, who has dreamed of being the Chief Easter Bunny almost his entire life, gladly accepts. January Q. Irontail, an evil, reclusive rabbit villain wants to be Chief Easter Bunny himself so he can ruin it for children after a child roller-skated over his tail and had to wear a hard iron tail.
…Peter, ashamed that his bragging and irresponsibility led to [an egg delivery failure], leaves April Valley until he meets Seymour S. Sassafras, an eccentric peddler and inventor, who supplies April Valley with the colors to paint the eggs from his Garden of Surprises, from red, white, and blue cabbages and purple corn to striped tomatoes and orange stringbeans. Sassafras then lets Peter use his Yestermorrowbile, a time machine, piloted by a French caterpillar named Antoine to take Peter back to Easter, deliver his eggs, win the contest, and defeat Irontail.
Psychedelic indeed. Well, no matter: the Frosty, Rudolph and Cottontail specials remain strangely popular today.
So do the songs. In 2014, they landed at #8 (Rudolph) and #14 (Frosty) on ASCAP’s top 30 holiday songs of the century. As of this week, Jimmy Durante’s version of “Frosty the Snowman” is at #51 on the Billboard Holiday Hot 100. But the snowman is still behind the reindeer: Gene Autry’s version of “Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer” is at #9 on the list, and Burl Ives’s version is at #48.
Lyricist Jack Rollins is actually a fascinating hard-bitten West Virginia story all by himself. He took jobs in a glass factory and as a baggage handler at Penn Station while writing songs on the side. He didn’t work at songwriting full-time until he turned 40, in 1946. A few years later he hit it big with “Peter Cottontail” and “Frosty.”
Those songs put Rollins in the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame, and have surely turned his heirs into jolly, happy souls. It’s not clear what his estate earns for licensing rights, but “I’ll Be Home For Christmas” (first recorded in 1943) still pulls in around $300,000 a year. Paul McCartney‘s much worse tune, “Wonderful Christmastime,” reportedly clears up to $600,000 a year. And music numbers don’t count revenue from the Frosty TV shows, books, etc.
Copycat or not, that ain’t lumps of coal.
See our full history of Frosty the Snowman »"Little Fockers" stole the holiday weekend box office number 1 spot for the New Year's weekend narrow lead, followed closely by “True Grit” which earned $24.5 million.
Since it was released, “Little Fockers” has earned the franchise an additional $103.2 million. Exactly 6 years ago “Meet the Fockers” was released and it earned $163 million in the same time period.
Movie sales fell overall for the eighth weekend in a row compared to last year. Sales were down 28% over last year. It was not just a sluggish Holiday season, it was also a sluggish fall.
This gets Hollywood off to a slow start in 2011. Although Paul Dergarabedian, a Hollywood box office analyst, said that they expect a good year ahead. The final “Harry Potter” movie will come out this year, another “Pirates of the Caribbean,” X-Men,” and the next “Hangover” to name a few.
Other movies that did well this weekend were “Tron: Legacy” with Jeff Bridges coming in number 3, “Yogi Bear” with Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake coming in number 4 and “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” coming in at number 5.David Adams
Distracted Driving 2014
Each day in the United States, more than 9 people are killed and more than 1,153 people are injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver. At any given daylight moment across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or manipulating electronic devices while driving, a number that has held steady since 2010. Drivers in their 20s make up 27% of the distracted drivers in fatal crashes.
Juries are becoming more attuned to the threat these distracted drivers pose to the public, and are recognizing the costs they are imposing on others, both to their health and general life enjoyment.Victor emblem league of legends Rule34

.The Problem, Our Solution and Our Approach
Listen to our library of presentations for an in-depth discussion on these issues.
The Problem: Our Lifestyle is killing us and making us broke
- Health status and lifespan in the United States are among the lowest of all the developed nations of the world, despite spending twice as much per capita than almost every other nation.
- Colorado spends 29% of its state budget on healthcare; employer costs continue to increase two to three times faster than inflation; and healthcare is virtually unaffordable for people without employer coverage. The Congressional Budget Office projects that federal spending on medical care will consume 100% of all federal tax revenue before the end of the century.
- Chronic diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, respiratory diseases account for about 75% of all costs, and as much as 90% of state and federal medical costs.
- Lifestyle behaviors, primarily tobacco use, physical inactivity and poor nutrition, are the primary cause of approximately 80% of all chronic disease.
Listen to our short (6 minute) discussion of The Problem on our Resources page.
Our Proposed Solution: Harness the power of Lifestyle as medicine
- Thousands of studies have demonstrated that comprehensive evidence-based lifestyle medicine programs can and have reversed heart disease and diabetes and prevented cancer in clinical, workplace and community settings as well as reduced medical costs with savings as great as $3 for every $1 invested among the best programs.
- Unfortunately, successful efforts are the exception; most efforts have little impact on health or cost because they are too superficial and do not use best practice strategies. Equally important, most people (estimated at 96%) do not have access to comprehensive efforts because of where they live, work, or go to school. The biggest limitation of reaching the full population is the lack of financial, social and intellectual capital, and policy authority necessary to have an impact. The resources available from foundations and health departments, the most common current funders, are insufficient.
- We anticipate minimal if any new financial investments will be required from state or local governments. In addition to improving health, quality of life and reducing medical costs, new annual economic growth may be as high as $1 billion in Colorado — creating more than 10,000 jobs, resulting in tens of millions in new state income tax revenue.
Listen to our short (9 minute) discussion of our Proposed Solution on our Resources page.
Our Approach: Scalable, fiscally sustainable ecosystems for healthy lifestyles
Our proposed approach has several distinct features:
- Moving beyond the intermittent “programs” that reach too few people, to creating ecosystems that engage all people where they live, work, learn, heal, pray or play, regardless of their economic status or geographic location.
- Providing a therapeutic dose of evidence-based approaches that change people’s knowledge, motivation, skills and behavior — and creating opportunities in their social, economic and physical environments to make it possible to practice healthy lifestyles.
- Aspiring to be fiscally sustainable, requiring no government funding but only seed funding from foundations, and repaying that seed funding over time.
- Reaching a scale large enough to help solve state and national level problems.
- Creating a mobilizing organization (MOG) that identifies and harnesses the financial, social, intellectual capital and the policy authority from individuals and organizations that have these resources and will better achieve their existing goals by applying them to this effort.
Listen to our short (16 minute) discussion of Our Approach on our Resources page.
Lifestyle as Medicine.
It works, but few people have access to appropriate programs, services and resources.
When was the last time you had the opportunity to be part of something truly groundbreaking and meaningful to the greater good? This is that opportunity and it’s an honor to play a role.”

The record derives from WCSP (in review) (data supplied on ) which reports it as a synonym with original publication details: J. Arnold Arbor. 1: 195 1920.
This name record (from WCSP (in review)) was not included in version 1 of The Plant List. It is possible the same name was included from a different data source, to check this you can search for Clematis paniculata in version 1 of The Plant List.The club sprang into life in 1926, meeting in café venues, more or less regularly, until the final pawn was pushed in 1939 on the eve of World War 2. Its membership fluctuated from an initial 15 or so, down to a low point when just a handful of dedicated souls kept the flame alive, and back up to around 30 towards the end. The club's most high-profile appearance was in 1931 in a cable match against the Manhattan Chess Club - alas they lost. In its glory days the club fielded teams in the Paris league, competing for the Coupe de Paris (of which more below). The BCCP was represented on the organising committee of the competition, as well as on the French National Chess Federation.
The BCCP's membership was a mélange of businessmen and diplomats posted in Paris, and resident Anglo-Francs. Les anglais visiting Paris for un bon moment were welcome. Some members can be spotted on the chess scene back in Blighty before or after the years of the BCCP, but others seem to be undocumented in all the usual places. In the previous series we compiled a partial list of members, sourced from occasional reports of the club's activities (see the Appendix below); and now, thanks to further research by Dominique Thimongier of Héritage des Echecs Français - to whom we once again express our gratitude - we can add more names, the first of which turned up in the French sporting daily L'Auto.
As we go along we can also tap into some of the chess incident at the Coupe, on and off the board.
In spite of the title, "L'Auto" embraced just about every sporting diversion imaginable - and some others besides, including chess. On most Fridays in the Spring of 1929 it had a chess column written by Anatole Ratnovsky.
He played for the Cercle Potemkine, hence the disappointment he expressed (L'Auto 29 March) at their performance in the Coupe de Paris that year. They finished 5th/6 in spite of having Tartakover and Znosko-Borovsky in their ranks. Indeed, the inclusion of such professionals of foreign extraction had provoked some controversy. Ratnovsky reported (L'Auto 27 Feb) that, in their match against Potemkine, Le Fou du Roi had left their board-one vacant as a protest, and when Tarta then switched to board-two Le Fou walked out as a man, even though the other games had started. Ratnovsky claimed that Potemkine (his own club, as mentioned) had done nothing outside the rules and, what is more, Le Fou had been rather poor sports - by comparison with Rive Gauche who, in their match with Palais-Royal, "courageously" took on such "maîtres aussi réputés" as Bernstein (Russian) and Baratz (Romanian). The latter, we should add, was several times Champion of Paris, and a sculptor, fashioning, among other things, the likeness of Alekhine for his grave in Paris (see the note about him on Héritage; by coincidence he also cropped up here).
For a bit of chess, here is an Alekhine coup de grâce against Baratz from a game in 1933: as a puzzle for your enjoyment.
Back at the Coupe de Paris in 1929 another maître, Halberstadt, turned out for Rive Gauche in March, only to be beaten by Tartakover in the game below (given in L'Auto 15 March, with Ratnovsky's notes).
I think that it is likely that our newcomer was T. M. Wechsler, who turned up in the local English press in the late 1920s playing for Bromley CC, in Kent CCA tournaments, and in the Kent County side - for example drawing with Vera Menchik (playing for Sussex) in September 1928 (for just one press reference see the Sevenoaks Chronicle 9 Nov 1928). He finished last in the Bromley Congress "Preliminary A" 11-18 April 1925. Mr Wechsler's Kent domicile makes a hop across the Channel a distinctly practical proposition, and he might easily have been a chess weekender in Paris, taking up the BCCP's invitation - published in the BCM - to drop-in for a game. If it was him, then perhaps he was accorded the honour of playing on board-one because he was a visitor - with form to boot (even if variable).
"If it was him": there is another Wechsler in the frame - a Romanian who won tournaments in Bucharest in 1927 and 1928 (it seems to say here), and 1930. But, even if this Wechsler was in Paris at the time, surely he would have followed his compatriot Baratz to Palais-Royal - he'd have been a stand-out sore thumb in the British CCP, if they had admitted him in the first place.
In his column of the 29 March 1929 Ratnovsky gave the final table for that year's Coupe de Paris:
The BCCP were within a hair's breadth of winning and, as Ratnovsky observed, they were "for everyone, the revelation of the tournament". As for individual players in the competition: he noted that the maîtres Bernstein and Tartakover participated, along with the majority of players from the Paris individual championship; and he counted among "other players of repute" the following from the BCCP: Fitzpatrick, Henderside (sic), Coleman, Champion and Brown, all of whom appear already in our list.
As we have relied so heavily on M. Ratnovsky's observations (and because he was so complimentary about the BCCP) it is only fair to give one of his games - the one he featured in his column of the 22 March, which he won.
However, there are yet more names to add to the list of the BCCP-ers. Dominique has unearthed the cross-table of the Club's internal championship of 1927 - maybe its first tournament. It comes from the Bulletin of the French national federation in October that year.
Hands, Blackmore, and Campbell are the new additions. They appear in the lower half of the tournament table which suggests they weren't that strong, and I haven't gone searching for references to them in the BCM etc...but they may yet turn up unbidden. The other names above were covered in earlier episodes, including the winner, H.K. Handasyde (here correctly spelled). He was almost Scottish champion in 1915, resident in Paris from around 1923, and died there in 1935.
You will have noticed in the details of the BCCP's second round win over Fou du Roi, given in Ratnovsky's 20th February column, that a Mr. Crowley won his game on board-two. That was, of course, Aleister "The Beast" Crowley, and he appeared further on in Ratnovsky's match report as an example of the "tenacity" displayed by the British team. They were worse on all boards, yet eventually won the match 4 v 1 - Crowley himself lost his Queen on the 10th move, but played on - and on - and won around move 80 after 7 hours of play...a touch of that old black magic?
Ratnovsky's list of "players of repute", which he gave later, in March, did not mention Crowley - in spite of his tenacious rearguard action mentioned above. Perhaps "The Beast" was by then already under a cloud and persona non grata among le Tout-Paris - he was expelled from France in April as a suspect spy, an ignominy (or badge of honour) discussed in our earlier episode 4. All this serves to remind us that Crowley and George "The Fly" Langelaan were conjointly the enfants terribles of the BCCP, for a year or two anyway. Langelaan himself was its founding-father - it was he who, in 1926, issued the invitation to like-minded British chessers to join.
After the war Langelaan confessed his admiration for what he regarded as Crowley's "great mind". George had by then reverted to his journalistic career and published an account of his own war-time action for SOE in occupied France ("Le Masque de L'Agent Secret" appeared in 1950), going on to write sci-fi horror yarns (including La Mouche). In 1966 he talked about his SOE adventures on French Radio. The broadcast was repeated on the 5th August this year (2017), and at the time of writing you can catch it on Radio France Culture (use allez à cette date; it's at 0.43 am). He was introduced - in French - as "eccentric and an original".
In the re-broadcast Langelaan speaks (with a suspicion of an English accent and an occasional touch of that fameux humour anglais) from the beyond the grave - which surely would have delighted the otherworldly Crowley (he himself had "died" in 1947), all the more so as George gives Crowley a nod in his talk. Sometime spy and now a story-teller by trade, Langelaan must have relished the opportunity to embroider the web of confabulations spun by his sometime crony. Thus he gets into its stride with a recycling of Crowley's claim that, while in the States in WW1, supposedly as a British double agent masquerading as a German agent, he had contributed to the successful mission to bring the US into the war. This was achieved, so Crowley said, by conspiring to lure the Germans into torpedoing the passenger liner Lusitania, with 130 Americans among the 1,200 civilian lives lost (including F.G.Naumann, the first President of the British Chess Federation).
Is it significant that Langelaan omits any mention the BCCP in his broadcast, as if to draw a veil over the Club and its goings-on? It was a haunt favoured by Crowley; so was it a cover for other nefarious activities? Who knows, and we look forward with eager anticipation to anything further that Dominique might unearth in the French archives....

CABLE CHESS MATCH:
TO NEW YORK CLUB
Manhattan Team Triumphs'
Over British Club of Paris
in Thirty-two Moves.
TEST LASTS SEVEN HOURS;
Pinkus, Samuels, Schroeder, Willman
and Meyer Compose Victorious Side.
In a chess match by cable which
lasted seven hours, New York gained
the verdict over Paris yesterday
when a team of five representing the
Manhattan Chess Club of this city
defeated the quintet of the British
Chess Club of Paris in thirty-two
moves.
The New York players, limited to
amateurs, but including men of na-
tional reputation, were stationed in
the operating room of the Commer-
cial Cable Company at 20 Broad
Street, from which moves were
rapidly interchanged by code with
the company's headquarters in Paris.
The victorious team was composed
of Albert S. Pinkus, the captain;
Lester Samuels, Alfred Schroeder,
Robert Willman and Leonard B.
Meyer. Opposed to them were G.
Champion, the captain; T. J. Collins
N. Baliol Scott, R. W. Holmes and.
C. C. Curtis. To decide first move
a coin was tossed by Joshua Crane of
Boston, who acted as umpire in
Paris. He lost the toss and the Man-
hattans were given the black pieces,
The British Chess Club team selected
a queen's gambit, which was first
declined but later accepted.
On their tenth turn the Anglo-
Parisians sacrificed a pawn to create
complications, but they failed to ob-
tain full compensation in position,
The Manhattans did not castle until
the twenty-first move, by which time
they had a distinct superiority in
pawns on the queen's side of the
board. Soon afterward two connected.
passed pawns were forced through
and the victory for New York was
clearly in sight.
The score follows:
QUEEN'S GAMBIT.
PARIS, NEW YK. PARIS. NEW YK
White. Black. White. Black.

So many of us have been raised to always think of others first, and ignore any thought about our own wants and needs, for that is the epitome of selfish.
TIME TO LET THAT GO!
There is enough room in this world for everyone to become extraordinary!
Your dreams are not my dreams
The only way to open your future up to new possibilities and growth is to change your subconscious mind. The only way to change your subconscious mind is through repetition and Hypnosis.
Consciously you are only able to juggle about 5 thoughts at a time and that’s multi-tasking. Your subconscious can handle approximately 5 million connections at a time. Your subconscious is running trillions of cells in your body and automatically creating actions and reactions before you can consciously think about them. Becoming aware of your subconscious and how it operates, then molding it to move the direction you want, gives you unlimited discipline in creating your future.
In order to generate the future you are hoping for, you must clear the way by gaining mastery over your subconscious limitations. Until you free yourself from the ties that bind you from moving forward, any effort you make will feel as if you are spinning your wheels.
Freeing yourself from shadows, grief, shame, guilt opens up the much bigger picture. By removing these limitations you are free to make a life greater than you could have ever imagined while buried under all those emotional blocks. Clearing the path to the right relationship or the perfect job helps you to understand that there are as many possibilities in your future as grains of sand on the shore.
Through Hypnosis you can raise your self esteem to allow you to visualize the destiny you are ready to step into. The timeline of your future opens up and you can consciously direct your superconscious energy toward your goals. When you connect your conscious and subconscious minds you enable the superconscious to tap directly into the intuition of your higher self. Through the connection of all three levels of your consciousness your potential becomes unstoppable. This is what it really feels like to be in alignment.
The bottom line is this. your subconscious mind is your autopilot and the holder of your self esteem. You can consciously change the direction in the autopilot to a higher route. However, the subconscious will revert back to the old direction anytime it’s given a chance. So living your life consciously, making the conscious decisions for change, will eventually change the autopilot permanently.
Changing the trajectory of your autopilot course only happens through repetition, repetition, repetition. Or Hypnotherapy.
By developing a firm foundation of self love and high self.How To Reset Printer Brother DCP J-140W

What you may have missed in the small print of the newspapers is that, from 1 September 2021, registration is now compulsory for many trusts that were previously not required to be registered on HMRC’s online Trust Registration Service (TRS).
Taxable trusts have been required to be registered for a number of years but this has now been extended to cover trusts where no tax is payable.
That doesn’t affect any of us though does it. Or does it?
The requirement to register covers a wider range of circumstances than one might expect and is not limited to ‘traditional’ trusts.
Consider these scenarios:
If the answer to any of these questions is yes, or if you know that you are appointed as a trustee under a trust deed or Will, you may need to register with the TRS.
For non-taxable trusts, a one-off registration is all that is required (unless there are changes to the trustees or beneficiaries’ details). Failure to register may result in fixed penalty fines from HMRC. HMRC have indicated that they will send out reminder letters to trustees when they become aware of a failure to register. If you should receive such a letter it is important to seek advice, and put the registration in place if applicable, so as to avoid a penalty.
Deadlines for Registration:
What should I do if I am not sure whether this applies to me?
There is information on the HMRC and government pages online which you may find helpful. If you are at all unsure whether or not you need to register, the Trusts team at Churchers would be happy to help on an affordable, fixed-fee basis. The team can be contacted on 02392 820 747.

Often, many of these mistakes cannot be detected by the human eye and can lead to a less-than-satisfactory result. You may not realize the severity of making embarrassing violations in your videos initially, but you will feel guilty of these errors later.
Thankfully, online video editors are there to correct many of these errors. So, don’t let video mistakes embarrass you; instead, use Intelligent Video Assistant to make amazing videos.
To save you time and energy, here is a list of 6 common video errors and an idea of fixing them out:
- Inconsistent Audio
One of the most common video errors is the poor audio mix. On your timeline, there are typically two kinds of audio components: voice and music. Both these audio components are integral parts of videos. Voice communicates content, and music sets the mood. But, there must be a good balance between both of these components. For instance, if your music mix is too loud, it will overpower the voice, and your audience will miss the message. Newbie moviemakers often either let music overpower the narration or vice versa.
How to fix:
Most of today’s intelligent video assistants feature an automatic audio control technique. All you need to do is to pay special attention to the sound and adjust the audio until both the audio components harmoniously blend and sound pleasing to the ears.
Pro Tip:
Often, you may not realize there is an issue with the audio until you reach the post-production stage. A pro tip here to figure out the audio issue during the editing stage only is to close your eyes and just listen to the video. If it does not sound pleasing, use the audio control feature to adjust the sound no matter how amazing your footage is!
- Incomplete Transitions
Incomplete transitions are another personal pet peeve. They occur when a transition effect extends longer than a video clip. Often, newbie movie makers place the transition between two clips, and the duration of one of the clips is shorter. The previous clip ends abruptly and shows a black screen to the viewer before the next clip comes.
How to fix:
The simple solution to this video error is to adjust your transition time or extend the length of the previous video clip. Intelligent video assistants make it easy to trim your video, set the proper length of it, and then drag and drop a transition effect on them. If you still see a black screen anywhere in the video, you should extend the length of the previous clip.
Pro Tip:
Here, the pro tip is to make sure that the previous clips extend longer to adjust transition time.
- Inefficient Graphics
Next comes the graphic related editing error. Here, you need to make sure whatever fonts, colours, texts, shadows, etc. you use in the video are consistent throughout the video. Using hard-to-read colours, multiple fonts in a single graphic leads to unreadable text, and typo errors; these are a few of the most common video violations that you can easily correct by just rechecking your video.
How to fix:
Take a look at video editing tutorials on how to add graphics in VideoCreek to keep the graphics cool, crisp, legible, and pleasing-to-eyes. Refine your graphics and make sure that they are clear and comprehensible.
Pro Tip:
Here, professionals advise choosing a font that sticks throughout the video. Pick a colour palette that coordinates with the font size and style. Change your creativity wherever it does not balance with the colour and text. Remember that less is more.
- Improper Pacing
Music drives the pace of production. Have you ever watched a video with fast-paced footage but a slow music track, or vice versa? If yes, you can better understand how tormenting it is to view a video with improper pacing. There is nothing worse than matching hyper-fast edits with plodding music or the opposite. Slow-paced music sounds best with longer shots and likewise fast-paced music with quick shots. And, when we fail to do so, the pace does not play properly.
How to fix:
An intelligent video assistant has plenty of free music templates that provide a way to set the mood of your scene. All you need to do is to browse the inventory and find the right track for your video. Select a soundtrack and edit your visuals to set the right pace for the production.
Pro Tip:
To produce an awesome video, first, focus on your edit and then look for the music that may harmonize the edit. Set a soothing rhythm in your mind and find out the places where a shot cuts short or goes too long. Let intelligent video assistants adjust the shot lengths that create a good pace throughout and work with your story.
- Irregular frames
Think you have crafted a wonderful video, you put your camera away and recline to view your video for the first time, and then you figure out you have left too much space in the positioning of elements in the frame. The disruptive flash frames are not often perceptible, but they do form uneasiness and make your viewers feel that something is not right.
How to fix:
The solution is to pay special attention to irregular frames and fine-tune the positioning of elements in the frame. If you don’t have sly eyes to catch wayward frames, it is wise to zoom in each of the frames on your timeline and review them to make sure they are perfect. Also, intelligent video assistants like VideoCreek make it easy to maintain the frame’s equilibrium.
Pro Tip:
If you film your video at full 1920×1080 HD, edit it in a 1280×720 timeline. This strategy will give you enough room to tactic your shot and help you maintain the aspect ratio.
- Inadequate duration
Inadequate duration is a major distraction to viewers. It is an unavoidable video violation. So, there is no room for grace on this blunder. This mistake occurs when a video clip drops quickly without giving enough time to read it out.
How to fix:
Don’t stress much about the duration of your video clips. Just use efficient video editing software and be rest assured that the text in a frame will get adequate time to read. The video editor features an intelligent video assistant (IVA) that adjusts the frame duration as per the demand of the clips.
Pro Tip:
When working on duration, think about which clip you want to highlight more. Allow intelligent video assistants to draw attention to specific areas of your video, which you want to emphasize more.
Edit well!
The key to craft a successful video is to purge the predictable problems. Now that you know the possible video errors, add them to your review list and make sure to eliminate them from your edits. Remember, if hard work is the teacher, smart work is the saviour. So, focus more on using smart video assistants like VideoCreek to produce perfect videos. With such smart video editing software (IVA), anyone can become a video maker overnight.Gameline Taping Machine

Cargill, Continental Grain Company, and Sanderson Farms, Inc. announced they have reached a definitive agreement for a joint venture between Cargill and Continental Grain to acquire Sanderson Farms for $203 per share in cash, representing a total equity value for Sanderson Farms of $4.53 billion.
The purchase price represents a 30.3% premium to Sanderson Farms’ unaffected share price of $155.74 on June 18, 2021, the last full trading day prior to media speculation about the potential sale of Sanderson Farms; a 22.8% premium to the Sanderson Farms 30-day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) as of June 18, 2021, and a 15.2% premium to the all-time high share price as of June 18, 2021. Upon completion of the transaction, Cargill and Continental Grain will combine Sanderson Farms with Wayne Farms, a subsidiary of Continental Grain, to form a new, privately held poultry business.
The combination of Sanderson Farms and Wayne Farms will create a best-in-class U.S. poultry company with a high-quality asset base, complementary operating cultures, and an industry-leading management team and workforce. The new company will be well positioned to enhance its service to customers across retail and food service and drive organic growth in an industry fueled by affordability and key consumer trends around the health, sustainability, and versatility of chicken.
“Since my grandfather founded Sanderson Farms 75 years ago, our many significant achievements have been driven by our commitment to providing the very best chicken products in a profitable manner that benefits each of the constituents who contribute to our success. This transaction is the culmination of that commitment, as it delivers a significant value to our stockholders, reflecting the dedication of our team, and our best-in-class assets, quality products, efficient and sustainable operations, and respected brand,” said Joe Sanderson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sanderson Farms, Inc. “We are proud to be joining with Cargill and Continental Grain and we are confident that they will be strong stewards of the Sanderson Farms team, brand and assets going forward. As part of the newly created company, Sanderson Farms and its new owners will remain committed to the employees, poultry producers, customers, communities, environment, and animals under our care, and to continuing to deliver the highest quality products and the best service in our industry to our customers.”
“We are very happy to partner with Cargill with whom we have had a decades-long relationship between two family-owned companies. Sanderson Farms’ operations, best-in-class assets and valuable brand have underscored their success, and we have the highest respect for Joe Sanderson, and the business and team he has built as the third generation CEO,” said Paul Fribourg, Chairman and CEO of Continental Grain. “Wayne Farms has been one of the most important and successful parts of Continental Grain for almost 60 years, so bringing together two great partners with two great poultry companies will ensure good things for our customers, our grower partners, and our employees.”
The new company will have state-of-the-art operations and will continue to invest in its workforce and in employee safety. Operations will include poultry processing plants and prepared foods plants across Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas.
“At Cargill, we are committed to nourishing the world in a safe, responsible and sustainable way,” said David MacLennan, Chairman and CEO of Cargill. “Expanding our poultry offerings to the U.S. is a key enabler of our ability to meet customer and consumer demands. With these great businesses, and our strong partnership, we believe we will deliver a superior portfolio of products and services to our customers.”
Cargill expects to support the new joint venture with its longstanding relationships with retail and foodservice customers. Wayne Farms, part of Continental Grain’s food, agriculture and commodities investment portfolio since 1965, has roots in the poultry industry that go back more than a century.Cloud Support

With Halloween fast approaching, the Dogs Trust has some tips on how to protect your dog when there are fireworks.
At Halloween, fireworks are something we all look forward to, but for our four legged friends, they can be incredibly frightening.
Dogs hearing is very sensitive, so they can find the noise of fireworks very distressing..
To keep your dog safe this Halloween, the Dogs Trust have put together some tips on how to keep your dog calm.
Before the Halloween fireworks kick off
The Dogs Trust have put together a list of recommendations to help keep your dogs safe during fireworks.
1. Dog proof your house and garden
If your dog is startled by the noise they may bolt, so make sure that your home and garden are secure incase your dog tries to escape.
2. Keep your dog's details updated
If your dog does bolt, it's essential to make sure your dog is wearing a collar and their microchip is up to date.
3. Walk your dog before dark
Walk your dog before it gets dark so they can go to the bathroom without being spooked.
4. Feed your dog before the fireworks
Your dog may not eat if unsettled by fireworks, it's important to feed them beforehand.
5. Make them a den
Dogs can find comfort in a hiding place, provide them a safe space where they can hide, such as under the table or behind the sofa.

How to help keep your dog calm during fireworks
There are a few ways that you can help keep your dog stay calm during fireworks, below we share a few of the Dog's Trust top tips.
1. Comfort your Dog
If your dog needs comforting, provide this and reassure them that there is nothing to be scared of by acting calm.
2. Don't leave your dog alone
If you leave your dog alone and they panic, they could injure themselves, it's best to always stay with your pet when there are fireworks outside.
3. Keep your dog busy
Try to keep your dog distracted by playing games and showing them attention, if they want to hide it's important to let them.
4. Prevent your dog from escaping
Your dog may bolt if startled, ensure that there is no way your dog to escape if panicked.
What can you do if your dog has a fear of fireworks?
Using some of the techniques mentioned above can help, but if you notice that your dog has a fear of fireworks and loud noises that is causing them distress, it's best to get in touch with your vet to see what options they can offer.Stateline Baptist Church Music Team Performance
On Oct 1, 2010, the music team WOW and some brothers and sisters from Stateline Baptist Church (East Columbus, MS) came to Starkville, and had a wonderful worship night with us. The music team had a performance on the songs, including Forever, Freedom Reigns, How Great is Our God, I'll Fly Away, More than Enough, What a Great God, Your Love Is For Me. After that, Pastor Robert gave an encouraging message: The Gateway of Hope (Hebrew 11:1). In the end, all choir members of both Stateline and SCCC together sang the song: Amazing Grace. We also had some refreshment and good fellowship time after the program.HomeMain content starts here, tab to start navigating

Some individuals shy away from DIY, however, it is great fun and is a way to boost your practical skills. If you don’t feel very confident about tackling a task, there are many tutorial videos on the internet you can view to learn different techniques. You’ll improve as you go along and if things don’t work out the way you hoped the first time, you can always try again. These simple projects are a great way to get started.
Put up some shelves
One of the easiest ways to get to grips with DIY is to start with shelves. You could build a whole bookcase or simply fit odd shelves into little gaps around your walls wherever they would come in useful. Putting shelves above radiators is a good trick, especially if you paint the underside silver, as this will reflect heat downwards and keep your rooms warmer.
Shelves look straightforward but there are things you’ll need to bear in mind. Firstly, choose material strong enough to bear the weight of what you want to keep on it. Secondly, fit proper supporting brackets using plastic plugs and screws – not nails. Bookcases should be fixed to the wall to prevent them falling forwards. When cutting lengths of wood for shelves, make them slightly longer than you need so you can sand down the ends to make them smooth. Ready made shelves can also be purchased and are easy to fit using the supplied fixings.
Fit window shutters
Shutters are a great way to insulate your home and make it more secure. You can buy café shutters or tiered shutters to fit yourself, and they’re easy to paint so that you can get exactly the look you want You’ll probably need a stepladder and another person to hold the shutter whilst you attach it.
Fitting shutters in older homes can sometimes be problematic due to deterioration of the wood in the window frame. If you think this might apply to you, check before you begin the project. You may need to repair part of the frame before you begin work. In most homes, however, the process is very straightforward.
Liven up your staircase
Staircases tend to be a neglected part of the home. If yours are made of plain wood, why not give them a boost by staining, varnishing or painting? There are many ways you can make this look good, using colours that complement your general décor or by using a different colour on each step to create a rainbow effect.
Some people are very creative with their stairs, painting them to look like stacked books or even putting mirrors on them (though this should only be done with plastic ones because they will sometimes be accidentally kicked). If you have kids, this can be a great DIY project for them to engage with.
Build a bottle wall
Glass walls can be a great way to divide spaces because they look beautiful and let the light through, but glass bricks can cost quite a bit. Building a wall from glass bottles is a great way to do this on a budget. You can use any type or colour of bottles – a mixture can look great – as long as they’re roughly the same size. Bamboo canes, easy to find in garden centres, can form your central poles.
To build your wall, fit the canes vertically – you can fit them with a wooden base and top piece if you don’t want to drill into the floor – then drill the bases of the bottles (it’s best to wrap them in cloth to do this safely – wear eye protection) and slide them onto the poles so that they overlap. The result can look stunning.
Try some tile painting
Why do tiled bathrooms and kitchens always have to be bland? They often are, but you can brighten them up. Use an alkyd or oil based paint to create your own beautiful tile designs and fit those tiles onto your walls. You don’t need to paint every tile on your wall to make an impression. Creating a tile fringe generally looks more impressive, and individual tiles that fit a theme such as flowers or sea creatures can look good if arranged semi-randomly. This is another great project for kids to join in with.
By using these simple techniques, and equipping your living spaces with attractive accessories, you can add real character to your home. You’ll enjoy doing the work and later you can sit back and feel very proud of the result.Until the summer, higher education will probably continue in its present form. While this may not be ideal, it turns out that much can be achieved in terms of organising lectures and tutorials remotely. Teaching staff are making the best of a tough situation.
But the new academic year is a different story, says Marc van Mil, lecturer at Utrecht University and board member of the Comenius Network. “We definitely need to do more than simply putting lectures online and organising Zoom tutorials.”
Quality in education
The 225 members of the network (in Dutch, ed.) share a profound commitment to quality in education. In recent years they have been nominated for the national Teacher of the Year Award or have earned a Comenius grant for educational innovation. And even in these trying times, they are determined to provide students with a sound education.
Van Mil believes that special attention needs to be paid to the students due to start their studies in the coming academic year. “There are a lot of difficulties to overcome to provide them with a high standard of education. How do you give them a sense of connection to their programme, to each other and to their teachers? How do you ensure meaningful interaction? These things are not easy to achieve through a screen.”
Minister of Education Ingrid van Engelshoven understands this too, judging by the concerns she expressed at Monday’s digital meeting organised by the Comenius Network in conjunction with her ministry, the Dutch National Students’ Association (ISO), and SURF’s experts on IT in education. The minister was keen to highlight ways of bringing students together in groups of thirty. In her view this is especially important for first-year students.
Even so, quality in education is about more than seeing each other every now and then. An inspiring educational mix needs to be created in which online and on-site education reinforce each other: blended learning. That’s the big question: how can we deliver an outstanding mix of online teaching and teaching on campus?
Helping hands
“This challenge will demand a great deal of lecturers and we feel strongly that students have a right to expect that investment”, says Van Mil. Teaching staff must be given the time and space to dedicate themselves to education: a tough choice to make when it so often comes at the expense of their research and other responsibilities. This calls for “helping hands”, for a wider involvement in education. “For example, universities could extend the contracts of postdocs and PhD students who want to do extra teaching. Universities of applied sciences will also have to take on more teaching staff, on a temporary basis if necessary.”
Nor should lecturers be penalised for choosing to focus on educational development. As Van Mil points out, “The worst thing a highly motivated teacher can hear is that it can’t be done, or that it’s bad for your career.”
The Dutch Research Council should also take this into account when planning its funding. After all, they set the deadlines that govern when academics have to apply for grants: these should really be extended for lecturers who are giving their full attention to teaching.
In any case, the crisis should boost the universities’ resolve to give greater recognition and appreciation to their educational activities. To date, universities have been inclined to measure staff achievement in terms of research grants and articles published. All too often this led them to compromise on education, and this is something the Comenius Network wants to change. “Hopefully that process will now gain momentum,” Van Mil adds.
Quick fixes
He observes that students have been quick to appreciate the universities’ rapid transition in times of crisis. “But they also see that the teaching they are currently getting is sometimes a little lacking in substance. It’s good that they are critical. If we continue to operate like this for the foreseeable future, we need to look beyond quick fixes. It will be about embracing a new approach to educational design.”
That will take time and money, he warns. “You can’t just ask lecturers to take all that on in the evenings and weekends. They are already up to their ears in work.”cam girls

Why aren't abortion clinics being held to the same standards as other facilities that offer outpatient surgical procedures? Is the so-called "right to abortion" such an untouchable issue that we are willing to sacrifice women's health and safety in order to appear "politically correct"? Planned Parenthood is making millions on abortions....and receiving taxpayer funding to boot. It isn't a mystery as to why they are screaming and hollaring about these proposed regulations. Keep the regulations.MISSION
The Mission of Attack Aviation Foundation is to bring awareness to the United States Military Fighter Pilot that he is 3x more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. We additionally call on the United States Military to change their policy, making the PSA blood test mandatory starting at age 40 during routine physicals. Early detection saves lives at all stages of this survivable disease.
ATTACK!
OUR STORY
Military regulations do not mandate this simple blood test until the age of 50 for those without a family history of the disease and at the age of 40 for those who do have a family history.
Our Founder, James “Chef” Barlow, a USAF retired A-10 pilot does not have a family history of prostate cancer, and was unaware that a simple PSA blood test could have caught the Stage IV prostate cancer he was eventually diagnosed with at age 44. After courageously battling the disease for 2 years, he’s grateful to announce that he is in remission. His mission with Attack Aviation Foundation is to prompt other young pilots to opt in for a simple blood test & catch prostate cancer early.
Instead,. During allergy skin tests, your skin is exposed to suspected allergy-causing substances and is then observed for signs of an allergic reaction.
However, it is important to keep in mind that many other health conditions can cause an increase in white blood cells. Allergy blood tests detect and measure the amount of allergen-specific antibodies in your blood. When you come into contact with an allergy trigger, known as an allergen, your body makes antibodies against it. As part of your initial assessment, your doctor might examine your nose, throat, skin, and lungs. If you are diagnosed with food allergies or airborne allergies, the next step is to run tests, if needed.
A food allergy is diagnosed on the basis of a clinical history of reactivity and symptoms after exposure to that particular food, plus a positive skin or blood test. A positive test in the absence anemia symptoms of symptoms does not necessarily mean you have a food allergy.
The Options For Speedy Secrets Of Health News
In addition to testing for food and environmental allergies , you can also be tested for stinging insect hypersensitivity if you have a history of an allergic reaction. The number of allergens included in a skin prick test depends on a patient’s age and symptoms, says Holbreich. Typically, it’s three to five allergens for babies 4 to 6 months old, up to 18 allergens for preschoolers, and up to 50 for teens and adults. Pregnant women are another population for whom allergy testing isn’t recommended, due to the small risk of having a severe allergic reaction during the testing process.
- One way to think of the difference is that a food intolerance is never life-threatening, while allergies certainly can be.
- There is robust scientific evidence to back up the use of blood testing, skin prick testing and patch testing for certain allergens.
- Skin prick tests- where suspected allergens are scratched on to the arm and a resulting bump or skin redness confirms an allergic response.
- The gut wall is actually pretty impermeable – there are a few medical conditions when it can become leaky, such as Crohn’s disease, but as a cause of other illnesses there is no proof.
- Many expect that food intolerances and food allergies are one in the same, or that the terms are interchangeable, but this isn’t the case.
Outlines For Effective Secrets For Healthy Habits
Many assume that they are allergic to pollen or mold when, in actuality, it may be a completely different substance causing the problem. It’s very possible that the things you’re trying to avoid aren’t the source of your problems.
An allergy happens when the immune system overreacts to a typically harmless substance, or allergen. As common as they are, allergies can be tricky to figure out, let alone manage, on your own. It’s not unusual for patients to come to us seeking treatment for pet dander allergies only to discover that “Fido” is not the problem!/>Photography by Chasis Photos

Why Do You Need Best Spark Plugs for 5.0 Coyote?
The importance of a spark plug in a vehicle cannot be overemphasized. Yet, some car users often see it as another cheap car accessory out there.
To begin with, your car simply can’t start without spark plugs since they generate the needed sparks that ignite your car engine.
No doubt, the engine oversees the chemical and mechanical conversions required for locomotion; however, the spark plug generates and transmits the electrical energy (sparks) that results in the ignition of the engine. Thus, experts argue that while the engine is the heart of the car, the spark plug is the heart of the engine. Because spark plugs play a more primary role!
Apart from triggering ignition, spark plugs also help in dissipating extra heat and keeping the engine cool. Besides, its role in mileage efficiency and the overall stability of the engine cannot be downplayed.
How Coyote Mustang Spark Plugs Work
The main idea of spark plugs is to ignite a compressed combination of air and fuel in each cylinder of an internal combustion engine powered by gasoline.
A typical spark plug has an insulated center electrode that extends through the length of the plug and a ground electrode at the extreme, usually separated from the exposed tip of the center electrode by a gap known as “spark gap”.
When the voltage delivered from the ignition coil to the spark plug is high enough, the electrical energy is bound to jump the gap, thereby creating a spark!
The most important part of a spark plug is arguably the electrodes which were traditionally made of copper-core; but nowadays, they are also made of special materials like iridium or high-nickel alloys.
Modern-day Coyote Mustang spark plugs are remarkably known to have smaller center electrodes to reduce the amount of voltage required to create a spark. This, of course, makes newer plugs more efficient when it comes to fast ignition.
Types of Coyote Mustang Spark Plugs
There are different types of Coyote Mustang spark plugs to fit your car’s specifications or the particular features you seek.
The 5 main types of spark plugs are copper/nickel, single platinum, double platinum, iridium, and silver spark plugs.
Let’s throw more light on each of them.
1. Copper/nickel Spark Plug
This type of spark plug is typically made of a copper center electrode coated with a nickel alloy. The diameter of the electrode is one of the largest compared to other types. Hence, it requires a higher voltage to generate a spark.
Besides, nickel alloy is not a very durable material and will need to be replaced more often. Fortunately, it’s a cheap alternative.
Some cars are typically designed to use copper/nickel plugs, irrespective of their shorter life span. That’s why you are not necessarily advised to install a more expensive or durable spark plug since it will be a waste of money if your car is not compatible with it. The best you can do is go through your manual for the ideal recommendation.
2. Single Platinum Spark Plugs
The single platinum spark plug is similar to copper/nickel, except that a platinum disc is welded to the tip of its center electrode instead of just nickel alloy.
This platinum disc offers more durability to the center electrode as it lasts longer before wearing away.
Single platinum plugs also generate more heat, which lowers carbon buildup. It’s highly recommended for newer car models with a coil-on-plug ignition mechanism.
3. Double Platinum Spark Plugs
The striking difference between a single and a double platinum spark plug is that the latter has a platinum coating both on the center and ground electrodes. This is unlike a single platinum plug that has a platinum coating for only the center electrode.
The double electrode coating brings about greater efficiency and longevity. And accordingly, such spark plugs are recommended for a wasted spark ignition system which causes more wear on both electrodes compared to other ignition systems.
4. Iridium Spark Plugs
Iridium spark plugs are the most durable option since iridium is said to be 6 times harder and 8 times stronger than the normal platinum metal.
This set of spark plugs come with small center electrodes that require significantly less voltage to generate sparks.
The only downside of iridium spark plugs is that they are relatively more expensive. Nonetheless, the advantages outweigh the cost. That’s why most car manufacturers would rather use Iridium spark plugs in their vehicles.
With that said, you are advised to stick to original equipment iridium spark plugs instead of downgrading to copper/nickel versions during replacements, as such downgrades could result in lower engine performance.
5. Silver Spark Plugs
Silver spark plugs are not common nowadays since most modern cars require either copper/nickel, platinum, or iridium spark plugs. Moreover, silver metal is not as durable as any of the options above.
Silver plugs are mostly compatible with older European cars and motorcycles which are rarely in stock today.
Things To Consider When Buying The Best Spark Plugs For 5.0 Coyote
One popular quote among car users is “A spark plug is a spark plug no matter the type”. However, that idea is completely WRONG. Because certain brands or specifications of spark plugs are indeed superior to others, depending on what the car requires.
Again, the market today is filled with lots of substandard spark plugs which are usually imitations of the original products.
Therefore, to select the best spark plugs for 5.0 Coyote, you have to pay attention to the following:
Material
This is probably the most important factor to consider if you want to get the best set of spark plugs for your 5.0 Coyote. The specific metal type a spark plug is made of goes a long way to determine its quality.
Coyote Mustang spark plugs are mostly made of 3 distinct materials: copper/nickel, platinum, and iridium.
Each of these materials is ideal for Mustang Coyote or Ecoboost engines, depending on your budget or the performance level you are satisfied with.
To find out the specific material of a particular product, you can either go through the manual or visit the manufacturer’s website.
Compatibility
Some spark plugs fit better in certain car brands than others. That’s why you should pay attention to how compatible a particular product is with your car.
For instance, if you own a Mustang Coyote or F150 Coyote, you should specifically go for V8 spark plugs that come 8 pieces per pack, since Coyotes are typically 8-cylinder engines. Also, pay attention to your car’s model/year to confirm if the spark plug is an ideal fit.
To be most certain, you should check your car manual for information regarding the most compatible spark plug.
Heat Dissipation And Heat Range
Spark plugs operationally produce sparking energy that can increase the internal temperature of an engine. Without any form of heat transfer, this internal engine temperature could increase until it causes serious damage. Hence, heat dissipation is one quality to look out for while buying a 5.0 Coyote spark plugs for Mustang.
Also, try to figure out the general heat range of the spark plug to determine how well it can perform under extreme temperatures (hot or cold).
And most importantly, find out the materials the plug is made of since some materials (silver, for instance) have better thermal conductivity than many others.
Authentic Dealer
This should actually be the first thing to consider when buying Coyote Mustang spark plugs, as long as you want the very best.
The United States, Germany, and other European brands are famous for producing and exporting high-quality spark plugs. However, Countries like China, for instance, notoriously imitate original brands and flood the market with substandard products.
Hence, you should consider if the spark plug dealer is trusted enough before making any purchase. Similarly, make sure the dealer imports/buys directly from reputable countries/firms that produce the best spark plugs for Coyote Mustang.
To guarantee the authenticity of the dealer, read the customer reviews on their products and services.
Final Opinion
If you’ve read this review to this point, you will agree that each of the products discussed above has a specific or a couple of features that qualify it as one of the best spark plugs for 5.0 Coyote. That’s why singling out the overall best will always be a hard nut to crack.
However, based on the standard buying guides we provided earlier on, the best spark plugs for Mustang Ecoboost or 5.0 Coyote should be made of a combination of quality materials to guarantee durability and high performance. It should require a low firing voltage for high inevitability, while also dissipating extra heat. Besides, it has to command a high melting point to withstand the damages of high temperatures. But most importantly, the best spark plugs for Coyote Mustang should come from authentic dealers who offer original equipment accessories. That’s why we recommend the Motorcraft SP-520 Spark Plug. Because even though the package comes at a relatively low price, it still features all the qualities above and can last up to 100,000 miles.
FAQs
1. How many spark plugs does a 5.0 F150 have?
5.0 F150 engines are generally 8-cylinder engines. Hence, they contain 8 spark plugs for each cylinder.
2. What happens if you don’t gap spark plugs correctly?
Improper gapping of spark plugs can result in a wide range of engine malfunction including misfiring, roughness, difficult startup, knocking, and so on.
3. What causes a spark plug to explode?
A spark plug explosion or blowout occurs when the plug is fastened too tightly or too loosely into the engine port. This prevents the plug from effectively transferring and channeling electrical charge to the engine block, causing the plug to break down.
4. Is 3.5 or 2.7 EcoBoost better?
Both spark plug models are reliable, depending on what you want. If you are interested in boosting power output or improving towing capacity, then 3.5L Ecoboost is the real deal. However, if you prefer to enhance fuel efficiency, then 2.7L Ecoboost won’t be a bad option.
5. What are the best spark plugs for a 3.5 EcoBoost?
The best spark plugs for Mustang Ecoboost must be made of durable materials and can maintain a wider heat range while ensuring top performance.
That’s why Motorcraft, HiVehicle, and NGK brands remain the best.
6. What brand of spark plugs does Ford use?
Ford engines are compatible with all the spark plugs recommended by the Ford Motor Company, which strictly include Motorcraft spark plugs.With the signing of Donald Penn, the Raiders have added three new offensive linemen to the mix in Oakland. After losing Jared Veldheer to free agency and Rodger Saffold to a failed physical, the Raiders signed Austin Howard, Kevin Boothe and now Penn. All three are favorites to be starters on the offensive line, but the Raiders are not promising anything to anyone.
Austin Howard told Greg Papa and John Lund on 95.7 The Game that the Raiders told him the best five offensive linemen would take the field on opening day. Clearly part of Reggie McKenzie’s plan is to get versatile linemen who can play pretty much anywhere. This provides added depth and camp competition, since pretty much every position is up for grabs.
The Raiders have 12 offensive linemen on the roster right now: Howard, Boothe, Penn, Menelik Watson, Khalif Barnes, Mike Brisiel, Tony Bergstrom, Stefen Wisniewski, Lamar Mady, Lucas Nix, Jarrod Shaw and Jack Cornell. Clearly a few of those players are just camp guys or destined for the practice squad, but including the three new names, there are eight players who should be competing for starting jobs with Oakland. I also would not be surprised if McKenzie isn’t finished adding offensive linemen. There is always the chance they use the No. 5 pick on a tackle, but there is also a chance they add another versatile free agent to the mix.
McKenzie has shown a desire to strengthen the offensive and defensive lines this offseason, something that was long overdue. The Raiders have suffered from inept play along the offensive line for the majority of their Decade of Disaster, and they’ve been looking to fix that area of the team since drafting Robert Gallery with the second overall pick in 2004. Masked by consistent struggles behind center, the offensive line in Oakland has been one of the squad’s biggest problems for years.
This is not exactly what one would call a dominant offensive line, but it is far better than anything seen in Oakland in several years. The unit should be able to create holes for the running game and provide better protection in the pass game. Finally fixing the offensive line is a great way to start free agency for the Raiders.Albany, NY (WorkersCompensation.com) - New York State Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott today announced the arrest of a Finger Lakes woman on charges she defrauded the workers' compensation system and stole nearly $6,000 in insurance benefits to which she was not entitled.
JoAnne Cardona, 47, of Laughlin Lane, Geneseo, was charged with Grand Larceny in the Third Degree, Insurance Fraud in the Third Degree, Perjury in the First Degree, two counts of the Workers' Compensation crime of Fraudulent Practices, and five counts of Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the First Degree, all felonies.
An investigation by Inspector General Leahy Scott found that Cardona had been receiving workers' compensation benefits since 2003 when she allegedly suffered neck, shoulder and upper back injuries when an elderly resident fell on her during her employment at an Amsterdam, New York home for the elderly. Subsequently, she stopped working and began collecting workers' compensation benefits.
In October, 2013, she began working at the Center for Disability Rights, Inc. in Rochester, New York. In the subsequent months, as found by the investigation, she repeatedly submitted documentation to the State Insurance Fund asserting she was not working in any capacity. She also falsely testified at a State Workers' Compensation Board hearing in September of 2014 that she had not worked in any capacity before June 2014. Between October 2013 and June 2014, she received $5,888 in workers' compensation benefits, about $185 per week, to which she was not entitled.
“This defendant falsified paperwork and misrepresented her work status in order to receive compensation benefits to which she was not entitled,” said Inspector General Leahy Scott. “I will continue dedicating the resources of my position and office to protect the benefits meant to assist honest, hard-working New Yorkers.”
Under State law, employers are required to maintain Workers' Compensation coverage for their employees, and employees are expected to provide truthful information regarding their work activity to insurance carriers and the Workers' Compensation Board during the time they are receiving benefits.
Cardona was arraigned in Albany City Court and was released pending reappearance Monday, Sept. 12, in City Court.
The defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in a court of law.
Inspector General Leahy Scott thanked New York State Insurance Fund Executive Director Eric Madoff and his office for their assistance with the investigation, and Albany County District Attorney P. David Soares and his office for prosecuting this matter.

I’m going to start writing here again, so here’s my first real post in awhile.
It’s a short piece & it’s about a woman I met on the train from Denver to Chicago.
———
She is tiny, bundled in a faux-leopard print coat, and she is carrying her weight in baggage.
“Can I help you carry anything?” I ask as I step off the train to join her on the platform of Chicago’s Union Station.
A face etched with the lines of a woman who has lived with all of her heart peeks out from under a severe blond bob and black beret. “Oh sure. Here, carry this–“
It’s a guitar case, flimsy with belongings other than what the case was intended for.
“I don’t have a guitar in there. I left it behind in Memphis because I wasn’t sure it was going to work out in Denver.”
She pauses and then turns to me, “Please don’t ever move across the country to live with a man you’ve only known for three months, okay?”Aud-Motherhood | Goo.N Baby Diaper X Lazada Big Baby Fair
Do you know that nowadays my shopping cart no longer contains beauty or makeup products? 90% of them are now baby related. Well, that's how a baby changes you, an amazing change, though.
I am very particular with the diaper I use on #AudBabyJoie. I've tried quite a few brands such as huggies, drypers, drypers touch, Mamypoko extra dry, Mamypoko standard pants, Goo.N, and Merries but only the last two brands are my favorites.
I've been using Goo.N and Merries alternately for almost a year now. Goo.N for the day, Merries for night and outings. I really love both of them because they are so soft and comfortable (no rashes at all). Both have very high absorbency too! I have not experience leakage on both diapers even during #AudBabyJoie's poonami. Most importantly, #AudBabyJoie is happy wearing them! But let's be honest, good diapers are not cheap. Although there are cheaper ones but I wouldn't want to put my baby's delicate skin at stake (nappy rash is horror!). What I can do is to try to save money, which is why I am always in the search for the best deal when it comes to diaper, milk powder or in fact, all baby related stuff, because EVERY PENNY COUNTS!
Some of you may feel that why not go to baby fair or expo? I know there are fairs and expos, I've been there a few times and I seriously detest squeezing with the huge crowd, and I surely hate to carry all the purchases home myself. I would much prefer to sit at home, click a few clicks and things get delivered to door step. Easy!
Click a few clicks, sit back, relax and wait for the diapers to be delivered. That's how my girl gets to enjoy her soft and comfy Goo.N diaper.
Oh, by the way, you do know that not everything in the baby fair is cheaper and worth buying right? You will be surprised that sometimes online deals are cheaper than fairs and the perk is you can totally avoid all the sufferings (jam, crowd, queue..).

Policymakers are using different ways to measure the community benefit provided by non-profit hospitals because different policy makers have different policy objectives. We compare 3 commonly used measures of community benefit; examine the correlation across the 3 measures; examine how the distribution of community benefits varies across non-profit hospitals; and compare the factors associated with the level of community benefit for each definition. The main dataset for this study is the Schedule H of IRS Form 990 data for 2017. We merged this data with the 2017 American Hospital Association (AHA), the 2017 CMS Hospital Cost Report, and the 2018 American Community Survey data. The final sample consists of 1904 non-profit hospitals. We define 3 measures of community benefit: (1) Total community benefits: combining all 17 possible measures in the 990 data; (2) Total community benefits less unreimbursed Medicaid care because it reflects a policy choice made by the state; and (3) only charity care. We also subdivided the community benefits into individual and service-based benefit. Gini Coefficients and descriptive analysis show the distribution of 3 types of community benefit measures. On average, hospitals spent 8.1% of their expenses on all community benefits; 4.3% on community benefits less unreimbursed Medicaid; and 1.7% on charity care. The provision of charity care showed more variation (Gini coefficient) than the other 2 measures. Different hospital and geographic characteristics were associated with each definition, suggesting that different types of hospitals place emphasis on different community benefits. When policy makers choose among different definitions of community benefit, they should consider what incentives they want to instill.

RESUMO
Importance: Overuse of health care services exposes patients to unnecessary risk of harm and costs. Distinguishing patterns of overuse among hospitals requires hospital-level measures across multiple services. Objective: To describe characteristics of hospitals associated with overuse of health care services in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cross-sectional analysis used Medicare fee-for-service claims data for beneficiaries older than 65 years from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017, with a lookback of 1 year. Inpatient and outpatient services were included, and services offered at specialty and federal hospitals were excluded. Patients were from hospitals with the capacity (based on a claims filter developed for this study) to perform at least 7 of 12 investigated services. Statistical analyses were performed from July 1, 2020, to December 20, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes of interest were a composite overuse score ranging from 0 (no overuse of services) to 1 (relatively high overuse of services) and characteristics of hospitals clustered by overuse rates. Twelve published low-value service algorithms were applied to the data to find overuse rates for each hospital, normalized and aggregated to a composite score and then compared across 6 hospital characteristics using multivariable regression. A k-means cluster analysis was used on normalized overuse rates to identify hospital clusters. Results: The primary analysis was performed on 2415 cohort A hospitals (ie, hospitals with capacity for 7 or more services), which included 1 263 592 patients (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [14] years; 678 549 women [53.7%]; 101â¯017â¯191 White patients [80.5%]). Head imaging for syncope was the highest-volume low-value service (377â¯745 patients [29.9%]), followed by coronary artery stenting for stable coronary disease (199â¯579 [15.8%]). The mean (SD) composite overuse score was 0.40 (0.10) points. Southern hospitals had a higher mean score than midwestern (difference in means: 0.06 [95% CI, 0.05-0.07] points; P < .001), northeast (0.08 [95% CI, 0.06-0.09] points; P < .001), and western hospitals (0.08 [95% CI, 0.07-0.10] points; P < .001). Nonprofit hospitals had a lower adjusted mean score than for-profit hospitals (-0.03 [95% CI, -0.04 to -0.02] points; P < .001). Major teaching hospitals had significantly lower adjusted mean overuse scores vs minor teaching hospitals (difference in means, -0.07 [95% CI, -0.08 to -0.06] points; P < .001) and nonteaching hospitals (-0.10 [95% CI, -0.12 to -0.09] points; P < .001). Of the 4 clusters identified, 1 was characterized by its low counts of overuse in all services except for spinal fusion; the majority of major teaching hospitals were in this cluster (164 of 223 major teaching hospitals [73.5%]). Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study used a novel measurement of hospital-associated overuse; results showed that the highest scores in this Medicare population were associated with nonteaching and for-profit hospitals, particularly in the South.

RESUMO
The different tax treatment of government, nonprofit, and for-profit hospitals implies different charity care obligations, with the greatest obligation for government hospitals and the least for for-profit hospitals. Prior research has not examined charity care provision among all three ownership types at the national level. Using 2018 Medicare Hospital Cost Reports, we compared charity care provision across 1,024 government, 2,709 nonprofit, and 930 for-profit hospitals. In aggregate, nonprofit hospitals spent $2.3 of every $100 in total expenses incurred on charity care, which was less than government ($4.1) or for-profit ($3.8) hospitals. No hospital ownership type outperformed the other two types with respect to charity care provision in a majority of hospital service areas containing all three types. Using different kinds of analyses, we also found wide variation in charity care provision within ownership types and a lack of a consistent pattern across ownership types. These results suggest that many government and nonprofit hospitals' charity care provision was not aligned with their charity care obligations arising from their favorable tax treatment. Policy makers may consider initiatives to enhance hospitals' charity care provision, particularly hospitals with government and nonprofit ownership.

RESUMO
BACKGROUND: Governance is a system that ensures and promotes accountability and responsibility toward stakeholders. The present study aims to compare the governance structures and practices in for-profit and non-for profit hospitals in Alexandria, Egypt. METHODS: The study is a descriptive cross sectional study in which Chief Executive officers (CEOs) in all hospitals in Alexandria Governorate were interviewed. A predesigned questionnaire was used in the interview that is composed of four section. The first section explored characteristics of study hospitals. The second section assessed the composition and the characteristics of boards. The third section assessed the functions of the board and the fourth section assessed boards' training and evaluation. RESULTS: A centralized board existed in the Health Insurance, Ministry of Health and Population and University hospitals. As for private hospitals, board existed in only 72 hospitals (82.75 %). Almost all boards have CEO duality. Board members were as few as two members in some boards and up to twenty members in others. Some hospital boards did not have an orientation manual or program. CONCLUSION: A proportion of study hospitals does not have a governing board. For the hospitals with governing boards, there were wide variation in governance structures and practices.

RESUMO
Low-to-middle-income countries often have high incidence of surgical site infection (SSI). To assess spatial and sociodemographic predictors of SSI rates, this study analysed and georeferenced governmental surveillance data from 385 hospitals located in inner São Paulo State, Brazil. In multi-variate models, SSI rates were positively associated with distance from the state capital [incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each 100 km 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.32], and were lower for non-profit (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.37-0.85) and private (IRR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.71) facilities compared with public hospitals. Georeferencing results reinforced the need to direct SSI-prevention policies to hospitals located in areas distant from the state capital.

RESUMO
OBJECTIVE: To improve patient safety and clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of prescribing errors, we tested the accuracy of a hybrid clinical decision support system in prioritizing prescription checks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from electronic health records were collated over a period of 18 months. Inferred scores at a patient level (probability of a patient's set of active orders to require a pharmacist review) were calculated using a hybrid approach (machine learning and a rule-based expert system). A clinical pharmacist analyzed randomly selected prescription orders over a 2-week period to corroborate our findings. Predicted scores were compared with the pharmacist's review using the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics were compared with existing tools: computerized alerts generated by a clinical decision support (CDS) system and a literature-based multicriteria query prioritization technique. Data from 10 716 individual patients (133 179 prescription orders) were used to train the algorithm on the basis of 25 features in a development dataset. RESULTS: While the pharmacist analyzed 412 individual patients (3364 prescription orders) in an independent validation dataset, the areas under the receiving-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of our digital system were 0.81 and 0.75, respectively, thus demonstrating greater accuracy than the CDS system (0.65 and 0.56, respectively) and multicriteria query techniques (0.68 and 0.56, respectively). DISCUSSION: Our innovative digital tool was notably more accurate than existing techniques (CDS system and multicriteria query) at intercepting potential prescription errors. CONCLUSIONS: By primarily targeting high-risk patients, this novel hybrid decision support system improved the accuracy and reliability of prescription checks in a hospital setting.

RESUMO
Psychological intervention outcomes depend in part on the therapist who provides the intervention (a therapist effect). However, recent reviews suggest that therapist effects may vary as a function of the context in which care is provided and therefore should not be generalized beyond that context. This study statistically analysed therapist effect differences between care sectors delivering psychological interventions. The sample comprised routine clinical data from 26,814 patients (69% female; mean age 38) and 466 therapists in five care sectors: primary care, secondary care, university, voluntary, and workplace. Therapist effects were analysed using multilevel models and Markov chain Monte Carlo credible intervals. The therapist effect was significantly larger in primary care (8.4%) than in any other sector (1.1%-2.3%) except secondary care (4.1%), after controlling for explanatory baseline and process variables as well as accounting for differences between clinics. There were no other significant differences detected between care sectors. These findings support the hypothesis that differences in effectiveness between therapists vary depending on the context in which psychological treatment is provided. Differences in relative therapist impact can vary by a factor of 4-8 across treatment sectors. This should be considered in the application of research evidence, treatment planning, and the design and delivery of psychological care provision.

RESUMO
Objectives. To examine content of financial assistance polices (FAPs) among US tax-exempt hospitals and determine whether restrictive policies were associated with reduced charity care spending.Methods. Using hospital tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service in 2016 and FAPs obtained from hospital Web sites, we examined characteristics of FAPs and associated expenditures for charity care in a representative sample of 170 tax-exempt hospitals. We identified common eligibility requirements and used them to define restrictiveness of FAPs.Results. FAPs were characterized by various ways to exclude patients, a patchwork of coverage for typical health care services, and wide-ranging discounts. FAP expenditures were lowest among restrictive hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act and highest among nonrestrictive hospitals in nonexpansion states. FAP expenses did not differ by hospital restrictiveness alone.Conclusions. Standardizing common eligibility requirements among FAPs carries potential benefits with regard to optimizing charity care for community benefit and achieving at least some level of equity; however, further policy efforts must account for additional restrictions, charges, and exclusions to be effective.Images of Wales Back to Webpage Archive

The timing of this information is to help you with your Christmas shopping. It is a great gift for any stitcher. It contains basic and necessary information from a professional such as; how to thread a needle easily, start and finish threads, set up fabric with a tight tension. There are many tips and strategies to help you enjoy stitching and achieve more professional results. It is also a creative text for those who prefer to do their own thing rather than follow kits and charts.
The title is the introduction. With a total of 17 flowers to be included the first consideration was that the cover would not look like a jungle. A definite structure was necessary to keep all the plants/flowers organized.
The outer circle contains the flowers featured in the first book which is no longer available. The inner circle features those that were added for the second edition and are less well known. The bushes and trees are still in the book but are not included in this cover embroidery.
Starting at the top of the outer circle, you will see white snowdrops. To the right are bluebells, primulas and grape hyacinths. Next are narcissi, tulips with hyacinths at the bottom. Following up the left side are tall iris, daffodils, and forget me nots. Lastly are crocus and more hyacinths.
The inner circle of spring flowers are less well known and are new for the 2nd edition. These photos have been enhanced so that you can see the detail of the original and the new flowers more clearly. The colour of the fabric is inaccurate.
At the top there are dark blue and mauve dwarf or rock iris. To the right are some more snowdrops with yellow aconites.
After that blue/mauve, white and pink/mauve pasque flowers or prairie crocus. Next are cream and pale yellow english primroses..
At the lower edge of the inner ring are a wilder variety of primulas in shades of blue followed but more english primroses.
Pink, white and blue star of bethlehem include dandelions growing among them. More snowdrops and aconites complete the inner circle.
The centre contains a small circle of padded background material with small and scattered french knots. The surrounding circle is larger french knots. The radiating lines are french knots stitched in shades of mauve and green. The green thread is the same shade as the background fabric.
All the plants are stitched using only four embroidery stitches. These are straight, detached chain, buttonhole and french knots. Yes, it was a challenge to portray all these wildly different plants with such a basic and limited number of stitches. Multiple colours of DMC Floss are used. The threads are blended/mixed in the needle to obtain the correct colour for natures’ choice of each plant and flower.
Precise directions and diagrams for stitching each plant are included in the text.
None of this is difficult but it is a different way of portraying flowers. As well as creating a garden which is what most students did, these flowers are useful for small projects such as greeting cards, phone covers and glasses cases all of which you will find in the book.
Green seems to be a difficult colour to photograph accurately. This green fabric is a soft gray green and shows off all the greens used for the leaves. When stitching green thread on green fabric, one often has to change the proportions in the thread colour recipe for them to be seen clearly.
I have discovered why fashion photographs so seldom portray green except for really dark or bright greens. This is something I had never noticed before photographing the flowers for this book.
If you are interested in this book, or its companion, Hand Stitch Recognizable Summer Flowers, you can find them at eBookIt.com It is published in an ebook format to make it affordable for everyone.
Professionally colour printing a book with as many colour photos and diagrams as are included in this text is expensive. You can print it on your home colour printer.
If you would like a printed copy, please email me at [email protected]
The next entry will feature more gardens stitched by students.
Congratulations Ann on your 2nd edition book. I enjoyed seeing the clever way that the flowers from your first edition were placed.
I love the cover. I am looking forward to trying these stiches. Thank you for the inspiration.A lower CP reﬂecting larger breathing volume will result in many of the symptoms below. How many do you experience?
• Snoring
• Sleep apnoea (holding your breath many times throughout the night)
• Disrupted sleep
• Sweating
• Racing mind
• Nightmares
• Needing to use the bathroom at about 5 am or 6 am
• Children wetting the bed during the night
• Fatigue ﬁrst thing in morning
• Brain fog upon waking
• Dry mouth
• Upper or lower respiratory complaints
Solution:
• Do not eat anything two hours before going to tummy or left hand side. Sleeping on your back is by far the worst position as there is no restriction to your breathing. The tummy is the most preferred position, as the weight of your body against the mattress will automatically help you breathe less.
• Ensure that your mouth is closed at night.
To eliminate insomnia, reduce your breathing by relaxing for ﬁfteen minutes before bed. Sit on a chair or in a meditation position. Close your eyes and follow your breathing. Continuously allow your breathing to quieten and relax. Feel a comfortable and tolerable air shortage. This will ensure continued sleep without disruptions.

In fact, all of the symptoms listed above will be reduced if you keep your mouth closed at night. If you have had copious amounts of alcohol, are epileptic or are feeling nauseas, do not wear the tape.
Some people may possibly, and very reasonably, experience panic at the thought of having their mouth taped. To help overcome this, put the tape on your mouth half an hour before going to bed. This should be enough time to allow you to adjust to using the tape and to overcome any nervousness. For the ﬁrst. Breathing through your nose will result in a wet mouth when you wake up. If your mouth is dry upon waking, you know that your mouth was open during sleep.It was revealed the Django Unchained beauty, 36, was dating the San Francisco 49ers cornerback, 31, on Wednesday afternoon (03Jun13), and just hours later sources tell Eonline.com the couple is actually man and wife.

The rechargeable battery under normal conditions of operation of the car practically does not demand service. At high temperature of air it is recommended to check electrolyte level in the battery from time to time.
In the opaque served battery measure the level of electrolyte by means of a hollow glass tubule, having closed one its end a finger. In the taken "sample" liquid column height in a tube will correspond to height of excess of level of electrolyte from the upper edge of plates.
Surely check electrolyte level when charging battery. It has to be always between the tags "MIN" and "MOVE" put on the longitudinal parties of the battery.
At decrease in level of electrolyte add in the relevant banks the distilled water to the mark "MAH". It should be made before the level of electrolyte falls below the mark "MIN".
PREVENTION
Do not pour electrolyte above the necessary level as it will follow through an air vent. It can lead to damage of a paint and varnish covering and to corrosion of a body.

The second contract involves the assessment of different designs for STEP’s ‘breeder blanket’, the first-of-a-kind component responsible for creating the tritium fuel required for successful fusion.
Matthew Gallimore, Assystem’s Chief Sales Officer said: “STEP is a globally significant project in the development of fusion energy as it takes us a step close to the commercial phase of this new technology.
“The teams at Assystem bring strong experience in fusion gained on JET and ITER and we are excited to be creating more jobs in fusion development through these latest contract wins.”.KUWALLA TEE

On January 9, your solo exhibition “Swampland” opened at Hong Kong’s Hanart TZ Gallery with drawings and installations that reflect on failed personal and collective utopias. Have you continued to think about this topic?
What I Saw On Top of The World (2019) was a wall-mounted installation at the show. It comprises three Chinese characters, 打落弊, rendered in large, gold script. The nonsensical phrase is a Cantonese transliteration of the Thai word for “forever.” My poet friend described the work as “an eternity carelessly sworn in a foreign language.” I thought I was going to be condemned by the gods for my blasphemy. At the same time, the individual characters literally translate to hit, fall, fail. Sure enough, like a self-fulfilled prophecy, since 2019 and throughout 2020, I have experienced the pain and bitterness of failure in public and in private. Instead of continuing to “think about” the topic, I would say experiencing failure is inevitable in daily life. If one is willing to do whatever it takes to reach one’s goal, besides fight, one must also endure.
What has been your experience of Covid-19 in Hong Kong?
The pandemic has messed up all my plans. I thought I had a grasp on the future because I have imagined countless possible scenarios. But the pandemic has restored the future to what it is: unknown, uncertain. I’ve resisted the unpredictable and detested it with a passion but now I find comfort in going with the flow. As a Hong Konger, I have long been riding on a derailed train without any brakes or seatbelts.
What artworks, exhibitions, or other cultural productions have been important to you in understanding the events of 2020?
I have been rewatching Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s 2018 film Netemo Sametemo. Its bizarreness, mutations, ruptures, and relentlessness speak to my experience of 2020. On the surface, the movie is about a woman running into two men who look identical, but the English translation of the title, Asako I & II, suggests that it is the female protagonist who is split. Many of my friends think that the story is so absurd that it could only be interpreted as a fable, but that might be because most people haven’t encountered ghosts before or lived with a spirit.
The narrative’s turning point is the Tohoku earthquake on March 11, 2011. I understand it as a story of Japan before and after the catastrophe. At the end of the film, both of the main characters look at a river. The man is disgusted by the turbid water, whereas the woman says, “it’s beautiful.” Eventually we will have to find some kind of reconciliation with this deformed world. I wonder whether we will be able to say something like “it’s beautiful” when we finally arrive at a post-pandemic era.
What has Covid-19 surfaced about the arts infrastructure in Hong Kong?
I was originally concerned with whether my income would decrease during the pandemic, but then I thought, did I earn a lot of money before the pandemic? There’s no difference. I have always been poor.
Screenshot of HO SIN TUNG’s online exhibition “I’ve often sailed in her,” a part of “Post-Human Narratives.” Courtesy the artist.
In July, you presented the online exhibition “I’ve often sailed in her.” What was it like preparing a virtual show, and what is it about?
Preparing for an online exhibition requires working closely with web technicians. It doesn’t feel too different from negotiating with handlers at a physical exhibition. Both require hard work. I’m very grateful to those who help realize my works, whether in the two- or three-dimensional world.
“I’ve often sailed in her” is part of a group project titled “Post-Human Narratives,” which stems from Donna Haraway’s seminal essay A Cyborg Manifesto (1985). Curated by Kobe Ko, it is an initiative that explores hybridity and border-crossing—of course, the borders being crossed include those between classes, ages, races, or genders. My featured work is primarily a writing project that extends from the Oxford Advanced Learner’s English-Chinese Dictionary. First published in 1988, this dictionary reflects the norms and trends of the time, and naturalizes them in a rational manner. I extracted sentences from the tome that use “she” as a subject, and copied them onto colorful cards. I then grouped these phrases under headings such as “Hole to Hole,” “Miss Mystery,” and “Shut Up.” The categories might be odd but the acts of renaming and reorganizing are ways to retrieve power. I also transformed some of the fragments into short poems and stories.
How are you imagining the future, for yourself and for the people and environment around you?
I imagine a world where the unseen and intangible become increasingly pivotal.
In the video Full Dark, No Stars (2020), you cut together scenes of illumination amid the dark. The work seems to speak of hope. What does “hope” mean to you?
Sometimes the lights in the work do represent hope, but at times a void, disasters, disguises, and despair are also mixed in. In regards to hope, a few lines from the cartoon Midnight Gospel (2020) have been reverberating in my mind. In the episode about reincarnation, a character says: “The moment you accept things as they are . . . You don’t need to hope anymore. Because you realized where you are is kind of okay. Hope tortures your fucking ass. Now, hopelessness sounds really rotten when you – If you haven’t really explored just how much you’ve been using hope as a flaw. ‘Ooh, I hope tomorrow . . . ’ Smack! ‘Oh, I hope she comes back.’ Smack! ‘I hope I can forget . . .’ Smack! Just beating yourself up with hope. Not one fucking second you let yourself be hopeless. Let go of hope. Let go.”.Testimonials

- AuthorPostsCésar Ortega discovered his passion for coffee while helping out at his friend's bistro 10 years ago. The experience inspired him to open Latidos Café in Escandón, a quiet neighborhood in Mexico City.
Within six months of opening in mid-2017, César was using the WhatsApp Business app to run Latidos's takeout and delivery service featuring coffee beverages and quick bites like sandwiches.
"With WhatsApp Business, sales have increased around 25 percent. As a contact tool, it is fabulous; automated messages have made us 50 percent more efficient," he says.
The labels feature helps César organize the credit tabs he runs for his most loyal patrons — color coding each account, he explains, makes it easier to track orders and remind them when payment is due — and the business profile feature means new customers can learn about Latidos, faster.
"Twenty minutes before I arrive at work, I place my order via WhatsApp. When I arrive, the order is there"
Customers also like the ease of connecting with Latidos Café via WhatsApp. Daniel Pérez says thanks to the private messaging service, Latidos Café is his eatery of choice. "It is very convenient. Twenty minutes before I arrive at work, I place my order via WhatsApp. When I arrive, the order is there."
Latidos Café’s success is driving César's expansion plans; he hopes to open a second café in the neighborhood within two years and the organizational tools the WhatsApp Business app provides means César can more confidently plan for his growing business.- New

And it was great to combine baptism and baby dedication because it doubled the number of guests. We ran out of seats by the end of worship. Good complications:)

The missing four-year-old was located “alive and well” at the property in Tonkin Crescent, in the Carnarvon suburb of Brockman, 900km north of Perth early on Wednesday.
See the moment Cleo Smith was rescued in the video player above
WA Police say a man has been taken into custody and is being questioned by detectives.
Speaking to Sunrise, the local said everyone living on the street was “shocked” to find that Cleo had been inside their “quiet” neighbour’s home.
“Everyone that knows the person that stays in that house, wouldn’t think that it would be him,” he said.
“We got a shock ourselves that it was him.”
The local said he saw his neighbour “buying Kimbies” at the nearby Woolworths supermarket on Monday, even though he is not believed to have young children.
“We didn’t click on about who it was he was buying it for until now.”
He added that the neighbour had been displaying some “suspicious” behaviour by doing laps up and down the street in recent days.
The house is located some 75km south from where Cleo went missing, just seven minutes from her family home and two minutes from the police station at the centre of the investigation.
It is surrounded by high fences and there is a grey Mazda sedan parked in the driveway.
Cleo finally found
Cleo disappeared on October 16 while camping with her family at the Blowholes campsite near Carnarvon.
At about 1am WA time (4am AEST) on Wednesday, police broke into a locked house and found the little girl in one of the rooms.
“Cleo is alive and well,” Deputy Commissioner Col Blanch said in a statement.
She has been reunited with her family.

Stable Road Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), said May 6 it adjourned a special meeting of its shareholders convened that day because it didn’t have enough votes to approve one measure on the ballot.
That measure is not the approval of Stable Road’s merger with Momentus, announced in October, but instead a three-month extension of the deadline for Stable Road to complete the deal. SPACs traditionally have a limited period of time for which to use the funding raised by going public to merge with a company, or else the proceeds are returned to shareholders.
Stable Road sought to extend that deadline for completing the merger with Momentus from May 13 to Aug. 13. At the time of the shareholder meeting May 6, the vast majority of votes it had received were in favor of the extension, but those votes accounted for less than 59% of outstanding shares. The company needs at least 65% of shares to vote in favor of the extension to go into effect.
The company said in a May 6 statement that it adjourned that special meeting of shareholders until May 13 because it “is in the best interest of its stockholders to provide additional time for stockholders to vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal.”
If the company doesn’t get enough votes in favor of the extension by May 13, the SPAC will be liquidated and its merger with Momentus will be off. Shareholders will receive $10.03 per share in the SPAC. Shares in Stable Road were trading May 7 at a little less than $11 per share, down from a high of $29.18 per share earlier this year.
Stable Road has gone to great lengths to encourage shareholders to vote for the extension, such as a series of social media postings and press releases. Leadership of both Stable Road and Momentus conducted a one-hour webinar May 4 to make their case for both the extension and the overall merger.
Brian Kabot, chairman and chief executive of Stable Road, said at that webinar that this SPAC had an 18-month deadline from when it was created to close a deal, less than the 24 months more commonly used by SPACs. “We’re asking for a three-month extension, which still only takes us to 21 months, right?” he said. “There’s plenty of 24-month SPACs out there that are gonna need three- and six-month extensions.”
The merger has been slowed by a number of issues with Momentus, including investigations by the federal government into its foreign ownership. Momentus has taken several steps to address those issues, replacing its Russian co-founder, Mikhail Kokorich, as chief executive and having him and Brainyspace LLC, a firm owned by co-founder Lev Khasis and his wife, agree to divest their shares within three years.
Momentus said in April that it was still working on various regulatory issues, such as a voluntary review of its ownership structure by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The company also said it was still awaiting a payload review by the Federal Aviation Administration to allow it to launch its first space tug, Vigoride-1, on a SpaceX rideshare mission in June. Those reviews forced Momentus to take Vigoride off a similar rideshare mission in January.
During the May 4 webinar, Rob Schwarz, chief technology officer at Momentus, said the Vigoride-1 tug is ready for launch but that the company was awaiting regulatory approvals. “It’s ready to go and it will, assuming we get all our licenses,” he said. “We still are waiting for the government to grant our final licenses so that we can launch. But assuming all that comes in, then, we are planning to launch in June, at the end of June of this year. So, just in a couple months. We’re all super psyched.”Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus, Third Edition Copyright © 2013 by the Philip Lief Group.

Painting a Roller Shade
Fabric roller shades are easily painted with any acrylic paint as long as you mix in the recommended amount of a fabric medium liquid. If you have vinyl shades instead, you'll need a vinyl specific primer first, then your favorite acrylic paint. To save a step, try a spray paint designed for use on fabric and vinyl so there's no need to wait on primer to dry.
Take the shade down and unroll it completely to paint. Consider marking out a geometric pattern, like trendy chevrons, with painter's tape and then roll, spray, or dab on the paint. You can also try free-handing artistic designs with a brush if you are artistically inclined. You can even treat the shade like a canvas and paint a portrait of your family, create a beautiful landscape, or just go wild with abstract splashes of color.
Covering a Roller Shade with Fabric
Start by picking a fabric that isn't too thick. The thin cotton used for making quilts is a good choice, but any fabric that thin or thinner should work just as well. Quilting cotton is a good place to look for bright colors and fun patterns as well. Measure your roller shades when they're fully extended and buy a piece of fabric that will fit over the entire shade with at least one inch of extra material in every direction.
Coat the outside of the extended roller shade with a spray adhesive that works on fabric and vinyl. Arrange the fabric over the shade so any designs or patterns are centered, then smooth the fabric onto the shade from the middle outward to minimize wrinkles and bubbles. If a wrinkle forms, gently lift the fabric back up and straighten it out. Trim the excess fabric with sharp shears when you are done. The adhesive will likely recommend a certain amount of curing time. Once that time period has passed, your fabric-covered shades are ready to be reinstalled and put to good use.
For more information about care and maintenance of your roller shades, contact companies like Sylvan's & Phillip's.Image 5-416-29 | Photo ©David Sanger | Macau, Mezzaluna restaurant, view of Taipa bridge

Title: Affair in Athens
Author: Matina Nicholas
Genre: Literary Fiction
Release Date: April 1, 2013
Blurb:
Fulfilling her mother’s dying wish to discover her roots, Athena Vallas journeys to Greece and finds more than history as she reunites with a part of her family she didn’t know existed. While documenting her grandfather’s heroic role as a Greek Orthodox priest in Plaka, sheltering Jews during the Resistance in WWII, Athena meets Luke, a dangerously charismatic man who sees her as the ideal wife.
Drawn into an extravagant lifestyle, her attraction to Luke is intense until she discovers that he plays a high stakes game of illegal pursuits. When she attempts to distance herself, Luke refuses to relinquish his plans. Ruthlessly, he keeps his eye on the prize—Athena—who won’t compromise love for wealth or fidelity for lifestyle.
Affair in Athens includes a set of authentic Greek recipes at the back of the book, passed down through Matina’s family. Read, eat, and enjoy!
With a background in English and education and a dedication to transmit her love of writing to her students, Matina Nicholas taught writing and literature at university and high school levels. She has been published in educational texts, professional periodicals, and journals. Currently, she writes for the Condo News under the name Tina Chippas. Her writing pieces can be read at condonewsonline.com under Commentary and Essays.
A confirmed dog lover, Matina is involved with her two dogs, Chelsea, a geriatric-but-far-from-over-the-hill toy red poodle and Lukie, a spunky, stubby Miniature Pinscher. Their eagerness for adventure and fine canine dining is the source for some of her essays for the Condo News.
This is her first novel.
Excerpt:
The old priest’s Byzantine chant, the heady smokiness of burning incense, the power of icons hundreds of years old staring down on her intoxicated her senses. She looked about the ancient Greek Orthodox church tucked under the Parthenon with a deep sense of awe and respect. This was where her grandfather had been priest for fifty years, where her mother had been christened and prayed and left behind so long ago. There were no pews, no chairs in this church. After all, “orthodox” meant upright. Dozens of candles in ornate brass candelabras flickered and cast mysterious shadows.
Athena’s eyes brimmed with tears. The altar swam before her. She was overwhelmed with a sense of coming home, of belonging. She knelt, covering her face with her hands, remembering her mother’s last days. Filled with love for her daughter, Amalia grieved that she would not live to see Athena married or have children. How could any daughter deny her mother’s last wish? Athena had promised to visit the tiny church in Plaka, learn of her Greek roots and her grandfather’s role in sheltering Jews during the Resistance.
Tears slipped through her fingers and dropped to the stone floor, the same stones where her grandparents had stood when they married, baptized their children, where their coffins had rested before they were buried. This was where her grandfather and his parishioners heroically stood when the Nazis trained their machine guns on them—Father Peter, in his black robes, face and arms raised in prayer, radiating strength and courage to his parishioners as they stood facing him. They had done God’s will by hiding and smuggling the Salonika Jews out of Athens into the remote countryside. “Pater Ev-lo-i-son Emas. Father bless us,” they chanted, their voices abruptly silenced by the sharp, staccato bursts of the machine guns.
“My daughter.” Athena felt strong hands on her shoulders. She raised her tear-stained face to see an old priest in the customary black robes, looking down at her. His bright blue eyes peered over his wire spectacles, his face creased in concern. “I am Father Nicholas. My child, how can I help you?” His English was quite good.

Picked up our pocket WiFi and queued up to get our Japan Rail Pass. It was all really simple, as well as finding the Monorail to take us into the heart of the city. Our hotel was situated in Shinjuku - a busy hub with the worlds biggest train station - so we managed to navigate our way there. We couldn't check into our hotel till 3pm - so we left our bags there and went exploring.
We decided to use the day to get our bearings around Shinjuku and see what it had to offer.
We then took the train to Shibuya to see the crossing and have another wonder around to see what Tokyo had to offer. It was a long day soaking up the culture change, and getting used to the transport system. 4 coffees later we decided to retire early due to major jetlag - we had some shitty ramen and fell asleep.
Also their vending machines are the BEST!
Friday 17th March:
Skytree and Akihabara
We really wanted to experience a maid cafe - so we did! We went to Maid Dreamin' which looked like a tacky horror story at first - with a few guys sitting on their own and a stage in front of them. In the end it was a really good experience of moe culture in japan, with cute girls serving us the most kawaii food and drinks! You had to sing little tunes when you got your food, wore animal ears, and had to say 'Meow Meow' to get the servers attention! My boyfriend found it a little cringey at first, but as more people came into the cafe, it was much more fun!
We woundered around Akihabara and looked in all the anime shops - manga, figures, vintage games - It was really interesting, and I enjoyed trying to find merch from my favourite anime's (yes I like anime...so sue me!)
We finished off the day walking back to our hotel and stopping of for some food. We ended up in the basement of some building eating Okonomiyaki - which I found out I don't like! (Food was HARD in Japan!) But I had some really nice peach wine?
Saturday 18th March
Studio Ghibli and Meji Jingu
The museum was really nice, with lots of Ghibli Charm! If you haven't heard of Studio Ghibli before - it's basically Japans version of Disney. Animated movies designed for all the family - they are charming, and gorgeous to watch - my personal favourite is Howls Moving Castle. We spent about 1 hour 30 mins at the museum, it's only small but well worth a visit.
We walked back to the train station through the park and headed to Meji Jinju Shrine just outside of Harajuku Station.
The Tori Gates to enter the park were the biggest I'd seen. It was all surrounded by woodland with wide paths up to the shrine. It was crazy to be so quiet when it was in the heart of Tokyo. We walked to a park on the other side before finding some food at our hotel. The resturant was called 'Royal Host' and was terrible....I'm sure we'll find some good food soon right?!
Sunday 19th March
Imperial Palace & Tokyo Tower and Robots
The Imperial Palace is open on Sundays so off we went! The sun was shining and it was the most gorgeous day! The Gardens were really nice to walk around, with old buildings dotted around - like old tea pavillions and japanese style gardens with huge skyscrapers lurking in the distance. We wanted to go see Tokyo Tower (Exactly the same shape as the Eiffel Tower except red!) we didn't feel the need to go up as we'd already been up SkyTree. There was a festival going on underneath, which had some japanese girls performing and loads of local food stalls.Behind the tower was a cute little park, and side streets to explore.
Once the show finished it was about 9pm and we decided the night wasn't over - so we made our way to the Metropolitan Government Building to get a free nighttime view of the city from their observation deck! (The Japanese sure loved their decks!) Walking through the skyscraper district at nigh was really nice too. The night view was incredible.
Monday 20th March
Nakano Broadway, Okibukuro and Tokyo Dome
We then went to Okibukuro to find Sunshine City which is a HUGE shopping centre. It also has the Pokemon Mega Store which had everything in it! It was so so busy as it was a national holiday, but we still enjoyed wondering around a new part of Tokyo. We then went to Tokyo Dome which is a baseball stadium, and has a number of other attractions too - such as rollercoasters, rides, a water park and themed cafes (I saw a Moomin Cafe, a Bubba Gump and some others!) I would defiantly want to explore TokyoDome more next time we visit Tokyo! It looked like it had a lot to offer.
I don't even remember what I had for dinner....obviously nothing to write home about! Was quite possibly a Mcdonalds.....it was amazing out there! Teriyaki burgers come to the UK please!!

Description
Anne Bosworth was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. She received her B.S. from Wellesley College in 1890 and was hired by Rhode Island State College (now URI) on March 23, 1892 for a one year appointment as math instructor. By April, she was appointed the college's first Professor of Mathematics and Physics. Bosworth attended the University of Chicago in the summers of 1894 and 1896 and received her Master's Degree in 1896. In 1899, she took a leave of absence to study at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen in Germany from which she received her Ph.D. in 1900. Bosworth married Theodore Focke in 1901. Like so many women of her day, it appears that she left her position at the college to marry. President Washburn wrote in the 1902 Annual Report: "It is with regret that the institution loses Miss Bosworth from the faculty. Her conscientious work has been, from the beginning, highly appreciated by every member of the institution."

NewThere are few things more beautiful (or reassuring) than switching on the telly for the Premier League curtain raiser.
Having been deprived of competitive football for an insufferable twenty-nine days, the sight of Wembley’s green grass glistening in the sun, tiers of red seats occupied by excited fans who’ve shilled a month’s pay packet on a new club shirt for the occasion while members of the armed forces staring blankly at a Hype Man in an oversized t-shirt issuing directives about waving an oversize bedsheet around, is a much needed reminder of what we live for, if not why we live for it.
It’s not even as though it matters. Alright, it’s an opportunity for one team to do that now compulsory wobbly hand build up before the captain flings the trophy above his head, but as Arsenal fans will tell you between pushes of the F5 button on the BBC transfer gossip page, no one bothers to dust off the big plate at the end of the season.
It’s a testament to the increasing power of ‘The Narrative’ that we’re all there anyway, watching Robbie Savage, Michael Owen and Rio Ferdinand making sounds into a microphone and secretly hoping at least one of them is hit by a stray ball during the warm up. It’s been less than three months since Leicester City won the Premier League but instead of taking a step back and appreciating freedom from fixture congestion, complicated mathematical problems involving goal difference and what is rapidly becoming known as ‘The Michael Owen Drone’, we’re all gagging for a glimpse into the future, questions swarming like moths to a Ronaldo.
Will Jamie Vardy’s party continue into a second season (otherwise known Ronaldinho carnival territory?)
Will the Most Envied League in the World prove to be a step too far for Zlatan?
Why is Maroune Fellaini still disguised as Big Bird?
Could Mourinho be any more irritating and obstreperous than last season?
While it’ll take a few more games (and a statement from Sesame Street) to confirm the first three answers, Mourinho laid down a marker that cannot be ignored. Carneiro-gate stripped him of any claim to the irritating yet entertaining agent provocateur personality many of us grudgingly admired and if yesterday’s performance was any evidence, he’ll be in full panto villain make up for the duration.
Keeping Leicester City waiting in the tunnel was disrespectful, but could, if one was feeling generous, be forgiven. After all, it’s sunny outside and the football is on. But very publicly and pointedly humiliating Juan Mata by putting him on in the sixty-third minute, then hauling him off after half an hour because ‘he’s too small’ is about as classless as it’s possible to be without kicking the guy in the arse as he walks off.
Regardless of Mourinho’s feelings on the player, Mata is an exceptional professional and should be treated as such. Mourinho appears to have learned nothing from his ignominious exits from Real Madrid and Chelsea, and while Manchester United fans will be rightly be thrilled at the possibilities afforded to them by his leadership and experience, alarm bells should be ringing.
While Sir Alex Ferguson harnessed the twin missiles of ruthlessness and petulance whenever necessary, he respected their efficacy and rarely allowed his personal feelings to impair his judgement. His insistence upon mutual respect and never say die attitude permeated the DNA of Manchester United and arguably propelled his club to the title of Most Hated Club for the right reasons.
In nine months time, they may well have earned that title again. And the other, slightly more important one. But at what cost to their reputation?
We’ll just have to wait and see, won’t‘We’ve had one or two negative comments,’ says resort manager
A statue of US Civil War Confederate general Robert E Lee removed four years ago has turned up at a private Texas golf resort after selling at auction for $1.44m.
The bronze statue was taken down from a park in Dallas following the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, which left one woman dead.
It was donated to the Lajitas Golf Resort in Terlingua, near the Mexico border, which is owned by Texas oil and gas billionaire Kelcy Warren, according to the Houston Chronicle.
The 1935 sculpture of Lee on horseback had collected dust in storage for two years until it was sold to Texas law firm Holmes Firm PC. The firm’s founder, Ronald L Holmes, did not respond to The Independent’s request for comment by the time of publication.
The statue of Lee, riding next to another mounted soldier, is at the entrance of the 18-hole “Black Jack’s Crossing” course about 430 miles west of San Antonio.
The manager of the resort, Scott Beasley, said its presence was only to preserve the “fabulous piece of art”.
“I would say that of the 60-plus thousand guests we host each year, we’ve had one or two negative comments,” he told the Houston Chronicle. “I’d bet that 80 to 90 per cent of the people that come to the resort take a picture of it.”
Created by Alexander Phimister Proctor, the statue is among several Confederate monuments removed across the United States in the past four years since the far-right rally in Virginia.
The statue of the Confederate icon at the centre of the Charlottesville rally was not removed until July of this year.
Black Lives Matter Houston activist Brandon Mack took issue with the argument that Confederate statues can be kept as “an appreciation for art”, and asked whether that would apply to all iconography throughout history.
“We don’t glorify the swastika; we don’t have monuments (of) Adolf Hitler,” he said.
Mr Beasley, however, said he was not concerned about those offended by the statue.
“They were uneducated,” Mr Beasley told the Chronicle. “(They) didn’t know the true history and the story. (We) have not had any verbal comments at all and it wouldn’t matter. If you know your history about Robert E Lee and everything about him, it’s fabulous.”Whether you’re a long-time fan of the Pokemon franchise that several generations have grown up with or you’re new to the world of Pokemon if you’re curious about how Pokemon shield poke jobs work, simply continue reading.
You can select jobs at the Pokemon Center:
In order to browse the jobs that are available head to your nearest PokemonCenter.
Complete Poke jobs and grow stronger:
By sending your Pokemon to work, when you’re not using them, they’ll grow stronger. You’ll also earn valuable items upon completion of each job. Some items that you can expect to collect include heal balls, nest balls, and fresh water. Typically the higher the level of job that you select and the more Pokemon that you send to each job, the better rewards that you’ll receive. As each job gives out good rewards and great rewards.
Understand how long each job will take:
When you’re contemplating which job to select, think carefully about the time frame which each available job will take. If a job is listed as a whole day job it will take 24 hours, while a half a day job will take 12 hours. A very long job will take 8 hours, while a long job will take 4 hours. A short job will take 3 hours, a very short job will take 2 hours and a little job will only take 1 hour to complete.
Keep in mind that multiple Pokemon may be sent to the same job:
Each job has a maximum number of Pokemon that can be sent to the same job. As an example, you’ll be able to send up to 3 of your Pokemon to a one-star job. while you can send 4 of your idle Pokemon to a two-star job. You can send a whopping 30 Pokemon to a 10-star job. Keep in mind that the more Pokemon that you choose to send to a job, the higher the reward you are likely to receive will be. So it’s well worth sending the maximum number of possible Pokemon to each job that you select.
Each listed job has a preferred type:
It’s also a great idea to match each job with a Pokemon from its preferred type. For instance, when you first start playing Pokemon Shield, you’ll be able to send Pokemon to work at a one-star job at Yoshida’s Cafe. It’s best to send a grass type, as the job lists grass Pokemon as its preferred type of Pokemon. As if you send the preferred type of Pokemon to a job you will earn approximately 20% more than if you were to send a Pokemon of another type.
In conclusion. If you want to earn valuable items that you’ll be able to use in your battles and want to be able to strengthen your Pokemon, it’s well worth sending them to Poke jobs. Especially once you have too many Pokemon in your inventory to play with at any given point of time.Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.

Besides knee or hip replacement surgery, another surgical procedure that is aimed at relieving joint pain is shoulder replacement surgery. This procedure is a popular corrective solution for those suffering from extreme joint pain or a limited range of shoulder motion.
Though shoulder replacement surgery is performed, first and foremost, for pain relief, it provides other benefits which include restoration of shoulder strength, function and motion. Many patients who have undergone shoulder replacement surgery in fact testify that they were able to return to the sports they love, like golf, tennis and swimming.
The most common causes of shoulder pain and reduced shoulder function are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), post-traumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis), rotator cuff tear arthropathy, severe shoulder fracture and failed previous shoulder replacement surgery.
In a shoulder replacement surgical procedure, the damaged parts of the shoulder are removed and replaced with artificial components, called a prosthesis (artificial component materials are typically metal or durable plastic). Restoration of shoulder motion and function, and abated pain should be the expected results after surgery; however, these have not been realized in a number of patients who have been implanted with faulty replacement implants manufactured by Wright Medical Technology, Inc. and Tornier, Inc. (two global medical device companies that merged in October of 2015).
As explained by a shoulder replacement mass tort attorney, many patients now suffer from bone damage, metal toxicity and dislocation, among many others serious side effects due to the faulty design of Wright and Tornier shoulder replacement implants. Rather than having their pain reduced or removed, patients have only been made to suffer worse pains; on top of this, their real problem has not been solved, they will have to undergo additional costly medical treatment, including a revision surgery. The mass suit that will be filed by victims is aimed at helping these victims recover compensation which will cover payment for their needed medical care and for other damages, including pain and suffering.Dear Customers and Friends,
We want to take this opportunity to reach out to all of you to let you know that our residential service is temporarily closed at this time.
Due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the residential side of our business has been ordered to close for at least two weeks. This is a difficult time for us, and for so many other small businesses in Vancouver and throughout Washington.
We really wish we could continue serving you, right now, but we must take a step back and consider the bigger picture. We hope that you all stay safe and healthy as we work together to overcome this challenge.
Although we were doing everything in our power to safely carry out our air duct cleaning services, before the announcement, we understand how serious this virus is. And we do not want to be part of the problem. We want to be part of the solution.
So, we will honor the proclamation by the governor of Washington and we will put the brakes on our business until we’re given clearance to resume full operations.
Rest assured that as soon as the temporary closure is lifted, we will be back and ready to serve you again. If you would like to make your appointment in advance, please feel free to call us at 360-852-6212 in Vancouver, or at 503-208-8351 in Portland. Or make an appointment online by clicking here. But remember, the earliest we can be back to work is Thursday, April 7.
Until then, please do your part to help prevent the spread of this disease.
Stay careful, stay safe, and stay healthy.
It’s an honor being your air duct cleaner in the Portland/Vancouver area.
Sincerely,

The Kremlin is pushing Belarus to merge with Russia in exchange for cheap energy, the Belarusian leader said Friday (14 February), as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin is believed to be maneuvering to extend his stay in power..Sermon for the Sixth Sunday after the Epiphany based on Matthew 5:21-37
Dear recipients of forgiveness: Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
God’s Law says, “You shall not murder.” Our sinful tendency is to apply this only to the course outward deed of striking our neighbour so that he dies, as if that is the only thing forbidden in this Commandment. Our sinful tendency is to think that we can do anything we want to harm our neighbour, so long as we do not personally and physically put him to death.
This was the interpretation of the Jews, and thus they thought they were not guilty of killing Jesus. They delivered Him over to Pilate for crucifixion and considered their own hands to be clean and innocent of His blood. When Peter accused the Jewish Council of being guilty of killing Jesus (Acts 4:10), they respond by saying, “You intend to bring this man’s blood upon us” (Acts 5:28) as if they were innocent and the Gentile Romans were the guilty ones, even though it was the Jews that compelled Pilate against his own will to kill Jesus.
So also, David thought he was innocent of the blood of Uriah the Hittite when he had Uriah put to death by the hands of the Ammonites. David had committed adultery with Uriah’s wife Bathsheba, and to cover up his sin he put Uriah at the forefront of the hardest fighting where the enemy had their most valiant fighters. Then David had the rest of the soldiers pull back from Uriah so that he was struck down dead by the enemy. Somehow David thought he was innocent of Uriah’s death because his own hand had not struck the killing blow.
What Pharisaic holiness! It dismisses the heart full of anger, hate, and envy, of hidden and evil schemes of murder. It dismisses the indifference the heart has to the needs of neighbours, as if we can do anything we want to our neighbour as long as we don’t personally take his life. As if we can be angry and unforgiving towards our brother, insult him, hold a grudge, and betray him to be killed as long as we do not strike him dead ourselves.
Jesus teaches us the true meaning of the Fifth Commandment when He says, “I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire.” God’s Law demands to be kept not just outwardly, but also inwardly, in the heart. We are not to break God’s Commandments in thought, word, or deed. Insulting our brother makes us as guilty in God’s eyes as if we had murdered him.
Even failing to help our neighbour in need is breaking the Fifth Commandment. Luther explains this in the Large Catechism, . Therefore God rightly calls all persons murderers who do not offer counsel and aid to men in need and in peril of body and life [LC I.V. 190 – 191].”
Jesus also teaches us the true meaning of the Sixth Commandment when He says, “I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” This Commandment also is not only about the course outward deed of adultery, but it is also about the heart, the eyes, and the mouth – sinful lust, looking, and speaking. This Commandment is not just broken when you fornicate, but it is broken when you don’t love and honour your spouse as you should, when you speak poorly of him to your friends, or when you selfishly neglect her needs. This Commandment is broken when you are unsatisfied with your spouse and look at or think of someone else in the way you should only look at and think of your spouse.
Jesus teaches us the true meaning of these Commandments so that we would not be proud and flatter ourselves by considering that we have fulfilled them. He wants to lead us to repentance, so that turning away from our sins, we would receive forgiveness.
He shows this when He says, “If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.” Here Jesus is saying that if you are about to do the best good work you can do, of giving God an offering, of sacrificing or giving up something He has given to you, God wants no part of it unless you are first reconciled to your brother. If you intend to serve God while you have unrepentant sin in your life, Jesus says, “Stop! Lay it down right now, drop everything, and go be reconciled with your brother first.” Repent of your sins or God will accept nothing from your hand.
It is an unchristian attitude that is hateful and bears a grudge. It is an unchristian attitude that refuses to repent and refuses to be reconciled.
Jesus sets the example for us in bearing the hatred and grudges of the world and still desiring nothing except our good. It was, after all, our sins that killed Jesus. We are guilty of murder here, too. Do not respond with saying, “You intend to bring this man’s blood upon us” as if you are not guilty of murdering Jesus just because your hands did not do the whipping, nailing, and piercing. We are guilty. Jesus died because of our sins. Yet the very One we are guilty of murdering gladly took our sins. He was pierced for our sins. He was crushed for our sins. He voluntarily died for our sins.
See how Jesus fulfilled the Fifth Commandment? Jesus helped you in your physical need. To prevent your eternal death because of your sins, He Himself died. To prevent your eternal suffering and death He instead suffered and died in your place. As He was crucified by you and your sins, Jesus did not get angry with you or insult you or bear a grudge against you. He prayed for you. He said, “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do [Lk. 23:34].”
The suffering and death of Jesus on your behalf is why you are forgiven. Your failures to keep the Fifth, Sixth, and every other Commandment were put on Jesus. The very piercing and crushing of Jesus is what brings you peace and heals you.
Jesus teaches us the true meaning of the Commandments so that we would not be proud and flatter ourselves by considering that we have fulfilled them. He wants to lead us to repentance, so that turning away from our sins, we would receive forgiveness.
God’s forgiveness is what enables you to repent of your sins and to be reconciled to your brother. You are forgiven, so turn away from your sins. You are forgiven by God, so forgive your brother. You are forgiven, so you have God’s promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Jesus died for your sins, so your sins have been taken away from you, and you are forgiven. Amen.
The peace of God which surpasses all understanding will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. [i]

In partnership with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the Small Business Retail Lease has been developed to simplify complex and time-consuming procedures associated with commercial properties and give the opportunity to independents to fill vacant high street space.
The lease has been authored by Nick Darby of the SNR Denton UK LLP Charitable Trust.
Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the BRC, said:  our lease removes.
“Shockingly, more than 11% of town centre properties are currently standing vacant. As well as assisting individual retailers, this new lease will make it quicker and easier to get those empty units back into use, preventing them acting as a drag on the performance of an entire area.”
Paul Bagust, associate director, professional groups and forums, RICS, said: "In simplifying the leasing process for landlords and small business tenants, we hope to support small to medium-sized enterprises.”

There’s no point in prolonging the process and wasting time and money if the owner and technician are not on the same page. So, one should ask some questions to ensure that the technician understands them. More importantly, the technician should also understand the problem before anyone drops off the computer or let a professional visit one’s home.
The second thing to consider about a toronto computer repair service is whether it can offer a price for standard upfront services. Most repair companies charge set fees for things such as virus removal, reloading software, adding software, and may charge extra for an on-service call. While a toronto computer repair service may charge extra fees for specific works, it should estimate the cost before starting. A trustworthy toronto computer repair service would clarify that it will not charge any additional cost if the owner did not approve it before starting the work. To receive further information please go to Infotechcomputers
One should provide a contact number if a repair service finds other computer problems that need attention. Finally, one should research well before choosing any toronto computer repair service. Read reviews to find out what others have to say about a company. An easy way to do this is by reading feedbacks online. If a toronto computer repair service has been operating for some time, anyone can find it on the Internet.This will be Audi's answer to the BMW X4 and Mercedes GLC Coupe.
Spy shots have already shown that the Audi Q5 is getting a facelift to keep the popular crossover looking fresh in the highly competitive crossover segment. But back in March, Audi announced it will be expanding the Q5 range with a new Sportback version as part of the upcoming facelift.
Now, our spies have caught an Audi Q5 Sportback prototype undergoing testing, providing a first look at Audi's answer to the BMW X4 and Mercedes GLC Coupe. This will be the fourth coupe crossover in Audi's lineup that prioritizes style over practicality following the Q3 Sportback, the e-tron Sportback, and the stunning Q8.
Like the regular Q5 facelift, the exterior has been updated with new LED headlights and taillights, a narrower grille, and tweaks to the front and rear bumpers, mirroring changes applied to the Audi A4 facelift. A lower ride height and a sloping roofline make the Q5 Sportback look more stylish than its standard sibling, but this means some of the cargo space will inevitably be sacrificed.
We weren't sent any photos of the interior, but the Audi Q5 Sportback will feature a larger 10.1-inch infotainment screen and Audi's new MMI touch software as part of the upgrades that will be offered in the Q5 facelift.
Audi hasn't announced any technical details for the Q5 facelift yet, but we're expecting the engine options to carry over from the current model. In the US, these include a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine rated at 252 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission.
A plug-in hybrid version of the Audi Q5 was also introduced for the 2020 model year, which pairs a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor. Combined, this setup generates 367 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 2021 Audi Q5 is expected to debut in the second half of 2020, so the more stylish Audi Q5 Sportback could potentially break cover by the end of the year.

There are no reviews yet.THE WICKLOW SENIOR footballers are on the hunt for a new manager following John Evans’ departure after two years in charge.
The Kerry native, and former Tipperary and Roscommon boss, has not sought to extend his stay with the Leinster county; with Wicklow GAA tweeting this morning:
“John Evans has completed his two-year term as Wicklow Senior Football Manager and will not be seeking another term. County Chairman Martin Fitzgerald has expressed his thanks to John on behalf of Wicklow GAA and wished him the very best for the future.”
In a longer statement from the Garden county, Evans himself wrote:
“Having completed my two-year term as Wicklow Senior Football Manager, I will not be putting my name forward and seeking another term.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Management team, players, Clubs, all Wicklow Media and the County Board for their support in these challenging times. I wish one and all in Wicklow GAA the very best going forward.
Evans will be best remembered for steering Wicklow to a famous Leinster SFC preliminary win last year — their first provincial victory since 2013 — where they beat Offaly in extra-time in Portlaoise.
A quarter-final meeting with Dublin followed with calls for the game to be played in Aughrim, but O’Moore Park again played host to the fixture as they were defeated.

They bowed out of the All-Ireland SFC qualifiers after a round-one loss to Cavan.
This summer, Wicklow ran Kildare to two points in the Leinster SFC preliminary round and again exited the All-Ireland championship after another narrow defeat to fellow Division 4 side Leitrim.
“Wicklow GAA wish to sincerely thank John Evans for his hard work, dedication and commitment over the past two years as Wicklow Senior Football Manager,” the statement concluded.
John and his management team have brought great professionalism and huge enthusiasm to their roles and have worked tirelessly for the greater good and development of Wicklow.
“County Chairman Martin Fitzgerald has expressed his thanks to John on behalf of Wicklow GAA and wished him the very best for the future.”

PAKLAKI HARRIET } APPLICANTS 2. NORBERT ADYERA } And 1. WATOTO CHILD CARE MINISTRIES } JUDGMENT CREDITOR 2. ODOCH BOSCO OLAK } JUDGMENT DEBTOR Heard: 12 February 2019 Delivered: 28 February 2019 Summary: release of a chattel from attachment in execution. ______________________________________________________________________ RULING ______________________________________________________________________ STEPHEN MUBIRU, J. Introduction: [1] This is an objector application for setting aside an order of attachment and sale of motor vehicle, Isuzu Giga registration Number UAN 486 P. It is made under the provisions of Order 22 rules 55 and 56, and Order 52 rules 1, 2 and 3 of The Civil Procedure Rules. The applicants contend that the property in issue is not subject to attachment in so far as it is not the property of the judgment debtor but rather that of the applicants, having purchased it jointly from the judgment debtor 2 on 4th December 2016. It is claimed that at the time of the attachment, the applicants were in full and exclusive possession of the truck. [2] The background to the application is that the judgment creditor sued the judgment debtor and the decision was in favour of the former against the latter. In a bid to recover the decretal sum of shs. 466,200,000/=, the judgment creditor applied for execution of the decree by way of attachment and sale of the judgment debtor's motor vehicle Isuzu Giga registration Number UAN 486 P. The proposed sale of the truck was advertised by way of a notice published in the Rupiny Newspaper of 14th to 20th December, 2016 whereupon the applicants on 22nd December, 2015 secured an interim order of stay of execution pending the disposal of this application. The truck has henceforth to-date been in custody of Gulu Central Police Station. [3] The background to the application is that the applicant is one of the lecturers at the respondent university. On 25th March, 2011 he was admitted to the respondent's programme of study by thesis, leading to the award of a Doctorate of Philosophy in Epidemiology. His topic, "The Epidemiology of Pyomyositis in relation to HIV infection Status," was approved and two supervisors were assigned to him. On 15th April, 2014 he submitted his research findings to the respondent's Institute of Graduate Studies and Staff Development whereupon it was rated as a pass by a team of three examiners. On 5th March, 2015 he defended his thesis before a panel of five examiners and it was rated as a pass with significant corrections. [4] The hearing proceeded ex-parte since none of the respondents was in court on the day the application came up for hearing on 14th March, 2014 yet they had been served and a return of service filed in court. 3 The applicant's arguments: [5] In support of the application, Counsel for the applicants, submitted that the applicants are bona fide purchasers and owners of the said truck since at the time of purchase they were not aware of the underlying court proceedings against the seller. Odoch Bosco Olok. At the time of attachment (11th December, 2016) was in their possession and control. They paid a total price of shs. 50,000,000/= for the truck in three instalments of shs. 20,000,000/= on 16th October, 2016; shs. 20,000,000/= on 16th November, 2016, and shs. 10,000,000/= on 4th December, 2016. It was therefore not available for attachment and it should be released from attachment. General principles: [6] Under section 44 of The Civil Procedure Act, property liable to attachment and sale in execution of decree includes land belonging to the judgment debtor, whether it is held in the name of the judgment debtor or by another person in trust for him or her or on his or her behalf. In the instant case, it is contended by the applicants that by reason of the transaction of purchase that took place a week or so before the warrant of attachment was issued, the property in question no longer belonged to the judgment debtor and as such it was not available for attachment in execution of the decree issued against him. [7] In order to succeed, the applicants as objectors must prove that at the time of the attachment; (1) they had some interest in the property attached, (2) the property attached was in their possession, (3) they were holding possession of the attached property on their own account and not on account of the Judgment debtor, and / or (4) that the property was not in possession of the Judgment debtor or some person in trust for her; or (5) that the property was not in occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to the Judgment debtor; or finally (6) that although being in the possession of the Judgment debtor at such time, it was so in the possession of the judgment debtor not on the judgment 4 debtor's own account or as the judgment debtor's own property. The crucial consideration therefore in applications of this nature is one of possession of the property at the time of the attachment. [8] If the Objector was in possession, or if some other person was in possession on account of the Objector, then the property should be released from attachment (see Haria and Co. v. Buganda Industries Ltd. [1960] EA 318; Joseph Mulenga v. FIBA (U) Ltd, H. C. Miscellaneous Application No. 308 of 1996; and Betty Namugenyi v. Daisen Co Ltd and another and Forward International Co Ltd (Objector) H.C Miscellaneous Application No. 522 of 2005). A determination of possession not ownership. [9] It is apparent from the facts of this case that the ownership of this property is contested. The respondents claim that the sale was fraudulent. In determining whether or not a transfer in these circumstances was fraudulent consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether: (i) the transfer was to an insider; (ii) the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer; (iii) the transfer was disclosed or concealed; (iv) before the transfer was made, the debtor had been sued or threatened with a suit; (v) the transfer was of substantially all the debtor's assets or essential assets of the business; (vi) the debtor absconded; (vii) the debtor removed or concealed other assets; (viii) the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred; (ix) the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made; (x) the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a warrant of attachment was issued; and (xi) the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lien who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor. A typical fraudulent transfer involves a judgment debtor that transfers personal or business property into the name of his or her spouse, parent, child or other family member. There should be evidence of apparent lack of arms length dealing. 5 [10] Although the sale a week before the attachment is suspicious, there is no evidence before me to show that the applicants had any knowledge of the decree passed against the seller at the time of the transaction. There is nothing to show that this was not an arm's length transaction. Moreover, a decision in an objector application is not a decision as to title to the property in dispute or a declaration as to the rightful owner thereof. [11] Where an objector application is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute (see Order 22 rule 60 of The Civil Procedure Rules). Objector proceedings are all about possession while questions of tile will be settled in a separate suit by the judgment creditor against the successful objector. At the end of the objector proceedings, the party interested in proving title must sue in order to determine the issue of title to the property as the order made under the rule is only provisional (see Uganda Mineral Waters Ltd v. Amin Pirain and another [1994-5] HCB 87). [12] Having evaluated the material before me and carefully considered the submissions of counsel for the applicants, I find that the applicants have proved that at the time of attachment, (a) they had interest in the property attached as purchasers of the truck; (b) the property attached was in their physical possession and control; (c) the applicants were holding possession of the attached property on their own account and not on account of the Judgment debtor; and finally (d) the property was not in possession of the Judgment debtor or some person in trust for him. [13] The applicants had actual physical possession and exercised control over the truck in the assumed character of owners and had exercised peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership thereof, without evidence of prior knowledge of the proceedings between the judgment debtor and judgment creditor. 6 Order : [14] It is for those reasons that I set aside the order of attachment and sale of the truck, with costs to the applicants. It is ordered that the truck be released from attachment forthwith. _____________________________ Stephen Mubiru Resident Judge, Gulu Appearances: For the applicants : Mr. Doi Patrick.

Susannah Clapp, The GuardianTatts Group will be forced to hand back $540 million (plus interest and costs) to the Victorian government after the High Court ruled in favour of the appeal. The decision brings an end to the four-year saga as the ruling found Tatts was not entitled to the payment. Consequently, fellow gaming group Tabcorp lost its appeal for $687 million in compensation. The case:
- Tabcorp and Tatts were handed 18-year licenses by the Kennett Coalition governement in 1994;
- In 2008 the Labor Brumby government imposed that 27,500 pokies were to be the responsibility of venue operators, as opposed to Tatts and Tabcorp;
- Legislation was issued which stated that the government was not liable for compensation to the groups;
- The matter was taken to court and Tatts were successful in there argument while Tabcorp was not;
- The Victorian Government appealed the case to the High Court and subsequently the original decision was voided.
At Tatts’ half year results 2016 (before the decision had been overruled), the proceedings from the case were recorded as a current liability labelled unearned income. We expect Tatts to advise the market as to whether this amount will be paid out of cash or funded via additional debt. This will most likely increase the net debt to EBITDA ratio but consolidated liabilities should remain unchanged. As for Tabcorp, all legal costs relating to their case have been recognised in previous periods and will not effect full year earnings for 2016. From an operational point of view, Tatts’ approach to the structural change within the gaming industry has paid off as growth in the lotteries business was derived from new products and increased online penetration. However, Wagering continues to perform poorly which is surprising given the Ubet re-brand and increased investment. This could suggest that competitive pressures are affecting the group as more private betting agencies flood the digital market. As a result of the high court decision, a potential merger between the two gaming groups is back on the radar. The combined group would create a $9 billion gaming and lotteries giant and given the recent slump in share price it is likely that investors are quietly pushing for renewed talks. This speculation suggests Tatts could possibly merge with Tabcorp and spin of the wagering segment altogether which leaves some uncertainty surrounding the group’s future.30X45 House Plan image above is part of the post in 30X45 House Plan gallery.

30X45 House Plan GalleryIn 2006, Chrysler revealed its intentions to capture on Europe’s supermini elite with the Dodge Hornet
No longer too long ago, we discovered ourselves talking in regards to the outlandish sage of the Tritec engine. It changed into once a $500 million Brazil-basically based totally mostly joint mission between Rover and Chrysler, however the veteran ended up leaving the desk before the first engines left the production line in Curitiba. Broken-down Rover owners BMW took over that stake in the endeavour, backing away in 2007 and deciding that its 2d-generation Mini would in its put exercise ‘Prince’ engines made through a brand fresh partnership with PSA. Within the course of a monetary disaster, Chrysler then offloaded Tritec to Fiat.
By that time, the comparatively used-fashioned however strong inline-four engines had made their formulation into a few Chrysler products along side the Neon and the PT Cruiser. The supercharged model changed into once easiest extinct in a production setting by the BMW-owned Mini save throughout the Cooper S. We possess to stay that ‘production’ qualifier in there as Chrysler did deploy it for an conception – the 2006 Dodge Hornet.
Reviving an used name from the AMC proper (Chrysler had acquired and discontinued the logo a decade and a half of prior), the conception that made its debut at the Geneva Motor Repeat. Funnily sufficient, a pair of stands over Mini changed into once showcasing an conception that previewed the incoming Clubman and the 2d-generation Mini hatch as a complete.
Unlike the Mini, the Hornet had no time for retro shenanigans. It had tight, boxy proportions with tiny overhangs and discreet door handles giving the 5-door hatch a sporty three-door glimpse. Sizeable, flared wheel arches housed 19-plod wheels, which even now could per chance be regarded as big for a vehicle of this dimension. Talking of, even though it changed into once intended for the ‘supermini’ B-section, it changed into once getting on for C-section width, with the aim of offering as great room internal as imaginable.
The rear doorways opened in a backwards-hinged ‘suicide’ fashion, revealing a conspicuous lack of B-pillars and an airy cabin with a flat floor coated in a tricky, honeycomb-textured rubber mat. The entrance seats had been made as skinny as imaginable with out adversely affecting comfort, further rising room for whoever also can very smartly be in the inspire.
This changed into once supposed to be a vehicle that appealed to consumers on all aspects of the Atlantic. “We put of dwelling out to set a vehicle with a uniquely American personality to lengthen the image and presence of the Dodge save in Europe and global markets, particularly in the entry-level market,” exterior dressmaker Imprint Moushegian said.
It changed into once indubitably very European in its mechanical makeup, with a transversely-mounted inline-four powering the entrance wheels exclusively. And yes, that engine changed into once a supercharged Tritec/Pentagon 1.6 (a ‘T16b4’ for you engine code geeks available), offering 170bhp and a 0-60mph time of 6.7 seconds. Adore the R53 Cooper S it shared the engine with, the Hornet had a functional bonnet scoop to give the intercooler with an abundant present of fresh air.
On the time, the respectable line changed into once: “It’s purely an conception, on the opposite hand it reveals you what the Dodge save plan in the case of future products”. A pair of years on, on the opposite hand, a production model looked seemingly. “We’re working intensely on the Hornet interrogate and I concentrate on we are able to tell one thing on this in the long amble,” Chrysler global procuring VP Thomas Hausch said in 2008.
The identical 300 and sixty five days, a file emerged suggesting Chrysler changed into once to team up with Nissan to build up the Hornet in Oppama, Japan the usage of Versa underpinnings. There changed into once correct one project: money. The monetary woes that saw Chrysler inspire a long way from Tritec rumbled on thru the following years, compounded by the Grand Recession and the loss of life of DaimlerChrysler. The historical American save could per chance now now no longer demand of to be propped up by a financially fitter partner. In April 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 financial bother.
A merger with Fiat to function Fiat Chrysler Vehicles (FCA) reopened the doable of a production Dodge Hornet going down, with focus on of a vehicle in accordance to the identical platform as the Grande Punto and the Alfa Romeo MiTo. Within the discontinue, the Hornet project morphed into the Crawl, with that massive name from Dodge’s past lowered to being slapped on the inspire of a generic-taking a gaze entrance-wheel pressure saloon in accordance to the Alfa Romeo‘s Giulietta’s platform. The usage of Fiat’s E.torQ engine, successor to the Tritec, would possess added a properly ironic sense to complaints, however in its put, the Crawl extinct a combine of FIRE and Tigershark four-pots.
15 years on from the Hornet inflicting a buzz (sorry) at Geneva, it’s taking a gaze love the name could per chance at final accumulate it to showrooms. The vehicle it’ll be extinct for (Dodge’s first all-fresh accumulate since the now eight-300 and sixty five days-used Crawl) won’t be the leisure love as inviting as that quirky, supercharged, suicide door conception proven all those years ago. Within the in the period in-between, there’s focus on of it being in accordance to the long-awaited Alfa Romeo Tonale, so yes, it’ll be a crossover. Try to behave shocked.

A hearing to resolve a procedural dispute over the rehabilitation of the Fisherman's Wharf area of Channel Islands Harbor is caught up in another delay.
Officials overseeing the county-owned harbor in Oxnard have turned to the California Coastal Commission to resolve the dispute over the planning process for a proposed apartment and commercial development. Early this week, though, Harbor Director Lyn Krieger pulled the item from the commission's meeting Thursday in Cambria.
Krieger said she will bring the item back to the commission in October, a monthlong delay. She estimated the procedural dispute over the county application to amend the land use has already delayed the project for almost a year.
At issue now is whether Oxnard city officials will stop maintaining landscaped portions of parkland within the harbor area unless a new agreement is negotiated and signed by the end of December.
Alternatively, if negotiations over the agreement break down before November, the city would stop maintaining the properties with 60 days' notice, Oxnard officials said Tuesday in a report to the City Council.
Commission staff members have eight times deemed the county application for a change to a harbor plan incomplete. The officials say the plan amendment for the development should not be processed before the county gets formal buy-in from Oxnard through its local coastal plan.
Krieger says only the commission can make the call on whether the amendment is consistent with Oxnard's coastal plan, given that the county plan for the harbor was certified first. Both state law and regulations make that clear, she said.
It's that question that the panel was to consider Thursday, but that now is scheduled to be heard in mid-October in Chula Vista.
Buy-in from Oxnard is not the only issue being raised by commission staff members.
They have also called for a deeper discussion of options that would provide more public and commercial uses along the waterfront and public parking areas than the current development plan.
A development firm has proposed building a 390-unit, 55-foot-tall apartment complex and 37,000 square feet of retail and commercial space.
Krieger said she had to pull the item because she had no time to discuss the issues Oxnard officials are raising with the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. She only discovered recently that the report was going to the Oxnard City Council Tuesday, she said.
Questions about the city's role in the issuance of permits also need to be addressed, she said.
Oxnard Mayor Tim Flynn said a delay was advisable with so many unanswered questions on the table.
"The county knows if this goes to the Coastal Commission, the county is not in a good position," he said.If resemble a drop of water. Other highlights include Christian Boltanski’s “Les Archives du Coeur” and Teshima Yokoo House. Like in Naoshima, you can either take the local bus or rent a bicycle to get around the island.
Upon arrival on Teshima island, we caught the local bus that took us from the port to Teshima Art Museum set on a hill surrounded by terraced rice paddies. The museum, actually more like a giant concrete shelter, features two large elliptical openings in the concrete walls exposed to the elements. It is an architectural feat to have 25 cm thick walls spanning 60 meters free of columns or visible beams. It is such a quiet and breathtaking experience to sit inside the gallery and listen to the water dropping, foliage rustling, and birds chirping. On the floor is Rei Naito’s installation Matrix which includes small discs, marbles together with rainwater and dew collected through the roof of the structure. You can sit for hours in silence just watching the water droplets form and run across the uneven floor to join other droplets forming larger puddles and then being drained away thru invisible holes. Matrix was created almost a decade after Being Given at Kinza House in Naoshima. Unfortunately, no photographs were allowed inside. But regardless, you really have to be there to experience the beauty of it all and no photograph could have done it justice. Teshima Art Museum was definitely my favorite museum on both Teshima and Naoshima.
From Teshima Art Museum, we strolled for about half an hour to reach Les Archives du Coeur or the Heart Archives inside a small building on the beach. Christian Boltanski is one artist whose primary purpose in art has been to remind us of our own mortality. Visitors can come and make recordings of their heartbeat as well as listen to other people’s recorded heartbeats echoing in a dark and a bit spooky space. There are mirrors inside the main installation or Heart Room with one bare lightbulb that flickers with each amplified heartbeat. The idea here as the artist puts it is that “it’s impossible to preserve something: you can record the heartbeat of somebody, but you can’t stop them dying.” This project has been touring the world collecting heartbeats that are then stored here in the library of heartbeats in Teshima.
We decided not to record our heartbeats but did manage to find some of our friends’. After listening to some heartbeats and reflecting on the concept of mortality, we walked to nearby Karato Port to wait for the bus to take us back to Ieura Port. About 5-minute walk from Ieura Port is Teshima Yokoo House composed of three one-storey old houses that have been renovated and repurposed. Teshima Yokoo House is the collaboration between graphic designer Tadanori Yokoo and architect Yuko Nagayama with the theme of life and death. There is a tall circular tower filled with panels of waterfalls with a mirrored floor. The main structure has translucent red panels everywhere, chrome bathrooms, and a bright iridescent rock garden. In fact, the museum even offers funeral and cremation services to the community.
There are another 6 or so smaller installations on Teshima island but are only open on Saturdays and Sundays. I had wanted to see the Tom Na H-iu installation but unfortunately it was closed for renovation during our visit. Tom Na H-iu is a 15-foot Celtic monolith standing in a pond surrounded by the bamboo forest. This monolith is made of opalescent glass with LEDs inside that blinks every time the Super-Kamiokande Neutrino Observatory detects neutrinos from the death of stars.
After about 3 hours on Teshima island, we boarded the ferry that took us back to Naoshima. There is much less here than in Naoshima but just coming here to see the Teshima Art Museum is already worth the journey.
I am no connoisseur of art but I thoroughly enjoyed this short visit to Naoshima and Teshima and actually instilled in me a newfound appreciation of art, especially contemporay art, in its various forms.

FMOD Designer 4.11.00 Development
FMOD Designer 4.11.00 Development Description:
FMOD Designer was created to be a fully featured sound designer authoring tool. Combined with FMOD Ex only, it allows total control over game audio, including complex audio event behaviour, interactive music, multi layer sounds, effects, envelopes, playback randomization and more! This application is intended for use with FMOD Ex API.
This easy to use and flexible sound designer tool allows simple or complex multi-layer/effect/envelope based sound events to be modeled and created by the sound designer. The capabilities would include such things as layering, effects, random behaviour, and stitching of sounds.
The aim is for a sound designer to totally design the in game audio from an external tool, and simply supply the programmer with assets and an event list to implement. If the audio behaviour needs to be changed within the game, it should be up to the sound designer not the programmer to do this.
The layering screen allows for complex audio models (such as a car engine with multiple cross fading channels, sounds and effects) to be totally controlled by the author, then all the programmer has to do is call the previously defined set of simple commands, such as SendEvent and UpdateParameter. In the car model cast, the 'parameter' in UpdateParameter might just be 'revs' or 'torque' or some other English type value, rather than a value defined by a programmer.
FMOD Designer 4.11.00 Development Features:
· Allows the Sound Designer to control audio behavior - not the programmer
· Create realistic aural environments without programming knowledge
· Preview and modify audio events on the target hardware using an audition network

3 Top Stocks to Invest In for Superb Earnings Acceleration
Earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Thus, constant earnings growth captivates almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. However, earnings acceleration works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that most successful stocks had seen an acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.
Earnings acceleration, in fact, is the incremental growth in a company’s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.

At the outset of the pandemic, government agencies and health authorities scrambled to inform people on how to identify symptoms of the virus.
But as the virus has evolved, it seems the most common symptoms have changed too.
Emerging data suggest people infected with the Delta variant - the variant behind most of Australia's current cases and highly prevalent around the world - are experiencing symptoms different to those we commonly associated with COVID earlier in the pandemic.
We're all different
Humans are dynamic. With our differences come different immune systems. This means the same virus can produce different signs and symptoms in different ways.
A sign is something that's seen, such as a rash. A symptom is something that's felt, like a sore throat.
The way a virus causes illness is dependent on two key factors:
viral factors include things like speed of replication, modes of transmission, and so on. Viral factors change as the virus evolves.
host factors are specific to the individual. Age, gender, medications, diet, exercise, health and stress can all affect host factors.
So when we talk about the signs and symptoms of a virus, we're referring to what is most common. To ascertain this, we have to collect information from individual cases.
It's important to note this data is not always easy to collect or analyze to ensure there's no bias. For example, older people may have different symptoms to younger people, and collecting data from patients in a hospital may be different to patients at a GP clinic.
So what are the common signs and symptoms of the Delta variant?
Using a self-reporting system through a mobile app, data from the United Kingdom suggest the most common COVID symptoms may have changed from those we traditionally associated with the virus.
The reports don't take into account which COVID variant participants are infected with. But given Delta is predominating in the UK at present, it's a safe bet the symptoms we see here reflect the Delta variant.
(The Conversation/CC BY ND)
While fever and cough have always been common COVID symptoms, and headache and sore throat have traditionally presented for some people, a runny nose was rarely reported in earlier data. Meanwhile, loss of smell, which was originally quite common, now ranks ninth.
There are a few reasons we could be seeing the symptoms evolving in this way. It may be because data were originally coming mainly from patients presenting to hospital who were therefore likely to be sicker. And given the higher rates of vaccination coverage in older age groups, younger people are now accounting for a greater proportion of COVID cases, and they tend to experience milder symptoms.
It could also be because of the evolution of the virus, and the different characteristics (viral factors) of the Delta variant. But why exactly symptoms could be changing remains uncertain.
While we still have more to learn about the Delta variant, this emerging data is important because it shows us that what we might think of as just a mild winter cold - a runny nose and a sore throat - could be a case of COVID-19.
This data highlight the power of public science. At the same time, we need to remember the results haven't yet been fully analysed or stratified. That is, "host factors" such as age, gender, other illnesses, medications and so on haven't been accounted for, as they would in a rigorous clinical trial.
And as is the case with all self-reported data, we have to acknowledge there may be some flaws in the results.
Does vaccination affect the symptoms?
Although new viral variants can compromise the effectiveness of vaccines, for Delta, the vaccines available in Australia (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) still appear to offer good protection against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses.
Importantly, both vaccines have been shown to offer greater than 90 percent protection from severe disease requiring hospital treatment.
A recent "superspreader" event in New South Wales highlighted the importance of vaccination. Of 30 people who attended this birthday party, reports indicated none of the 24 people who became infected with the Delta variant had been vaccinated. The six vaccinated people at the party did not contract COVID-19.
In some cases infection may still possible after vaccination, but it's highly likely the viral load will be lower and symptoms much milder than they would without vaccination.
We all have a role to play
Evidence indicating Delta is more infectious compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of the virus is building.
It's important to understand the environment is also changing. People have become more complacent with social distancing, seasons change, vaccination rates vary - all these factors affect the data.
But scientists are becoming more confident the Delta variant represents a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain.
As we face another COVID battle in Australia we're reminded the war against COVID is not over and we all have a role to play. Get tested if you have any symptoms, even if it's "just a sniffle". Get vaccinated as soon as you can and follow public health advice.

Martin Memorial Auctioneer Scholarship recipient. Henderson was chosen from a talented pool of applicants seeking to gain their Mississippi auctioneer license. Henderson will be attending Nashville Auctioneers School in Tullahoma, Tenn. on a full tuition paid scholarship. Upon completion of the required auction class hours, Henderson will be able to register to take the Mississippi auctioneer’s licensing exam. Nashville Auction School has been training auctioneers from across the world for more than 50 years with innovative classes, state-of-the-art technologies, and some of the most qualified instructors in the industry. Many of Mississippi’s most successful auctioneers are alumnus of Nashville Auction School.
Henderson is currently seeking his Bachelor of Science degree in business and education and is expected to complete his degree later this summer.
MAA established a scholarship in 2016 to encourage qualified individuals to become successful auctioneers in an effort to ensure the integrity of the auction industry. This year’s scholarship was made possible by donations from members of the MAA and particularly by the donation of Jeff Martin Auctioneers of Brooklyn, MS. Jeff Martin established the George W. Martin Memorial Auctioneer Scholarship in memory of his father, George W. Martin, who was a successful auctioneer for more than 40 years as well as a distinguished member of the auction community.
“George loved the auction industry and always provided young auctioneers the time to help them in any way,”said Jeff Martin, President/CEO of Jeff Martin Auctioneers, Inc. “George believed in helping others. This scholarship was established in order to allow young adults the opportunity to attend auction school and to carry on George’s tradition of helping others.”
Applications for the George W. Martin Memorial Auctioneer Scholarship are available through the Mississippi Auctioneers Association’s website at. Deadline for applications is December 1.I mention my writers’ group a lot on this blog. My husband is really supportive of my writing. So are my family and friends. I’m lucky. They all ask about what I’m working on and genuinely care. When I wax too lyrical about the nuts and bolts of plotting, pacing, or marketing, they do their best to hang in there, but no one really appreciates the nitty gritty of a job like the people who are doing it. If a group of teachers get together, they talk teaching. Nurses talk about nursing. And writers…well, we talk about writing. Getting together with my group, twice a month, is a chance to talk about craft, frustrations, and news.
The other place I enjoy talking with fellow writers is on twitter (@judypost). Twitter has writers of every genre and every level of success. It has people who specialize in marketing and the business side of writing. It has bloggers who list reviews. It’s a nice place to meet new people and keep my finger on the pulse of what’s happening. And it has experts who share their advice.
If you’re not on twitter, you should be. If you are on twitter, be warned–it can become habit forming. I have to limit my time there so that I actually WRITE, not just talk about writing.
Every once in a while, I list links where I find really good information on writing or marketing. I’ve found all of these because of twitter. I think they’re good, so I thought I’d share them with you.
For marketing, I think it’s hard to beat Lindsay Buroker. Her advice is practical and straightforward.
I also recommend Rachel Thompson’s tweets and links:
For writing techniques, I’ve enjoyed K.M. Weiland’s posts:
and on character reactions:
I also like Chuck Wendig’s blog–but he can be a bit irreverent and may swear occasionally––(probably why I like him:)
Someone on twitter sent me the link to Jim Butcher’s blogs on scene & sequence. Both good:
This blog post is mostly about sharing with you. I’ve enjoyed these, hope you do, too. Happy writing!
2 thoughts on “Listening to other writers”
Thanks so much for linking to my posts! I’m glad you enjoyed them.
I don’t just enjoy them. I recommend them. judges in America found the time, and had the inclination, to write poetry. A good deal of it was about the law-clients, cases, trials-even law books-and the affairs of the day. Other poems address timeless themes such as nature, faith and illness. Some were meant to be humorous. Edited by Michael H. Hoeflich, an expert on 19th century American legal practice, this collection, which includes poems by President John Quincy Adams and Supreme Court Justices Joseph Story and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and a few laymen with an interest in law, offers a window into life in 19th century America as reflected in the practice of law, which by its very nature is entwined in so many stages of life. Includes poetry by John Quincy Adams, David Barker, Irving Browne, William Allen Butler, Francis Dana, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Sidney Lanier, John Pierpont, George D. Prentice, John Godfrey Saxes, Joseph Story, William Wetmore Story, Eugene Fitch Ware, and many others. MICHAEL H. HOEFLICH is the John H. & John M. Kane Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Kansas School of Law.

It must be a lonely life. Slide6: Joshua: The lonely life is not for me. Besides, I'm supposed to be founding a legacy here, even if it is just a peasant legacy. I need a wife. And since Her Majesty was kind enough to provide a wishing well, I'm going to use it. Slide7: Joshua: Oh, wow! This wishing well is amazing! I totally found the woman of my dreams! Being married to the queen would be waaay too much responsibility. Here is a woman after my own heart. And she's a peasant, just like me. Author's Note: I just about choked when I saw who he got on the first try! This game read my mind. Slide8: Joshua: Will you marry me? Jasmine: Sure! Sounds fun! Joshua: I'm the luckiest man in the world! Slide9: Joshua: Your Majesty, may I introduce my fiancee, Jasmine. “How do you do? I'm pleased you're joining the playable fold, Jasmine. So, when is the happy occasion? Jasmine: How about right now? I've got nothing better to do. “You're so romantic.” Slide10: Jasmine: Wow! I had no idea you were so rich, Joshua! Joshua: I'm not rich. I don't even have $20,000 left to build our house. Jasmine: Well, when you only have $14 to your name, pretty much anything is rich. “I like your attitude, Jasmine. You'll do well with Joshua.” Slide11: Joshua: Speaking of money, let's make some. We can busk for a while, since we'll both need the creativity points for our career. Jasmine: Already got the creativity handled, honey, but tips are nice. Slide12: Jasmine: In fact, why don't we just study the skills we need, and once we've got the minimum requirements to top our career, we can go and have some fun. Joshua: Sounds great. It will let us start out higher, and we can top the career much sooner. I can't wait to be perma-plat. Jasmine: I want to have 100 first dates, and we don't have that many people in town. I'll probably never be perma-plat. Slide13: Jasmine: I'll just have to keep my aspiration score up the old fashioned way. Slide14: Jasmine: Well, look at that. There are two openings at level 6 in Slacker. Perfect for both of us. I don't like skilling, but we have enough for this career. Now we're done, and we never have to skill again. We just need to make friends, and go to work in a good mood, and we'll be professional party guests in no time. Slide15: Joshua: As long as we're here, let's enjoy the hot tub, and make some friends! Slide16: Jasmine: I prefer gaming, thanks. It's one of my favorite hobbies. Slide17: “I don't know about you guys, but I've had quite enough of the hot tub for now. I guess four lightning rods on the palace roof just weren't enough.” Joshua: Wow! I'm so glad I got out just when I did. Gordon: He sure was lucky he didn't get struck by lighting. Vesuvius: Yeah. That was so evil of him to leave it to the Queen to get hit, instead. Slide18: Joshua: I was hoping to have a bit more money to start with, but we can earn a few hundred writing an article or two. Jasmine: OK, but just one each, please. There are more fun things to do around here. Slide19: Jasmine: See? Isn't this way more fun? Joshua: You're right! In fact, now I know what sort of family business to start up! Slide20: Joshua: What do you think, honey? We have our own fishing pond! We can sell tickets to all the neighbors, and they can fish in our pond, and enjoy the great outdoors. Meanwhile, we're saving a fortune on building, until we can make a bit more from our jobs. And, this is a great way to build up our friendship network, to get those last four promotions. Slide21: Jasmine: I know it doesn't look like much right now, but I assure you, it's really fun! Joshua: Hey, Clovis, congratulations on winning the challenge. I think you're a much better king than I would have been. And thank Boolprop it wasn't Groop, right? Slide22: Joshua: By the way, congratulations on woohooing the Queen, and on your son. I'm sure he'll do you proud. Clovis: Thanks. Nice place you have here, if you're into roughing it. Do you think you'll be sprucing it up later? Joshua: Sure, eventually. But it's summer, you know? No sense building for the winter until the winter comes. Slide23: Jasmine: Joshua may not worry about the winter until the winter comes, but I'm all for stocking up the larder now, before the freeze makes it impossible. And we can sell the surplus later, too. Author's Note: In the background, you can see the ship, in which I magically summoned in all my “Townies,” to populate the land, in the first place. Unfortunately, it crashed, which is how I lost so many of them. The cemetery is next to it, but I haven't decorated it, or anything, so it looks like a blank lot. Someday, I'll open them both up to the public. Slide24: Joshua: The trick to building a business that requires little maintenance is to price the tickets really cheap. So cheap! Sure, there isn't really that much to do, but for the money, the customers are happy, and we don't even have to waste time selling. Slide25: Jasmine: We made money, even while we were away. And I got a promotion! Slide26: Vesuvius: This outdoor shower is so evil. It makes puddles for neat sims like me to clean up. Ha! If Joshua and Jasmine thought they could enjoy mopping the puddles, then it's just too bad, because I beat them to it. What a fun place. Joshua: Hahaha! Neither of us are even remotely neat. How do you think the puddle got there, in the first place? Thanks, Vis! Slide27: Joshua: Jasmine, I'm glad you got a promotion, but I really need it more than you do. Will you go on a date with me to boost my aspiration before work? Jasmine: Sure thing, lover. There's no way I'm going to be perma-plat, so anything to boost my aspiration, I'm all for it. I love dates. Slide28: Groop: GRAWWWWR! I can't believe that Joshua got to woohoo before Groop! And in public, yet! Now Groop must do what Groop does best. “You know, Groop, you still don't have your swords.” Groop: Now Groop must kick over the garbage can. Slide29: Joshua: It worked! I got a promotion, so both Jasmine and I are home video editors, and we have a few days off to focus on our customers and grow the business, before we go in for our next shift. Slide30: Neptunium: What a fun place this is! Let's boost it to level 2. Joshua: Thanks! I love these cash rewards. If we can get it to level 5 before winter, we'll be able to pay taxes, and still afford a lovely house. Slide31: “Let me teach you all how to do Tai Chi.” Jasmine: Thanks, Your Majesty. And thanks, too, for boosting us to level 3. That bonus really helps. Look! I bought a bubble blower, to give you more fun things to enjoy. Slide32: Joshua: The money is coming in, from bonuses, and the trickle from cheap tickets, and now we're both off to work with platinum moods. We should get promoted today. Slide33: Joshua: Jasmine, what you did with the bunny rabbits stock footage was AMAZING! Jasmine: I know! The boss told me he didn't need any of his stuff, anymore, and wrote me a check for his entire net worth, and then went off to live in the woods, with all the bunnies. We're rich! Joshua: And we can walk to work for another shift tonight, too! Slide34: Joshua: So close! So close! One level away from my dream, but we don't work again until next Tuesday. Jasmine: Just enjoy the weekend, dear, and we'll build up our business some more. I want a house before winter sets in, you know. Walter: How in the world did I manage to earn money just by buying tickets here? Slide35: Jasmine: Come and get it, everyone! Eat up, chat up, and make friends and customer stars. Clovis: Did you notice that the Queen has built a little hall at the Crash Zone? She's not sure, yet, if it should be a memorial museum, or a clubhouse, or just a store, so it's not open to the public, yet. It does add to the landscape, though, doesn't it? Walter: Yes, very nice. Slide36: Joshua: Finally, we have level 4! With that bonus, and the bonus you got from work, Jasmine, we can really build a good house now. Slide37: Jasmine: Alright. We have a nice playground for the kids we'll have someday, and a greenhouse, so we can grow delicious produce to sell, even through the winter. And it's not very many solar panels, but it should be enough to help lower the bills, at least. Slide38: Jasmine: If we garden and craft items through the winter, then in the spring, we'll be able to sell the things we've produced, in our show room. Right now, though, the customers are just using it as a dance floor. Slide39: Jasmine: And although the port-a-potty is fine for outside, the cold weather demands a better bathroom. This one is inside, and has two stalls, two sinks, and two showers. Slide40: Jasmine: I hope the customers like our “club house,” with a big screen TV, a good stereo, and a nice kitchen and dining area. Slide41: Joshua: I know I'm going to love working in the greenhouse. I've maxed my Nature enthusiasm, so I'll always be in The Zone when I'm gardening. Slide42: Jasmine: And upstairs we have a big living room, without much furniture, yet, and a craft room, where Joshua can sew his projects, I can work on flowers and clay pots, and both of us can work on paintings. Then there are the bedrooms. The purple is the master suite, the turquoise is the nursery, and the orange is the bedroom for the kids, when they grow up a bit. If we have more than two kids, we'll convert the nursery to a bedroom, but I think it will be fine as it is for a good long while. Slide43: Joshua: It's our last day, and winter has finally set in. Time to get this garden going, so we'll have some good food in the spring. Slide44: Jasmine: I'll make sandwiches for our guests. We only need a few more stars to get level 5, and that final cash bonus for our business. Slide45: Joshua: YES! We were so lucky to get that last bonus in time, because we spent a bit too much building this house, and would not have had enough to pay the taxes today. Speaking of which, according to my math, we are worth $204,304, and at 5% for us peasants, rounded up to the nearest hundred, our taxes are $10,300. WHEW! That's just over one percent of a university. And we have to make at least that much every week to keep up our tax payments. Slide46: Jasmine: We have to pay HOW MUCH every week in taxes? Alright, Joshua. I know we're both slackers, but we need to make sure we have a good harvest, or we won't be able to keep up. Time to get to work in the garden. “And that is how we leave the Hunter family this week. They had quite a good week, and have set a high bar for the other families to follow. Next week, we'll see if Groop has as good luck.” Slide47: Clovis: Michelle! I don't believe you! You set out those laws, and then the very first round, you let Joshua break them. If you let him get away with it, none of your subjects will have any respect for you! “Wait, what? What did he do?” Clovis: He opened a venue! Peasants aren't allowed. It was right there in your first proclamation. Don't you remember? Slide48: “Oops. Just because I forgot the rule doesn't mean HE can.” Clovis: So, how are you going to deal with this? “Obviously, he must be punished. Heheheheh.” Clovis: Oh, this will be fun! Do I get to help? “Sure! I thought I'd have to wait weeks before I'd be able to dispense some discipline. So, what to do?” Slide49: “I already have a few ideas, but I'm open to suggestions, before I settle on a final plan for punishment. “Preferably, the punishment will make him and his family suffer, but no more than one generation (so no apocalypse this time), so it will be a short challenge (Ahem. Punishment), with a definite reminder that he is a mere peasant, NOT nobility. “I will implement my plan at the beginning of the next round.” Slide50: Clovis: Did you do this on purpose, just to add some drama to the neighborhood? Not that I mind. I'm just curious. “Honestly, no. I was playing, while on pain pills, and a real space-case. I actually did forget until it was too late. I swear!” Clovis: Really? “Hah! You should see what I did to poor Ragnar Rock ! It seemed like such a good idea at the time!” Slide51: “Of course, when you're on pain pills at three o'clock in the morning, you don't always realize the ramifications of your actions. I did not predict that...” Clovis: Shhh! A good artist knows not to spoil the surprise. “You're right, Clovis. I'm so glad I married you. You really keep me well grounded.” Slide52: Happy Simming! Now, I've got to get theses updates out fast! And if you read this before the next royal round, feel free to write in your suggestions for how to punish Joshua Hunter, at the Boolprop thread here . I'll either take the suggestion I like best, or else take a bit of this and that, and mash it all together into my own special blend of punishment. Huh. I guess Joshua Hunter isn't so lucky, after all. You do not have the permission to view this presentation.

Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience…
The older I get, the more I question even my own questions or answers, for that matter. My typical response to things is “I don’t know,” or “It’s complicated.” That’s not to say that I don’t have some opinions on a whole range of issues. And even convictions. Although given the nature of things, much of it can be on matters that are rather open ended. The answer may be good insofar as it goes, but it’s open to refinement, and even some correction.
But when it comes to life itself, and what’s at the heart of it, I wouldn’t hesitate to think, and hopefully say, It is God in Jesus, and the good news in him in his incarnation and life, death and resurrection, ascension and the outpouring of the Spirit, with the promise of his return. That is something I believe without so much as a thought that it might need some correction here or there. Of course only God fully understands even the most simple gospel truth, such as John 3:16. We understand by faith as much as God helps us to, of these simple, yet profound truths, which are brought home to our hearts and minds by the Spirit of God.
And we’re to tell them to others. Not having all the answers, or being a know-it-all. But simply being able to point to the one who is the way, the truth, and the life. In whom we have put our faith and hope, our all. And through whom we know God’s love, which we share with all others. Jesus.When I go out, I always see wives scolding or complaining that their husbands are doing a super bad job taking care of kids. The husband literally just stand there and suck it up while their furious wife is pouring out all her troubles in public. I ever asked my wife if she'll do that to me in the future, and she asked if I'll do that to her instead.
The truth is that it's easy to be a good dad. In fact, it's easier to be a good dad compared to a good mum. The standard of a good dad to hurdle over is way way lower than that of a good mum. I mean a dad just needs to do a little housework, maybe cook a little, wake up at night perhaps once a week and change the diapers once in a month, and he'll be hailed as a national hero to be lauded with praises. "He's a good catch!", says random friends and relatives.
But the mum, despite having to work, look pretty, do housework, cook daily, do night duty almost every day and change the diapers almost every time, will still fall short of expectations. "How come you're still so fat 2 yrs after giving birth?", asked concerned random relatives during family gathering. "How come the baby is waddling in the mud, tsk tsk...the mum is not doing a good job", says observant random passerby.
I see it and I try my best to correct the inequality and unfairness in the whole dynamics. I did my fair share of work, but due to conflict of interest, perhaps only my wife can comment on whether I am really fair and equal in sharing the duties of child caring between ourselves.
To all the fathers who are ticked off by their wives in public, I wish I can help you deflect some of the attention, but you know I can't. The best thing you can do is to step up to the challenge and start being a good dad, by living up to the standard of being a good mum.
Happy Father's day.

Easier to be a good dad than a good mum
Monday, June 18, 2018 BIAS , Parenthood 12 comments
12 comments :
that is so true. just have a read at any tragedy befalling kids. kids committing suicide - why is the mum pushing the kids so hard. Kids in accident - why did the mum let her out of sight. kids abused by maids - why did the mum go to work leaving the kid with a stranger? kids abused by childcare - how did the mum not know about it until so late? kids abused by stepfather - why did the mum so itchy need to find new guy? kids abandoned by mother - why the mother like that? don't want the kid? kids aborted by mother - why the mother don't raise the kid up herself? so cruel? or why the women so loose. as if she just slept with herself to have a kid. kids can't do homework - why the mother never teach. rude kids - how the mother discipline? spoilt kids - how the mother raise the child?
Dads? hmm they mostly don't feature in kids in broken families. No one bothers to ask where did the dads go after fathering them - whether divorced or not married. they only feature in wholesome families - there to provide some bread. but in this day and age, women are expected to provided bread too!
anyway, happy Father's Day. =)
Sorry for ranting.
Hi anonymous,
Haha, you also observe that too? In my line of work, absent father makes up 99% of all the cases. In my 15 years of work, I can count with my 2 hands how many involved fathers there are. I guess the guys have to step up to parenting and give women a break.
Cos women are more fussy and higher standards
Majority of maid abusers are women too
Hi jaded,
I don't know what women generally, so I can't comment on that. But I do think that people can be unkind to other people.
The begining of suffering, haha.
A heartwarming post from a sensitive new age dad! Great job. :D
We don't have to live our lives prescribed by others or societal norms. How good a mum or dad we are, only our kids are qualified to hand us the report card.
I particularly like this quote 'If we want to be in our children's lives tomorrow, be in theirs today'. And we jolly well make our presence a welcomed one.
If we are burdened by the baggage laid upon us, we can never go far enough to catch up with our children's lives. :)
Hi anonymous,
I think it's not all suffering. Sure, there are times when I asked myself what am I doing now? But it's often offset by the really really good times. Can't really describe it. As much as it's the beginning of suffering, it's also rightly the beginning of joy.
Hi EY,
I asked my wife for a report card, she said it's an A. Even offered to write a blog post here lol
But to wait for my kid to give me a report, I think it's kind of late. He can't talk right now, but I really hope by the time he can talk, I'm already far in the distance. I guess a little baggage is good because my motivation point is not to be the absent fathers I've "seen" a lot in my career.
I love the quote :)
so do you think there is a difference in the kids who have involved fathers v those who do not?
My own analysis is that with today's society shift towards longer working hours, and higher material consumption, and greater ease of information out there on the internet. it is more difficult for parents to have a significant impact on the child.
I really don't like people who like blaming the attitude of the kids on the parents. especially those who blame the mothers. they are the same ones that advocate for a loosening of societal norms (i.e. more sexualised content on mass media, lower age limit for alcohol or cigarettes, push for soft drugs to be legalised). All these makes it more difficult to raise a child, especially since parents are already stretched out by working hours.
PS: I don't think its coz women are fussier. They just have more of a mother's instinct. my other half is happy to let my kids eat Macs and chicken rice coz its easier to get them to eat those than a healthy food. He doesn't mind letting them watch maranthon tv so he can chill out. I can't. not coz I am fussier but I think I am more nurturing. Long term pain v short term gains. Maybe if he knew that he was in charge of the kids for the rest of their lives instead of just one Sunday afternoon he won't do that? so its a chicken and egg thing - he knows that this is just a once off so he can afford to slack off when he babysits for me. If I do that every day after work, I don't think that is good.
Anonymous Ranter earlier.
Household Living expenses could be split 50/50. Taking care of children is never a 50/50. If due to commitment, one party has to do more to taken care of children. The living expenses should be reviewed.
Hi anonymous ranter (haha),
Yes, I think there's a difference. I've seen families with both parents being involved, and they turn out really great. Of course, there are also families with the usual involved mum and absent dads, and they turn out well too.
"Maybe if he knew that he was in charge of the kids for the rest of their lives instead of just one Sunday afternoon he won't do that?" - I think this statement is spot on. You hit it right on the jugular. It's very easy to take short term solutions with long term implication, if you are not going to there for the long term.
Ultimately, as parents, we can only try our best. The outcome we all have to leave it to whatever may be. I don't want to look back years later and say I didn't do my best. It'll be a huge regret on my part.
Hi anonymous,
Not even talking about 50/50. It's skewed like 99/1 or 90/10, with the lower number being the father. I see that very very common in my line of work.
And I'm not just talking about being physically there. I'm talking about being emotionally there too. You can be there with the kid 100% of the time, but your mind might not be there. Could be checking fb or surfing the net while physically there. It's that kind of absent-ism that I'm talking about.42.3601325, -71.0671701
The Vilna Shul, a simple yet elegant building on Beacon Hill, was modeled after the medieval synagogues of Europe, but also draws inspiration from the architecture of the neighborhood. It was built in 1919 and designed by architect David Kalman. After the Vilna Shul shut its doors in the 1980s, the Alliance joined as a vocal member of a movement to see the building restored and reopened. Following a $3 million restoration that secured the building envelope, the building was reopened as an historical site, cultural center and spiritual haven for tours, exhibits, programs and events.This event has passed.

But such an ambitious study never happened. And the researchers’ agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, decided not to make public hundreds of pages of research and warnings about the use of phones by drivers — in part, officials say, because of concerns about angering Congress.
…
Not all the research went unpublished. The safety agency put on its Web site an annotated bibliography of more than 150 scientific articles that showed how a cellphone conversation while driving taxes the brain’s processing power..”
Reviewers of this literature take note: The summaries are quite good and can be found in the original NTSA report from pages 13 to 99.
Many news sources covered this topic:
- New York Times (the original source) – “U.S. Withheld Data on Risks of Distracted Driving”
- Atlanta Journal Constitution – “Research on Cell-Phone-Use-While-Driving Quashed by Feds”
- News & Observer – “Agency Declined to Study Cell Phone Use”
The articles seem to imply that there was knowledge available to the NTSA but not to anyone else, certainly not congress. Mention of outside research was brief in the news articles. For example, one excerpt summarized:
The research mirrors other studies about the dangers of multitasking behind the wheel. Research shows that motorists talking on a phone are four times as likely to crash as other drivers, and are as likely to cause an accident as someone with a .08 blood alcohol content.
The links go to the start of powerpoint presentations included in the NTSA document rather than to actual research. There is nothing wrong with the powerpoints, though it would be nice if the HF researchers and professionals who have worked on this problem got direct credit for the knowledge they provided to the world.
I’m not sure why the work done by the NTSA would be the only work taken seriously by congress, but perhaps I’m not understanding correctly. HF researchers have known for years that a hands-free headset was not an inoculation against poor driving performance and that many in-car activities consume attentional resources. David Strayer, (whose articles I use in my Intro to Human Factors class,) has worked for years on the problem of driver distraction. His work alone, often with Frank Drews, provides 8 published articles on driver distraction between 2001 and 2003 when the NTSA report was written. This is, of course, in addition to work occurring since the inception of the cell phone (these are just a few I cribbed from Strayer and Johnson’s references in their 2001 article):
- Alm, H. & Nilsson, L. (1995). The effects of a mobile telephone task on driver behaviour in a car following situation. Accident Analysis and Prevention, 27, 707-715.
- Briem, V. & Hedman, L.R. (1995). Behavioural effects of mobile telephone use during simulated driving. Ergonomics, 38, 2536-2562.
- Redelmeier, D.A., & Tibshirani, J.J. (1997). Association between cellular-telephone calls and motor vehicle collisions. The New England Journal of Medicine, 336, 453-458.
My favorite comes from 1969(!):
- Brown, I.D., Tickner, A.H., & Simmonds, D.C.V. (1969). Interference between concurrent tasks of driving and telephoning. Journal of Applied Psychology, 35, 419-424.

The Hunt
Genre: Horror/Comedy
Directed by: Craig Zobel
Run time: 90 minutes
Rating: R
Format: Blu-Ray
The Lowdown: For all the ranting and condemnation expressed over the latest Blumhouse production, The Hunt, uninformed viewers might expect to actually be shocked when they sit down to watch the movie, now that it’s available on home media and video-on-demand.
Don’t be fooled, The Hunt is neither ‘the most talked about movie of the year’ nor a worthwhile waste of 90 minutes.
The alleged social satire, written by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof, manages to flail and fail at every turn except one, which is the only reason to tune in – the gratuitous, almost cartoonishly comical gore that results in a slew of body parts, internal organs and brain matter being sprayed across the screen.
For the stellar practical effects alone, The Hunt is worth the time of horror fans still staying home and waiting patiently for movie theaters to reopen.
Trust me when I say, if you go into The Hunt expecting a popcorn-munching, politicized skewering of both liberals and conservatives, prepare to be disappointed. Cuse and Lindelof, despite having been involved with some of the best, smartest, most engaging entertainment of recent history, inexplicably never wade out past the most shallow of waters possible and park the boat, refusing to go deeper into fresh, unexplored, unexpected territory.
Ironically, the heroine that they choose to lead The Hunt – Betty Gilpin’s ‘Crystal’ – is one of the most loathsome characters I’ve ever had the displeasure of watching on the big screen.
She’s neither too-Trumpian nor too-snowflake. She’s so firmly fixed in her unlikability that it’s impossible to root for her in any context other than secretly hoping she steps on a stray landmine.
The Stuff You Care About: Hot chicks – Yes.
Nudity – No. Gore – Wow, gratuitous.
Drug use – No.
Bad Guys/Killers – Anyone who pledges allegiance to party over country.
Buy/Rent – Rent it.

Again, if you love witch movies, then maybe this is your bag, but it’s not mine, not now, not at a point when familiarity breeds contempt and lack of originality can doom a movie before the full plot is even revealed.How can I pay with American Express?

Predictors of quality of life among community psychiatric patients in a peri-urban district of Gauteng province, South Africa

Abstract
Introduction: Few studies on quality of life (QoL) in the mentally ill population of South Africa have been conducted, but none in community-dwelling individuals. This study examined the QoL of psychiatric patients at community mental health clinics in Gauteng province of South Africa.
Methods: A cross-sectional interview-based study was conducted on 121 adult patients attending community psychiatric clinics. To reduce the impact of acute psychiatric symptoms on subjective QoL, only clinically stable patients were included. Instruments used included the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF domains (i.e. physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for severity of illness and a socio-demographic and clinical questionnaire.
Results: Just under half of the sample rated their overall QoL as good or very good. The strongest predictor of a poor QoL in all four domains was residual psychiatric symptomatology. The most severe BPRS scores were for the symptoms of depression, anxiety and somatic concern. Perceived social support significantly predicted a better QoL in the psychological, social relationships and environmental domains.
Conclusion: This study highlights the negative impact of residual psychiatric symptoms on subjective QoL, and the importance of social support and enhancing QoL. If better QoL is the goal of care, then our findings highlight the importance of managing residual symptoms and promoting social support.

doi: 10.3390/socsci8020055This quickstart explains how to use the
bq command-line tool
to run queries and load data into BigQuery.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud Console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
If you are using a preexisting project, enable the BigQuery API. BigQuery is automatically enabled in new projects.
- Optional: Enable billing for the project. If you don't want to enable billing or provide a credit card, the steps in this document still work. BigQuery provides a sandbox to perform the steps.
In the Cloud Console, activate Cloud Shell.
In this quickstart, you run all the
bqtool commands in Cloud Shell from the Cloud Console.
Examine a table
BigQuery offers several
sample tables
that you can query. In this quickstart, you run some queries against the
shakespeare table, which contains an entry for every word in every Shakespeare play.
Examine the
shakespearetable in the
samplesdataset:
bq show bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare
This example command examines the schema of a specific table. If the project and dataset IDs are the default values for your
bqtool, then you can omit them in the
bq showcommand and just specify the table ID:
bq show shakespeare
The output is similar to the following:
Table bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare Last modified Schema Total Rows Total Bytes Expiration ----------------- ------------------------------------ ------------ ------------- ------------ 26 Aug 14:43:49 |- word: string (required) 164656 6432064 |- word_count: integer (required) |- corpus: string (required) |- corpus_date: integer (required)
Run the help command
View detailed information about the
bqtool:
bq help
View information about a specific command:
bq help query
In this example, the call to
bq helpretrieves information about the
bq querycommand.
Run a query
To see how many times the substring
raisinappears in Shakespeare's works, run a query using the
bq querycommand:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \ 'SELECT word, SUM(word_count) AS count FROM `bigquery-public-data`.samples.shakespeare WHERE word LIKE "%raisin%" GROUP BY word'
The output is similar to the following:
Waiting on job_dcda37c0bbed4c669b04dfd567859b90 ... (0s) Current status: DONE +---------------+-------+ | word | count | +---------------+-------+ | Praising | 4 | | raising | 5 | | raisins | 1 | | praising | 8 | | dispraising | 2 | | dispraisingly | 1 | +---------------+-------+
To see how many times the substring
huzzahappears in Shakespeare's works, run the following query:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \ 'SELECT word FROM `bigquery-public-data`.samples.shakespeare WHERE word = "huzzah"'Since the substring doesn't appear in Shakespeare's works, no results are returned.
The output is similar to the following:
Waiting on job_e19 ... (4s) Current status: DONE
Create a new table
In the next sections, you create a new table and place it in a new dataset.
Download the sample data
The sample data is provided by the US Social Security Administration and contains approximately 7 MB of data about popular baby names.
Download and extract the baby names zip file.
The zip file contains a file named
NationalReadMe.pdfthat describes the dataset schema. Learn more about the dataset.
Open the file
yob2010.txtto see what it looks like. The file contains comma-separated values for the following three columns: name, sex (
Mor
F), and number of children with that name. The file has no header row.
Copy or move the file
yob2010.txtinto the directory where you are running the
bqcommand-line tool. If you are running the
bqcommand-line tool in Cloud Shell, upload the
yob2010.txtfile. For more information, see Managing files with Cloud Shell.
Create a new dataset
Check whether your default project has existing datasets:
bq ls
The output is similar to the following:
datasetId ------------- olddataset
- List the datasets in a specific project by including the project ID followed by a colon (
:):
bq ls publicdata:
This example lists the datasets in the
publicdataproject.
The output is similar to the following:
datasetId ----------- samples
- In the project you selected for this quickstart, create a new dataset named
babynames:
bq mk babynames
A dataset name can be up to 1,024 characters long and consist of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the underscore. The name cannot start with a number or underscore, and it cannot have spaces.
The output is similar to the following:
Dataset 'myprojectid:babynames' successfully created.
- Confirm that the dataset now appears as part of the default project:
bq ls
The output is similar to the following:
datasetId ------------- olddataset babynames
Upload the table
In the
babynamesdataset that you created, load your source file
yob2010.txtinto a new table called
names2010:
bq load babynames.names2010 yob2010.txt name:string,gender:string,count:integer
The
bq loadcommand creates a table and loads data in a single step.
The command includes the following arguments:
- datasetID:
babynames
- tableID:
names2010
- source:
yob2010.txt(if necessary, include the full path)
- schema:
name:string,gender:string,count:integer
The output is similar to the following:
Upload complete. Waiting on job_4f0c0878f6184119abfdae05f5194e65 ... (35s) Current status: DONE
Confirm that the table now appears in the dataset:

By default, when you load data, BigQuery expects UTF-8 encoded data.
If you have data in ISO-8859-1 (or Latin-1) encoding and you're having
problems with it, instruct BigQuery to treat your data as Latin-1
using the
-E flag. For more information, see
Encoding.
Run queries
Return the most popular girls' names:
bq query "SELECT name,count FROM babynames.names2010 WHERE gender = 'F' ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 5"
The output is similar to the following:
Waiting on job_58c0f5ca52764ef1902eba611b71c651 ... (0s) Current status: DONE +----------+-------+ | name | COUNT | +----------+-------+ | Isabella | 22731 | | Sophia | 20477 | | Emma | 17179 | | Olivia | 16860 | | Ava | 15300 | +----------+-------+
- See the most unusual boys' names:
bq query "SELECT name,count FROM babynames.names2010 WHERE gender = 'M' ORDER BY count ASC LIMIT 5"
The minimum count is 5 because the source data omits names with fewer than 5 occurrences.
The output is similar to the following:
Waiting on job_556ba2e5aad340a7b2818c3e3280b7a3 ... (1s) Current status: DONE +----------+-------+ | name | COUNT | +----------+-------+ | Aarian | 5 | | Aaidan | 5 | | Aamarion | 5 | | Aadhavan | 5 | | Aaqib | 5 | +----------+-------+
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
Remove the
babynamesdataset:
bq rm --recursive=true babynames
The
--recursiveflag deletes all tables in the dataset, including the
names2010table.
To confirm the delete command, type
y.
However, if you followed this quickstart in a new project, then you can delete the project.

MAJOR
Ronald Martinez/Getty
The NCAA will allow student-athletes to profit from the use of their name, image, and likeness in a major shift toward embracing “change,” the organization announced on Tuesday.
“We must embrace change to provide the best possible experience for college athletes,” Board of Governors Chairman and Ohio State University President Michael V. Drake said in a statement. “Additional flexibility in this area can and must continue to support college sports as a part of higher education.” The organization’s board of governors unanimously voted during a meeting at Emory University in Atlanta on Tuesday to allow the amateur athletes to “benefit from the use of their name, image and likeness.”
Drake added the decision “is a natural extension of the numerous steps NCAA members have taken in recent years to improve support for student-athletes, including full cost of attendance and guaranteed scholarships.” The organization added it has asked each division to create any new rules beginning immediately, but no later than January 2021.Table of Contents

29 thoughts on “6 Ways that Starting to Raise Meat Rabbits Will Make You More Self-Sufficient”! 🙂 Thank you!!
Nicole,
When you two come over on Saturday you can check out our rabbit setup. We can help you talk him into it! 😉 🙂.
I Find Rachel pretty amazing. I am sure that before she became so “enlightened” at the behest of her family she ate countless forms of meat. Eggs, chicken, beef, fish, and the works. I wonder if she secretly curses her mother and father for insuring that she had a balanced diet which continues to support her to this day? Not everyone in the world can afford to live on a vegan diet. In many places in the world the terrain and climate do not support such indulgences, are these people less evolved spiritually than you because they need meat products to maintain good health for themselves and their families? But why stop at animals, don’t plants have a right to live, don’t they breathe, respond to stimuli? Isn’t it just as cruel to kill a plant by your rationale as it is to kill an animal? I would fully support the vegan movement taking this next bold step in the preservation of innocent life. Please start immediately Rachel! -Don’t support the slaughter of innocent plants!
Thanks for the information. I have raised rabbits for most of my life. My rabbits eat well and are taken care of and are processed according to the Bible. I raise rabbits so I can cut my grocery bills and to help with my garden. I can feed my rabbits greens off my six acres as well as garden scraps, and kitchen scraps. I am researching starting a worm farm operation as well to sell worms for fishing. As many who are suffering in this economy I hope my “Rabbitry” will help me in my retirement years (or when I can no longer physically able to work).
Rabbits are helping the people in Haiti recover from the quakes there as 2 out of 3 people are still starving there. I have a Vietnamese friend who was subject to the policies of that company. He ate dog and I don’t judge him on that as it was survival and we may all face choices at some point and my choice will be rabbit as it is a better choice for the homesteader due to the diet being able to consist of 75% greens (or 100% you just won’t have a big rabbit). Hopefully our food supplies will stay consistant but should it fail I would hate to see a hungry child due to my lack of being prepared to help my family or neighbors in need. God Blesses His children.
I eat meat and therefore need to acknowledge that animals die for my food. I understand revulsion at this idea, but that revulsion is a luxury. Luxuries are nice (who would turn down a pint of Ben and Jerry’s? not me!), but to live my life in a way I value, I find it necessary to at the very least recognize them.
Raising and slaughtering your own meat allows you to ensure the animal gets a life that makes it that animal version of “happy.” I have backyard chickens, and am considering eating them – they have been “happy,” apparently, and I like the taste of chicken.
I know this may offend you, Maddy. There are many downstream unpleasantnesses about our lives that we can choose to see; slaughtering animals is one. Sweatshops are another. We can only live our lives as well as we can, and accept that others will choose differently.:
I am just getting started into rabbit raising and this is all very enlightening. Rachael, your breakdown on the cost of raising a rabbit was very helpful. I intend to build my hutch this weekend but have been procrastinating as I am looking for a good design for 2 does and a buck, probably to house one of the larger rabbit breeds. Any advise would be appreciated (positive feedback please). thanks.
Topbarbeeman, Are you planning on using pre-assembled cages or build your own? If you are building your own find that a 3’deep by 4′ wide is a great size for does with litters that are growing out if you aren’t weaning them at 8 weeks old. You’ll also need at least two large grow out pens (1 ea for bucks and does). I also recommend having more pens than you anticipate needing. We didn’t expect to need more than 5 and now we don’t have enough pens and need to rebuild our rabbitry. We’re making do with makeshift pens now until we can find time to rebuild.
I use 2 X 3 pens for my bucks and does. Make sure your gate is large enough to put nest box in. (for does only). I line mine up 6 holes to the run and have a chicken pen under the rabbits to take care of any spilled food, bugs, grubs (protein for eggs). I sometimes stud out my does for different blood lines and my grow out pen is a “rabbit tractor” that I move around the yard to cut down on my feed bill and a little bit of mowing time as well. I free feed hay to all and a mixture of greens and orchard harvests. Good luck with your rabbits and I cannot stress enough to read and compare what you hear so you know you are getting good advice..
Very well written. Truthfully, I already know all of this information. That being said, I know it after reading tons and tons of different articles about it. This is probably the best article I’ve read (including the follow up in the comments) about the basic joys, and benefits of raising rabbits. It would have been great if I found this article a year ago. Very informative and well written. Thank you.
Before you think you will sell some to pay for food they eat or for profit go to Craig’s List and see how many in your area have the same idea.
We found about 75-100 on any given day here in our area. They were having to practicably give them away and that did not mean they could even do that.
Slaughter, is not easy either. I would find a bunny raiser who would let you participate in his harvest to see if it is your cup of tea or not.
One more thing, eat some rabbit, do you like it? I do not. I do not like the texture or taste.
We will not be raising rabbits in the future. We will stick to Aquaponic fish and eggs and chickens we do like the taste of.20+ Pics That Show the World Is Still Full of Riddles

Nice little restaurant. The pizzas are very tasty and well-cooked. Authentic Italian cuisine! It's nice to have a decent Italian restaurant in this part of town.
My husband and I had the mini bacon-wrapped hot dogs as an entree. They were very tasty. I ordered the prime rib sandwich as my main course, and my husband had a burger. The prime rib was under-cooked, but since they had forgotten about our order and we waited almost an hour to be served, I did not return my food. My husband said his burger tasted great and was well-cooked. Now came the dessert. We both had milkshakes. To our pleasant surprise, one of manangers/owners of the restaurant felt so bad that it took so long for us to get our food that he actually brought us another dessert on the house. Wow, talk about class!
The decor was very unique and cool, and the ambiance was great. The waiters/waitresses were friendly. The service was slow, and we did get served by at least 3 or 4 different waiters, so disorganization might definitely be an issue.
Would I ever go back to this restuarant? Well, let's just say that the desserts alone are worth the trip! If the staff could learn to be more well-organized and the food could be served quickly, then this restaurant would have a lot of potential.
My husband and I ordered the Roasters burger with fries and chili. The burger was very good, especially since it was smothered with bbq sauce and topped with crispy bacon. The fries were also crispy and perfectly seasoned. The chili was very spicy, yet delicious.
The service and ambiance were also good. Our waitress was professional, and we got served quickly. No complaints.
My husband and I ordered crab cakes as an entree. They were bite-sized crab cakes served with a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce. They had a nice, crunchy exterior, and were very tasty and moist on the inside.
We ordered pizza as our main course. I had the seafood pizza, which was topped with shrimps, scallops, crab...plenty of seafood and cheese. My pizza was ok. It had a nice crust, which I enjoyed very much. The pizza tasted fine, but it certainly wasn't the best pizza I have ever eaten. My husband had the Italian sausage pizza topped with mushrooms, cheese, and marinated eggplants. He enjoyed his pizza, and said it was tasty and well-cooked.
As for service, we had no complaints. Our waiter was courteous and professional.
The ambiance and decor were also very nice.
We will definitely be going back!
I ordered the club 51 with fries. The sandwich was good, and the sliced green apples were a nice touch! The fries were ok.
The service was...well, it wasn't great. Not very professional. I noticed our waiter chatting and laughing a lot with another employee...and glancing at the few customers in the restaurant every so often. There was only one or two other couples in the restaurant that afternoon, and yet the service was still poor...too bad.
As for decor, it's ok. Modern and trendy, but nothing spectacular.
I read some great reviews about this restaurant, and finally decided to try it for myself. Wow, this restaurant exceeded all expectations! The ambiance was great, the service was excellent, and the food was delicious!
My dinner guests and I started off with the spinach and cheese dip appetizer, which was phenomenal! Everyone raved about how good it was, especially since it came with pizza bread and sour cream and salsa. We were off to a great start! Our main courses consisted of different types of burgers and side dishes. The garlic mashed potatoes were excellent! The hamburgers were huge and very filling.
The menu was extensive, and there were a few new dishes that caught my attention. I might have to try their lobster sliders next time. They also have a nice variety of desserts, especially cheesecakes!
Overall, this is a terrific restaurant with great service and a wonderful selection of tasty dishes. Bravo!
After reading some good reviews about this place, I finally decided to give it a try. I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. The burger, though not big, was cooked to my liking and was quite thick. My burger just needed some cheese and ketchup, and I had a great tasting burger! The fries were good too, crispy, not too greasy.
As for service, I had no complaints. I got served quickly, and my waitress was courteous.
Basically, this is a great place to go to for a quick bite. The food is good and affordable. Two thumbs up!
This was my first time at this restaurant. I had read some good reviews about their pizzas, and decided to try it for myself. My husband and I shared an all-dressed pizza. The pizza was good, loaded with toppings (especially pepperoni), and it had a nice crust as well.
As for ambiance/decor, this is definitely a very casual place, a little old-fashioned, but decent. The service was ok, nothing more, nothing less. Overall, this is a decent restaurant for a good pizza. It's certainly not the best pizza I've ever eaten, but it's tasty and affordable. Always a good combination!
Excellent! My husband and I just went there for breakfast. I had the "weekend" breakfast, which included 4 slices of raisin bread french toast, 4 slices of crispy bacon, sliced bananas, watermelon, canteloupe, and grapefruit. My husband had the "V.I.P." breakfast, which included french toast, crepes, and a mountain of fresh fruit. We both had the freshly squeezed orange juice, which was tasty and refreshing. Our meals were delicious!
As for service, no complaints in that department either. Friendly, quick service. Our waitress was very personable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! Great food, big portions, great service, and reasonably priced! 5 stars all the way!
Good smoked meat sandwiches. Very tasty! Quick service. Good place to go to for a quick bite. Definitely one of the better restaurants in Montreal for a great smoked meat sandwich.
Nice variety...Tasty, thin-crust pizzas with a variety of toppings.
UPDATE: Generally, this restaurant is good. HOWEVER, even though I do appreciate their attempt to be creative and unique with their menu items, some of their pizzas may not be as appealing as they seem. Most recently, I had decided to try one of their pizzas with prosciutto. Let's just say, I'd rather stick to a simple margherita. Much better, and certainly not as disappointing. Overall, it's just a nice spot for a decent pizza.
UPDATE: I recently went to this restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was a rather good dining experience. The service was a little slow, and the restaurant was packed. The food, however, was terrific! The antipasto was delicious, and the gnocchi was quite good as well. The veal was alright, but not as tender as I had expected.
As for decor/ambiance, there's not really all that much to say. It's very ordinary.
Large variety of poutines...Tasty, yet expensive..Good hot dogs.:)..Small restaurant, very busy, slow service.
Interesting concept, tasty crepes. :)
I've only been there once, and it wasn't a very good experience. Sorry, but there are better places out there for chicken and fries.
I've only been to this Boston Pizza once, but I usually go to the one in Anjou...The pizzas are actually decent, and the sweet potato fries with chipotle dipping sauce are very tasty.
Great location! Not really authentic Italian cuisine, though. :(
ok for pizzas, but nothing great. :(
Not too bad, but there are better restaurants out there. Good location, great service. Food-wise, it's ok, but a little too expensive.
Great ambiance, stylish, unique...Great selection of authentic Italian food. Well done!
Ok subs! Great location, decent food, nice variety.
Average pizzas, but judging from the reviews, their subs seem good. I will have to try one of them next time.
Large variety, decent food, good location. I like their Singapore noodles and egg rolls.
Nice ambiance, decent food. Not one of my personal favorites, but there are worse restaurants out there.
Tasty pies, though a little too expensive. Trendy, but not really my cup of tea.
Good for sandwiches!!! Good location, very trendy.
Not bad for a seafood meal. I haven't been there in a long time, but I will certainly be going back in the near future.
Decent place for some crepes, but nothing spectacular.
The pizzas used to be decent at one point, but are now usually soggy and barely edible. Sorry, but I would rather use my money on good quality food.
Terrible hamburgers; one of the worst I ever had, so I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Horrible experience. This is one restaurant I will never go to again. Grade: F
Ok for beer and nachos, but nothing out of the ordinary.
Pizzas and tortellini are good. Nice ambiance, good location, decent service.
Good dining experience, tasty food, and good service.
Not bad. It's casual, affordable, and the food is actually decent.
I don't go there often, but when I do, I always get their seafood pizza. It's highly addictive, especially since it is loaded with toppings and creamy bechamel sauce.
This restaurant is ok, but not impressive in the slightest. The pizzas are edible, but nothing great.
My husband and I go to this restaurant on occasion, and it isn't bad. I'm not a fan of their ribs, but my husband seems to enjoy it for the most part. It's usually always packed, so make sure to reserve.
Sorry, but I generally dislike this restaurant, and the service is quite poor as well. Oh, and if you don't have a reservation, you will wait at least an hour to get a table.

by: MATT BARNARD World Staff Writer
1/2/2008 12:00 AM
Two new Malayan tigers will arrive in Tulsa in about a month.
Two of the world’s rarest felines will soon have a new home in Tulsa.
Handlers will bring a duo of endangered Malayan tigers from a zoo in
Omaha, Neb., to fill the Tulsa Zoo’s existing tiger exhibit. The
current cats are being sent to other zoos for breeding.
Breeding problems forced the move of the two Tulsa Amur tigers, said
Karen Dunn, large mammal curator. An age difference and one tiger’s
health issues added to the reproductive troubles, she said.
Officials expect to receive the new felines from the Henry Doorly Zoo
in about a month and have them on display soon after at the Tulsa
Zoo, 5701 E. 36th St. North.
Dwight Scott, Tulsa Zoo assistant director, said the felines will be
more active and entertaining than their older predecessors.
“They’re going to be more exciting cats to have on exhibit because of
their age,” Scott said.
The new cats, which weigh about 275 pounds each, are almost 3 years
old. Malayan tigers are a rare subspecies, with only 39 living in
captivity in the United States.
Although the new tigers are smaller than the exhibit previous
tenants, the two subspecies have similar diets and look alike, Scott
said.
Officials hope to add more Malayan tigers to the zoo’s collection
when the cats reach maturity and are able to breed.
Mating habits of large cats are difficult to predict and depend on
several factors, such as age, health and individual temperament, Dunn
said.
“We all have our distinct personalities, and that’s the same for
tigers,” Dunn said. “It’s not as easy as just throwing them together
and out pops two cubs.”
The two Amur tigers were nearly six years apart in age, and Nadezhda,
an 11-year-old female, has age related health problems that made
breeding difficult, Dunn said.
Nadezhda will mate with tigers at the Henry Doorly Zoo, and the 6-
year-old Baikal will mate with other females at the Bronx Zoo in New
York. Animal breeding programs are overseen by the Association of
Zoos and Aquariums, a nonprofit agency that regulates the zoo
industry. The group moves animals between nearly 200 accredited zoos
in North America to keep a species’ gene pool as diverse as possible,
Scott said.
“If we don’t work together, we’re not going to be able to save these
endangered species. If every zoo does its own thing, it’s not going
to work,” he said.
After temporarily sedating the felines, workers will put them into
cages for the road trip to the other zoos.
Scott said the Henry Doorly Zoo is considered a reproductive
authority for tigers and other large cats. The $2.5 million cat
center is the largest feline breeding facility in the country.
The first artificial insemination and test tube conception of tigers
took place at the zoo, Executive Director Lee Simmons said. More than
30 tigers are housed at the zoo, including nine Malayan tigers.

SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS NEED YOUR SUPPORT WITH BOOKS, BOOKS, BOOKS!, CURREN K-8 SCHOOL, OXNARD, CA. $249
Help me give my students a broad range of books that are not offered in their school library.
My StudentS
My students are amazing! I have 15 students in 7th grade and 13 in 8th grade. They are all in a special education class for study skills and they all mainstream to general education classes too. My students are amazing because they are all progressing in school. They have learning disabilities and although they may be behind in their grade level, each and every one of my students are motivated to improve themselves, both personally and academically. I have some students that have gone from a first grade reading level to a fifth grade reading level in two years because they read non-stop. But they want more books!
This year we have added math and language arts to their special education program which is a fantastic opportunity for them to get more support before entering high school.
My amazing students would greatly benefit from more books in our classroom, which normally would take years to purchase with limited funding.
My Project
All my middle school, low socio-economic, special education students love to read but we have a small school library and they have read most of the books already! We read one hour a day in class either a read aloud, small groups or independent reading. Students are taught story structure, literary elements and then they mind map all their readings to be displayed on our walls.
They are starving for more classroom books to enrich their learning and broaden their horizons.
Your donation will give them this opportunity and in turn our society will benefit from kind, well read and grateful young community members.
LIGHT FOR CHILDREN WITH VISION IMPAIRMENTS, PROVO PEAKS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, PROVO, UT. $135
Help me give my students access to toys and sensory input. The switch activated light, and other light up toys help my students with vision impairments see what they are playing with and get more visual stimulation.
My Students
My students have a wide range of abilities and challenges. I have students that range from kindergarten to 6th grade. My students have a variety of of physical and cognitive disabilities (cerebral palsy, down syndrome, etc.) that make school a little extra challenging for them, but they are just normal kids who crave opportunities to learn and grow.
My students are capable of so much.
They have a few extra stumbling blocks in their way, but I truly believe that with the right tools they can overcome those obstacles.
There are many resources that my students will need to develop their academic, social, and behavioral skills that I don’t have access to. I want to provide them with a positive learning environment equipped with the tools they need to thrive in school.
My Project
There are several students in my class with visual impairments and motor disabilities. It’s difficult for these students to access play time or sensory input that their peers can access independently. The switch activated disco light can help my students access that stimulation independently. That, as well as the other light up toys, will help them realize that they can access play and sensory input without just waiting around for an adult to provide it.
Independence is so important, even for students with disabilities.
These light up toys and sensory toys will help my students develop more independence. Binders, page protectors, and other classroom items will help my students display their work and take pride in the things they create.

- Jebel Ali Port operated by DP World, is the flagship operation of its portfolio of over 78 marine terminals across six continents.
- Total barge capacity stands at 9,600 MT of fuel oil and 2,000 MT of gas oil.
Dubai, UAE: GP Global has today announced the expansion of the group’s bunkering portfolio with the launch of its new bunkering operation in the port of Jebel Ali. Jebel Ali Port, operated by DP World, contributes over 26 per cent to Dubai’s GDP and along with Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) provides Dh151 billion ($41.1 billion) or 10.7 per cent to the UAE’s national GDP making it a key player in the development of the UAE economy.
GP Global’s new bunkering operation includes two wholly owned barges, each with a capacity of 4,800 MT of fuel oil and 1,000 MT of gas oil, which will deliver MAROPOL and ISO-compliant distillate marine, including high quality marine gasoil (MGO) grades such as DMA and DMB as well as residual fuels including RMG and RME grades. Subsequently, GP Global will continue to champion the bunkering industry’s needs for ISO-compliant low sulphur grades, working closely with its customers and partners on cleaner energy solutions.
The new Jebel Ali bunkering operation of GP Global complements its operations in the UAE at the Port of Fujairah, where it had set a group milestone by completing its first delivery of IMO compliant fuel oil, three months ahead of the January 2020 deadline.
The group’s entire bunkering operations in the UAE – including Dubai and Fujairah – is supported by GP Global’s trucking business to cover fuel oil and marine gas oil in major ports in the country.
Anil Keswani, Head of Bunkering, East of Suez at GP Global,said: “Our East of Suez business has reported a growth of over 25 per cent last year in revenue, which underlines the strong opportunity and potential of the region.. With this, we now offer a global network that can meet the requirements of marine fuel supply as per IMO guidelines.”
The strategic location of Jebel Ali Port will catalyse GP Global’s bunkering business, given the effortless connectivity that the port offers in linking South Asia, North America and the Middle East. With proven strengths already in bunkering, the new operation will further position the company as the leading name in the industry.

When glucose in the blood increases, the beta cells produce insulin. Insulin converts glucose to glycogen in the liver and muscles. In the same way, when there is a decrease in the level of glucose in the blood, glucagon uses the glycogen stored in the liver and the muscles and converts it into glucose to be used by the body. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells.Anderson sits out game, doesn’t detail comments in fracas.

More AP MLB: andAdvantages of Custom Buttons
Clearly, promotional items contrast beginning with one thing then onto the following and this is the reason various affiliations and associations have ended up being exceptionally creative and today they use custom buttons as a technique for propelling their image, product, and services. In this chapter, we will take a look at a portion of the advantages that custom buttons can convey to your business with a specific end goal to build your deals and profit making capacity. One of the major advantages of using custom buttons is the fact that they can be utilized as a marketing and promotional tool whereby they can easily connect your clients and customers to your brand and this makes them be able to easily identify with your product or service. Publicizing and creating awareness are for the most part extreme to any business whether broad or little and this is the reason various affiliations and associations attempt to think about various direct strategies for promoting their products and services, for instance, the usage of custom buttons in light of the fact that these are exceptionally unobtrusive and can without quite a bit of a stretch fit in any monetary arrangement. Another motivation behind why numerous organizations and associations incline toward utilizing the custom buttons is the way that they don’t turn bad and this implies if you have delivered various custom buttons for your clients, the remaining custom buttons can undoubtedly be put away for later use without them ruining.
Custom buttons have proven to be the best handouts for events and trade shows and this means that you can give them as gifts to potential customers and actual customers and they will remain to be a good reminder of your brand to the customer. Another amazingly great position of using the custom buttons is the manner in which that you can without a doubt use them on different things without breaking your money related arrangement and this is regularly incredibly reasonable for associations overseeing more than one product or service.
Many businesses and organizations prefer using the custom buttons and this is because they get to personalize or customize their buttons to the particular image that they would want to portray to their customers and this will help them to retain their brand and ensure that the same message is conveyed to their targeted audience. Custom buttons have in like manner wound up being one of the minimum costly and most perfect ways to deal with rewarding your customers since this will have the ability to show appreciation to your customers and you will in like manner be in a circumstance to use a confined budget which won’t interfere with exercises of the business.

While there, I sent out some Salt Lake City updates via email to my family and some friends, but I decided to reprint those here, just for the fun of it (slightly edited):
Day ONE:
Well, it’s my first day in Salt Lake, and here’s my report:
1. the Rocky Mountains look really cool from an airplane flying high above
2. the Salt Lake really IS “great” – it’s enormous!
3. the city is surrounded by snow-covered mountains – I can see mountains out my hotel window, which is cool
4. the keynote speaker at the opening ceremony was BORING – as in B-O-R-I-N-G – so I pretended that I had to go to the bathroom and I got out of there
I’m home sick… I think I’d rather be doing trivia challenge at Austin Avenue!
Day TWO:
In case you’re interested (and if you’re not, you know where the Delete button is), here’s today’s report from Mormon-land:
1. It snowed today – I did not bring a coat.
2. I couldn’t see the mountains today – too much fog.
3. The sessions weren’t boring, except for the first one. Or maybe that’s because it was at 8:15 and I wasn’t awake yet.
4. The Mormon Temple is really really big. You can’t go in there unless you’ve been recommended by an elder and you wear all white, including your underwear. I don’t know any elders and I didn’t bring my white clothes. But some of my underwear is white.
5. I heard what the music is going to sound like when we all get to heaven. I went to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir’s weekly rehearsal. WOW!
6. Tonight was the first time I’ve ever eaten in a restaurant with a retractable roof.
7. Even in Salt Lake City, bums sleep in doorways downtown.
8. Those Mormons sure know how to plant flowers.
Day THREE:
And now, without further ado, I present my last SLC report. Tomorrow I will have time to pack and sight-see, and then I fly back home tomorrow night. Here’s my report:
1. I like saying “y’all” and “fixing to” and “reckon” to people from Canada and Portland and Pittsburgh.
2. I’ve never seen so many tulips in my entire life.
3. I guess Olive Garden restaurants are the same everywhere you go, which is kinda reassuring.
4. I guess city light rail systems are the same everywhere you go, which is kinda depressing.
5. When I’m alone, I spend too much money.
6. If it weren’t for all the Mormons, this would be a really cool place to live.
7. People here are REALLY mad about the Texas raid on the polygamist compound in El Dorado. Last night there was a demonstration, and people had Texas flags with swastikas painted on them, and other people burned Texas flags. I’m a little bit hesitant to tell people where I’m from.
8. I have found the greatest, coolest bookstore on the planet.
9. The University of Utah is enormous.
10. Salt Lake City has the most interesting public library I’ve ever seen.
Well, that’s it for SLC. I wish I had had time to do/see/go/tour more, but I was there on the university’s dime, so I spent the majority of my time attending sessions and trying to learn something! By the way, I don’t have anything against Mormons. It’s just that there’s so many of them all in one place – it’s kinda weird. I saw a store called “Latter Day Bride” – I thought that was pretty unusual. I wondered if Mormon brides have to have special stuff, or was the store just hoping to appeal to the largest audience in town.
I’ll be posting a photoshow soon, and I’ll add the URL as soon as it’s available.
2 thoughts on “Salt Lake Summary”
I enjoyed your post – very entertaining! I’m glad that you enjoyed the rehearsal. Sending best wishes, and hope y’all come back and see us again sometime. 🙂
Sounds like you had a good trip overall, except for a few boring classes…lol. Glad your home though.- Advertisement -

I hope they keep doing this great work and make sure our lakes are healthy and fun for everybody.” –Gabriel N.
Freedom from Religion
“The Freedom from Religion Foundation may well be said to be among the most patriotic of organizations, for its utter determination to uphold the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, keeping state and church SEPARATE. In so doing, it aids in leveling the playing field for ALL religious practitioners, as well as for those of us who practice NO religion. I personally feel myself privileged to have been able to work with Dan Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor in assisting with their efforts, through the Northern Ohio Freethought Society.

Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation
“I have interacted with Ceiba in numerous capacities over the last five years — first as a student, then as a volunteer, and finally through a grad school internship. I am blown away by the combination of efficiency, effectiveness, and empathy the Ceiba staff have shown as they promote conservation, improve people’s lives, and educate the next generation of conservationists.” –Maximus111
Wisconsin Microfinance
“If you think of your donation as a seed, this nonprofit grows a perennial, not an annual. Donations fund microloans in impoverished areas of the Philippines and Haiti. Because loan repayment rates are high, a small donation keeps recirculating to help more people. Assistance by microloan, as opposed to gift aid, provides both opportunity and accountability. This amazing nonprofit is an all-volunteer organization run by dedicated people committed to giving those in need a hand up.” –ATrain
Health Ministries for Haiti
“I feel very fortunate to be part of this wonderful nonprofit. Everyone involved are dedicated professionals working extremely hard to improve Haiti as a country and the communities that we serve. The Haitian people are our neighbors, our friends, and our family. I look forward to continuing the work that we do in HMH and can’t wait until I have the opportunity to go to Haiti again.
“I encourage anyone reading this to donate to this wonderful organization to support this ongoing work, but most of all, I encourage you to volunteer and work with us.” –jslaffert
Movin’ Out
“Movin’ Out is a great place to volunteer because your work is directly linked to making life a little better, a little easier for people with disabilities who are also living on poverty income.” –Chance
Monarch Butterfly Fund
“Monarch Butterfly Fund supports the monarch butterfly and its magnificent migration through habitat restoration, research, monitoring, education, and support for sustainable community development in and near the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) in Mexico. The conservation of natural resources requires a multifaceted approach that protects monarch overwintering habitat and migratory pathways; generates skills and ability in local communities for forest management and stewardship; and improves the economic well-being for local residents.

Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus, Third Edition Copyright © 2013 by the Philip Lief Group.Hit by steep rise in prices of raw materials including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, solvents and packaging materials, the Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association (HDMA) has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to form a task force to streamline the prices of pharmaceutical raw and packaging materials. MSME formulation units which are now struggling for survival in the current pandemic era have been worst hit by 25 per cent to 300 per cent rise in prices of APIs, excipients, solvents and packaging materials including aluminum, PVC, glass vials, mono carton, corrugated packing, said Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association president Dr Rajesh Gupta.Himachal Pradesh has around 600 pharmaceutical units consisting of 80 per cent of MSMEs and 20 per cent large units.India meets most of its API needs through imports from China. The increase in raw material costs in the wake of the Chinese power crisis will further add to the woes of the drug industry, especially MSMEs.Prices of APIs such as paracetamol have gone upto Rs. 840 to Rs. 900/1,000 per kg whereas its pre Covid price was Rs. 300 per kg. Prices of excipients and solvents such as glycerin, propylene glycol, PVPK 30, isopropyl alcohol have also skyrocketed. Prices of packaging materials such as aluminium, printed, alu- alu foils have increased more than 30 per cent over the last three months and expected to cross 50 per cent in coming days, said Dr Gupta. Similarly, prices of mono cartons and corrugated packing have risen by 25 per cent to 40 per cent and continue to go up while prices of PVC used for blistering of tablets and oral liquid PET bottles have witnessed a 25 per cent-30 per cent rise and trend still upwards. High prices of vials, ampoules, flip off seal, butyl seal parts have greatly affected the injectable products, he informed. Besides this, freight rates of containers for import and export have zoomed up by 6 to 9 times compared to pre Covid-era due to shortage of containers amid pandemic. On the other hand, hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and CNG has led to 10-20 per cent increase in logistics cost.Last year Chief Minister Jairam Thakur had taken up the price rise issue with the Prime Minister’s Office following a representation from the state pharma industry. Acting on the PMO’s instruction, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had sought extensive data pertaining to price rise from state drug units. Despite submission of extensive data by the state drug units last year, hardly any preventive measures have been taken in this regard, he added. The steep rise in prices of raw materials and packaging materials needs three times capital infusion which is impossible for MSMEs. If prices are not tamed, the production of several drugs would be stopped, he stated. The task force having representation from various ministries including ministry of health and family welfare, ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, ministry of commerce and NITI Aayog would protect pharma MSME units and help avoid any shortfall of medicines in the country. The task force would keep a watch on raw material import, its impact, bulk drug production in the country and their prices and devise a mechanism to check price rise so as to avoid the present situation, Dr Gupta stated.LAHORE: The final of Green Pakistan Under-19 Polo Cup 2020-21 will be played between JPCC Colts and LPC Remington Pharma on Saturday (today) at 2:45 pm at the Jinnah Polo and Country Club.

Hepatitis C Testing
If you’ve detectable HCV RNA in your blood, you’ve the potential to unfold the illness to other folks. The most common mechanism of exposure is the sharing of needles or different ‘works’ utilized in consuming medicine corresponding to cocaine or heroin. Healthcare practitioners may also order a liver panel, which is a gaggle of exams that assist assess the well being of your liver. Liver tests corresponding to ALT and AST may be used to detect ongoing liver damage. You will doubtless be checked to see if you’re proof against hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and if not, you could be supplied vaccination, since infection with these other viruses can further harm your liver.
The data on this site shouldn’t be used as an different to skilled medical care or advice. Contact a health care supplier in case you have questions about your health. Health care suppliers diagnose hepatitis C based in your medical history, a bodily exam, and blood tests. If you might have continual hepatitis C, you most likely will not have signs until it causes complications.
Treatment is recommended in all sufferers with chronic hepatitis C unless they’ve a brief life expectancy that is not related to liver disease. Severe life-threatening liver illness could require liver transplantation. Newer therapies with DAAs have allowed more and more sufferers to be treated. Generally, people with chronic an infection with hepatitis C haven’t any signs until they’ve in depth scarring of the liver .
- If your hepatitis C turns right into a continual hepatitis C infection, there are a quantity of medicines out there.
- Acute hepatitis C infection is a short-term illness that occurs inside the first six months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis C virus.
- New HCV infections are most common amongst individuals who inject drugs.
- These folks may still have choices for treatment with the newer regimens.
The riskof transmission from an infected healthcare employee to a affected person appears to be very low. One side of hepatitis research is to reproduce infections in mammalian models. A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from people Что делать если обнаружили гепатит С into mice, a method known as xenotransplantation. This is finished by producing chimeric mice, and exposing the mice HCV an infection.
How Widespread Is Hepatitis C In The United States?
Hepatitis C is a viral illness that leads to swelling or inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis C is irritation and swelling of the liver from an infection with the hepatitis C virus. Most folks newly infected with hepatitis C virus won’t have symptoms. About 10 p.c may have jaundice or yellow pores and skin that will get higher. The dangerous information is that most people contaminated with hepatitis C may have it for a protracted time, usually with no signs.
Remedy Of Key Populations And Distinctive Situations
Chronic hepatitis C an infection is the commonest purpose for liver transplantation in the U.S. Today, most people turn into infected with HCV by sharing needles or other gear to inject drugs. For some folks, HCV an infection is a short-term or acute illness however for more than half of people that turn into contaminated with HCV, it becomes a long-term, chronic an infection. Chronic HCV an infection is a severe disease that may find yourself in long-term well being issues, even demise.
Acute hepatitis C infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first six months after someone is uncovered to the hepatitis C virus. For most individuals, acute an infection leads to chronic an infection but for causes that aren’t known, approximately 15% to 25% of individuals clear the virus with out treatment. Having persistent hepatitis C increases your chance of creating liver most cancers. If continual hepatitis C causes severe liver harm or cirrhosis earlier than you obtain hepatitis C treatment, you will proceed to have an elevated chance of liver cancer even after therapy. Your doctor may suggest blood tests and an ultrasound or another kind of imaging take a look at to examine for liver most cancers. Finding most cancers at an early stage improves the possibility of curing the most cancers.
In developed nations, a lot of the new HCV infections are reported in injection drug users . The most recent surveys of lively IDUs in the United States indicate that approximately one third of young (aged 18–30 years) IDUs are HCV-infected. The further threat of acquiring hepatitis C infection from noninjection cocaine use is tough to distinguish from that related to injection drug use and sex with HCV-infected companions.Cascades subdivision in Carlsbad gets another chance with housing, retail coming soon
A development intended to help solve Carlsbad’s housing shortage could be coming to a struggling subdivision along the Pecos River.
Developer Oxbow recently bought 10 lots in the subdivision, a purchase from the City of Carlsbad and Carlsbad Department of Development (CDOD).
Oxbow Managing Member Scott Goodale said the total scope of the project was “north of” $50 million.
Support local journalism.Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus.
Two new buildings are under construction, but the full development will offer up to 300 condominiums units on three floors, with the ground level leased or sold to commercial retailers or restaurants.

The buildings are expected to be complete by May and August 2020, with the full project planned to open in the next three and a half years.
The condos would be priced more affordably than the current average housing price in Carlsbad, Goodale said.
Goodale said he sees Carlsbad maintaining its current pace of development, as oil and gas majors such as XTO Energy and Occidental Petroleum announced plans for permanent corporate offices in Carlsbad, employing hundreds of employees.
More:The long drive south: Carlsbad housing shortage a risk to local culture
The mixed-use nature of Omega Point will be the cornerstone of its success, he said.
“They majority of it comes down to investors wanting to make sure Carlsbad is set up for the future,” he said. “When we looked at the successes and failures, the location isn’t that easy to get to. We looked at residential and commercial. You need both.
“We wanted to have the chicken at the egg at the same time.”
So far, Goodale said about half a dozen businesses have expressed early interest in the properties, with “a few” offers coming for the condos.

The housing was intended for modest incomes, selling for about $140,000 to $200,000 for the one-to-three-bedroom units.
It’s a price point that is largely absent in the Cavern City, and one ideal for young professionals, teachers, police officers and other workers outside of the much more lucrative oil and gas industry, said Stacey Blackmon, owner and broker at Century 21 Associated Professionals.
“Once people start moving in, I think it will just snowball,” she said. “This is what’s missing in Carlsbad. The interest is high.”
More:Priced out: Young professionals struggle to afford housing in Carlsbad
The appeal would be even strengthened, Goodale said, by the incoming businesses from restaurants to retail and entertainment options.
“A lot of people are coming from not small towns,” he said. “They’re used to living in this style. They want to be able to do it all and go back up to their home.”
Blackmon said the added shopping will keep revenue within the city, as opposed to having residents making the long drives to El Paso or Roswell for shopping.
“What I see happening here is instead of people moving in flock to El Paso for shopping during the holidays, they’ve come here,” she said. “When money stays here, it helps everyone.
“So many people have wanted this for so long. The dirt is moving.”

The Cascades properties struggle to come to fruition after a project to build a movie theater faltered as Allen Theaters pulled out and other plans for an entertainment hub – even a laser tag arena – were stymied by litigation and missed deadlines.
Goodale said the Cascades sat largely dormant for about a decade, and his project could finally give the community what it was originally promised.
“The Cascades has sat vacant for 10 years,” he said. “We’re hoping to follow the vision of the forefathers. I think people are excited.”
Businesses in the Cascades at Carlsbad have turned over at a high rate in the past couple of years, with Lucy’s Mexicali Restaurant’s riverside location closing last year, and Raging Brew Coffeehouse shutting its doors last spring.
The only active commercial business still operating in the area was Anytime Fitness, joined by the Carlsbad Department of Development’s offices and the National Cave and Karst Research Institute.
John Waters, CDOD executive director said the subdivision provides a unique opportunity for businesses and local residents, offering a scenic location along the river.

But development, he said, was initially slow to occur.
“We’ve got a good little start to it, but we want to see it finished,” Waters said. “More people down here will mean better business. (The Cascades) is not dead by any means. Not everything happens overnight.”
And construction costs were also a challenge, he said, for those looking to develop in the subdivision.
“The construction costs in this area are higher,” he said. “It’s really difficult to keep employees. That drives the costs up. Labor is a tough nut to crack.”

This MRM Highlights Pick interview is with Christopher Rowley and Christine Tardif, researchers at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre of the Montreal Neurological Institute in Montreal, Canada. Their paper is entitled: “A model-based framework for correcting B1 inhomogeneity effects in magnetization transfer saturation and inhomogeneous magnetization transfer saturation maps“. Their paper was chosen this month because the authors shared their code with their paper and also provided very detailed documentation inside and outside their code.
To discuss this Q&A, please visit our Discourse forum.
MRMH: Chris, to start with, we’d love to know how you got into MRI and ended up working with Christine.
Chris: I started my undergrad studies doing a general life sciences degree at McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario. There was an option to take an elective class in medical physics that included a brief introduction to MRI and I got really excited about the whole topic. So, I ended up doing a major in medical physics, picking up any of the MRI classes that were offered along the way. I then worked for a few summers with Dr. Nicholas Bock at McMaster University, on intracortical myelin processing techniques. I chose to do my PhD with him, where I undertook a project studying cortical changes in bipolar disorder using T1-weighted imaging. My PhD experience was heavy on the processing side, but I also wanted to learn more about the physics of MRI. So that’s why I joined Christine’s lab.
MRMH: And you Christine?
Christine: I did my undergrad at McGill in computer engineering, specializing in signal processing. After I graduated, I wasn’t ready to move on to a job in industry. It was during a study abroad program in Glasgow that, while having a beer with colleagues in a pub actually, I first learned about MRI. It seemed like a natural progression to move from 1D signal processing to 2D and 3D image processing. So, I went to Imperial College London to do a one-year masters program, followed by a PhD at McGill and a post-doc in Germany. Although I still do some image analysis, I really enjoy working on the data acquisition part of MRI, so that’s what I focus on more now, here at The Neuro.
MRM: Maybe we could start to unpack the concepts of your paper a little bit for our Highlights audience. Could you introduce the concepts of MTR (magnetization transfer ratio) and MTsat, and explain why MT techniques are good for quantifying brain microstructure and myelination?
Chris: Sure. In MTR you acquire two images, one with and one without an MT-weighted preparation pulse. Generally this is an RF pulse that is applied off-resonance, on the order of 1-10 kHz. The energy from that RF pulse saturates the longitudinal magnetization of the bound pool protons, and then, through stochastic processes, transfers some energy to the water pool where it is observed in the form of decreased longitudinal magnetization. This leads to a water signal decrease that will be proportional to the quantity of bound protons in that voxel, providing us a measure of the macromolecular content. The MTsat technique is an extension of this technique that uses signal modeling to account for the T1 of the voxel that counteracts the MT contrast, which effectively reduces contrast between white and grey matter in the image. But in order to use MTsat, you need to know the T1 as well, so you have to acquire a third image that is T1-weighted. These three images can then be used to calculate the approximate percent signal drop achieved through application of your saturation pulse, and that’s what we call MTsat.
MRM: And so how does B1 come into the story?
Chris: So, this brings us back to the saturation pulse, which is modulated by the B1 profile that your subject experiences in the scanner. We can liken this to what you experience when you place food in the microwave, where the center of your meal will be colder and the edges will be warmer. In MRI, it’s the inverse; the energy your B1 deposits (proportional to the B1 map) will generally be higher in the middle and lower towards the outside. If you don’t correct for that, you’ll have more magnetization transfer in the center of the brain. Therefore, in order to measure something that’s reflective of pure anatomy, you need to correct for B1 in MT techniques.
Christine: B1 inhomogeneities have been haunting the quantitative MRI field for a long time. For me, this has been an issue from the beginning of my career in MRI research since B1 field variations are quite significant in the cortex. For MTsat, Gunther Helms did address B1 nonuniformity in his original paper. He showed that MTsat is relatively robust to small variations in B1. At 3T, a B1 map can be used to further improve MTsat using an empirical correction factor, as seen in work by Nikolaus Weiskopf. What I really like about the B1 correction that Chris has developed here is that it can be applied not only to widely used MTsat protocols, but also to broader applications such as ihMT.
MRMH: So, to summarize, previous approaches involving application of B1 correction to MTsat used empirical factors, whereas here you are properly modeling it so that it can be applied to different pulse sequences. What do you think is the major contribution of this concrete work to the field?
Chris: I think the major contribution is just the flexibility of the method. It was developed with ihMT in mind as, to date, I’ve seen very few papers that have used the same saturation or readout, which doesn’t lend well to using a standard empirical correction factor.
MRMH: Can you tell us about the modeling aspect of the study?
Chris: Yeah, so the idea behind the whole approach was that we can use modeling to account for the difference in MT caused by the differences in B1 values. To make it flexible for use in both MTsat and ihMT, we needed to model three pools: a water pool, a bound pool, and a dipolar pool. We then ran simulations through the differential equations to model the steady state signal changes for a range of different B1 values and tissue parameters. We found that there are two variables that seem to have a high impact on the MTsat value that you would get, namely the longitudinal relaxation rate R1 (1/T1) and the bound pool fraction.
MRMH: And all of this is done for 3T, right? How challenging would it be to apply this to higher field strengths, like 7T?
Christine: That’s our next challenge. Chris’ B1 correction method should work at 7T as well, despite the larger range of B1 variation. Obviously at 7T, SAR is a huge issue as well, so I think part of the challenge will be to optimize the acquisition parameters of the MT sequence to achieve the best MTsat efficiency.
Chris: Also, for the simulations, we need to know the tissue parameters such as the T1 and T2 for each the water and bound pools, magnetization exchange rate and relaxation time of the dipolar order. Because quantitative imaging has been around for so long at 3T, even though there’s still a lot of variability in the literature with regard to what those values are, you nevertheless have a good idea of the range and can simulate for that range. But the literature is not as well established for 7T, and so you’d have to run more simulations for a wider range of potential values. Because the B1 range is also a lot broader at 7T than at 3T, you’d have a much larger range of those values to simulate for, too.
MRMH: Lastly, what do you enjoy doing outside of work?
Chris: When I’m not in the lab, I’m generally on my bike riding around town and also racing, which has got me in trouble on occasions, landing me in hospital, but I’ve been lucky so far in Montreal. My PhD supervisor wanted me to stop. He saw me have a couple bad accidents, so it was a reasonable request! [laughs].
Christine: Outside of academia, I’d say in this phase in my life, it’s mainly about spending a lot of time with my family. My girls are 8 and 10 years old now and super active. So we spend our time playing sports, tennis, skiing, hiking, etc. And travelling… I am really looking forward to travelling again!We import promotional eye masks in black in the largest quantities which is why these eye masks are our cheapest option.

All on 4 Dental Implants
June 14, 2016, Langley Dental Practice
All-on- 4 implants are ideal for folks suffering from broken lower teeth, decayed teeth, or perhaps teeth experiencing gum condition. Since all the smile is supported by the enhancements, you may chew your foods just like when you had your natural teeth.
In addition to be able to this, the implants make life n smile in numerous other ways including:
When you ask many individuals suffering from malocclusions the majority of them will tell an individual they don't like typically the removable complete dentures since they quickly slip, demand maintenance requirements and prohibit them on the foods that they take. Many of the impacted the teeth are the lower types since they have to say with the ever-changing form of the jawbone. These kinds of implants usually are secure and cozy. This ensures of which you don't have problems with pain and poor oral health.
We can all acknowledge that teeth and bone fragments loss affect cosmetic dimensions. Not enough teeth could make you look more aged than you are. All-on- 4 enhancements offer you back the misplaced teeth thus restoring your current younger look.
Another approach that implants will alter your life is by simply improving your diet. Since mentioned above, individuals using dentures have limits within the types of food of which they eat. Most regarding them don't eat tough or crunchy foods. All-on- 4 implants are robust adequate to withstand the makes thus allowing you to be able to eat healthily and also a large variety of foods. An individual also be able to appreciate elevated bite strength.
Comprehending typically the all-on- 4 procedure
If an individual possess a teeth trouble, you should visit your current dentist. This technique requires placement of two enhancements at the front end of the posture. They are located from the position occupied by simply incisors. Two units usually are set at a 45 degree angle tilting away coming from the first implants. This specific is to maximize the program of the bone inside of which area. Typically the angle likewise helps with supplying better support for your replace teeth. When well attached, the implants have generally the ability to help a fantastic arch of 13 or simply 14 teeth.
All-on- 4 oral implants cost
Typically the price of the actual enhancements varies from $15, 000 to $24, 500. The variation comes regarding because of some factors this kind of as Kind of implants utilized,

- Part 1 : introduction
- Part 2 : the database server
- Part 3 : the Analysis Services server
- Part 4 : the Reporting Services server
- Part 5 : the Sharepoint server
- Part 6 : the TeamFoundation Server server
- Part 7 : the TeamBuild server
In this fifth post we will see what to do to rename the TeamFoundation Server server tfs.demo.local to tfs1.demo.local and make our service work again
TeamFoundation Server
First you need to rename the server
We can then reconfigure the Application Tier using the administration console:
- Start the admin console.
- Select the Application Tier node and click the Change URLs link:
- In the dialog window, update the Notification URL field with the new TFS server address:
- Click the OK button.
If you prefer to use command line tools, you can use the TfsConfig:
- Open a command prompt.
- Run the following command to update the notification url in TFS:
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010\Tools\tfsconfig" settings /notificationurl:
That’s it for the Application Tier part. We must now reconnect the TFS Sharepoint extensions.
Sharepoint
On the Sharepoint server we will reconfigure the TFS extensions for Sharepoint by using the TFS administration console:
- Start the admin console.
- Select the Extensions for Sharepoint Products node and click the Modify access link:
- In the dialog window, update the URL for Team Foundation Server field with the new address:
- Click OK.
That’s all for Sharepoint but now you must update it’s content.
Office Documents
If you have Excel or Project files in your Sharepoint document library that use the Team Explorer add-in to connect to TFS, you will need to update those files. Here is what to do for all your Team Projects using the Agile process template:
- Open the Product Planning document for editing:
- In the Team tab, click on Configure and select Server Connection :
- In the dialog window, click on Servers to add the server using it’s new URL.
- When the connection is create, select the server and the correct Team Project :
- Click on Connect.
- Redo steps 2 to 4 for every document. (yes this can be long… :))
Your documents are now reconnected. Note that you must also update the Visual Studio connection but i think everyone knows how to do this
TeamBuild
The last component to update is the build service. For this we must use the TFS admin console:
- On the build server, start the admin console.
- Select the Build Configuration node and click the Properties link:
- In the dialog window, if the service is started you must first stop it using the stop to make changes link:
- You can now update the Connect to Team Project Collection (outgoing) field with the new url:
- Click Start to restart the build service.
- Open the registry editor (regedit).
- Go to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\TeamFoundation\Build\ServiceHost.
- Update the ApplicationServerUrl value with the new URL.
- Restart the build service.
Your installion is back online using the new TFS server name. LNext time will rename the TeamBuild server.
Carpe Diem.Tan bathroom ideas
BATHROOM IDEAS – Most of us love brown as a neutral color that goes with all bathroom styles. The color creates a warm, homely and informal atmosphere for a bathroom.
Here we offer 10 brown bathroom models for those of you who want to change the neutral color. When we talk about a light brown bathroom model, we quickly remember those who like to sunbathe, and then get a tanned effect on their skin.
The tan values vary depending on the skin type. That leads us to present the 10 looks below.
Nice light brown bathroom
Our first recommendation actually practices a high-contrast bathroom concept in general. But the model looks soft thanks to the choice of colors. The bold hue comes from the gray tiles that make up the bathroom wall to highlight the closet.
The sink worktop looks a bit bold with the wood category. The light tone comes from the large, brown tiles that cover most of the bathroom walls and floors. When the lights are on, the light brown ceramic looks sunny.
That makes the bathroom really nice, especially with the flowers and the sink design.
Sweet Tan Bathroom
Such a cute and cute bathroom. The brown shade looks more concentrated compared to the first one. In combination with the white paneling, the tan creates a gentle contrast. The choice of color initially makes the room homely.
We love the entire bathroom design. The bathroom looks cozy despite the narrow space. It divides the bathroom into a few segments. Each of the sections has cute accessories. For example the leaves lying on top of the concrete wall.
The choice of ornaments lets us say that the bathroom looks cute overall.
Milky brown bathroom
Imagine a cup of chocolate milk with plenty of water. This occurs to us when we look at the shade of brown. Neither focused nor bright. The choice of tan appears on the bathroom wall.
The bathroom combines the tanned area with beige and brown. We admire that the bathroom optimizes the corner. It fills the room with the shower area and the wooden cabinet.
The simple idea turns the bathroom into a creative space despite the limited, square space. The windows ensure good air circulation in the bathroom.
Generous light brown bathroom
The sunny tan for the bathroom. The tanned taste appears on the bathroom wall. The tanned hue helps the beige shade brighten the bathroom. White hue does the job too.
The color combination brings the strong color tone of the wooden furniture and mirror edges into balance. The bathroom appears spacious not only through the furnishings, but also through the design of the ceiling.
The style of the wall lamp and the interior design make the bathroom look a bit vintage.
Soft brown bathroom
The tanned area appears on the bathroom wall. In fact, the tan tone is more concentrated compared to the previous examples. However, we tend to call the tanned segment the soft one because of the color painting.
The tanned wall looks delicate and corresponds to the theme color of the bathroom. The tanned color becomes a gentle variant for the brownish shade of the bathroom, which results from the material wood and flooring.
With the tanned area, the outdoor bathroom retains its natural look without appearing too neutral.
Warm light brown bathroom
The bathroom chooses the light shade of brown. The tanned effect looks warm instead. This is due to the weak rays produced by the lamps. The strategy aims to support the calm ambience for the bathroom.
The example shows that the tanned shade is suitable for a spacious bathroom. The picture shows that the bathroom is the most beautiful. It contains the vintage and classic furnishings.
With the holder model and the candles, the bathtub looks special. The seat offers space to relax.
Light brown bathroom
The light shade of the tan goes very well with this primitive bathroom. Because the tanned effect harmonizes with the primitive bathroom design, which normally relies on neutral colors.
Applying the tanned paint makes the bathroom feel soft and comfortable. In terms of content, the bathroom with the tub and washbasin area looks classy. There is the partition that acts as storage.
The specialty are the vintage ornaments like the towels and the wooden chair.
Vintage brown bathroom
The bathroom uses the same tan effect as the example of a light brown bathroom. The difference lies in the overall appearance of the bathroom. The pattern looks relaxed with the brownish hue that largely fills the room.
From the wooden part of the cabinet to the valance, the bathroom looks very brownish. The vintage taste comes from the bathroom. In nature, the bathroom looks quite similar to the light brown bathroom, but this one uses newer items.
Greasy brown bathroom
The bathroom is quite unusual. This is because the bathroom chooses the strong tan tone. The tanned effect creates a contrasting tone for the very narrow space. The color brings balance to the white sink area.
In addition, the tanned effect comes from the woods, which are arranged in this unique way. This is different from the previous examples where tanned colors are applied through wall painting.
That kind of makes the bathroom trendy.
Intense light brown bathroom
Similar to the bold brown bath, the last recommendation chooses the intense or concentrated shade of the tanning effect. We are referring to the part of the ceiling that is directly above the bathtub.
The tanned effect brings strong variations into the bathroom, which mainly chooses light brown and beige tones. The bathroom itself is suitable for a spa. It contains natural elements like marble so that the floor makes the room fresh.
This is how we package our 10 brown bathroom ideas. We hope the examples invite you to get creative with brown or other neutral colors. Despite the simple look, each of them has some shades that lead to trendy bathroom models.

Therefore in order to stop this trend developing amongst the Police and other public services - if they stop you then when they ask you what race you are simply reply 'Black African'.
The police cannot say you are not a Black African as the police as an institution regards race as a social construct not a genetic reality and therefore they allow individuals to self designate themselves as members of an specific racial or ethnic group.
Therefore if you say you are Black African then they have to report the stop and search as against a Black African.
If the Police think they can place the public at risk by this idiotic procedure and also target whites for stop and search simply as they are white and this will allow them to hit their targets in order to demonstrate some farsical politically correct 'anti-racism' procedure in the police - then they can think again.
Make sure you get you copy of the stop and search forms and check they have ticked the right box.
Once a few people start doing it - then the police will realise there is no point in doing such things in future.

He's a typical high school kid — he plays baseball and has a part-time job. But the work he does is pretty out of the ordinary. Burton has his own business painting custom shoes and cleats, and he paints them for professional athletes.
A Martinez visited Burton in his garage, which serves as his art studio, to find out how he started his business.
As a baseball player himself, Burton says, he'd always been into the latest gear and cleats. The New Balance cleats he'd always worn, until recently, weren't available with any sort of custom designs or colors.
"I wanted to be kind of different," Burton says. "I had seen people had been painting regular shoes, and so I figured why not try and take that to a cleat canvass."
His gigs for major leaguers started when he sent Enrique ("Kiké") Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers a message on Instagram.
"I just reached out to him, I told him I was a huge Dodger fan and that I just wanted to try painting a pair of cleats for him," Burton says. "He responded in a couple days and invited me down to Dodger stadium."
Luckily Hernández was impressed. He asked Burton to paint another pair for him, and helped him get in contact with other major leaguers.
After a start-up loan from his mom Sabrina, Burton's business, Wes Custom Kicks, was soon up and running.
In the summer, Burton has a lot of free time available to devote to painting cleats, but in the off-season (and when school is in session) he has to set some limits on his orders.
There's school to focus on, along with his own baseball team "that I need to give as much time as I can to," Burton says. "Cause that's my major dream is to be a professional baseball player myself. So, it's a balancing act."Efficient Techniques for Online Record Linkage
M.V.K.Kumar Varma"Efficient Techniques for Online Record Linkage"International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT),V3(3):1011-1016 Issue 2012 .ISSN 2231-2803.. Published by Seventh Sense Research Group.
Abstract: -Matching records that refer to the same entity across databases is becoming an increasingly important part of many data mining projects, as often data from multiple sources needs to be matched in order to enrich data or improve its quality. Record linkage is the computation of the associations among records of multiple databases. It arises in contexts like the integration of such databases, online interactions and negotiations, and many others. Matching data from heterogeneous data source has been a real problem. A great organization must resolve a number of types of heterogeneity problems especially non uniformity problem. Statistical record linkage techniques could be used for resolving this problem but it causes communication bottleneck in a distributed environment. A matching tree is used to overcome communication overhead and give matching decision as obtained using the conventional linkage technique.

To help get you ready, here are a few thoughts I try to keep in mind as I send out my own work.
1. Create tiers, but don’t be too strict about it. Most writers I know have some sort of tier system for journals to which they send. These lists are readily available on the Internet, many of them formulated by the number of selections each title has in year-end “Best of” anthologies. They can be helpful, if only to assist in keeping track of the hundreds of journals out there. But while you should, of course, send your best work to the top outlets, remember that a particular story/essay/poem of yours might be a great fit for a journal that happens to be in your second or third tier.
If that’s where you want it, send it there. It might work well online, rather than in print. Or it might fit better at a regionally-focused journal. Sure, it would be great if the New Yorker, the Atlantic, and, ahem, Ploughshares were all vying for our work, but as we know, that just ain’t the case. Don’t get hung up on rankings. Sometimes the best home is not the one everyone so desperately wants to make their way into, but the one where your work actually fits well.
2. Keep track of where you send your work and when. In part we do this so that should your story/essay/poem get picked up, you can withdraw it from the other outlets in a timely and professional manner. But you should also do this so that you can witness the life of a submission. You sent your story/essay/poem to ten journals and got ten rejections (okay, nine, because McSweeney’s never got back to you); did you make any changes to the piece before sending it to the next batch? Probably. How about after the next round? How similar to the first version was the one that finally got accepted? Looking back at how a story eventually came into publication is often an effective reminder not to send work out too early.
3. Quit sending out too early! Yeah, you want to get published, and yeah, most journals take a really long time to respond. But all you’re doing is lessening your work’s chances at your most coveted outlets. Writing takes patience. A story/essay/poem needs time. You need distance and perspective. Resist the temptation to send out right after clicking save. Set it aside. Start something new and let yourself get excited about it. Then go back when you have a draft or two of the new project done. The older piece will feel much less precious and you’ll be able to do some revising in earnest.
4. Don’t think an editor is going to run the last mile of your marathon. There are too many writers out there sending out for too few spots on journals. You can’t send something that’s 85% done and hope an editor is going to see all the potential you see. Rework your story/essay poem until it is as done as you can imagine it. Then rework it some more.
5. Keep your rejection slips. This is the life, brothers and sisters. It ain’t pretty, and those rejection slips are your battle scars. Put them in a folder or envelope or drawer or that little box where you used to stash your reefer. Sending your work out is hard. By that I don’t mean that it’s labor-intensive (especially now that more and more outlets are accepting online submissions), but that it’s emotionally draining. You have worked on that story/essay/poem for what? Two months? A year? More? And now you are putting it out there to be judged. Hold on to these little notes as reminders that you are doing your job.
6. Remember that some rejections are better than others. I know people who actually feel worse when they get a personalized or “nice” form rejection. (Or at least they pretend to feel bad about it as they humblebrag.) “Aw, I was so close!” they say. “Heartbreaker!” Yes, sure, it can be a heartbreaker, but given the bleak mathematics in the pages-to-writers ratio, it’s a pretty decent accomplishment to get anything other than the most terse of rejections. Those journals that almost publish you are likely going to remember your name—or at least the story title, which you should put into your next cover letter to them.
7. When you get one of those nice rejections, don’t send them something else that same day. The editors saw something in your work. Even though they aren’t publishing your story/essay/poem, they liked what they read. These aren’t just empty platitudes on a form rejection. If they really didn’t like reading your work, you wouldn’t have gotten that “nice” form letter. Don’t repay the kindness by sending them some half-baked scribbles. Send to them, and try to do it before there’s so much staff turnover that no one actually remembers your work, but don’t rush your work. Remember, set it aside for a while. Get some perspective. Every piece is judged on its own.
8. Take it easy on the Facebook updates, folks. My rule is this: you get one status update per journal publication. Save it for when the thing is actually published and available for reading. Why? Because if your “friends” can’t read it, then what’s in it for them? So no updates as soon as it gets accepted. Keep that for in-person conversations among those you actually know. It’s better to have people hear about your accomplishment once and think you’re a swell, accomplished person than to hear about it four times and think you’re a braggart.

Why Now?
In the course of our work, we are often in the position of explaining Bitcoin to investors and institutions approaching it for the first time. Never before have we seen more interest in Bitcoin and its potential as a digital companion to gold..
There has been no shortage of writing about Bitcoin over the past 11 years. This paper does not claim any novel insight. Instead, it is a summary of the conversation we often have with investors seeking to understand Bitcoin for the first time.
Money
“The two greatest inventions of the human mind are Writing and Money — the common language of intelligence and the common language of self-interest.”—Mirabeau
Money is an old and complex idea. Historically, it has taken many forms: from decorative axes and cowry shells to precious metals and representative paper. The last major shift was arguably in the early 1970s with the end of the US gold standard and the beginning of the modern fiat currency system.
We can think of money as a competitive market like any other. Gold dominated for centuries not by accident but by possessing important features such as being scarce and unforgeable. Today, fiat currencies dominate largely through local monopoly power, but all monetary assets still compete globally, with gold, US Dollars, and Euros favored as reserve assets.
Like written language, money is a protocol standard with immense network effects. A new monetary asset can only emerge if it better fulfills the core functions of money, and it can overcome the adoption hurdle of a new money. We believe Bitcoin offers a compelling answer to both.
Store of Value
One of the primary functions of money is to be a store of value: a mechanism to transfer purchasing power across time and geography.
All successful money fulfills this function. If a monetary asset loses trust as a store of value, then savings quickly flow elsewhere, as seen in hyperinflationary economies like Venezuela.
Gold
Gold has been trusted as a store of value for millennia. Importantly, the supply of gold on Earth is scarce. Confidence in this scarcity rests in humanity's understanding of nature: that gold cannot yet be cost-effectively synthesized (despite alchemists' best efforts throughout history).
Gold also has many other desirable properties, such as being easy to recognize (no tarnishing), easy to divide, easy to measure (by weight), and easy to verify (through melting), so it is no surprise that gold replaced predecessors to become a global standard.
Paper Currency and the US Dollar
Paper currencies emerged to simplify the daily use of precious metals as a means of exchange (another core function of money). Although paper notes were initially linked to precious metals, today most paper currencies are free-floating and established by government fiat.
The US Dollar is the leading fiat currency and has been the global reserve currency for much of the last century (replacing the British sterling before it). In addition to being a trusted store of value, the US Dollar is the leading means of exchange and unit of account. A significant share of global trade is priced and settled in US Dollars, whether or not the United States is directly involved.
Confidence in the US Dollar rests on trust in the government (e.g., to wisely manage its monetary policy). There is great efficiency in placing such trust in a single institution, but there is also risk. Fiat currencies can lose credibility and be devalued through the actions of the government, who in times of crisis may face short-term pressures that outweigh concerns for long-term credibility. Countries like Venezuela offer an extreme precedent for currency value in the face of eroding trust: the currency becomes worthless.
Many investors, including central banks, own both gold and US Dollars (or US Dollar-denominated assets) because they offer complementary trade-offs. We can think of the US Dollar as a centralized monetary asset, which can be devalued by a single actor, and gold as a decentralized monetary asset, which cannot.
Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a new decentralized monetary asset, akin to gold. It combines the scarce, money-like nature of gold with the digital transferability of modern currency. Although it remains relatively nascent, Bitcoin has great potential as a future store of value based on its intrinsic features.
As with any monetary asset, Bitcoin must be scarce, portable, fungible, divisible, durable, and broadly accepted in order to be useful. Bitcoin rates strongly across most of these dimensions, except for broad acceptability:
- Scarcity: Bitcoin supply is scarce, and asymptotically approaches 21 million coins. Achieving scarcity in digital form was Bitcoin's great technical breakthrough (building on decades of computer science research).
- Portability: Bitcoin is extremely portable, especially relative to gold. Arbitrary amounts of value can be held in a USB stick, or digitally transported across the globe in minutes.
- Fungibility: Any two Bitcoins are practically interchangeable, although each Bitcoin has a distinct history on the public ledger.
- Divisibility: Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units (called "satoshis").
- Durability: Bitcoins are durable and do not degrade over time.
- Broad Acceptability: Bitcoin’s primary weakness: it is far less broadly accepted than gold or US Dollars, although it has made impressive strides over the past decade. We can think of broad acceptability along two dimensions, both of which are important: the % of people who trust and accept Bitcoin, and the % of wealth that trusts and accepts Bitcoin.
Beyond these classic monetary features, Bitcoin is also:
- Digital: Digital money like Bitcoin is cheaper to store and easier to transfer than gold, which is physically cumbersome. Bitcoin is also instantly verifiable, whereas gold can require a slow and manual verification process.
- Programmable: Bitcoin is programmable, which has subtle but far-reaching implications. Today Bitcoin scripting enables applications like escrow or micropayments. Over time we may be surprised by what can be built with Bitcoin (much as we were surprised by the Internet, another programmable substrate).
- Decentralized and Censorship-Resistant: The rules of the Bitcoin network (such as its monetary policy) are governed by a decentralized peer-to-peer network, involving a disparate and global user base of consumers, investors, companies, developers, and miners. It is impractical (if not impossible) for a single actor to unilaterally influence the rules of the system. This affords Bitcoin holders a special kind of confidence: that Bitcoin cannot be devalued by arbitrary monetary policy decisions, and that they will always be able to hold and transfer their Bitcoin freely. This could be valuable not just to individuals and companies but also to governments whose foreign currency reserves may be subject to the whims of foreign entities.
- Universal: Similar to physical bearer assets like US Dollar bills or gold, Bitcoin is a digital bearer asset that anyone can hold and transfer. The same is not true of digital US Dollars (which require a bank account that supports US Dollars) or digital exposure to gold (which requires a brokerage account).
A broadly accepted store of value with the above features would represent a significant improvement over gold, but Bitcoin still lacks broad acceptance and remains nascent as a store of value (as compared to gold's millennia of history and credibility). A better product is not enough—Bitcoin must have a go-to-market strategy to reach broad acceptance.
Bitcoin as a Bubble. By definition, a store of value is an intermediate asset that people demand, not for its direct utility, but for its ability to be valuable in the future. This value is reflexive: people will believe in a store of value if they expect others to believe in it (who in turn should expect others to believe in it, and so on).
This phenomenon is distinct from other asset classes, which have utility-based demand, with speculation occurring around this underlying utility. For monetary assets, the utility is in the collective speculation itself.
As Nobel-laureate Robert Shiller observes: "Gold is a bubble, but it's always been a bubble. It has some industrial uses, but basically it's like a fad that's lasted thousands of years." This is not an argument against gold (or Bitcoin) as a valuable monetary asset, but an astute insight into the bubble-like, reflexive nature of money.
We can think of money as a bubble that never pops (or that hasn’t popped yet) and the value of fiat currency, gold, or Bitcoin as relying on collective belief. Other factors like a government's power, the industrial utility of gold, or the robustness of Bitcoin's codebase can help reinforce this belief, but belief is critical.
Such large amounts of value emerging from collective belief may seem circular and nonfundamental. However, there is real value in the social and economic coordination that monetary assets facilitate (much as there is real value in common language). Moreover, such collective belief cannot arise around any arbitrary asset—a successful monetary asset must compete to earn this belief based on intrinsic features. Having superior intrinsic features explains why gold is preferred to silver or fur pelts and Bitcoin is preferred to any number of Bitcoin copycats.
Bubbles as a Go-To-Market Strategy
If Bitcoin succeeds in becoming a trusted store of value, then its end state is to be a bubble. Bubbles are also how Bitcoin gains broader acceptance.
Throughout Bitcoin's 11-year history, there have been at least four Bitcoin bubbles of note.
- 2011: From ~$1 (Apr 2011) to ~$31 (Jun 2011) to ~$2 (Nov 2011)
- 2013: From ~$13 (Jan 2013) to ~$266 (Apr 2013) to ~$65 (Jul 2013)
- 2013-2015: From ~$65 (Jul 2013) to ~$1242 (Nov 2013) to ~$200 (Jan 2015)
- 2017-2018: From ~$1000 (Apr 2017) to ~$19500 (Dec 2017) to ~$3500 (Dec 2018). This dynamic is evident in the successively higher price floors that Bitcoin reaches during times of maximum disillusionment: ~$2 in 2011, ~$200 in 2015, and ~$3500 in 2018. Broader awareness also encourages the building of Bitcoin infrastructure by startups like Coinbase and incumbents like the CME and Fidelity, further improving Bitcoin's liquidity and utility as a monetary asset. Through successive bubbles, Bitcoin reaches greater levels of scale in users, transaction volumes, network security, and other fundamental metrics.
The Future of Bitcoin
As Bitcoin becomes more broadly accepted, what will its future look like? Some wonder whether people will be earning salaries or making everyday payments in Bitcoin. While these behaviors may exist to some degree, Bitcoin seems unlikely to challenge the US Dollar as the leading means of exchange and unit of account (at least anytime soon). Instead, Bitcoin.
Ultimately, monetary assets rise and fall on timescales that stretch beyond human lifespans, making them a challenge to forecast. There was a time before the US Dollar reigned when the reserve currency was British, or French, or Dutch, or further into ancient history, Greek or Roman. Similarly, there was a time before the adoption of gold when more primitive forms of money were dominant. The idea of a fiat currency like the US Dollar being untethered to gold is itself a recent phenomenon that seemed unthinkable half a century ago. In the future, it seems likely that the global monetary order could change in ways that would be unthinkable to us today, with digital currencies such as Bitcoin playing a significant role.
Market Size
As a decentralized store of value, it is most natural to consider Bitcoin's market size relative to gold, whose aggregate value is estimated to be ~$9T (May 2020) between central bank reserves (17%), private investment holdings (22%), jewelry (47%), and other miscellaneous forms (14%). Some but not all of this value is addressable by Bitcoin.
Over time, the market demand for assets like gold and Bitcoin could expand to exceed ~$9T, especially given the prevailing direction of global monetary policy. According to the IMF, total international reserves reached ~$13T in 2019 between gold (11%), foreign currency reserves (86%), and IMF-related assets (3%). If foreign governments (some of whom already bristle at their dependence on US Dollar FX reserves) begin to adopt Bitcoin as a complement to existing gold holdings, the market size for Bitcoin could expand significantly.
Beyond complementing gold's investment demand, Bitcoin may also address broader store of value markets indirectly. Consider, for example, people who hold fiat currencies with eroding credibility such as the Argentine Peso or the Turkish Lira, but who may have difficulty accessing US Dollars or gold. Or consider various collectibles like art or gemstones, some of which are owned primarily as stores of value. Or consider the empty NYC apartment that is owned by a foreigner interested in storing value outside his or her native country. Bitcoin could plausibly address subsets of these behaviors more effectively.
Deferring a precise estimate of market size, we believe it is clear that Bitcoin has significant headroom if it continues to gain broader acceptance.
Risks
Although it has come a long way in 11 years, many risks remain for Bitcoin:
- Crossing the Chasm: Bitcoin has gained credibility with early adopters, including some large institutional investors, but it remains niche relative to incumbent monetary assets like gold. There is risk that Bitcoin never achieves the broad acceptance that its proponents hope it will. Of course, therein also lies the opportunity. If Bitcoin were already a broadly accepted store of value, then it would likely be worth orders of magnitude more with relatively little remaining upside.
- Volatility: Bitcoin has been (and continues to be) quite volatile relative to US Dollars. There is risk that this volatility limits adoption or prevents investors from considering Bitcoin as a credible store of value. For better or worse, this volatility may be inherent to the process of Bitcoin adoption as natural swings in investor confidence (as faced by any early-stage upstart) are reflected in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin’s bubble-like adoption process exacerbates this effect. As Bitcoin matures and becomes more broadly accepted as a monetary asset akin to gold, investor confidence and Bitcoin prices should stabilize.
- Regulation: Bitcoin is a new currency and payment rail that sits outside of existing systems, posing a potential challenge to existing regulatory frameworks. Similar to early Internet regulation, there is hope that governments pursue nuanced regulation(s) that allow innovative use-cases to prevail. However, there is risk that regulation is onerous and ultimately hinders broader Bitcoin adoption. One mitigating factor is that Bitcoin is a global, decentralized network like the Internet, which is difficult to control for any single government, although governments can plausibly limit access to Bitcoin in various ways.
- Technical Risk: The Bitcoin codebase and network have been battle-tested for over a decade, but it continues to evolve and there remain some open questions about how the system might behave in the long run (for example, when the Bitcoin supply approaches its asymptote and miners must be compensated primarily with transaction fees rather than block rewards).
- Competitive Risk: Other cryptocurrencies could compete with Bitcoin, as could digital fiat currencies sponsored by governments. Relative to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has a strong first-mover advantage in acceptance, security, and credibility that will be difficult for competitors to overcome. Relative to digital fiat currencies, Bitcoin remains differentiated in its scarce, gold-like nature. Digital US Dollars or digital Renminbi would still be subject to local monetary policy decisions, although they have the benefit that they are currency units people already know and use.
- Unknown Unknowns: We must acknowledge that a digital monetary asset such as Bitcoin has never existed before. We are in uncharted territory with more uncertainty than is typical.
Conclusion
Bitcoin is a new monetary asset that is climbing an adoption curve. Although it is not yet a broadly accepted store of value, Bitcoin has great potential as a future store of value based on its intrinsic features.
Since monetary assets do not arise frequently, Bitcoin is likely to challenge our ordinary intuitions, and it has stirred (understandable) controversy in the investment world.
Therein lies the opportunity, of course. We believe Bitcoin offers a compelling risk/reward profile for patient, long-term investors willing to spend the time to truly understand Bitcoin. We hope this paper provides a helpful starting point.

-The global general aviation show AERO Friedrichshafen – that has been successfully taking place at Lake Constance, in Germany, for over 40 years – is now set to expand to South Africa in July of this year.
From July 4 to 6, Messe Frankfurt South Africa will play host to the first AERO South Africa. The show will be held at the Wonderboom Airfield, in Pretoria. Messe Frankfurt South Africa enthuses that the expansion of the show is thanks to a close partnership between events management company Messe Friedrichshafen and trade fair organiser Messe Frankfurt.
The AERO South Africa show is poised to be Africa’s largest general aviation trade show. The event will expose visitors to the latest advances, developments, products and services across the aviation industry.
The show will demonstrate the capabilities of everything from ultralights and gliders to business jets, helicopters, remotely piloted aircraft and electric aircraft as well as avionics and maintenance. Various companies will be afforded the opportunity to showcase their cutting-edge products and services. The event will also be attended by leading industry experts, enthusiasts, aviation companies, flight training schools, pilots, business jet owners and private aircraft owners.
The show hopes to establish four unique focus areas which will cater to industy and enthusiast needs. The focus areas will include: an operational focus such as test flight facilities that will also enable the fly-in of visitors, an exhibitor focus ensuring that exhibits are affordable and diverse and present as the ideal platform for manufacturers and suppliers to engage with the general aviation industry, and a visitor focus that will provide valuable information to guests and allow them an opportunity to view the latest products and innovations. Finally, the show will establish a content focus that will result in the establishment of workshops and experimental zones where visitors can keep up to date with industry developments while experiencing the latest innovations.
“The collaboration with Messe Frankfurt South Africa underscores the great significance that the AERO Friedrichshafen brand enjoys around the world. In addition, Messe Frankfurt is well positioned in South Africa to favourably entrench the AERO brand there,” says Messe Friedrichshafen CEO Klaus Wellmann.
Messe Frankfurt head of AERO Roland Bosch states that Messe Friedrichshafen is the ideal partner, as its South African subsidiary, based in Johannesburg, possesses important local expertise thanks to its many events, as well as operational resources.
Messe Frankfurt South Africa CEO Konstantin von Vieregge adds that, “AERO South Africa perfectly rounds out the company’s South African portfolio, as it already offers the largest automotive and boating trade shows in the country and, with this new aviation trade show, will thus cover all three elements. The company is looking forward to close cooperation with the Messe Friedrichshafen team.”
With this move, AERO has underscored its strong international aspirations. The European event holds the top spot in the rankings of industry trade shows for general aviation.
“South Africa is a classic land of aviation: the number of aircraft is high, but owing to the current average age of this inventory, the need for contemporary aircraft and the corresponding modernisation of the infrastructure is great,” says Bosch, assessing the market situation. Further, he adds that the Johannesburg and Pretoria regions are the most important hot spots in South Africa from a business perspective.
Messe Friedrichshafen further reveals that it anticipates that AERO’s international presence will further expand in the next few years. Messe Friedrichshafen’s China branch states that it is experiencing an encouraging uptick in global business activities.
The twenty-seveth AERO Friedrichshafen will again take place from April 10 to 13 this year, at Lake Constance, in Germany.

First a bearish flag, and now a bearish pennant? Looks like the bears are in control of USD/CAD! It seems that sellers are gearing up for a break of the falling wedge that I pointed out in yesterday’s post. For now, I suggest you keep a close eye on this pair and be ready if and when price shoots off for new lows. A solid bearish marubozu candle could be a solid signal that this pair may be headed for the .9900 handle..
GBP/JPY: 4-hour
Lastly, here’s an update on Guppy. The pair is STILL trading within a symmetrical triangle, bouncing between the falling and rising trend lines. Now that price is testing the upper resistance level for the SIXTH time, will we finally see a breakout? A solid candle close above the 123.00 handle may give the bulls enough fuel to break this pair out of consolidation..Associated parks:

“Oh goody! We get to go around again!”
We had another early morning in store for us. Luckily our hotel was very close to our next park. Once Barry Short and I ate a quick breakfast at the hotel, we checked out and made our way to the first park of the day.
====Wild Waves & Enchanted Village====
I had no expectations for this park at all. I knew it was home to a new wooden coaster as well as a few other rides, but I had nothing to go by. As we pulled into the parking lot we couldn’t help by notice the obvious draw to this park is the water park. So much so in fact that the amusement park is listed with smaller letters on the main sign. From the outside it didn’t look like the water park was all that large. Once we walked inside the rest of the water park came into view. I wouldn’t exactly call it large, but it did look like it had a lot of stuff to do. There was no chance I was going to sample some of those things as it was very cool outside and getting wet was at the bottom of my list of things to do this morning.
In order for us to get to the coaster we were having ERT on, we had to hike up a large hill. Barry and I joked around with Steve Gzesh by saying this was the Northwest version of Magic Mountain, but with more rides that operate. =:^)
----Timberhawk: Ride of Prey----(#590)
I have heard mixed reviews about this coaster. Since this is the first S&S woodie, I was looking forward to riding it. Because we were riding it the first thing in the morning I honestly didn’t expect much at all. The coaster looked nice as we were walking up to it and I couldn’t see much of the layout. As we walked into the station and hopped into one of the trains, we got our first surprise of the day. The seatbelts.
I am not sure of the reason why, but one end of the seatbelt was quite long, while the other was so short you had to really look for it when you sat down. You virtually couldn’t see the belt on the other end of the buckle as it was tucked so far down into the seat. Once we figured out a way to fasten the strange belts, we left the station and headed up the lift hill.
I noticed that on one side of the coaster it appeared the railing area looked like a dense fence or something. There was no space from the track up to the hand rail. My guess is they did this for noise control?
Once at the top of the lift we slowly curved about 180 degrees before flying down the first drop, filled with some nice head choppers. We then climbed up into a small hill before reaching the first turnaround. There was quite a bit of banking in this turn so I thought we would fly through it but that wasn’t the case. The train did track this section well though.
I can’t remember the exact layout from here on but I do remember diving down once again and raising up into the structure where a nice moment of airtime was felt. I think there was one other moment like it someplace else as well. The ending of the ride contained two brake runs. Because of the strange seat belts, we spent a few minutes waiting to go back into the station while people were strapping in. The crew looked like they were trying to dispatch as fast as they could but almost everyone had trouble with those belts. Supposedly the belts are going to be redone during the off season.
During ERT I ended up riding more and more. With each ride it seemed the ride was getting a bit faster, but not totally wild. This isn’t a bad thing as the ride was clearly designed for families. I think it is the perfect family coaster and I enjoyed all the rides I got on it. It’s only fitting if you think about it. The first coaster from CCI was more of a family ride as well.
Once the park was opened we walked our way around the rest of the park. The park itself is pretty small with most rides on one side, the water park on the other, and a lake in the middle. Steve took us around to a heavily wooded area where some more rides sat.
There was a small Zamperla powered coaster but we decided not to ride. The layout was really small but the cars reminded me of Magnum’s. How weird. Near this powered ride was our next coaster.
----Klondike Gold Rusher----(#591)
This Zamperla mouse looked identical to the other two versions I rode a few weeks before at La Ronde and Magic Springs. As with those versions, this version was totally brakeless. The last couple of turns were real rib smashers, but in a good way. Once we were done riding we spent a few minutes watching other people getting slammed around on the last couple of turns. It was pretty funny considering most people didn’t expect the ride to be so strong.
As we made our way down to the next and final coaster at this park, we passed one of those park caricature deals. You know? The ones where you sit down and someone makes a funny cartoon drawing of you. There were samples of some of the work you could expect. I swear to you. One of the drawings looked just like porn star Ron Jeremy. Barry and Steve agreed. We had to do a double take when we saw it. I think Barry might have even shot footage of it.
----Wild Thing----(#592)
This Arrow looper looked to be just like the version I missed at Great Escape. I did get to ride a similar version at Libertyland so I kind of knew what I was in store for. While we were in line we got to meet up with Jerry Williard. We talked about various things including Steve’s imitation of an infamous Silverwood “rap” before hopping into our train. The layout of the ride is simple. Lift. Turn. Drop. Loop. Corkscrews. Brakes. Repeat?
Even though there are no signs stating the policy, one ride on this coaster consists of two laps. With the exception of a lot of kiddie coasters, and a couple of other rides I have ridden, there aren’t many parks that operate a ride like this. Luckily the ride wasn’t that rough and doing two rides was pretty easy.
Once we had ridden all the coasters in the park, we walked back up to Timberhawk and got another ride or two. Steve and I also took a ride on the Falling Star which overlooked the lake and water park. I couldn’t believe there were people in the water park. It was pretty chilly out but that didn’t seem to stop the locals.
Our lunch took place on top of a building in the water park area. The same vendor that supplied us with our great lunch the day before was on hand again to give us even more of a variety. While we were eating, introductions and announcements were made on a PA. A park spokesman answered a few questions for the crowd before the picnic ended.
We could have stayed all day in the park but Barry and I wanted to go to another park. After talking to friends Tim Baldwin and Jeff Siefert, they almost had us sold on going back to the Puyallup Fair with them to try and grab a ride on the water coaster as we had heard it was running. After doing some checking we found out the coaster wasn’t open. It was a hard credit to get and it didn’t look like we were going to be able to ride it. Oh well. Maybe another time?
Barry and I left the park and decided to try and find a tiny park east of Seattle. It was home to one kiddie coaster. Since we were in the area and didn’t know when we would be back, we wanted to try and ride everything we could.
We headed to the east side of Seattle via some real hilly roads and beautiful scenery. Both Barry and I were blown away by the look of the whole area. While there were mountains all around us, we never did see Mount Rainer again as it was too cloudy. Our drive took us on a main highway as well as a small two lane road through a town. We thought we would get lost finding our next park but it ended up being fairly easy.
====Remlinger Farms====
As we drove down the small dirt road leading up to the park, or farm, we weren’t sure what to expect. As the place came into view we had doubts about the place. This certainly didn’t look like any park I have been to, but then again, it was on a farm. We walked inside and into an area that had all kinds of crafts for sale. We followed a couple of signs telling us where to purchase wristbands for the rides. We ended up at two check out lanes like you would find at a grocery store, complete with conveyor belts and all.
Three women were standing there. Two of them greeted us. The third woman looked like she had just purchased something. Upon closer look, the third woman was another enthusiasts and friend named Susan. I shouldn’t have been surprised to see any other enthusiasts here but considering the nature of the place, I was. Susan had just purchased a wristband and headed off to go ride the coaster. Barry and I purchased our wristbands and talked with the kind women for a couple of minutes. They were so happy that we would come all the way out this way to check out the rides. We told them to expect more of us and they seemed even happier to hear that news.
Barry and I walked into the park. This has got to be one of the strangest parks I have ever been to. It’s aimed at families and kids so there were all kinds of tiny rides like a Ferris Wheel that had 4 cars on it and was about 8 feet tall. There was an area where kids could play in the hay as well as a tiny suspended carousel. The whole area was, just, odd. It had kind of a Lightwater Valley vibe to it for some reason. The coaster we wanted to ride was in the back portion of the park.
----Mine Twister----(#593)
As we walked up to it we could see Susan enjoying a ride. This coaster looked exactly like the two coasters we weren’t allowed to ride at the Puyallup Fair. I guess this place had no problem letting adults ride. The entrance for the ride has a nice mine theme to it, but we couldn’t walk through the mine to get to the ride because it was roped off with a small sign.
“Ride closed. Come back in 45 minutes after I take my lunch break.”
Oh oh!
We honestly didn’t want to spend 45 minutes in the park waiting to ride this coaster. No offense to the park, but we did have something else planned once we left this place. We walked over to the exit and asked Susan how she got on the ride. She said she went through the mine entrance. When we told her it was now closed, the single ride operator came over to us and asked us if we wanted to ride now and pushed opened the exit gate. He didn’t have to do that but it was very cool that he ended up giving one last ride before he went to lunch. Susan joined us on our ride as well. Just as some of the other coasters this size, it seemed to be more fun with some friends.
Once we were done taking a few laps, we decided to leave the park and head to our next destination. We said goodbye to the nice ladies that we talked to a few minuets before and headed out. As we were leaving we saw more enthusiasts show up. I looked like they were going to have to wait a while before they rode as the ride operator for the coaster walked away from the ride when we left.
We left the green hills of the area and headed into the Seattle area. We drove across a pretty long bridge that skirted the water just as the Seattle skyline grew closer and closer. Our next park we were visiting was actually the first park we went to at the start of the trip, but this time the rides were running. As we were driving around the Space Needle area looking for parking, we saw friends Cindy (I am sorry I forgot your last name) and Martin Valt from England. Martin had come the longest way for this event and was doing the same thing we were. Riding as much as we could.
===Fun Forest Amusement Park===
The first thing we noticed was the Fabbri Booster that was being dismantled a couple of days before was now gone. At first we didn’t see any activity in the park, but as we continued to walk up to it, we saw one of the coasters running. As we were walking up to purchase tickets, we ran into Marlon Scott and Lisa Scheinin. Both of them warned us the larger coaster was pretty violent if you sit in the front and to hold on.
----Windstorm----(#594)
This was a standard Windstorm coaster. It looked shorter than the rest for some reason but as we walked up to it we could tell it just sat lower in the ground than the most. I think I have ridden 6 different versions of this ride so I had an idea what to expect. Barry and I rode in the back row. There were only two other people on the train when we dispatched.
For those of you that are not familiar with the ride, the highlight of the ride for many people (including myself) is the mid-course, 80-degree twisting drop. Every time I ride one of these things that drop always surprises the hell out of me. This was no exception. While the rest of the ride was a bit shaky in some areas, I didn’t find it to be very violent or rough. I guess I am glad we didn’t ride the front.
As we were walking away from the ride we ran into enthusiasts Deb Oliver and Bob Velbeck. They decided to ride the front. We could tell they were being thrown around quite a bit but they didn’t seem to mind. As we were headed towards our next ride, I counted up the tickets I had left. The next ride would only use 2 of my tickets. I gave the rest away to two other enthusiasts who were just about to purchase more tickets.
----Rainbow Chaser----(#595)
Yep, another kiddie coaster. This one was almost identical to the one we had just ridden at Remlinger Farms. Adults were allowed to ride this one as well. I can’t even remember how many laps we got on the thing as I stopped counting at 8. I spent the rest of the ride looking straight up at the Space Needle as it was directly overhead. It was just weird looking up at it and watching it rotate as we made our way around the oval layout. I told Deb to look up as well but I am not sure if she got the same effect as I did.
Once our ride was finished, we headed back to the car and started the nice 3 hour drive to our next country.
Canada.
The drive itself was fairly nice with some large mountains in the distance. For a good 30 miles of the drive we noticed large banners that hung off the side of almost every bridge we drove under. They all were very patriotic and reminded us never to forget September 11th, which just happened to be this day. Lost of people were standing on the bridges as well, waving. We would honk as we would drive under each bridge with a banner.
Once we reached the border we expected to be delayed considering one of my last experiences with border guards. As we pulled up to the booth, a guard asked us the standard questions and wanted to know exactly why we were heading to Vancouver. When we told him we were going to the PNE, he looked confused and asked if it was still open. When we told him we were part of a coaster enthusiasts group that was having an event there, he smiled and told us to have a good day. That was very easy!
We continued our drive into Canada and made our way to one of the most beautiful cities I have ever seen. I have never seen a picture of Vancouver and I was speechless seeing it for the first time. It was amazing looking from far away. The next day we would be getting a much better look at it but my first glance at the city is one I won’t be forgetting anytime soon.
We made our way to our hotel in Burnaby. As we were walking up to the hotel we looked over to the right of us and noticed a large group of people taking pictures of something. We looked over and were kind of shocked to see a large MGM movie/TV studio. There was a sign at the top of one of the sound stages that listed the shows they film there. Shows like Outer Limits, Smallville, Dead Like Me, and a couple of others.
Our room faced the studios. It must be a popular place as we saw many people taking pictures of it. Even a few tour busses showed up so people could get out and take pictures. We would have loved to check out more of the place but we went and grabbed dinner at a pizzeria. By the end of dinner I was very tired and just wanted to get some sleep. I was really looking forward to the next day as I have heard nothing but good things about what we were going to ride.
Next up…..
A park with an amazing setting and amazing rides, and one last chance to make the trip complete.

I am not sure what it was doing there. They also had a Top Spin (or something similar) that looked like it was temporary as well.

Isn't that the scary one in Minnesota?
Remlinger Farms was a very cute place. It reminded me a lot of the orchard/market type of place that I used to go with my mom to when I was a kid growing up in Southcentral PA. The funniest moment of the weekend happened on the Mine Twister when a little kid asked my wife and I why we were riding such a small coaster? I didn't have the heart to explain to him in front of his mom what a credit ho was ;)
Looks like you are about to hit the 600 mark eh? :-)
For me, reading TR's like about parks I really know little about is much more informative than going to their respective websites, etc.
You always add a little *more*...the towns, scenery, your funny (and sometimes not os funny) experiences while on the road.
Great tips for trip planning. ;-)
That area sounds absolutely beautiful!
Someday. ;-)

Yep. That's the one. I have never been to the place but I have seen creepy footage of it.
Dutchman,
I didn't even think to look to see if there was a train. We were in and out of that place in a matter of minutes. I guess that's the down side of cre-ho'ing.
Thanks Tina. I know you would love the area up there. It really was incredible looking. Let's put it another way. It sure wasn't Arkansas. =:^)
Rob,
Wooops. Sorry dude.
To be honest, I didn't know there were a few Buzzers that lived in the area. I am not big on the Meeting Calendar as I had a pretty bad experience on a coaster trip because I told someone I was going to be at a certain park. Ever since then I don't respond to roll call lists or anything like that.
I am sure you are cool though. You have to be. You post here. =:^)
-Sean
I NEVER respond to those meeting calendars.
I don't know about you meeting Rob, Sean. :-D Rob is the biggest stalker of all......or is that me stalking him? I keep forgetting. ;-)
Na, Rob is THEE coolest of the cool. You'll like him.
-Tina
Yes, I don't 'always' appreciate a good stalking, but it seems that most people that post here have become online friends that I trust (to a certain degree). I might not have them out to my house for dinner, but meeting somewhere for a few hours is pretty cool, and gives you a chance to bail when they are freakier than you realized. ;)
Sean, you sound just fine to me. :)
The Flying Turns makes all the right people wet - Gonch
(Actually, I was quite pleased with myself on that parking job, given I'd just gotten the car that afternoon and the visibility on it was VERY different than the cars I'm used to. :) )

When yu were at Remlinger was the train running?They have Crown live steamer, which is always worth a ride.
The train was running that day. We wanted to ride it but unfortunately when we were in the park it was close to the point in the afternoon when they shut down the rides for lunch.We’re only a week and a half into the new decade, but already I’m seeing a trend…
A few days ago Sean Carroll’s book From Eternity to Here came out, promoting the idea that understanding time and cosmology is all about understanding entropy. The same day saw Erik Verlinde’s arXiv preprint On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton, which argues that
Gravity is explained as an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies.
Verlinde is a well known string theorist, and the paper is somewhat of a repudiation of the motivating idea for string theory unification, that string theory predicts gravity since it has a spin two massless state. But even with the main motivation gone, all is not lost for string theory, since
The presented ideas are consistent with our knowledge of string theory, but if correct they should have important implications for this theory as well. In particular, the description of gravity as being due to the exchange of closed strings can no longer be valid. In fact, it appears that strings have to be emergent too.
This is discussed in blog postings here, here and here, and yesterday even made it to Slashdot.
Today, it’s yet more entropy, with The Entropic Landscape by Bousso and Harnik, which propounds the Entropic Principle, that:
the number of observers is proportional, on average, to the amount of entropy produced.
and claims that this principle quantitatively predicts six important aspects of cosmology.
While much of physics in the last century was dominated by a highly successful program to identify fundamental degrees of freedom of nature and understand their dynamics using increasingly deep and sophisticated mathematical formalisms, now the trend appears to be very different. Many of the most well-known theorists are pursuing research programs with the remarkable features that:
The last century was a hugely successful one for physics, whether this new order will be equally successful remains to be seen.
Update: More analysis of the Verlinde paper here, and Verlinde now has a blog and a twitter feed about it.
Update: Verlinde is adding explanations of points in his paper and conducting a discussion of it on Lubos Motl’s blog here. He now says that, to explain quantum gravity
I am not sure that string theory is the way to go.
Even though under his new framework string theory explains nothing about any fundamental physics, Verlinde refuses to give up on it, arguing that:.
“I have one word for you son… biology!”
The future of physics lies where experiments will be done, or where data is already awaiting analysis. Interpolation, not extrapolation.
Pingback: Occam’s Machete » Blog Archive » Does the Whole Shebang Emerge From Entropy?
Erik Verlinde’s paper should arguably be regarded as a review article providing an accessible overview of some fairly well-known work done by others over the past 15 years. In particular, his references include the following:
[7] T. Jacobson, “Thermodynamics of space-time: The Einstein equation of state,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 1260 (1995)
arXiv:gr-qc/9504004
[14] T. Padmanabhan, “Thermodynamical Aspects of Gravity: New insights,” arXiv:0911.5004 [gr-qc], and references therein.
Padmanabhan has developed these ideas in several papers.
In addition, see the papers of Ariel Caticha, including the following:
“The Information Geometry of Space and Time”
arXiv:gr-qc/0508108 [26 Aug 2005 (v1)]
“From Entropic Dynamics to Quantum Theory”
arXiv:0907.4335 [24 Jul 2009 (v1)]
I would also offer the general comment that arguments from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics played an extremely important role in arriving at an understanding of the microscopic dynamics of matter in the early 20th century. I think it is eminently reasonable at this stage to suppose that explorations of the deep interconnections of thermodynamics, entropy, and gravitation will play an equally important role in arriving at the unified understanding of the dynamical underpinnings of gravity and quantum fields that we don’t yet possess.
The definition of entropy is hyperplane dependent, as is its thermodynamic dual, temperature. That’s a problem. [As a matter of definition, something that is not hyperplane dependent would not be entropy, although clearly it is conceptually possible to introduce “measures of randomness” that are not associated with phase space. The vacuum state of QFT on Minkowski space is Lorentz and translation invariant, and introduces Gaussian fluctuations that are hyperplane independent, but quantum fluctuations are distinct from thermal fluctuations (which, again, are not Lorentz invariant).]
As far as empirical success is concerned, SR, GR, and QM were all inspired by empiricist approaches, of different kinds, but at least partly inspired by the 19th Century epitome, thermodynamics (in contrast to statistical mechanics). The descent back into model-building realism, particularly since 1950, say, is questionable (Chad Orzel has an IHE article in which he characterizes Physics as being about models — I imagine Pierre Duhem is turning in his grave). The descent into Platonic realism about mathematical models is even more questionable. So, the great successes of the 20th Century could be said to be more rooted in the 19th Century, and a return to an updated empiricism might be a good thing.
Peter, your link to Chad Orzel’s IHE article seems to be null. Could you post a follow-up with a correction?
In the context of mentioning Padmanabhan, he also had an attempt to refute the massless spin-2 in “From Gravitons to Gravity: Myths and Reality” to which Deser cared to reply recently
Peter, your irony is honest, but some of it may be a little bit misplaced.
# You don’t need to have any idea what the fundamental degrees of freedom are.
Of course, this attitude is wrong. We need to know the fundamental degrees of freedom. Not looking for them is a way to avoid solutions; you are right on this.
# You don’t need any fundamental dynamical laws either.
This point is more delicate. If macroscopic dynamics, such as space-time curvature, is a statistical effect, there is a certain independence from the fundamental dynamics. So this point may be an acceptable one, at least partly or temporarily.
# You can do everything with high school mathematics.
This point is also delicate. “everything” is surely too much. But Verlinde’s paper is, in large part, the non-relativistic version of Jacobson’s. And nonrelativistic gravity is done, as we all know, with high-school maths. What is wrong here? There is only one thing that is wrong: that since 1995, when Jacobson wrote his paper, almost nobody was interested in his result. Both Jacobson and Verlinde show that, independently of the specific microscopic degrees of freedom, gravity results from their statistical properties. This is an old idea, going back to Smolin and others.
You are right to say that this cannot be the end of the story: we need to find the underlying degrees of freedom. But there are many people who do not even think that such degrees of freedom exist. For them, Jacobson and Verlinde are good: they make them start thinking.
Besides, there should be something about Jacobson and Verlinde that you should really like: these arguments are very much 3+1-dimensional. Verlinde talks about string theory as well, but in fact everything is 3+1-dimensional. (Jacobson, for example, does not mention string theory at all.) In fact, their work is discretely pulling the rug under the idea of higher dimensions. I at least, was very much astonished to see a string theorist like Verlinde writing this, because this means that he is slowly, but definitely leaving string theory – even though he does not yet admit.”
At the most fundamental level, I would just imagine physical dynamics are described by change of entropy – I can’t imagine any more fundamental principle which could possibly describe change.
Pingback: “On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton” by Erik Verlinde « The Language of Bad Physics
The award winning 2004 Ph.D. dissertation of Tamara Davis from University of New South Wales (P.C. Davies on her committee) Figs 1.1 & 5.1 are very relevant to this discussion. The dark energy density we detect in our past light cone is the inverse area of our future event horizon in our future light cone. Therefore, it’s our future event horizon that must be the hologram screen acting retro-causally in the sense of Wheeler-Feynman’s total absorber. Indeed the increase in area of our future horizon from inflation to its asymptotic constant de Sitter value in the causal diamond of our observable universe (defined by T. Davis) explains why the thermodynamic arrow of time is in same sense as the cosmological arrow and why the entropy of the early universe is so relatively small at the moment of inflation.
(I found Chad Orzel’s most recent IHE article; I’m not sure it’s the one Peter Morgan had in mind.)

Hans-Peter, you react fairly strongly against Peter’s “You don’t need to have any idea what the fundamental degrees of freedom are”, but I think this is a significant aspect of a statistical approach.
We can achieve an empirically adequate model with effective degrees of freedom, whereas at some point in the future we will need to introduce a model that has different DOFs to achieve empirical adequacy to updated experimental data. Although it is possible that there is an endpoint to this process of refinement, there is no guarantee that there is.
Chris W., sorry about the link problem. I had in mind the IHE article referred to in Chad’s “Uncertain Principles” blog post,.
I would be more inclined to suggest that this is the entropy century!
Entropy is critical because of its relationship to inference. We are finding that the “laws” of physics are rules that tell us how to make the best inferences given our current states of knowledge. Probability and entropy are central to this point of view since probability is a measure on the space of logical statements that one can make about a system, and dually, entropy quantifies (not technically a measure) the relevance of questions one can ask about a system.
There is nothing physical about entropy. This has led to great confusion in the past. Entropy quantifies the amount of information one would need to know the particular details about a given model.
Similarly, the idea that information drives a system is faulty. Deriving laws based on probability and entropy does involve information that the one performing inference possesses, but ultimately the system is merely “driven” in the most probable direction. The fact that we get the right answer doesn’t mean that the information is driving the system. It means that we took into account all of the relevant information in making our predictions, and that this relevant information was sufficient to make an accurate prediction.
The result is that we don’t get a theory of *why* something evolves the way it does. Instead we get a theory telling us which is the most probable scenario.
I have been pursuing these ideas for the last decade now along with Ariel Caticha and others, and am astounded at what the community involved in this research has uncovered. This new perspective of physical law as inferential reasoning brings a unity and utility that previous interpretations lack. My belief is that these ideas will break through the stagnation that theoretical physics saw in the last century and propel us to new heights.
The only substantial clue we have as to the link between quantum mechanics and gravity is black hole thermodynamics, so entropy looks like a sensible place to start. Many of the deepest ideas in physics (Faraday’s field concept, Einstein’s relativity) came not out of sophisticated math but careful analysis of the foundations of physics.
See Erik Verlinde’s latest post (13 January), scroll down to the following paragraph, and read from there:
Verlinde states that he does not believe that string theory is a fundamental theory any more, because gravity is not a fundamental force, but he also states that string theory has a right to exist as a UV completion of QFT, and as a tool that gives valuable hints.
So his statement is a repudiation of string theory as the most fundamental theory, but not of string theory as a unification of the four forces (note that we have to drop the ubiquitous “fundamental” here).
I’ll pick just two examples of the many points that confuse me, maybe someone likes to fill me in on Verlindes intentions:
First point:
“Many physicists believe that gravity, and space-time geometry are emergent. Also string theory and its related developments have given several indications in this direction.”?
Second point:
Verlindes talks about space to be emergent, but supposes microscopic dynamics including the existence of “time”. If you start from GR, then this is impossible: Either you have space and time or you have none. Spacetime itself describes causal relationships, i.e. relationships of events, and this requires both notions. How does one reconcile GR with having time at a microscopic level and space as an emergent macroscopic phenomenon?
On a side note I don’t quite understand the amount of attention this paper receives. What’s so fascinating about it?
Tim vB,
I’m not the best person to respond to your queries, but I’ll take a stab at it.
Point 1: In string theory’s original formulation, a background spacetime was indeed assumed, but as work has pointed towards a deeper, non-perturbative formulation (M-theory) it has become doubtful that this can be maintained. Edward Witten has been fairly explicit recently that spacetime must ultimately be emergent. Exactly what this means, and what such a theory should look like, has remained obscure.
Point 2: “If you start from GR…”. Again, no one is sure whether, or exactly how, this can work, although a number of provocative ideas have been under investigation for quite a few years. Causal set theory is one example.
Why all the attention? Interest in the deep interconnections of entropy, thermodynamics, and gravity goes all the way back to the 1960s, when the so-called 4 laws of black hole mechanics were formulated, essentially as theorems in general relativity. Ostensibly they simply described the geometry of balck holes, but it was quickly noticed they bore a striking resemblance to the laws of thermodynamics. As a graduate student of John Wheeler, Jacob Bekenstein decided to take this analogy seriously and conjecture that they were in fact the laws of thermodynamics in a geometrical guise. He drew out some of the implications of this, and his conjecture was soon vindicated by Stephen Hawking’s discovery that a semiclassical analysis of quantum fields near the horizon of a black hole implied that the black hole had a finite temperature measured at a distance (asymptotically), confirming Bekenstein’s suspicions. This intimate 3-way relationship between general relativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and thermodynamics has been widely regarded ever since as a key guidepost towards a theory of quantum gravity. This has been reinforced in the last years by the work of Ted Jacobson and others (see earlier comments). Erik Verlinde’s prominence as a string theorist, and his remarks in the paper and on his blog about string theory in this context, suggest a significant shift in outlook on his part with respect to string theory and quantum gravity in general. (He goes out of his way to make this clear.) Of course this shift is not definitive, but we’re in a revolutionary phase in fundamental physics; little if anything can be taken for granted.
?”
To TimVB,
You should watch the talk by Moshe Rozali on “Backgound Independence in String Theory” at Loops 07:
Or read the corresponding paper:
quote “Entropy, thermodynamics and gravity go back to the 60s…”
The first widely accessible book on GR was R.C. Tolman’s “Relativity, Thermodynamics, and Cosmology” from the mid 30s.
-drl
DRL,
That quote was taken out of context. I wasn’t talking about understanding and applying thermodynamics in astrophysics and cosmology, where gravity and special relativity (relativistic energies) are important. I was talking specifically about the discovery—in the 1960s—of the unexpectedly thermodynamic character of a particular class of solutions in classical general relativity.
Hans-Peter wrote:
“…since 1995, when Jacobson wrote his paper, almost nobody was interested in his result.”
I guess I’m almost nobody. But seriously: everyone in loop quantum gravity was very interested in Jacobson’s result; the problem was figuring out something to do with it!
Chris W., Mark,
thanks for the answers, that was very helpful.
At this moment I have not digested all of the offered material, so I will refrain from asking more questions with one exception:
Chris W. wrote:
.”
It makes much more sense to me to understand Verlinde in the way you suggest: If he talks about the microscopic dynamics and it’s concept of “time”, then it is not the macroscopic notion of time connected with the emergent spacetime, but a different concept like the “causal set structure” that you pointed out.
But I’m not sure if that’s what Verlinde means, because he mentions “space”, and space only, as an emergent concept.
And he uses “time” to denote the causal structure of the microscopic dynamics, which made me think that he rolls back the unification of space and time of relativity theory.
Maybe this is a simple misunderstanding caused by my overly pedantic interpretation of his use of language.
From Tim vB: And he uses “time” to denote the causal structure of the microscopic dynamics, which made me think that he rolls back the unification of space and time of relativity theory.
The unification of space and time in relativity has come to be viewed in a somewhat different light as a result of the study of the dynamical structure of general relativity (“geometrodynamics”). You should find out more about the ADM formalism.
The meaning and status of time in general relativity is a vexed subject, that has received much attention from physicists and philosophers of physics. How it will all shake out is not at all clear, of course (notwithstanding my own biases 🙂 ).
Wow! Verlinde posting in Lubos’ blog?? Is Lubos still considered an important voice in the field? Amazing!!
Verlinde’s Jan. 15 post is now on his blog. It appeared first on Lubos’ blog.
Also, although the linked titles on his main page don’t work, the three posts can be accessed as separate files:
15 Jan: Entropic forces and the 2nd law of thermodynamics
13 Jan: Essential points of the paper
12 Jan: Logic of the paper
I enjoyed Verlinde’s paper. I was not familiar with the earlier work he references by Jacobson, so of course it really got me thinking. It immediately raised the following questions for me:
(1) If you accept that gravity is emergent, then what is wrong with the Standard Model? Why do strings need to be added to all the QFT that makes good experimental predictions?
(2) Having spent most of my life working with computer codes, I am intuitively comfortable with ideas like the holographic principle. Similar types of information constraints come up all the time in algorithms I work with, so it does not seem surprising to see something similar in nature. However, starting with the holographic principle doesn’t seem quite right when the author claims 3 dimensional space as an emergent phenomena. I am willing to go along and follow the logic of deriving spatial dimensions as emergent phenomena, but there wasn’t enough in Verlinde’s paper to suggest a good route. I was kind of expecting a derivation of spatial dimensions based on information-theoretic type arguments, but I could not find it.
(3) On the other hand, time was taken as a given. I was surprised, since I would have expected for entropy based arguments that time would be one of the (many) emergent phenomena, and that 3d space and the holographic principle would be the givens.
One way or another, I liked the paper and think I may have learned something. One we start down the route of saying Newton’s equations are like the ideal gas law, we need to be very careful, in any given context, to say what is a “given” and what emerges. The logic can get very confused if, in the process of a single argument, the author is not perfectly consistent about the givens.
The New Scientist article that Verlinde said was in the works is now on the website. (See Verlinde’s Twitter feed.)
The author, Martijn van Calmthout, avoids dealing with some muddled aspects of the story, but overall the article isn’t bad.
The muddle is inherent in the opening paragraphs:
This skates right by the fact that the only forces—in a Newtonian sense—in general relativity are the non-gravitational forces that take particle trajectories away from geodesics in spacetime. So strictly speaking, talk of an entropy force must be replaced by another locution if one is to properly understand the connection of “the flow of entropy” to geodesic deviation, ie, to spacetime curvature.
This is just one aspect of this very provocative line of thinking that could use some clarification in accounts aimed at a general readership. Ted Jacobson’s original paper avoids this problem, at the cost of using some relatively dense technical argumentation, and no explicit use of the holographic principle.
PS: Actually, footnote 5 in Jacobson’s paper makes the following reference to the holographic principle:

Summary
Kevin Kohlstedt helped Douglas Emmett implement electric vehicle charging stations and rooftop solar installations to reduce its energy use, and recommended ways to secure project financing.
Goals
Douglas Emmett, a real estate investment trust with a portfolio of over 75 Class A commercial office and residential properties, enlisted EDF Climate Corps fellow Kevin Kohlstedt to help reduce its energy use and evaluate sustainability projects. Having set a goal of reducing energy costs by 5% annually, the company was well-established as an industry leader in energy efficient buildings. But, the Engineering Services team had a limited budget, which required short payback periods in order to get approval for energy efficiency and sustainability projects.
Solutions
After evaluating existing facilities and potential utility incentives, Kevin and the Engineering Services team determined that Douglas Emmett could reduce its energy use significantly by replacing fluorescent lights with LEDs in parking garages and stairwells. Since these lights are in use all year, they provided the greatest potential savings. They decided it was best to use an energy service company to perform the work and file for utility incentives, therefore freeing up Douglas Emmett employees for other key projects.
Based on input from Douglas Emmett property managers and tenants, Kevin identified a strong demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) solar. To help offset the cost to install these features, he recommended using both utility incentives and setting up a Green Revolving Fund (GRF)—an investment vehicle that provides financing through the savings generated from energy efficiency projects. Instituting a GRF would help the firm secure a consistent funding stream to pursue additional sustainability projects.
Potential Impact
Kevin’s analysis identified savings of $4 million in net operational costs, 3.5 million annual kilowatt hours of electricity and 2,000 metric tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions. Kevin and the Engineering Services team initiated the LED lighting project, delivering immediate payback to the firm.

The financial crisis made clear that interconnectedness and complexity have the potential to magnify localized shocks and amplify and transmit them to the greater financial system. Understanding the risks posed by our ever more interconnected global financial system is crucial to managing those risks. To that end, DTCC has published a whitepaper providing an overview of the subject, surveying a selection of interconnectedness studies conducted thus far, and highlighting regulatory measures designed to address interconnectedness risks. Among other things, DTCC concludes that “firms must do more than monitor and mitigate these risks – they also need to focus on building resiliency so they can detect potential systemic shocks before they strike or recover from them as quickly as possible.”
Interconnectedness, the network of credit exposures, trading links and other relationships and dependencies between financial agents, is not all bad, however. DTCC notes that in some cases, “these intra-financial and/or legal linkages help dampen shocks by distributing and dispersing their impact throughout the financial system." The key is for risk managers to understand what interconnectedness means to their business and factor interconnections into their risk management strategies:
“risk managers can no longer view financial firms as stand-alone entities because, in reality, they are now a diverse set of interconnected components that distribute risk and are exposed to it, oftentimes in ways that are not transparent or expected.”
Consequently, DTCC concludes that considerations regarding interconnectedness should become an aspect of a firm's day-to-day risk management function. By thinking about interconnectedness routinely, DTCC believes risk managers will have a more holistic view of actionable and inherent risks. The paper provides some guidelines for risk managers to analyze interconnectedness risk:
According to the paper, studies of market interconnectedness are clustered in two main areas:
DTCC's synthesis of these studies yields the following conclusions:
The study of the nature and effect of interconnectedness is neither complete nor simple, however. DTCC notes that "studies on the relationship between a network’s interconnectedness and its ability to withstand shocks also suggest that many other factors come into play, including the type of financial shocks, the maturity structure of banks’ liabilities, existence of information problems and other financial frictions. Researchers continue to study the impact of these and other factors as they try to gain a better insight into the impact of a network’s topology on its resilience."
By its very nature, policy responses to interconnectedness require a multi-national approach. DTCC finds that policy-makers have wisely chosen not to try to reduce or elminiate financial market interconnectedness. Rather, "than curbing interconnectedness directly, they have chosen to emphasize measures designed to increase the resilience of highly interconnected – and systemically important – financial institutions." Basel III, EMIR, the Volcker Rule, and other regulatory initiatives address interconnectedness by directly controling and limiting interconnectedness by imposing direct restrictions on the scope of businesses conducted by large banks. These restrictions aim to safeguard core banking activities from contagion that might originate in riskier areas – while simplifying the banks’ organizational structures in the process. Still others like CPMI, IOSCO, and FFIEC are working, not to limit interconnections, but to make those interconnections safer and more stable.New Ewe, The Bigger the Bow the Closer to Jesus, Baby Short Sleeve Dress, Raspberry, 6 Months-24 Months

Except, of course, in the cases where a Hungarian citizen would not be allowed to start a company. (e.g., ban). You can be a member of the company, or additionally, an executive too. The managing director has additional obligations, such as opening a company portal account and tasks related to the day-to-day work of the company, eg: compiling accounting documentation, opening a bank account, registering with chambers.
One-stop-shop company formation in Hungary
Company formation
Before engaging in establishing a business in Hungary, it is worth checking out the benefits Hungary can offer.
The process is the same as for Hungarian citizens. If you do not speak Hungarian, it is necessary to translate the documents required for founding a company. The company formation in Hungary is a legal process and the involvement of a lawyer is required.
There are several forms of companies from which you may choose the right, though we generally recommend a limited liability company.
Delivery proxy
If either the directors or the members of the company do not have a resident address in Hungary, they need to appoint a delivery proxy. The delivery proxy will act not for the company itself, but the directors and the members. If you reside in Hungary and have an official address card, then you do not need a delivery proxy.
The delivery agent will receive the documents addressed to the foreign person in connection with the operation of the company and then has to forward those to him/her. In the case of a document sent to the delivery proxy by a court or other authority, it shall be presumed that the document became known to the foreign person on the fifteenth day after the lawful service to the delivery proxy.
The name (company name) and place of residence (registered office) of the delivery proxy of a foreign legal or natural person not resident in Hungary must be reported to the court of registration upon the establishment of the company.
The delivery proxy can be an organization with a registered office in Hungary or a natural person with a permanent residence. Members of the company, directors, and members of the supervisory board may not act as a delivery proxy.
Client portal account
We recommend that the client portal account be open, but not mandatory. I will write about this below.
A client portal is a tool for managing electronic administration with the government, including tax matters.
To log in to the Client Portal, you need to create a personal Client Portal ID. This is a registration process that you can initiate at any government office. It can be completed at a documentary office, government desk, or tax office customer service and even consular offices. It is worth booking an appointment and indicating if you do not speak Hungarian.
In the case of EEA nationals, an identity card or passport must be presented, otherwise, non-EEA nationals shall show their passport for registration.
Company portal account
After opening the client portal account, you can go on with creating a company portal account to which the company is assigned. You’ll be able to manage all the company related e-communication with the government through the company portal. If you do not speak Hungarian, it is worth appointing a company gate agent who will take over the documents instead.
Health insurance registration
TAJ (health insurance) card and contributions: An EEA national performing directorship duties in Hungary may not be subject to Hungarian social security rules if he/she has been insured in their home EEA country, and can prove this. If you manage the Hungarian company and do not have social insurance in any of the EU member states, then the Hungarian social security will apply.
Personal tax identity number registration
Personal tax identity number: any directors of a Hungarian company need to have a Hungarian tax identity number. This is their private tax id number, separate from the company’s tax numbers. The director, its agent, or accountant can apply for the Hungarian tax identity number. The process can be done at any tax office customer service in person or electronically through the client portal account. The registration can be done by the director, its agent or accountant. A proof of the identity, passport or EEA identity card is also needed to be presented.
Opening bank accounts
The tax regulations require all new Hungarian companies, including those that are established by foreign nationals, to open a bank account in the territory of Hungary. Bank accounts cannot be opened remotely, due to the strict anti-money laundering rules all clients shall visit personally the bank office and go through a client screening process before the bank could offer to open the account.
At least one bank account is a must in Hungary, though any other accounts may be opened outside of Hungary. Virtual or mobile app-based accounts, like for example Revolut, Monzo, Starling or N26 are also acceptable. The bank accounts opened in Hungary are automatically declared to the tax office. Additionally, the company needs to report to the tax office any accounts that are opened elsewhere.2021 Internship Program and Philosophy8 min read
BrainGu puts an immense emphasis on the quality of our internship program. For the second year of our official Summer Internship Program, our focus has been on providing a stimulating and rewarding internship experience. As the organization grows and matures, so does our collective ability to provide an impactful internship experience. I’m confident that we have succeeded in making the 2021 internship program richer and more organized than last year.
BrainGu Internship Philosophy
BrainGu is highly committed to recruiting a diverse and well-rounded cohort of interns and providing them with an immersive and educational employment experience. We want our Gu-interns to share a similar experience to that of our full-time engineers and developers. Therefore, we strive to give them logic and technology problems to solve, teach them principles of product and project management like SAFe and Agile, and give them opportunities to self-actualize, be creative, and bring their personalities and hard work to a supportive and collaborative environment.
The 2021 Intern Cohort had two primary goals in addition to the mission of the internship program itself:
- Have the interns create, test, and deliver a fully functional Swag Store for the company.
- Accept more applications than 2020 and make the Internship a nation-wide opportunity.
I am happy to report that we have been successful in all three of these primary goals. We concluded the 2021 Summer Cohort with a full walk through demo of the swag store. The interns conducted a survey in Slack and the company voted to call it BrainGear. I thought it was an impressive demonstration that showcased the skills and talents of our awesome interns perfectly. They were able to get an app designed, built, tested, polished and brought to the edge of full deployment by utilizing industry best practices and leveraging team collaboration.
I think the interns certainly walked away having learned a lot, but I also believe this cohort taught us a lot about ourselves as BrainGu. One of the most important things that observing our interns this year reinforced for me was the importance of process in getting lots of work done quickly. By utilizing SCRUM and Agile principles, Chris Antonio, our Learning + Development Manager and other BrainGu leaders were able to coach the cohort to a successful product while gaining momentum, and staying on course with each new sprint. I look forward to the work that future intern generations will be able to accomplish on the foundation of the 2020 and 2021 cohorts’ cumulative progress.
This year, we recruited the most diverse group of interns yet. Our amazing cohort this year is 50% women, and we have interns from many different ethnic and national backgrounds. We will continue prioritizing our DE&I mission for all of our recruitment practices, and the work continues. Lastly, we went from processing ten qualified applications to the 2020 cohort to processing almost 200 applications to the 2021 cohort. This huge transversal of scale was made possible by our awesome recruiting team, our new applicant tracking system, Greenhouse, and our newly adopted pre-employment tech testing tool, Codility.
Codility, Greenhouse and the selection process
Last year it would have been impossible to imagine that we’d be able to get ~200 applications processed while making the process more data-driven and objective within a tight two-month time window. Greenhouse made the team lift feasible and enjoyable. Greenhouse shares a full integration with Codility. That means that we were able to send out take-home evaluations to over 150 candidates, invite the most qualified candidates to a technical interview with a panel of our engineers, and send out offers to eight extraordinarily talented and engaging interns without adding any personnel or overwhelming our current recruitment team process. Our use of Codility and Greenhouse at scale for the 2021 Internship Recruitment Sprint taught us a lot of skills and tips that we have already begun employing in our company-wide recruitment practices, things like:
- Using pre-employment testing to mitigate unconscious bias.
- Sticking to workflow SOPs to ensure low variation in the recruitment system, and fast, reliable results.
- Analyzing and extrapolating from exported candidate data and evaluator feedback to narrow applicant pools to only the most qualified with the best cultural fit. This makes selection rounds a breeze without compromising fairness and equity.
We used a nearly identical recruitment flow for our internship recruitment as we do for our full-time positions. These are the steps that we followed in processing each application we received this year and some details about each stage:
- Application Review: The recruiting team reviews each cover letter and resume, looking for the correct experience and tech stack. Unqualified applicants are rejected and encouraged to apply for a future opportunity.
- Phone Screen: Qualified applicants are invited to sit for a 15-minute phone screen with a member of our recruitment team. Our team asks a series of questions from our standard question block and gets to know each qualified candidate. We answer any questions they might have about the next steps in the process, and we prepare them for a Codility test, giving them the option of which test they’d like to take. This year we offered a take-home test in either the Django Framework or the React Library.
- Take-Home Codility Test: We received a completed exam for >75% of the exams we sent out invites for, which is pretty cool! Codility scores allowed us to make objective decisions for advancing candidates.
- Technical Interview: The top scorers in the Codility testing rounds were invited for 30-minute technical Interviews with a panel of our incredible technologists. We used a bank of questions and problem-solving exercises that evaluated technical skill fit and took an opportunity to get a sense of each candidate’s culture fit in BrainGu with the luxury of face-to-face time.
- Offer: We extended and received back 8 signed offers, with a week to spare before the start date! We made sure to be ready ahead of time with the computers, and all of our interns started their internships with a BrainGu company laptop on day 1! Thanks, April Johnson, Project Manager and Luke Reichel, ITM Manager!
The Project and the Immersion Experience
As I mentioned above, the mission of the annual internship program is to provide an educational and fully immersive simulation of employment in a technology company. This year our intern cohort is developing a fully functional and styled swag store app, called “BrainGear,” from Day 0 → Day 1, following the same SAFe Agile principles that BrainGu uses to bring solutions to our satisfied customers. The internship is self-driven, so we do our best to enable and encourage our interns to be vocal and assertive in going after the work that interests them and improving their skills in a team environment. In the 2021 cohort, we have interns gaining valuable professional experience in UI/UX design, Project and Team Management, Front and Back-End Engineering, cybersecurity, automated testing, quality control best practices, and more.
At BrainGu, we hire and evaluate by values. Therefore, we filter the work and the teamwork associated with completing the work through the lens of our three values pillars: Execution, Diplomacy, and Citizenship. Every two weeks, the intern team presents their most recent development sprint results with a demo, Q&A, and new sprint planning session. Team Members from across the company are invited to attend these Friday demos to ask questions and provide feedback. We hope that this gives all interns opportunities to get valuable business experience explaining technical and functional concepts to customers or associated stakeholders, taking their questions, and incorporating customer feedback into team iteration on end-product delivery.
Cohort 2022 and Beyond
As we look ahead to next year, we have begun to identify goals, improvements, and expansions to the Internship Program. Firstly we must continue the never-ending work on our DE&I mission. We hope to build on the diversity and equity wins of the 2021 program by partnering even closer with diversity-focused non-profit groups like Girls Who Code and STEM organizations like the North Carolina Space Grant. Second, we will continue the ongoing work of the cohorts -- developing more and better tools for BrainGu to use to drive company culture and positive employee experience. Lastly, we will continue to expand on the quality and depth of the Internship Program offered by defining SOPs for curriculum and project management and designing improved learning and development supports by leveraging Pluralsight and many more improvements (stay tuned).
After everything is stripped away, the driving force in our motivation to continue providing internship opportunities is hearing from our interns that they had a positive, memorable experience that helped and changed them and opened up doors for their futures. That makes all of this worth it.As interest in digital assets continues to grow at a fast pace, it’s critical to know how to have these conversations with your clients.

Unshattered
2018 Nonprofit Fellow
When Kelly became a Fellow, she had recently left an executive role at a Fortune 50 company to start Unshattered, a social enterprise that helps women win their fight against addiction through job training and employment. She describes her Praxis experience as a redemption of ambition—a turning point from falsely believing that she couldn’t have big dreams in the nonprofit world. “I thought I had to play small this time. One of the key things I learned at Praxis was to lean into my ambition and calling in a healthy way.”
Through the program, Kelly adopted practices to lead with a focus on the restoration of people rather than organizational growth. She also found a community willing to encourage her in this script. “It felt like I had come home. Praxis is the community I had been looking for my whole life.” In 2020, Christy Singleton, a Praxis Mentor, joined the board at Unshattered.
In 2019, Unshattered has received recognition by the White House, landed on Huffington Post’s 16 Style and Beauty Gifts that Give Back list, grown their sales by over 30% and donations by 1,000%, and started the process of closing on a new property.

Every year, we are bombarded with articles announcing the extinction of this gem of a framework. And, considering the fact that Ruby on Rails (RoR) is nearly 15 years old, it is far from extinct in the programming community. You may be curious why Ruby on Rails is used. In fact, RoR is a better match for many use cases than any other method.
What is Ruby on Rails?
Ruby on rails has taken the world by storm. It is one of the most flexible, start-up-friendly, and well-supported frameworks. Ruby On Rails app development has helped many successful businesses and companies to build their website. But why numerous startups & robust companies picked and continue RoR as their technology platform? The primary thing for a web product startup is a fast, stable, and secure business solution. Also, Ruby on Rails is reliable and cost-effective framework assuring a fresh start.
Ruby on rails or ROR is an open-source framework used for creating web applications. It is still considered as one of the general-purpose scripting languages which were developed almost two decades ago. A creative mixture of HTML, CSS & JavaScript files in Ruby assists in shaping clean and high-quality web applications.
Some fascinating statistics about Ruby on Rails
- RoR framework is equipped with more than 45,000 stars on Github.
- RoR app development has contributed more than 523,339 live websites.
- Around 4,000 coders contribute to the progress of the ROR framework.
Reasons why you should choose Ruby On Rails for web development
Open-Source
Ruby on Rails is an open-source server-side language which means that there are numerous libraries that you can adopt to create your web app into a hit, without having to reinvent the wheel. Rubygems is a package manager by RoR which is similar to npm. Not to mention that the rails community should enhance some of these open-source resources, making them more accessible and valuable and that there is a lot of community support on GitHub.
Security
Security is always considered a top priority for most businesses and organizations. Some people assume that open-source software like Ruby on Rails compromise security. However, this isn’t the case for Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails framework is integrated with fundamental security from the beginning. The current version of Ruby on Rails(4.0 and above) has built-in mechanisms to block hackers and malicious activities. The community of the RoR framework actively identifies and patches new vulnerabilities as they come along. Also, the RoR documentation is crafted in a great manner. In case, if some of the security features are disabled, your code doesn’t follow the best practices, or you don’t care about web security in general, then your RoR can be left open to attack.
Improved App Development Speed
RoR provides developers with Active Support, a collection of utility classes, library extensions, and other transversal items. Either one helps to improve both the Rails framework and the Ruby on Rails application itself. Enhanced speed of development is one of the reasons why startup founders also prefer Ruby on Rails. It allows them to shorten the MVP development process and to create an outstanding product at a lower cost.
High Reliability & Maintainability
The aspect of stability is critical for any company. TDD (test-driven development) is often used in Ruby on Rails development, and the toolkit provides robust testing capabilities. It means that Ruby on Rails solutions are robust and maintainable. The framework is also protected by automated tests, making it reliable.

Weak 1/r-Nets for Moving Points
Abstract
In this paper, we extend the weak 1/r-net theorem to a kinetic setting where the underlying set of points is moving polynomially with bounded description complexity. We establish that one can find a kinetic analog N of a weak 1/r-net of cardinality O(r^(d(d+1)/2)log^d r) whose points are moving with coordinates that are rational functions with bounded description complexity. Moreover, each member of N has one polynomial coordinate.

“And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel” (Genesis 3:15).
The Lord is addressing the serpent, which deceived Eve, with a prophetic judgment. This announcement is understood by the Christian church as a prediction of the coming of the Deliverer.
There will arise a long struggle between Satan’s “seed” or followers (John 8:44; Acts 13:10; 1 John 3:10) and the woman’s seed. There will be a great controversy between Christ and Satan. This battle began in heaven (Rev. 12:7–9) and continued on earth. In this battle Christ defeated Satan (Heb. 2:14), and will ultimately cause Satan’s destruction at the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:10).
The price of our redemption was very high. The Son of God left heaven and came to this earth to redeem mankind. The nail marks in His hands and feet and the scar in His side will be eternal reminders of the greatest sacrifice in which the serpent bruised Christ’s heel (John 20:25; Zech. 13:6). But Christ rose triumphantly from the grave and His victory caused Him to crush Satan’s head.
This declaration brought great comfort to Adam and Eve. By sinning Adam, yielded his authority to Satan. And Satan understood that as shown by his statement to Christ on the mount of temptation (Luke 4:5, 6). As Adam began to realize his great loss, he was utterly devastated. But the Lord in His great mercy gave him hope in revealing the plan of salvation.
How infinitely loving was God! Divine justice required that sin should meet its penalty, but divine mercy had already found a way to redeem the fallen human race—by the voluntary sacrifice of the Son of God (1 Peter 1:20; 2 Tim. 1:9; Rev. 13:8). God instituted the ritual of sacrifice to provide man with a visual aid, that he might be led to understand a glimpse of the price that was paid to make atonement for his sin.

Plus, the completion of some long-standing research projects has provided a little more time to develop this site. To mark this new energy, I gave the site a new theme last week. I wanted simpler, more elegant, image-based. The Monet theme is easier on the eye and demands less of the viewer. It is also better for mobile users. The theme does less well with webpage hierarchy, however, so I plan to eliminate some of the stacked sub-pages and simplify the static content. I’m also currently devising secret plans to develop the gazetteer section of the website somewhere else beyond WordPress–even as the bibliographic library lives off site at Zotero.

Amnesia Rockfest Montebello President and Founder, Alex Martel. (Photo: Scott Penner/Aesthetic Magazine Toronto)
Amnesia Rockfest Montebello, which struggled in 2013 due to several major problems, announced at a press conference yesterday in Gatineau, Que, the signing of an agreement with the Quebec City Summer Festival as well as several major changes to its 2014 edition. Thus, the Quebec City Summer Festival, through its sister company 3E-event-emotion experience, will be responsible for production and logistics of the 9th edition of Rockfest to be held from June 20-21 2014.
“I am very pleased to be partnering with the Festival d’été de Québec and the changes we make to the festival in 2014. I am confident that they will bring the Rockfest at the desired level because we want to create an event worthy of our programming. We invest huge sums of money and taking the steps thatare needed to effectively manage the growth that knows the event in recent years. We are committed to surpass the good logistics course of the first seven editions,” said Alex Martel, Amnesia Rockfest Montebello President and Founder.
“We are pleased to bring Alex Martel, a young man working, passionate and visionary, our collaboration and expertise so that it can offer a high quality event to the public,” said Daniel Gélinas, CEO of Festival Quebec Summer and 3E.
In addition, the Rockfest enlists the participation of the firm P. Miron Consultants, who specializes in the logistics field, a major player in the success of several festivals in the region such as RBC Royal Bank Bluesfest, the Ottawa Folk Festival and the Ottawa Marathon.
Considering the less-than-organized festival that was 2013 Rockfest, which included overflowing public toilets, long lines, and slow bus shuttle service, which made the area surrounding the concert site look like a landfill, this news will be music to the ears of the 160,000 that attended last year.
Overview of Changes to the 2014 Rockfest:
- Bracelets-mailed in advance, with a RFID (bracelet chip) technology;
- Expansion and reconfiguration of the festival grounds;
- Significantly Improved sanitation facilities (toilets, water, garbage, cleaning);
- Complete Redesign of parking and shuttle system;
- Improved sound from the main stage and adding LED screens;
- Artists paid-emerging and opening different scenes rather than on a separate stage.
“We are very motivated to take up the challenge given to us by the Rockfest. For us it is an honor to work with the biggest festival in Ottawa and to bring our expertise, “said Colin Laramée-Plouffe, President and founder of Orkestra.
“As the new mayor of Montebello and fervent supporter of Rockfest, I greet loudly the many changes in the organization of this year’s event. These initiatives confirm the seriousness of the organizers and their commitment to providing a world-class event to the participants. Montebello City Council supports and will support all initiatives that will make the festival more welcoming, innovative and structured for years to come. We offer our full cooperation to Alex and his team,” said Luc Ménard, mayor ofMontebello.
The full announcement of the program and the sale of tickets will be held at the end of winter.

However , the theory has spread a lot further than that. You will find Filipina gals from Asia, Europe, as well as America getting connected with men from countries like the Us, Quotes, Canada, and New Zealand. A lot of people did not be able to imagine a woman by any of these countries having anything in common with a man from the United Kingdom or the America. However , that may be what Postal mail Order Wedding brides is all about.
There are several explanations why Mail Buy Brides is starting to become so popular among foreign girls. One is since Filipino women are viewed to be a reduced amount of desirable to guys in these countries. This is due to cultural norms. Since so many guys want to be married to Filipina women, the culture makes it hard for a Filipino woman to adjust to her fresh life.
Another reason as to why mail purchase brides have grown to be so popular is the fact there are a lot of scams going on in the market. The only way designed for foreign ladies to gain access towards the United States, Canada, and other american countries can be through marital life companies. However , additionally, there are some unethical brokers who bypass trying to get overseas women to enter into relationship with all of them. In most cases, they try to get as much money as is feasible. Even though these kinds of brokers will not really want the bride, they are simply continue to taking advantage of the situation.
Philipino women tend not to like the idea of being segregated from their husbands or fathers very much. For most, this would mean an escape from home and a more complicated life. On the other hand, if the woman decides in which to stay the Korea and get married to a foreign person, that will indicate an extended period of time that he needs to adjust to her new lifestyle. In addition, her family members may not just like the idea both. They would latest the fact that all their loved one is currently living in a different country and they were not contacted about it earlier.
This kind of leads many Filipino females to prefer international submit order brides to be. If they choose well, their families know little regarding what exactly they are doing and that will be more comfortable for him or her. On the other hand, some women get to United states of america or Canada with the help of their father and mother.
Philippine women are known for their kindness and hospitality. That they love to match foreign males and showing these people good hospitality. And for a foreign man, this is often an opportunity to show the right kind of food. As long as the person is well intentioned and polite, there will be no problem. One thing any deliver order brides to be needs to carry out is to choose a suitable spot to base themselves. This can either maintain the Israel or in the usa.When the temperature outside begins to drop, it can be quite alarming — especially to those that always feel cold. That said, while you can adjust your thermostat and bask in the warmth, prolonged usage may increase your utility bills. However, if you’re looking to stay toasty and cozy this winter, without overworking your heater, here are a few helpful tips to use!
Tips on How to Stay Warm
Warm Beverages Over Cold Beverages
When you visit your local coffee shop, do you opt for hot or iced coffee? Well, if you opt for the latter, you’ll only be making yourself much chillier. Instead, always opt for warm beverages — such as coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Not only will they taste absolutely wonderful, but they’ll warm you up from the outside in!
The More Layers, The Better
No, we’re not talking about a seven-layer cake (although, that’s quite delicious), but rather wearing more layers when the temperature begins to plummet. Just like when you’d head outside to shovel snow, wearing a comfortable amount of layers indoors will help keep you toasty and warm!
For example, don’t be afraid to wear a long-sleeved shirt, with a crewneck sweatshirt over it — that will provide maximum comfort and coziness!
Bake More Often
Do you have a sweet tooth or know someone that does? If so, another great way to stay warm is to start baking more often! Believe it or not, after you’ve baked your sweet treats — whether that be a cake, cupcakes, or cookies — turn the oven off and leave the door open. Doing this will help the “leftover” heat disperse into the room.
Pro tip: If you have kids or pets, proceed with caution, as this could be a safety hazard.

President-elect Joseph Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were formally announced Saturday, after a tense several days of mail-in vote counting with an Electoral College victory inconclusive until Saturday.
November 9, 2020
Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, announced Saturday morning after Biden exceeded the necessary 270 electoral votes, defeating incumbent President Donald Trump and ending his one-term presidency.
“I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris,” Biden said in an address to the nation Saturday night from his hometown of Wilmington, Del. “In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America.”
Harris’ win is historic as she is the first woman named vice president-elect, as well as the first Black woman and woman of Indian descent.
“While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities,” Harris said Saturday in her speech.
As the nation looks ahead, current President Donald Trump has not formally conceded the election. Throughout last week, he made unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and illegal action around mail-in ballots and ballot tallying. Some other members of the Republican party have made similar statements, but neither Trump nor anyone else have presented actual evidence of wrongdoing or illegal action.
“The simple fact is this election is far from over,” Trump said in a Nov. 8 Fox News article. “Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor.”
As President Trump threatens more legal challenges, president-elect Biden and vice president-elect Harris turn their attention to the formal transition of power in preparation for the Jan. 20, 2021, presidential inauguration.

 listening to music has become a trend and one of the favorite pastimes. So nowadays everyone is searching for the best music downloader application for downloading multiples of music. If you are one of the downloader searchings for the best applications that I have mentioned various music downloaders that are provided for free absolutely. This is the best free music downloader for your iPhone devices that have for free absolutely. So check out all the best music downloader below:
Mobile applications, in an inexpensive way are the best tools for marketing and communication for any business or organization. There’s so much importance attached to mobile applications and its usefulness. Hence, you can either choose an Android or iOS platform. Prior to developing your app, it is advisable to conduct
a market research on the Android and iPhone app development companies in the area to find the right developer for you. It is common for most entrepreneurs to come across this question: Android or iOS? Both platforms have their unique pros and cons. It is best to choose the right platform for your app, based on your requirements.
Android is known for its lucrative features, affordability and smartphone fragmentation. Unlike Apple, the green robotic human has a wide range of devices which makes it the topmost priority in app development. Suffice it to say that this isn’t the only reason to choose Android. Many other benefits abound in developing an Android app. Here’s a few
Presently, India is known to be the world’s third largest smartphone market after China and USA. It is believed according to a recent survey that the Android operating system has captured 97% of the Indian smartphone market. Android is the only market that offers high-quality features at affordable prices for a wide range of devices. This implies that an average Indian customer can buy an Android smartphone within his/her preferred budget. As a result of market segmentation and affordability, Android consistently continues to control majority of the Indian smartphone market share.
The iOS app development companies inevitably require a Mac desktop to develop the iOS applications. On the other hand, Android app development can be carried out using a Windows, Linux or Mac. More so, Google levies a one-time payment of $25 to register as a developer while Apple levies as high as $99 annually. For you to develop an Android app, all you require is a computer system and a fee of $25 to start your development process.
TBy far, Java is proven to be the most programming language there is and is used for developing a wide range of devices.
It is an open source which provides free source codes from its Java Development Kit (JDK) to the developers.
It is unique in the sense that it has the ability to run on any system irrespective of the software and hardware dependency.
Therefore, it is regarded as a powerful programming language used for developing the native Android apps.
Java programming languages used in writing Android apps can be easily ported to various other platforms like Symbian, Blackberry, Ubuntu and Chrome OS.
Are you fed up with the same old widgets? Calm down! It is possible to download a widget from a third party app and replace it with your outdated one.
Are you bored of the same layout? You can also download and replace it too.
Android gives you the freedom to personalize your apps the way you like them. This is a major reason why developers enjoy developing apps on Android than many other platforms.
The ability to adapt quickly really matters a lot in the fast-growing app market. The Android’s Google Play Store gives you room to update the app within an hour, in response to the user’s feedback while the App Store follows the same lengthy process to submit your app. You can submit the same app for multiple times on the Play Store while you’ll require a minimum of a week to launch your updated app on the App Store. Android also offers Alpha and Beta releases which can be accessed by a set of members to test your app. With the aid of feedbacks from the testers, one can rectify the errors and/or incorporate some features before it gets to the actual users. Thus, Android creates the perfect platform to test your app.
Absolutely! Nothing can be truer. There is a general assumption that iPhone users are rich enough to make in-app purchases, and this invariably generates more revenue than Android. However, this isn’t true anymore. Android developers can generate revenue through initial app purchases, in-app purchases and from the most profitable way-app ads. According to a survey conducted by DAU-UP, the average revenue per user for Android games was only 20% by January 2010. Interestingly, it got to 65% by year end. Moreover, the advertising cost is 25-50% lower on Android apps, which eventually can be more profitable than the iPhone apps.
Finally, now that you are aware of the advantages of investing in the Android app, you can develop your app on this most rewarding platform in order to stay ahead in this competitive market. As a result of its usability, affordability and profitability, Android still remains indomitable and continues to dominate the smartphone market Remember, developing an Android isn’t an expense. It’s a worthy investment! Looking forward to investing in Android apps? Contact us here. We are one of the foremost Mobile and Web application development company and we’ve developed more than 150 android apps with a professional pool of designers and developers.The Smoking Syndicate Roundtable is a format where we will be doing a live group review of a particular cigar, then have a shortened video posted later on our YouTube and social media accounts.

Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it to Hagar … and the child and sent her away … and she wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water was spent she placed the child under one of the shrubs and she went and sat down a good way off … for she said, “Let me not see the death of the child” and she lifted up her voice and wept. And God heard the voice of the lad … and God opened Hagar’s eyes and she saw a well of water and went and filled the bottle with the water and gave the lad a drink. (Genesis 21:14-19)
We can see that when Hagar’s son Ishmael was about to die of thirst in the wilderness, God opened Hagar’s eyes and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the bottle with water and gave Ishmael to drink. (Genesis 21:19)
Therefore believe that God can open your eyes and enable you to see the solution to your problem because With God all things are possible. (Matthew 19:26) In addition, God is not a respector of persons (Acts 10:34) which means that what He did for Hagar, He can also do for you if you believe. If your faith is wavering read How to Increase your Faith.
Prayer
Heavenly Father I ask You in the name of Jesus to help me remember that All things are possible for the person who believes (Mark 9:23) so that I can believe without wavering that With God all things are possible (Matthew 19:26) including seeing a solution for my problem.
Bible Verse Meditation
God opened Hagar’s eyes and she saw a well of water. (Genesis 21:19)
You can even modify it and meditate on God opened (insert your name) eyes and I saw a well of water.

Normally when we take teams to Acholi quarters in Kampala the focus of the programme is providing educational activities for the children who, for financial reasons, aren’t able to go to school.
We do also always spend a bit of time with the ladies learning how to make beads out of paper and that is a lovely opportunity to chat more with them, but the main focus is usually the children
So it was really good earlier this week to be able to deliver some training opportunities for the ladies, and two men, of the Co-operative that we work with; and help build their skills, confidence and sense of self worth, which can often be low due to their back stories and what they have been through in the past.
The first of the sessions we delivered was ‘Healthy Nutrition’ – helping to give more understanding regarding a balanced diet, the benefits of different foods, and suggestions for making good choices as well as busting some myths
The First Aid training was also very well received, and everyone enjoyed the opportunity to learn about what to do if someone is unconscious, the recovery position, first response for burns, scalds and wounds, and various other bits of useful knowledge that can be critical in a community that has very little in the way of health care, and even less in the way of affordable health care for those living in poverty
The third training session that we delivered was around the use of questions to help with developing ideas. It’s based on a concept called The Art of Hosting, which is a collection of ‘tools’ that help folks to explore ideas and develop thoughts in a range of settings.
In this instance, we wanted to give the members of the cooperative a tool by which they could support each other through questioning in a number of ways. It could be to develop ideas on small income generation schemes, work out what steps are needed to journey forwards with a plan, or determining whether an individual is ready to receive a loan from the cooperative’s savings group. Having explained the concept in simple terms, we then demonstrated it in practice, using Evelyn, one of the members, as an example.
Evelyn has a dream to develop a cake-baking business – she knows what she would like it to look like eventually, but until now hadn’t known how to start working out how to get there, what steps to take, who she needed to link with re supply and demand etc etc. By the end of the session, Evelyn had a much clearer picture in her mind of the next steps, and the other members had seen the power of questions to help develop a process, rather than the individual with the idea just being told what to do by others.
The conversations that followed showed that the members were thinking through how they could use the process in different situations, and to help various individuals, as well as in their group – it was lovely to see them feeling more equipped and empowered to move forwards.
Next week I have the good fortune to be in Acholi again with a team who are supporting the children. I have a sneaky suspicion that I’ll also be doing some more ‘questioning dreams’ conversations as well – the hunger for development and moving forwards is so great, and I am looking forward to asking questions that help various individuals work out what their next steps are to moving towards their dreams and goals.- September 4, 2018

“Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, is dead.”
That line plays in my mind like a badly scratched record, hiccupping at one point – “is dead, is dead, is dead” – over and over again.
Aretha’s death marks the passing of a generation of Boomers who grew up singing “Respect” – a song that celebrated women’s independence and became the secular theme song for the Civil Rights Movement, and crying to “Natural Woman,” “Never Loved a Man,” and “Until You Come Back to Me.”
And in the age of Beyoncé and Nikki Minaj, Aretha didn’t disappoint. Her lyrics and melodies were a respite from run-on sentences that didn’t rhyme or words with no cadence or imagery. Aretha reclaimed me with “Forgive but Can’t Forget” and “Wonderful.”
No more nostalgia. If Aretha can die, so can we. Facing mortality is something else. As long as Aretha was alive and crooning, I could ride the rhythms of her lyrics through memory lane, and let them take me back to places of hallway grinds and sweet young boy kisses, men who didn’t do right and people/places/spaces that tried to disrespect me. For every event or encounter, there was an Aretha song. She was my/our “Bridge Over Troubled Water.”
Seeing Aretha waste away was the first sign that all was not well with the Queen. She’d battled obesity for decades, along with smoking, and later complications from her illness reduced her to just a wisp of herself. Still, she garnered our “Respect.” Regardless of size, Aretha’s voice never faltered, and never failed her or us.
As Rep. John Lewis, an iconic civil rights activist, wrote upon hearing of her death, “… (Aretha) was like a muse whose songs whispered the strength to continue on. Her music gave us a greater sense of determination to never give up or give in, and to keep the faith.”
And now she’s gone. “The Weight” is upon us. Yes, we have all the songs she wrote and/or sang. Thank God. And all the albums she recorded. Hallelujah.
So FYI, anyone in hearing distance of my house or car is gonna have to suck it up and listen to my Aretha marathon … “Don’t Play that Song Again,” “Do Right Woman, Do Right Man,” especially “Respect” and so many more.
For now, just can’t get that scratch out of my head: Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul … is dead …is dead … is dead.
Gone? Yes.
Forgotten? Never.

This session only touched on a small subset of the tools available. A larger non-comprehensive set is available on the CI Feature Matrix (originally version from codehaus.org).
We don't want to recreate that page here! Please don't try to make this a complete listing of possible CI tools.
This session segmented the CI Tool market very broadly in terms of price. The prices were based on this article by Joel Spolsky where he described the options for pricing: "...software is priced three ways: free, cheap, and dear." You translate those prices in terms of budget levels: Developer Budget, Manager Budget, Director+ Budget).
The notes here are based on rumor, innuendo and hearsay from other CITCON events except where actual users of the tool happened to be present.
Contents
Developer Budget (free)
Developers don't have budget authority so "developer budget" generally means open source. These are build centric tools
a) Hudson: Good for Projects when the number of projects under CI are less. When number of projects grow hudson might sometimes get hard to manage. Has a very good plug-in model. Easy to get started. Easy setup.
b) CruiseControl: Original Java version. Slowing down in popularity currently. CC.NET: Started as a .NET port of CruiseControl but has evolved quite differently since. Still going strong in the .NET world. cc.rb: Ruby people in the audience use this.
c) Lunt Build:
d) Run Code Run: defunct hosted CI service.
e) Build Bot: python based tool. Some users in the audience using it on a php project.
f) phpUnderControl: a repackaging of CruiseControl for php projects.
Manager Budget (cheap)
The Manager Budget is typically something a manager could charge to their credit card and then get reimbursed. These set of tools also fall under build centric tools.
a) Pulse: A cool tool from a 2-man shop. (Bummer that neither Jason nor Daniel made it! -Jtf)
b) Team City: Nicely integrated with IntelliJ. Builds your code before commit and commits only if the build is fine to the repository.
c) Bamboo: Has really nice graphs. Also available hosted as part of Jira Studio.
d) Quick Build: Commercial version of Lunt Build.
Medium Cost Tools
These are the tools which fall under the medium cost category and generally nobody sells tools in this category for reasons explained in the aforementioned Joel article:
."
(I'd argue the bottom limit these days is closer to $10,000 but the concept is still solid - Jtf)
Director+ Budget (expensive)
Enterprise tools. Security and audits are more of an issue. Often used for more than just building. These set of tools are extensible, scalable for thousands of users for thousands of commits and builds. Tools in this category can be used to do the entire release management.
a) AnthillPro: Dependency management built in. Aims to tie together everything from commit to release: Dev, QA, release management, and operations.
b) Cruise: Similar vision to AnthillPro
c) Build Forge: IBM's rational product. Work is underway to make it compatible with WSAD under the banner Rational Automation Framework.
Other CI Tools:
a) RTC (Rational Team Concert) Outcome of Jazz concert. Meant for enterprise agile projects.
b) MS TFS: Microsoft product. Team Foundation Server.
c) DB Deploy: Open Source tool for database change management. Someone said they use it for automatic build for SQL, PL/SQL.Hot Toys MMS432 JUSTICE LEAGUE 1/6 BATMAN (TACTICAL BATSUIT VERSION) REGULAR

Abstract
This paper discusses an approach for designing VW applications using the generative design grammar framework and the generative design agent model as tools. The need for a suitable method and tools for designing VW applications is evidenced by many of the problems that VWs continue to suffer due to poor design. Preliminary analysis suggest that the combination of a method and tools created specifically for designing VW applications provides a robust and suitable approach for designing these types of applications.Payday Loan in Alameda,ameda, California on this page.

After joining your driver at the cruise ship terminal, travel along the Gineste and Crests roads to reach Cape Canaille and begin your tour. There, you'll take in the unparalleled majesty of the Cape's natural beauty, as the Cape maintains the highest sea cliff in all of France.
You'll have the opportunity to board a 45-minute boat tour of the region, on which you'd be able to pass by the three Calanques, or steep-walled coves, that shelter quaint harbors and beaches. In Cassis, you'll have free time to explore the picturesque town and enjoy a delicious French lunch.
Next, you'll enjoy a panoramic tour of the dynamic city of Marseille, France's third-largest metropolis. During your time in Marseille, you'll have a photo opportunity at the famed Notre-Dame de la Garde Basilica, the city's most visited attraction.
From the hill, you'll peer out at a breathtaking view of the city, the nearby Frioul islands, and the fortified Chateau d'If. Then, drive along historic Corniche Road, which will take you to Saint-Victory Abbey, an 11th century fortified church that guards entry to the Vieux-Port.During tough economic times, people will often delay routine dental care until a toothache, chipped tooth, cracked tooth or other problem forces them to see a dentist. There are only so many dollars to go around when the finances are tight, and people are looking for a way to save money, not necessarily trying to catch up on their oral health.
Many patients who had been coming in every six months for routine maintenance are now coming back once a year. Some individuals will even wait for two or three years. People report that they have lost their job and their insurance, so perhaps they didn’t get that filling done. That’s how it turns into a root canal and a crown, or even extraction of the tooth.
Generally speaking, preventive care is far less expensive than advanced care such as periodontal treatment, crowns, root canal, extractions, etc. Early dental treatment is simply more cost-effective. In fact, the cost of providing preventive dental treatment is estimated to be 10 times less than the cost of managing symptoms of dental disease in a hospital emergency room.
Related: Don’t Let a Toothache Ruin Your Vacation
Here are some of the most important reasons for not delaying that visit to the dentist:
It will cost you more financially. People who avoid the dentist can only do so for so long. When you start getting severe toothaches, you will then be motivated to finally make an appointment. The longer you wait, though, the more likely it is that you’ll have to undergo painful and expensive treatments.
You may experience tooth loss. Tooth loss is one of the most serious consequences of avoiding the dentist. Almost all problems affecting the teeth and gums are treatable if they are addressed in a timely manner. However, if you ignore warning signs and don’t get regular checkups, you can lose your teeth. This can occur due to advanced periodontal disease or from tooth decay that goes untreated for too long.
Delays can cause painful toothaches. Cavities and other dental problems become painful if they remain untreated. Sometimes people ignore problems like pain when chewing or sensitivity to hot or cold foods because the pain isn’t severe. If you don’t address the cause, however, the pain is likely to get worse over time.
It will increase the chances of gum disease. Periodontal or gum disease is a widespread problem that can have many harmful effects on your health. This is not something that occurs overnight, but usually results from long-term neglect of the teeth and gums. If neglected, this can lead to painful inflammations and other complications.
Final Thoughts
If you go to the dentist at least once per year, he or she will usually be able to catch any problems in the early stages. This makes your visits fairly simple and pain free. Avoiding the dentist, however, ends up bringing about the things you fear the most – pain and large bills. Do you really want to walk around with a chronic toothache? It’s much better to go to the dentist at the first sign of discomfort and get the problem taken care of.

Here, mountaintops reach for the sky, only to vividly unroll into the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea. Where the two kiss, an endless fringe of pebbly beaches bathes in waves. As if casually dropped from the clouds, the islands of Hvar and Brač sit within a swimmer’s stroke from the mainland. The coast is dotted with fishermen’s villages, some sleepy, some abuzz. One of the latter is the heart of the region, the town of Makarska, and it lends its name to the entire area: Makarska Riviera.
Towering the Riviera is the spectacular massif of Biokovo, part of the Dinaric Alps that holds the country’s second tallest peak, Sveti Jure at 1742 metres. Biokovo is a protected nature park, one of 12 in Croatia. Whether you are a mountain climber, panorama hunter, or even a paraglider, Biokovo is the answer to your heart’s desire. Conquering this mountain – which could be as simple as driving up a narrow road – is a journey through olive groves with drywalls; with altitude these shift into a karst wilderness, home to ibex, eagles and over 200 different butterflies.
Hiking up Biokovo is an ode to the natural beauty of Dalmatia, replete with spectacular views and magnificent viewpoints. The newest, Biokovo Skywalk, is an attraction in its own right: a massive, horseshoe-shaped viewing platform made entirely of glass and steel that juts out from the rocks and makes you feel as if you were floating above the mountain slopes. It’s not for the fainthearted, but jaw-dropping nonetheless.
Nestled at the foot of the mountain, Makarska Riviera stretches some sixty kilometres between the seaside villages of Brela and Gradac. Biokovo protects this narrow stretch of the coast from harsh continental climate; with around 2750 hours of sun per year, sunbathing goes well into October.
The beaches of Makarska Riviera have been sung about in many must-see beach lists. Forbes once proclaimed Punta Rata beach in Brela as the prettiest in Europe and the sixth prettiest in the world. Striking, pristine and lined with cafes, pizzerias and spots where you can rent sunbeds, umbrellas, boats and watersports equipment, fantastic beaches are the main draw for visitors to the Riviera.
Cosied up to a pebbly beach an easy stroll from the town centre of Makarska is Valamar Meteor Hotel, a perfect base for taking in the best of the town’s highlights. The hotel’s outdoors might make it hard to leave though, given the gorgeous infinity pool immersed in the scent of pines, the shallow pool with water attractions that keep the kids infinitely happy and the terraces for lounging and enjoying the very essence of Mediterranean living.
Plenty of foodie goodies are available as well. At Mediterraneo buffet restaurant they come coupled with fun show cooking; at La Pentola Trattoria Italiana, with homemade pasta, bruschettas, risottos, fish and meat specialities and marvellous sea views. Surrounded by sport courts and featuring innumerable possibilities to explore the region, Valamar Meteor makes your vacations as breezy as a summer evening promenade in Makarska.
Makarska’s beach resort identity came to life in the 1960s when construction of hotel facilities picked up. Until then, Makarska was a languid seaside town, with a history that can be traced back to 6000 BC. With its natural harbour flanked by the peninsula of Sveti Petar and the cape of Osejava, Makarska centres on the town’s seafront, the lungo mare. Today it’s dotted with ice cream parlours, souvenir shops, café bars and disco clubs.
Younger crowds fancy Makarska for its leisurely daytime and happening nightlife; families come here for the friendly ambiance and easy multi-generational vacations; and adventurers for the ideal vantage point to explore Dalmatia’s adrenaline-powered experiences, from rafting on Cetina River and rock climbing in Omiš to deep-sea diving near the islands.

Tuesday, November 15, 2016 10:33 AM you come?”
I had heard many rumors about Florence Foster Jenkins and amusing ones so I didn’t want to miss this and I said yes, I’d love to come. “I will leave two tickets for you at a desk in the lobby. See you tonight, good-bye.”
That night, I appeared in the lobby of the Park Lane Hotel and as promised I found two tickets waiting for me. It was nice of her to consider the fact that I might enjoy the concert more fully if I could share my impressions with those of a friend who came with me.
We waited eagerly until the lights went down and that was the signal for Florence to come onstage. It was almost shocking to see her getup. She was wearing a hat that looked like an old lampshade and a costume full of jingling appendages. That was shock number one. Shock number two, which was more forceful than the first, was her voice. She opened her program with a bele song from Lakme. Each note was completely out of tune, either a quarter tone above or a quarter tone below and caused the audience to laugh and giggle because she was at that point more of a comedian than a serious operatic soprano (as she enjoyed calling herself).
Looking around the room, the audience seemed very odd as well. Most of them were older women and men. The women dressed in gowns that looked as if they had been hidden in mothballs in a trunk for many years and taken out for such special occasions. Obviously these were the friends of Florence. This was the first time I ever heard her sing and it was a joke funnier than any prepared comedian’s routine, because she gave the impression that she was really a great singer and out of that mouth came distortion after distortion.
Her husband, who I met after the concert, was also there and he had the appearance, as my companion expressed, of a starved out gaunt-looking herring. She very proudly greeted the guests after her performance.
Every song in the program was as distorted as her opening aria. She chose to sing only very famous, supposedly lyrical arias from very well-known operas. The audience came originally because she was touted as a famous opera singer (and the audience seemed to be opera fans), and they surely knew these works extremely well having heard them at the Met with outstanding voices performing. She sang some colatura pieces, which were funniest of all because of the speed or the tempo and missing the mark each time by singing notes that were never there. So she left a crowd of her friends laughing but trying to give the impression afterwards that she was really very, very good. When Florence Foster Jenkins was asked about the people who laughed, she said they did that because they were jealous of her.
At any rate, we wound up in Florence’s lavish apartment after the concert. It certainly had a style: it was very dark with massive amounts of furniture, sofa after sofa where I bumped myself not expecting to see so many sofas placed one in front of another. Of course there was a little slim vase with one rose sitting on her piano which looked like a very good piano (it was a Steinway). We finally found a place to sit down.
She quoted a fee that I should get if I accepted this job. As much as I and my family needed money at that time, since my father had died and left my mother alone to support three children, I just couldn’t bring myself to accept the tempting offer. She was ready to pay a lavish fee for each concert and each rehearsal. I had to say no, since as a musician of my standards I simply could not listen to that voice continuously for any fee.
Imagine my surprise when it was announced that Florence Foster Jenkins was going to make her formal debut, at Carnegie Hall no less. I had to be there! Of course she had found another accompanist since I refused, a rather nice-looking young man, and his name was Cosmi McMoon, which sounded to me like a made-up name. I went to the concert and the large Carnegie Hall was filled to the rafters with musicians, all of whom had heard about her and had come to be amused and laugh. And they did. I believe one of the audience fainted in the midst of such intense laughter. I was really surprised to learn that many of my musician idols were there. They also wanted to make a joke of this weird singer.
She did her regular routine at Carnegie Hall, singing the same famous arias, and changing costume for each song. For the opera Salame, she wore a bare midriff gown (and she was not slim enough to carry it off). I don’t quite remember at this late date all the details of the gowns she chose for each presentation but whatever they were, they were also enough to shock the audience that a woman of that age and size could carry them off with confidence, presenting herself as the seductive and gorgeous Salame. And to top it off, she added her unbelievable voice to the whole package.
The rumor that floated around was that she had really lost her hearing because of a bout with syphilis which she caught from a previous husband. But the amazing thing to me was the fact that she didn’t seem to hear the distortions and truly felt herself to be a great prima donna.
I was surprised to learn recently that a movie was being made about her life. My daughter called and invited me to see the movie with her, even though I am nearly blind because of macular degeneration and hadn’t gone to a movie in years. But I thought it still might be interesting for the sound, which I could hear, and to compare the facts that I knew about the woman with what they showed on the film. On the film they depicted her comical debut with a Carnegie Hall filled with military personnel. I was there and saw just a few military uniforms. They were mostly musicians and many that I knew. It sounded logical that she had lost her full sense of hearing because of a disease and as they put it, it was syphilis. But she became very famous despite that.
Many artists dream of making a debut at Carnegie Hall, the pinnacle of all famous concert halls, renowned for presenting the greatest performances and artists of the day. And here was what I would call a complete phony, except that she really and truly believed that she was especially gifted and deserved recognition as one of the greats.
Several weeks after her debut she was found lying unconscious on 57th street. This eventually was diagnosed as a heart attack which had caused her death. She must have died a happy woman since she made it giving her debut at Carnegie Hall to a full and enthusiastic house. Whether she was aware of their laughter I do not know, but even if she was, she always felt those who laughed were just jealous rivals. And so her career turned out to be a huge success, converting beauty into an amusing joke.Try a different search or click on nearby areas below.

Track Spikes, Waffles Running Shoes, and all things Athletics
All eyes on are Tokyo this month as the world unites through sport to watch athletes from across the globe compete for their countries at the Olympic Games. After four, well in this case five long years of drive, discipline, and determination, it is finally time to see them showcase their talent on a global stage.
As one of the official partners of Athletics Australia and their Sporting Schools program, we have put together everything you need to know about athletic footwear, just in time for the start of the athletics season. Athletics Australia is the governing body of athletics in Australia, and they work to encourage and promote the sport around the country. Their Sporting Schools program is designed to increase children’s participation in sport and connect them to community opportunities.
What type of athletic shoes do I need?
There are three main types of athletics shoes: running shoes, waffles, and spikes.
Running shoes are a great all-rounder shoe and a great option for young athletes.
Waffles are spikeless shoes, ideal for kids under 12. Whilst they can be used in all athletic events, they are the best cross country running and jumping events. Check out the ASICS GEL-Firestorm, one of our bestselling styles.
Spikes are the ideal shoe for athletes 12 and above and are best for short-distance track events. They provide grip to propel runners forward but do not provide much cushioning. Did you know the first track spikes date back to the 1850s? Fast forward to today, spikes have evolved into innovative competition footwear.
How should athletic shoes fit?
When fitting athletic shoes, you want a snug fit in comparison to running shoes to stay as light and efficient as possible. The shoe should fit the natural shape of your foot and there should be no slip on the heel.
For short-distance, high jump, and long jump events, the shoe should have no cushioning. As the running distance increases, look for a shoe with a small amount of cushioning through the heel. For long-distance events over 400m, a shoe with heel to forefront cushioning will offer propulsion and comfort.
Here at The Athlete’s Foot, we pride ourselves on being the experts in FIT. Our Fit technicians will find your perfect fit using our MyFit 3D technology. So come and talk to us in-store or virtually.
How to care for your athletic shoes?
Caring for your track shoes means not to use them for anything but the track. This will extend the lifetime of shoes. Try our range of cleaners to remove dirt and stains, repel water and remove odour.
Now that you’ve got the low down on athletics shoes, it’s time to watch our athletes in action in Tokyo. For some extra inspiration check out some of our Australian Athlete’s in their final training sessions before heading off to Tokyo. Go AUSTRALIA!
Entrepreneurial spirits are strong with new business application requests up nearly 19% in June 2021 as compared to June 2020 (and even higher at a 31.6% increase from June 2019 to June 2020) as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
As individuals experience job loss, lay-offs and a need to make changes themselves, small businesses are on the rise. When the competition is hot, how do you compete?
Here are some small business marketing ideas to drive loyalty, engagement and new customers when adding competition to the mix.
1. Demonstrate your value proposition
Your value proposition is the ‘why’ people do business with you; it’s arguably the most important aspect of your marketing copy. It is your promise–the factor that sets your company apart from the competition. A strong value prop shows your customers why they should buy from you (and nowhere else). Setting and demonstrating your value proposition is work–work that puts you ahead of the competition and makes you stand out. Neil Patel’s exercise in developing a strong value proposition starts with a list of who your customers are and what they need/want. From there, think through their pain points, their desires and how your exclusivity (and credibility) can help. It is not a tagline or a slogan; it is a statement that guides messaging, how you interact with customers and the services you provide.
2. Showcase values
Your values help your customers and your employees understand who you are and what you stand for. While you may not talk about these values all the time in customer-facing content, building values true to your brand will guide everything you do. When times get tough, refer back to your values—use them to lead you to new success or to fine-tune the things that may be holding you back.
3. Enhance your customers’ experience
What is the current customer experience and how can you make it better? Customer service, personal touches and customized outreach are so important. Go above and beyond; customers stay true to brands that show they care. Use social media channels to make it easy for them to connect with you, ask questions or send personal requests for information. Your treatment (and response time) of your customers reflects heavily on your brand. To beat the competition, prioritize ongoing assessments of your brand’s customer service and spend time reflecting on what’s working (and what’s not). Zendesk’s 2021 Customer Experience Trends Report notes that the top 5 areas customers care most about are:
- Quick resolutions
- Helpful and empathetic agents
- 24/7 support
- Being able to use preferred channels (it’s not what you are comfortable with, it’s what your customers want to use)
- Proactive support
4. Keep your employees top-of-mind
Just as our customers want open and transparent communication, the same holds true for our employees. As competition (and workload) ramps up, employees need to feel supported. If they start to feel displaced or overwhelmed, it can trickle down to your customers. Establish ongoing communication and check-ins with your team members to ensure you’re supporting their needs as your business grows.
5. Set strategic marketing communication touch points
Even if business is good, even if you are busy, you must continue to build your pipeline. If you stop, you’ll have a rude awakening when revenue dries up. Continue to communicate with prospective customers by showcasing your expertise and your willingness to help and educate. The goal is to keep your business top-of-mind so that when the needs arise, customers will reach out.
Do this in a way that is strategic and make plans to measure results frequently. Think about what your customers need in the short-term and the long-term and produce marketing messaging that support both. What information will help them now as they are in the discovery or awareness stage of their journey?
- Establish consistent social media content across all the channels where you are present; sporadic posts will not build relationships
- Add recurring content to your website such as a blog, downloadable content, informational videos or product demonstrations
- Send out small thank you gifts, emails or personalized social media shout-outs to current customers
- Invite new (or not-yet customers) to participate in virtual events and learning opportunities
Continue to market now so you stay ahead of your competition and continue to build connections. Do not stop marketing when business is at a peak; if you do, your sales funnel will dry up.
6. Be consistent and be true to your brand
There’s a reason I started with your value proposition—it defines who you are and it’s a reminder not only for your customers, but for you and your team as well. While thinking outside the box is encouraged, don’t stretch so far that you move into areas or tactics that make you uncomfortable or that doesn’t fit your brand. Your customers are watching. Authentic brands are what matters—those will win out and thrive.Hyper V doesn't work, I already got a bug number from the support, but nothing has happened for a long time, today I also had to find out that Spotify cannot establish a connection via the VPN!

From the 17th to the 23rd, we will be sharing the day’s verse along with a short meditation by members of the Colson Center staff.
O King of all nations and keystone of the Church:
come and save man, whom you formed from the dust!
I once heard a music expert on National Public Radio extol the brilliance of Handel’s Messiah. “The soaring music takes one’s breath away” he said. “And the lyrics are majestic: ‘King of Kings, Lord of Lords.’ So appropriate for the musical score. ‘Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father. The Prince of Peace.’ Magnificent!” he exclaimed. He seemed to have no idea the “lyrics” were the words of Scripture. And that the words are not merely magnificent, the words are true.
O King of all nations . . . The King of kings hasn’t abandoned his people. He hears their cry for deliverance. The eternal Sovereign steps from His throne and removes His crown to become fully human, a baby in a feed box, born to share our flesh and blood so He might die to save us from the penalties of our sin.
. . . keystone of the Church: come and save man, whom you formed from the dust! The Creator stoops again to create humanity; not from the life-giving dust of the Garden but from the muck of rebellion and death. Born a second time, we “new creations” join as living stones to become the Church, secured by Him who is the capstone.
The NPR music expert was wowed by the genius of Handel’s Messiah, but the deeper truths are even more stunning. The soaring music and words tell the true story of God and man, heaven and earth. Their histories converge face to face for a time; from Advent to Ascension.
Now, enthroned again, the Lord does not shout, “Behave!” He cries out, “Behold!” He is making everything new (Revelation 21:5). Including us.

The Teachers Service Commission, TSC, has remained firm on the entry requirements into the teaching profession, insisting that some teachers are poor at communication.
In what seems like a move to ashame teachers, TSC revealed that some of the letters teachers write to the Commission have a lot of spelling mistakes.
According to TSC Director of Quality Assurance and Standards (QAS), Dr. Reuben Nthamburi, TSC wants to professionalize the teaching service to match other professions like law, engineering and medicine. Already, the commission has told universities the kind of a teacher they want.

Teachers Who Fail Consistently in TPD Tests Likely To Be Removed From Payroll
We are not planning to scrap hardship allowance From Any Hardship area, clarifies TSC
The main challenge that TSC is facing currently, according to Nthamburi is that most teachers cannot communicate effectively and that is what prompted Kenya University and College Central Placement Service, KUCCPS, to strictly put Grade C (plain) as a minimum requirement in both English and Mathematics for any applicant who wants to pursue a degree in education.
“You saw in the papers when we did say we want the BED programme properly reorganized, what came out? The outcry; that this can’t work. You know change is painful and always resisted. But what we are saying TSC is the client. I am the one who takes the teacher,’ said Nthamburi.
“The challenges we are having today, if you look at some of the letters the teachers are writing, they have very many spelling mistakes…We want to have qualified teachers who can communicate well,” added Nthamburi.
Nthamburi was addressing the Senate Committee on Education chaired by Dr. Alice Milgo and Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD), where he represented the TSC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Nancy Macharia.
The director maintained that the teaching service can only be professionalized and can only match other professions if the entry requirements are strictly observed and boosted by a professional development training, which in this case is the Teacher Professional Development, TPD. Before then, TSC will not think of remunerating or motivating teachers.
“It is the question of what do we want best for our teachers, the future of a teacher in the country; the 21st century teacher…we would want to get a professionalized teacher, and that one we are not relenting on it,”
Nthamburi added that it’s the role of universities to understand the new areas and emerging issues in education so as to align their content accordingly. He further revealed that TSC has previously held separate meetings with all the Vice-Chancellors of universities and soon they will meet all the University VCs and the Faculty Deans to deliberate on how they will align their courses.
“Some Universities have run very quickly, they have begun aligning their degree courses to CBC,” said Dr. Nthamburi.HSBC expands localised e-commerce trading services

Each year, California FFA Foundation designates Giving Tuesday to raise funds for blue jackets for California FFA students who may not be able to afford one. Your $80 donation provides a jacket and a tie/scarf to a California FFA student member. Thanks to a match by Blue Diamond Growers of $25,000, every dollar you donate gets doubled.
In a year that jackets were not necessarily required, California Association FFA staff still wanted to provide students access to jackets. The discussion led to offering all 338 chapters the opportunity to apply for five chapter jackets. Agricultural teachers throughout California enthusiastically welcomed the opportunity to participate in the program. Over 630 jackets were provided to 111 chapters in California.
The advisors selected the sizes, and male or female jackets, for their chapter’s set of loaners. The jacket arrived with the chapter name embroidered on the back and a tie or scarf. The loaner jackets will be used by students that need a jacket for official California FFA competitions, events, or county fairs.
California FFA Center staff then worked with National FFA to streamline the process. Lisa Barger, Director of Merchandise & Membership Services, National FFA, says about the program, “Nationally, approximately 50% of FFA members do not have jackets for official functions, competitions, special events and state and national conventions. California FFA creatively met this need with their 2021 Chapter Jacket Loaner program and inspired more students to learn, grow and serve while in the blue jacket.”
Donate on Giving Tuesday, November 30th. You can donate on calaged.org or on California FFA’s fundraising event on Facebook.

Two days after a lifeless body of a Buruburu girls teacher was found in a swimming pool, the cause of his death has been revealed.
Authorities have confirmed that Nelson Otsianda, the Buru Buru Girls High School teacher whose body was found at a Diani hotel’s swimming pool, died by drowning.
A post-mortem done at Jocham Hospital mortuary showed that the body of the teacher had no injuries.
“He had no soft tissue injuries on his body. This shows that he was not assaulted. Perhaps he was just drunk and fell in the water and did not know how to swim,” said Msambweni police boss Fanuel Nasio.

The teacher and four colleagues had checked in at Gisimba Villas on November 13 for a couple of days.
But in a cruel twist of fate, the same day they arrived in Diani, his lifeless body was found at the hotel’s swimming pool.
According to a source at the villa, the five were playing loud music and drinking by the pool.
“We found them trying to resuscitate Nelson. The owner of the hotel called police officers who took long to arrive, forcing the friends to hire a boda boda to ferry him to Diani Beach Hospital,” he said.Whatever the fact will be the cash of Ohio Kansas Chat area will be the digital capital of that shows on the internet mingling as a whole and somewhere where you can satisfy and connect with the latest Ohioans online within common Ohio Chat!

cucumber, cream cheese, dill, chives, whole wheat bread
Sandwiches and Burgers
Tennis is one of those poshy sports in which etiquette and decorum always matter. As a result, we can’t help but associate the sport with bite-size, gourmet hors d’oeuvres. And boy do these little cucumber tea sandwiches fit the bill.
Vegetarian-friendly, these babies are easy to make and stack. “Serve” open-faced or piled high in club-sandwich format. We won’t judge.
Ingredients
1 small–medium-sized cucumber, thinly sliced into rounds (we prefer to keep the skin on, but either way works)
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 ½ cups cream cheese (or stracchino cheese if you can find it)
½ small bunch dill, finely chopped
Small bunch chives, snipped or minced into bits
9–10 thin slices whole wheat bread, cut into squares just slightly larger than the diameter of the cucumber slices
Directions
After you have finished slicing the cucumbers, lay them on a paper towel and then top with another paper towel for a couple minutes to dry them a bit.
In a food processor, combine your dill, several sprinkles of black pepper, cheese, and most of the chives.
Begin assembly. First, start with one piece of the bread you sliced. Spread some of the cheese mixture on it, then top with 2 cuc slices stacked atop each other. If you want to keep your sandwiches open-faced, sprinkle with chives and move to Step 5.
If you want a club-sandwich serving style rather than open-faced, repeat Step 3 until you have a three-layered club (three slices of bread). On the top bread slice, place a tiny dollop of cheese in the center and then top with a single cucumber slice. Sprinkle with some chives.
Repeat this until you have used up all your ingredients and have several little cuc sandwiches!
Serve with a chilled glass of champagne and enjoy!We do all the looking for you. Princeton, MN has 56+ organizations that publish their own events calendar. Now you can find all of those events in one place, click on any event for more information.

Awarded by Panavision in the Papaya Young Directors competition for best cinematography.Kamiyah Mobley, the 18-year-old who was stolen at birth from a Florida hospital and raised as Alexis Manigo, defended her abductor, saying she is not a "felon". Gloria Williams, 51, has been arrested for allegedly posing as a nurse and stealing the baby from her biological parents in 1998.
However, in a Facebook post, the teenager wrote that Williams "raised me with everything I needed and most of all everything I wanted. My mother is no felon. The ignorant ones won't understand that.''
Mobley's remarks came as her biological family in Jacksonville was celebrating after being informed that their stolen baby has been found after 18 years. The family reportedly cried "tears of joy" after hearing the news from a detective.
"She looks just like her daddy," her paternal grandmother, Velma Aiken, told The Associated Press after Mobley was reunited with her birth family via video chat on Friday (13 January). Aiken added: "She acts like she's been talking to us all the time. She told us she'd be here soon to see us."
"I always prayed, 'Don't let me die before I see my grandbaby'. My prayer was answered," Aiken told the news agency.
Mobley was abducted when she was just eight hours old. Williams had allegedly posed as a nurse at University Medical Center in Jacksonville on 10 July, 1998, and kidnapped the child. The case had garnered national attention and also featured on television programmes in the US at that time, but with the passage of time became a cold case.
However, police continued to follow all leads they received from different sources. Eventually, a tip received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children led to the abductor, Robert Lowery, a vice president at the centre, said without disclosing the name of the person who gave the tip.
Williams was arrested at her home in Walterboro, South Carolina, early Friday. A DNA test of Mobley confirmed she was the missing baby, who has been living in Walterboro all these years as Williams' daughter.
"She wasn't an abused child or a child who got in trouble. But she grew up with a lie for 18 years," Joseph Jenkins, Mobley's neighbour from Walterboro told the AP.
Tesha Stephens, a cousin of Williams, told reporters on Friday evening that Mobley, whom they have known as Alexis, was now holding up. "This was something brand new to all of us," she said of the incident.
"Right now she's holding up. She's processing everything and she's probably going to have to take this day-by-day," Stephens said of Mobley.

Especially since i was hearing this while watching my ‘Skins drop their lead and lose it against our rival Cowboys last night!
Talk about a double whammy. One being more important than the other, ofcourse, but equally upsetting ;)
I didn’t know entire situation exactly, but from what our GOOD neighbors say (the ones who invited us to watch this so-called football “game” last night) it seemed as if their interest rates reset and they could no longer afford their corner-unit with a glam frontview of our LAKE!!! arghh….so they then tried to “short sell” it, only to find out their lender won’t except it!!!
Short Sale: A short sale occurs when a property is sold and the lender agrees to accept a discounted payoff, meaning the lender will release the lien that is secured to the property upon receipt of less money than is actually owed.
So while this neighbor HAD an offer on the table to buy the property at a MUCH lower value (i think it was around $300k for a place that sold for $370 two years ago) she just said “F it” and it is now in foreclosure. ARghhhhhhhhhhhh…..
So now, the minute it sells for buttloads less, all of our places will drop in value!!! I don’t know the logistics of it all, but basically if her stupid corner townhouse with the f’ing fantastic view sells for, let’s say, $200k (God forbid), and our not-*as*-nice places used to be valued at $350k-$370k, then the next buyers coming into town could value our places around $250-$300k or something equally horrendous. I really don’t know how it all works out in reality, just in theory ;) What i DO know is that it hurts us either way…and it really pisses me off.
Again, i don’t know her specific situation, but it just sucks when you are a good little citizen and pay your dues on time and diligently, yet you lose thousands because of someone else’s mistakes! Why again did we have to buy a house so randomly at the peak of the market? oh yeah – to follow the American dream! F to the F to the F, F, F.

When it comes to marketing for social enterprises, there are some essential metrics that serve as the most insightful KPIs to watch for. Each of these can provide analytics that inform any steps that follow and changes that need to be undertaken.
If you’re going to engage in digital marketing, make sure you set these particular KPIs for monitoring.
Conversion Rates
Conversion rates are what you’ll use to map out your sales strategy and future executions for lead generation. In digital marketing, these can inform you on the most effective platforms and ways you can funnel potential customers into a profitable transaction. Essentially, your goal is to not only increase the rate of your website traffic but also turn each visitor into a verified consumer that takes the actions you want them to take.
Optimally, you should aim to hit conversion rates above 10%. The industry average for e-commerce is around 4%.
Consumer Statistics
This covers a variety of data you can gather insights from. As a starting point, you can check how much of your traffic comes from organic visits. This can tell you whether your digital marketing efforts are effective outside of sponsored posts.
You can also check the analytics of your traffic to see what your audience is made up of and whether or not you’re actually hitting your target market. See the ratio between returning visitors and new ones. On top of this, it’s a good idea to measure how long you are actually retaining customers. Those numbers can tell you how effective your product or brand is at offering long-term value.
To improve your overall digital strategy, it’s also good to gauge the sentiments around your UI, customer journey, and services.
Cost-to-Revenue Ratio
For this point, you basically have to think about whether your actions are productive and worth the cost. Set targets that you can hit and analyze how much these objectives are producing in terms of revenue. It’s a good idea to have routine checks of this so you can have both short-term and long-term results.
Consider the details of your revenue as well. How much does it cost you to acquire more customers? Following that, how much are you actually earning per customer? It’s important to balance these out, so in-depth consumer revenue analysis can save you a lot of expenses when it comes to finalizing your digital marketing strategy.
As a general rule, you should not be spending more than 30 percent of your total gross revenue on marketing materials.
Conclusion
There are many other metrics to take note of as well, like click-through rates, impressions, and page views. However, those are just supplementary in the data that they provide. The points we mentioned today are the main three that you want to make sure are in your analytics because regardless of whether you’re expanding a massive brand or developing content marketing for small businesses, they will provide you with actionable information from which you can form plans and campaigns.

It's also the start of National Heart Month, a time we should all use to make sure we're heart healthy. This is especially important in Arkansas.
As tragic as COVID-19 has been, almost twice as many Arkansans will die from heart disease. And in a lot of ways, COVID has made heart problems even worse.
“You know, we've seen a lot of people sit on symptoms and basically hope for the best because they're afraid to come into the hospital or clinics, because they're trying to be safe,” Interventional Cardiologist Dr. Nazneen Tata said. “And I tell people, ‘we'll keep you safe. You just need to come in and get that help before it's too late.’”
And if there was one overriding factor at the root of heart disease?
“It's hard to put a finger just on one. What I would say is lifestyle,” Dr. Tata said.
Of course she means diet, exercise and no smoking.
“There is no good number of cigarettes, you know. Zero is your number,” she said. “But when I talk about lifestyle too, it's also stress in the world we live in, you know, psychological stress is just as important as physical stress.”
Dr. Tata is quick to point out this stress is not just in men, women need to be aware too.
“When you're under a lot of stress, there is a lot of changes in our neural hormones and that puts strain on our heart physiologically,” Dr. Tata said. “So, women need to understand that.”
Heart attack signs in men are very familiar — pain in the arms, shortness of breath, chest pain.
“But with women what we see sometimes, it's more from indigestion type feeling, so like a heartburn feeling,” she said.
Outcomes for women are improving, but in terms of year to year outcomes, women still do worse than men.
“You know we're good at nagging, but we had to take our own medicine sometimes,” Dr. Tata said.
Bottom line, don't let ignorance become an underlying condition — know your heart health.
“I cannot tell you I’m going to buy you 15 more years or 20 more years,” Dr. Tata said. “All I’m trying to give you back is quality of life. Where you can enjoy the time you have to your best abilities and I think once people recognize that, I have seen people turn around their lives.
Dr. Tata shared with us some risk factors that women should consider:
Do you answer yes to any of these questions:
- Did you have high blood pressure during pregnancy
- Did you have heart problems during pregnancy?
- Did you become a diabetic during pregnancy?
If answering yes to those questions, you’re at risk of heart disease. It's best to talk it over with your primary care physician first.Best Dating Website for United States Of America People to Meet Asian People Online

I found Sandvox with a Google search.
What made you decide to get Sandvox?
Sandvox is a great tool if you want an easy method to quickly develop a professional looking website on the MAC.
Now that you have Sandvox, what do you like about it?
I love that Sandvox is intuitive, very easy to use and offers designs that can be modified. I am still learning and finding this is the best web design software I have used. New to the Mac and this is really making my transition easy. I am really hard on this software, doing a lot wrong and trying all kinds of things - Sandvox is very forgiving!
What would be a good way to search for a program like Sandvox?The leader of good news, John Krasinski, had one of the largest graduating classes the US has ever seen this week. He set out to congratulate the graduates of 2020 by providing his viewership with a diploma template. This act was significant as graduation was cancelled for many due to the pandemic. Numerous graduates uploaded their personalized SGN diploma to their social media in hopes of recognition from ‘Somos Good News”. Staying true to their mission, “Some Good News” did not disappoint. Many students were congratulated and recognized for their academic achievements in SGN’s social media.
Continuing John Krasisnki’s lead, BELatina News has created yet another episode of their own version of “Some Good News” with “Somos Good News.” In this BELatina News original series, people will find comfort in news coverage that is good for the soul. Just like Krasinski’s initiative this week, “Somos Good News” also recognized many people.
Hosts, Katherine Castro and Angela Carrasco, report about a nonprofit organization, Conga Kids, determination to continue to serve their students. They took the time to create an online platform apt for virtual dance lessons. After noticing the positive impact their lessons had on their student’s, Conga Kids opened up their class to everyone. These online classes became free of charge on May 1st for the public.
The episode features Yanira Soriano, too. She is a woman from New York City, who contracted COVID-19 while pregnant. Her condition accelerated so much that doctors were forced to put her in a medically-induced coma. Thus, hooking her up to a ventilator. She remained in a critical condition for 11 days. During this time, she gave birth to her son via c-section. Though things looked bleak for her at some point, she prevailed against the coronavirus.
“Somos Good News” presents the recovered mother holding her baby for the first time. It was a beautiful sight to say the least.
To maintain the high spirits of this episode, Castro and Carrasco also touch upon Kenan Thompson’s SNL character, “Big Papi.” As many of you may already know, Thompson’s “Big Papi” character plays homage to the Dominican baseball player, David Ortiz.
In the skit highlighted, “Big Papi” takes us into the process of making a Dominican lunch. He chose sancocho, or in other words: Dominican Republic in a bowl, as the focus of his menu. However, he added extra ingredients. One can assume this was done with the purpose to personalize his flavor. “Big Papi” had some help making his meal as well. “Big Bunny” made an appearance to showcase his products, allowing “Big Papi” to cook everything in time.
Flavor seems to be the theme of this episode and there’s nothing wrong with that. Besides, what Latin person isn’t accustomed to some sazón?
Speaking of flavor, two Cuban medical professionals made an appearance on “Somos Good News” this week. They showed the world their spice flaunting salsa moves that so many of us love seeing. The song they danced to was, “Quedate en casa,” by Havana D’ Primera which couldn’t have been more appropriate considering our current situation.
There’s no denying that there’s a lot of movement going on around the world. Especially in our Latin community. This is a true testament to our resilience even in the hardest of times.
Stay tuned for more “Somos Good News” next week. Remember, amid the pandemic, good news continues to surface.Epilog Imaging Systems Overview

Epilog ImagingI’ve decided which story to post. It’s not one of the ones I”m actively working on and seeking to publish. It’s a story that I started and just pushed to the back burner a while ago, but I do love it.
So I’m going to share it by chapters with you fine folks.
Enjoy!
Chapter One
I stared out my window and watched as the snow fell softly to the frozen ground. My mother finally cornered me in a room of the house and started her lecture.
“Anne, you need to listen. Your behavior is atrocious. How do you expect to find a wealthy husband?”
“Mother, calm down. My behavior is just fine. Besides I don’t want to get married.”
“It doesn’t matter what you want. You will find a respectable man, and you will get married. In fact Charles Darlow will be here for supper,” mother said heading for the door.
A very short lecture this time.
“I don’t want to see that man,” I protested.
“Get over it , Anne dear. He’s a good man from a good family,” she said promptly shutting the door behind her.
It wasn’t fair. I didn’t love Charles Darlow. I didn’t love any of the men that my parents deemed suitable. Hell, most of them were my parents age. I grabbed the silver hairbrush that sat on the table in front of me and threw it at the door.
I won’t marry who they want me to! I shouted in my mind.
“Miss Anne, it’s not very lady like to throw ones possessions at doors,” the deep drawl of Thomas came from the doorway.
“Thom,” I said with relief.
“Ma’am?”
“Don’t call me that,” I pouted.
His lean muscular body was hidden beneath the cotton trousers; starched, white shirt; and wool jacket my parents made him wear.
“It’s only proper ma’am,” he smiled.
I could feel my heart skip a beat.
“What do you want Thom?” I sighed pushing the unlady like thoughts he dredged up to the back of my mind.
“Your mother asked me to bring this to you,” he held up a chocolate-brown, silk dress.
“Of course she did,” I ran my fingers through my auburn hair and stood up.
I reached out for the dress, but Thomas grabbed my wrist and pulled me in close to him. His intoxicating scent flooded my senses. The delicate dress fluttered to the ground as he wrapped his arms around my waist, and mine around his neck.
“This can’t last forever,” he whispered in my ear.
“Sure it can,” I nuzeled his neck.
“You’re almost nineteen.”
“So?” I asked.
“You’re going to have to get married,” his green eyes stared into my own blue ones.
“It’s not fair that they get to pick who I marry.”
“I know,” he leaned in a kissed me softly.
As I pushed into him the door knob creaked on my door. I quickly broke the moment and reached down for the dress.
“Why was the door shut?” the tall, beautiful, blonde asked who pushed it open.
“A draft must have blown it shut, ma’am,” Thomas said to her.
“Hmm, either way, Anne, mother said to get dressed and get down stairs.”
“Okay, Elizabeth,” I mumbled at my sister.
“It wouldn’t hurt for you to actually put effort into looking decent tonight. You know I can’t marry until you do.” She turned her nose up at Thom and retreated from the room.
“I can’t stand her,” I muttered turning to my closet.
“She’s your sister.”
“She’s horrible.”
I slid out of my cotton day dress and pulled the prison garb on."Flowers... are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world. "

Claiming breach of contract for refusing to distribute his latest movie, filmmaker Woody Allen has sued Amazon Studios for $68 million for breach of contract, The Wall Street Journalreported Thursday.
Filed in federal court Thursday in the Southern District of New York, the lawsuit seeks damages for Amazon terminating a four-picture production and distribution deal without cause. The suit emerges as the future of Allen's latest film, A Rainy Day in New York, remains uncertain, though production wrapped in 2017.
Allen, 83, and a four-time Academy Award winner, has accused Amazon of backing out of his deal last June after the #MeToo movement renewed media attention to longstanding accusations that he molested his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, in 1992. According to the Journal, the lawsuit reads:
."
Allen alleges that his business relationship with Amazon started to break down in late 2017, soon after an Amazon producer accused former Amazon Studios President Roy Price of harassment. Price also came under scrutiny for his business ties to movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.
A Rainy Day in New York stars Timothee Chalamet, Diego Luna, Elle Fanning, Jude Law, Selena Gomez and Liev Schreiber. Though completed in 2017, Amazon Studios has declined to distribute the film indefinitely. Many of the film's cast members have publicly expressed regret for working with Allen. Chalamet and Gomez donated their salaries from the film to charity in a show of solidarity to victims of sexual assault.
In 2018, Dylan Farrow provided new details regarding her allegations against Allen on CBS This Morning. She has also written about her experience. Meanwhile, Allen has continued to forcefully deny the allegations.
Variety has reported Amazon Studios Associate General Counsel Ajay Patel emailed Allen's representatives notice back in June 2018, terminating the production and distribution deal. Allen's camp maintains that Patel failed to provide a reason for the termination.
The deal between Allen and Amazon, sealed in 2016, saw the release of two other films, Wonder Wheel and Café Society.
"Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection and genuine goodwill — the lawsuits come later," Allen said at the time, according to Variety.tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-477600956057124592.post1887047849796921536..comments2021-11-25T18:25:44.623+05:30Comments on Speeding Light: Matrimony - The height of Materialism!Unknownnoreply@blogger.comBlogger9125tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-477600956057124592.post-6939094404751525782010-05-05T15:28:00.596+05:302010-05-05T15:28:00.596+05:30very nice n very true......

Last year, I wrote about my journey as a Spurs fan, growing up in San Antonio and eventually moving to Los Angeles, getting lost in the glitz and glamour of the Phil Jackson led Lakers.
Lee Dresie recently published an excellent article in which he dissects San Antonio’s changing of the guard through the lens of a Greek paradox: “the connection to the Spurs could have resulted from the wonder of watching the incomparable Manu Ginobili, the dignity of David Robinson, or the remarkable fundamentals of the Great Tim Duncan”.
For me, I grew up in San Antonio, so being a Spurs fan was just a natural part of my childhood. I didn’t know that during most of the games I attended, the Spurs were in their darkest period.
The acquisition of David Robinson brought hope to The Alamo City. The Admiral’s class and gravitas only made the transition sweeter. For me, that worked for his first three or four seasons. Then my teenage years took over and I started to rebel. Believe it or not, the bridge of my angsty youth to the Spurs was Dennis Rodman. I don’t often mention the foolishness of my youth (just like I don’t take out the photos of my hairstyles from that era), but by the time I regained interest in basketball, the Spurs were my team and it was exactly for the reasons most fans became so passionate — great players, relationships, team loyalty, and a positive attitude from most of the roster. There is no denying the connection between the Spurs and the armed forces in Military City, U.S.A.
But like Dresie, I am holding on to the Spurs through this transition acknowledging the sum is greater than the parts.
I took my father-in-law to a Spurs game this season and he was taken aback by how many fans were dressed in Spurs gear. He then admitted it wasn’t just at the AT&T Center, but all over town (my own wardrobe has been a topic of teasing for my non-Spurs family members). I had to agree, Spurs fans show support in all facets of their lives.
Pounders, what is it that makes you a Spurs fan? Can you name the moment that it became less a hobby and more a lifestyle?<<About this book

Senator HARKIN. Thank you very much, Dr. Judd. This subcommittee, and this Senator in particular, has been very supportive. The National Institute of Mental Health, last year, we increased by $101 million, $398 million to $491 million, almost a 30percent increase.
Dr. JUDD. Yes; for which we were very grateful, Mr. Chairman.
Senator HARKIN. You wound up pretty good. We wound up with $458 million. We had to come down from that, we had to compromise with the House on that, so we have a record of strong support. We want to continue that strong support as much as the budget will allow us to take advantage of the increased focus the decade will bring, and to make sure that we fulfill those objectives that were set out during this decade. So by the year 2000, we will have made some giant strides toward unlocking some of the secrets that we know are there.
Dr. JUDD. Exactly,
Senator HARKIN. We need the research done. We are getting closer all the time to unlocking some of those doors, and now is not the time to back off.
Dr. JUDD. Wonderful. Senator HARKIN. Thank you, Dr. Judd. Dr. JUDD. Delighted to hear that. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman,
STATEMENT OF DANIEL T. BROSS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AIDS AC.
TION COUNCIL Senator HARKIN. Our next witness is Daniel T. Bross, executive director of the AIDS Action Council.
Mr. Bross, welcome to the subcommittee. And your statement will be made a part of the record in its entirety. Please summarize it.
Mr. BROSS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Gorton, members of the subcommittee staff.
I am Dan Bross, executive director of the AIDS Action Council. The council represents more than 500 community-based AIDS service organizations at the front lines of the AIDS epidemic. I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning, and to convey the AIDS community's appreciation for your leadership, and particularly your efforts last year in providing funding for the Ryan White CARE Act.
Unfortunately, once again this year, AIDS Action must come before you again with an urgent appeal for increased AIDS funding. Ten years after the reports of a strange new illness, AIDS has killed more than 100,000 Americans. There will be 60,000 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS this year alone. Every single day, 125 people die of AIDS, and 110 more become infected with HIV.
As someone who has worked for the last 5 years at the community-base level, I can tell you that the suffering out there is real, it is terrible, and it is getting worse. AIDS Action Council convenes the Coalition of National Organizations responding to AIDS, representing more than 150 national groups, actively fighting the virus.
In the coalition's expert judgment, it would take $3 billion in 1992, or $1 billion above the President's request to adequately address the epidemic. I am happy to submit a copy of our appropriations recommendations for 1992 for the record. We make this request recognizing the constraints imposed by the Budget Enforcement Act, but as a Nation we must recognize the threat that AIDS poses to our national security, and respond just as resourcefully as we have to perceived threats abroad.
Today I want to focus on the most neglected aspect of our Nation's response to the epidemic: care for men, women, and children with HIV. This year, AIDS Action Council's top priority is full funding of the Ryan White CARE Act. The statistics I cited earlier are a brutal reality for AIDS service organizations, all of which handle overwhelming caseloads to make up for the lack of services in their communities. Yet even for community-based groups, service cuts may be the harbinger of the future. Caseloads in the 16 cities under title I of the CARE Act have increased 20 percent in the last year. With 5-percent inflation, and with two additional cities now eligible, title I funding will need to be increased by 30 percent, just to meet the same fraction of need addressed last year.
The funding provided in title I is making a difference in those cities, but without significant increase in services, we will have to lag—we will not be keeping up in the increase in caseloads. The same can be said for State services funded by title II of the act. Between the level of funding proposed by the President and the expiration of overlapping funding cycles, there will be an actual decline in the level of care States can provide.
As you know, title III's early intervention programs were not funded last year. We do not know how many people have developed AIDS as a result. However, we do know that some 600,000 HIV infected Americans now need early intervention care. Sadly, only a tiny number are receiving it.
Together the CARE Act's three titles comprise a comprehensive response to the care needs of people with HIV. Full funding of these programs at more than $500 million above the President's request would represent a dramatic and unprecedented increase in funding. But please, remember that the care for people with HIV has been neglected by the Federal Government for 10 years. Consequently, the epidemic continues to devastate our Nation's health care delivery system.
PREPARED STATEMENT
Mr. Chairman, literally hundreds of thousands of Americans with HIV and their families are looking with hope to this committee. Please do not disappoint them.
Thank you.
[The statement follows:]
STATEMENT OF DANIEL T. BROSS Good morning Mr. Chairman, my name is Dan Bross. I am executive director of the AIDS Action Council. The Council represents the 500-plus community based AIDS organizations who are at the frontlines of the nation's fight against AIDS.
I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning and to underscore the AIDS community's appreciation for your leadership in the fight against AIDS, Once again, however, AIDS Action Council comes before you with an urgent appeal for increased funding for our nation's AIDS programs.
As you know, AIDS Action Council convenes the coalition of National Organiza. tions Responding to AIDS, which represents over 150 national groups concerned about a comprehensive federal response to AIDS. In our professional judgment, it would take $3 billion in funding in 1992, or $1 billion above the President's request, to begin to address the range of challenges posed by this epidemic. I am happy to submit a copy of our alternative budget proposal for the record.
We make this funding recommendation fully cognizant of the limitations imposed by the Budget Enforcement Act and our national commitment to reducing the desicit. But surely we as a nation can recognize the threat that AIDS poses to our national security and respond just as resourcefully as we have to perceived threats in the international arena.
In its tenth year, the AIDS crisis is no less dramatic than before. Indeed in many respects its demands on our nation's health care system are far more pressing than ever. Already, over 100,000 Americans have died of AIDS; the CDC estimates that there will be 60,000 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS this year alone; every day, approximately 125 people die of AIDS-related causes, 165 people are diagnosed with full-blown AIDS, and 110 people become infected with HIV.
As someone who both represents and has worked for community-based AIDS organizations, I can tell you that the suffering out there is real; it is terrible; and it is getting worse.
There is so much our nation must do to properly contain this epidemic: -Our nation still lacks a comprehensive strategy for and commitment to edu.
cation and other prevention programs needed to stem the spread of HIV infec. tion. What programs we have are chronically underfunded. There is a cruel irony in the fact that the President's budget request contains only a one percent increase in funding for prevention programs while it acknowledges that spend. ing for Medicare and Medicaid will rise by 29 percent. We have neglected pre- vention, and now we are paying for that neglect in the cost of care. -Our nation's research efforts have made dramatic gains in our understanding of HIV disease. But research efforts are being crippled by underfunding and understaffing. A recent study conducted by the Institute of Medicine at the re- quest of the NIH concluded that the AIDS research effort would benefit from
a 25 percent increase in funding. We fully support that recommendation. --And because of the close connection between injection and other drug use and
the transmission of HIV, it is critical that our nation's capacity to treat and prevent substance abuse be increased—and that HIV-related services be integrated
into those programs. But in the limited time I have today, I want to focus on the most neglected aspect of our nation's response to the AIDS epidemic: the care needs of people with HIV infection. In this fiscal year, AIDS Action Council's highest priority is to fulfill the promise of the Ryan White CARE Act and move toward full funding of the desperately needed programs created by CARE. The jump start given these programs last year must be more than matched this year, if we are to begin containing the burden posed by this epidemic on our nation's health care system.
The statistics I cited earlier are an every day reality for the AIDS service organizations throughout the country. They must cope with burgeoning caseloads and the disproportionate impact HIV is having on local health care delivery systems. Just last year the country's largest AIDS service provider, in New York, was forced to limit its services for the very first time.
Service cuts may be the harbinger of the future. The caseload in the 16 cities funded under the emergency assistance portion of the CARE Act has increased 20 percent in the last year. Allowing 5 percent for inflation, Title I funding would need to increase by 25 percent just to meet the same fraction of the need addressed in the 1991 appropriation. The funding already provided in Title I is making a dramatic difference in those 16 communities. But without significant increases, these communities will continue to fall behind in their battle to keep up with the growing caseload.
The same can be said for the funding provided the states in Title II of the CARE Act. With the expiration of overlapping funding cycles in 1992, level funding will mean an actual decline in the level of care-related services states can provide. On top of a growing caseload, this will result in tragedy for thousands.
As you know, Title III of the CARE Act, which provides for early intervention services, was not funded last year. It is hard to know how many people have devel. oped AIDS as a result. But we do know that some 600,000 HIV-infected Americans now need early intervention services—care that can delay or prevent their developing AIDS. Only a very small number are getting it. Indeed, the need for these serv. ices is 80 great that many of the Title I cities have set aside resources to provide such care because Title III was not funded.
Short of dramatic changes in our nation's entitlement programs, the three titles of the CARE Act, taken together, comprise a comprehensive Federal response to the care needs of people with ÅIV infection. We understand that asking for full funding of these programs—at more than $500 million above the President's budget request—would represent a dramatic, and unprecedented, increase in funding. But we must remember that care is an area that has been neglected by the Federal government until last year. We must make up for lost time. That $500 million should have been spent over the past ten years; it must be spent now.
Mr. Chairman, literally hundreds of thousands of Americans with HIV infection and their families are looking with hope to this committee. Please don't disappoint them and send thousands to an early death.
TESTING AND COUNSELING STATUTE Senator HARKIN. Mr. Bross, thank you very much for your testimony. Again you have a sympathetic ear here. We will do everything we can. The President's request is a 3.5-percent increase. Title III, the testing and counseling statute requires at least 35 percent of funding be spent on new services. My question is should we first insure existing services are not cut.
Mr. BROSS. The President's request of a 3.5-percent increase does not even meet inflation for this year. As I cited in my testimony, we are looking at a 20-percent increase in caseloads, just in the title I cities. So I think that in order to meet the needs of the people out there, we need to maintain at least current services. And with the President's request, we are really looking at a reduction in current services.
Senator HARKIN. You are asking for about $1 billion over what the President has requested.
Mr. BROSS. That is for AIDS programs throughout the Federal Government, sir. On the CARE Act specifically, we are only asking that Congress appropriate the moneys that were authorized last year. And that is $851 million.
Senator HARKIN. I understand. Mr. Bross, we will do our best.
Mr. BROSS. I know you will, Senator. Thank you very much. STATEMENT OF DR. MATHILDE KRIM, AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR
AIDS RESEARCH Senator HARKIN. Our next witness is Dr. Mathilde Krim, American Foundation for AIDS Research. Dr. Krim, good to see you again. And welcome to the subcommittee. Your statement will be made a part of the record in its entirety.
Dr. KRIM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes; we submitted a written statement, and because of the very short time today, I will limit my presentation to emphasizing a few important facts that I would hope you would keep in mind during the appropriations process. I will comment specifically on behalf of AmFAR, the American Foundation for AIDS Research on the research needs related to AIDS.
One of the very important facts to remember is that we are facing today only the early phases of a worldwide epidemic of a deadly viral infection. The World Health Organization has predicted that the number of cases over the next 10 years will be tenfold larger than during the past 10 years—than what we have experience over the past 10 years. And also that there will be a demographic change in the epidemic, and that by the year 2000, 30 to 40 percent of all people with AIDS will be women and children.
The second important fact is that this epidemic will not be selflimiting, it will not disappear by itself. There are good reasons for this statement, and if you are interested, I could list them later.
The third important fact is that, therefore, only biomedical research can control, ultimately, eventually, the epidemic and stop it in producing treatments for people who are already infected and a vaccine to protect the uninfected.
The fourth important fact is that HIV infection invariably leads to AIDS and we have never yet saved the life of a person with AIDS. We have made progress. We have been able to prolong survival, but we have not saved anybody yet. A lot remains to be done.
In the Federal Government, the agencies that have the heaviest responsibilities in the crucial research effort are the National Institutes of Health, the Alcohol Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control. Progress in the war against AIDS, not only on behalf of American citizens, but on behalf of people all around the world, depends almost entirely upon new fundamental knowledge developed by or through the extramural programs of these three agencies. And they all are in need of significant additional support.
The capacity for scientific discovery is far from being fully reached at this time. For example, we found only 24 percent of all the approved grants admitted to the NIH. And for this reason, the American Foundation for AIDS Research support increase in funding for all basic biomedical research. It endorses, speaking of the work of the NIH specifically, it endorses the recommendations of a recent study conducted by the Institute of Medicine. And it particularly recommends to your attention a program of the NIH, called community program for clinical research on AIDS, or CPCRA, which is an innovative and cost-effective program that accelerates the pace at which promising experimental treatments are evaluated and made accessible to all those who need them, including women.
The CPCRA Program, I hope, will continue to receive funding, and, in fact, significantly increase support in the years ahead.
We also need much further research on addictive disorders in order to have a better understanding of these disorders so that treatment can be for rational and more cost effective treatments. It is an illusion to us for a national strategy for drug treatment on demand and education unless we have more rational and cost-effective treatments.
Finally, I would like to say that resources for these research efforts should not come from other domestic programs, nor should they be provided at the expense of medical care for those with AIDS. We just heard the extremely urgent needs in this area from the representative of the AIDS Action Council, nor should these resources come at the cost of prevention education for those at risk of AIDS.
We are well aware of the restrictions of the Budget Enforcement Act, but we know of the numbers, we know of the suffering, and we know how much the American people needs to understand why it must and how it can protect itself from AIDS.Miss

yet, you’re in for a treat. The self-published novel by Andy Weir was a sci-fi phenomenon when it came out in 2011 and lots of people (myself included) were irritated that it couldn’t be considered for the Hugo award when it was republished in 2014. There’s already a movie–directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon–slated for release in the US on October 2, 2015. It also looks fantastic.
An article from MoviePilot.com goes even farther, however, and argues that “The Martian Heralds A New Era Of Realistic SciFi.” Here are some thoughts about this story, about sci-fi, and about humanity.
First, the book was great, but even as I was reading it I was pretty sure it would make an even better movie. It is really well-suited for visuals and would retain all of its punch even when shortened and simplified for screen. So, yay.
Second, I do hope that it heralds the dawn of some more realistic sci-fi. Don’t get me wrong: alien invasion stories are fun and FTL and artificial gravity2 are fine and dandy as plot devices go, but at a certain point I feel that scientific pseudobabble3 can kind of lead to all-around laziness. I mean, universal translators? They don’t even make sense conceptually. Sure, it may have been necessary for Star Trek, but it’s all the imitators who take the same liberties that drive me nuts. It’s not hard to see a trend from Star Trek to the absolute nadir of big-budget science fiction film (and the worst movie I have personally seen in my life): Wing Commander.
Finally, I also hope that realistic and popular sci-fi might lead to some renewed interest in space exploration. Because as it stands today, humanity kind of sucks on this front. No human being has been beyond low earth orbit in my lifetime. That’s really, really frustrating and should be a species-wide source of shame and humiliation. It’s not even close, by the way. That last time we (meaning: anybody) sent an astronaut outside of low earth orbit was Apollo 17. That’s 1972, people. Nineteen seventy-two. We’rec coming up on a half century since venturing outside of our atmosphere.4
You really need to see a picture to understand just how pathetic this is, so here you go:
That tiny smidgen of blue hugging the surface of the earth? That’s LEO. The green stuff is medium earth orbit. The red is high earth orbit. The moon–which, remember, we’ve been too once or twice–is way, way out beyond that. That’s how far we were able to go 50 years ago. And that’s how far we haven’t gone in my lifetime. And we call ourselves explorers? Adventurers? It’s a disgrace.
Oh, and while I’m venting, I may as well not hold back on this either. From the MoviePilot post:? [emphasis added]
The word “interstellar” has a meaning. It means “between stars.” Does Mars orbit a different star? No, it does not. So The Martian is interplanetary, not interstellar. In any other article I would have just rolled my eyes, but come on! The thesis of this article was realistic sci-fi and the very next sentence talks about “NASA scientists advising the screenplay,” but you could even get the word “interstellar” right?
OK, I’m going to go see if there are any kids on my lawn I can shake my cane at.
1 thought on “The Martian is Awesome, Humanity Less So”
I endorse your endorsement.
Go this on a Kindle, & it could easily have been a “read in one sitting” book” had I had the requisite chunk of time.
There’s a thread at Amazon dealing with the abundance of technical errors in the book:?
ie=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1LQO2I51UNLHM&cdThread=Tx131JG2K6D72AT
The thing is, they really don’t detract from the book, even if you are aware of them. Andy Weir, the author, said in an interview somewhere that he was aware of this but, essentially, he had a story to write!
(Wouldn’t you say that “nterplanetary” is a subset of “interstellar”? Interstellar is not so much wrong as not right enough.)Mimosa is the heady sweet scent; tempered by green cardamom seeds.

Shanghai (Gasgoo)- Chinese automaker Changan Automobile recently initiated the building of a drive-by-wire operation platform for Level 4 autonomous vehicles, according to a local media outlet, deepening its offensive into the nascent field.
Involving an investment of RMB1 billion, the project is expected to be applied to volume production in 2025 with an annual output value of RMB4 billion.
Under the project, the Changan E-Rock is chosen to be the basic carrier in which technologies will be introduced, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. The platform is designed to significantly improve the sensing range and accuracy of autonomous driving system, the operational capability of computing platform, as well as the performances of decision-making, planning and controlling for self-driving system. In addition, such novel services as fully automated parking and driverless car-hailing are considered as part of the blueprint.
(Photo source: Changan Automobile's WeChat account)
Roughly a month ago, Zhu Huarong, President of Changan Automobile, showed the Level 3 autonomous driving function of the UNI-T SUV, the first product of the “UNI” series, by live webcast. It was the first time that Level 3 autonomous driving technology is applied to mass production in China.
The automaker commenced the autonomous driving development as early as 2009. It has by far created quite a few “firsts” among Chinese automakers in this field—the first one in China that completed a long distance (2,000 km) self-driving vehicle test; the first one that accomplished the mass production of APA (active park assist) 4.0 & IACC (integrated adapted cruise control); the first Chinese automaker obtaining license plates for intelligent vehicle road tests from both China and the U.S. authorities.
According to the blue print of “Dubhe” Intelligent Strategy, Changan will gradually realize the L4 autonomous driving volume production in 2025 with the in-car system completely voice controlled.

Fertility Law
Suzi Denton, our expert in Fertility law, has published the below article for BioNews, a weekly medical-legal publication. Suzi reports on the recent case of a Canadian single father, Joseph Tito, who had twins through surrogacy in Kenya. Tito was making arrangements to travel home when he discovered that the twins were not automatically entitled to Canadian citizenship, and he faced a lengthy wait in Kenya while he waited for the immigration issues to be resolved. He has recently returned to Canada with his twins, and is calling for Canadian immigration law to be amended. This case shows how important it is to get legal advice before embarking on international surrogacy, to highlight any immigration issues you might face after the birth, and to put a plan into place.
A single father whose twin girls were born through gestational surrogacy in Kenya has been allowed to return home to Canada with his children.
Joseph Tito’s twins, Stella and Mia, were born in Mombasa, Kenya, in November 2018. Tito was making arrangements to return to Canada with his children in December when he was told by the Canadian High Commission that due to a quirk in Canadian immigration law, the twins did not automatically qualify for Canadian citizenship. He would therefore not be able to take them home until their citizenship status had been resolved.
The ‘one generation’ rule, which came into force in Canada in 2015 when the Citizenship Act was amended, means that Canadian citizens who are born outside of the country are not able to pass on their citizenship to their children if their children are also born outside of Canada. As Tito was born in Italy to a Canadian mother, his children did not automatically become Canadian citizens at birth.
Tito has called for the rule to be changed: ‘I think it needs to be amended for people who live in Canada and who are Canadian,’ he told Global News.
There followed a period of uncertainty for Tito and his new family, as he was told that he may be facing a wait of between six and 12 months before he would be able to return home with his children, while the twins’ applications for permanent Canadian residency were being processed.
Tito began the permanent residency application process in late December, sponsoring the applications using his citizenship status. He then discovered that he could apply for temporary resident visas for the twins, which enabled him to travel home while the permanent applications were pending.
Tito’s situation attracted international media attention, and according to CityNews, he believes this is why the situation was resolved quickly. On his return to Canada, he told CityNews: ‘I think it’s surreal. I still can’t believe I’m here after all this time.’
Immigration attorney Joel Sandaluk agrees that the rule is ‘problematic’. He told CBC News: ‘It creates two separate classes of Canadian citizenship – one which is inherently more valuable than the other.’
Sandaluk also described the rule as ‘arbitrary’, as ‘Certain Canadian citizens are able to pass along their citizenship to their children if they’re born outside of Canada whereas other Canadian citizens are not’, he told CBC News.
Tito offered advice to others who are considering embarking on an international surrogacy arrangement. He told Global News: ‘Just research everything. Research whatever country you’re in, research their laws, research our laws.’2017 - July Blogs

From a chronic dull ache to acute pain when you assume certain positions, lower back pain, also known as lumbago, is extremely common. In many cases, the underlying cause of the pain isn’t serious and it improves naturally over the course of a few days or weeks. However, sometimes the pain is long-lasting or comes and goes. When this happens, and the pain is caused by a specific, underlying cause, surgery may be necessary to address the problem and permanently alleviate your symptoms.
If you are struggling with pain, weakness, loss of function, or other symptoms of spinal complications, contact Dr. Tumialán's office today.
What is it about shopping at Trader Joe’s that makes you just want to skip through the store with a goofy smile on your face? Seriously. Is it the darling cards priced at $1.99? Finding Tiki the turtle? The best hummus and pita packets ever? Probiotic smoothies that my boys slurp up each and every morning? The friendly staff? Oh, and let’s not forget stickers at check out. A huge win.
Well, as if I needed another reason to jump for joy over this place! And yet I found one. One that is oh so comforting, healthy, and cozy… perfect for fall.
Meet pot sticker soup.
It’s almost laughable how easy this one comes together. Minimal fresh ingredients provide a soothing and light broth. Fry up some pot stickers fresh, and pour the soup over or let them hang out in the broth to develop more and more flavor. We, along with my parents, gobbled this up. Not a morsel left for lunch the next day. Although my mom did hoard some for her breakfast.
Not kidding!
- TJ's 100% Greek Kalamata Olive Oil (I used plain olive oil)
- 1 package TJ's Potstickers (Pork, Chicken, Shrimp or Vegetable...we used chicken)
- 1 container TJ's Mirepoix (this is simply onion, carrots, and celery diced up)
- salt and pepper
- 2 packages TJ's Low Sodium Chicken Broth
- 1 bag TJ's Baby Spinach
- 1 tablespoon TJ's Soy Sauce
- 1 tablespoon TJ's Joe’s Sesame Oil
- TJ's Cilantro, for garnish (optional, but oh so delicious)
- 1/4 teaspoon TJ's Sea Salt, or to taste
- Coat the bottom of a large frying pan with oil (about 2-3 tablespoons) and lightly fry the gyoza over medium-high heat until they get some nice browning on both sides (about 10 minutes total).
- In a large soup pot, pour a couple tablespoons of oil and add the mirepoix (onions, celery, carrots). Saute the vegetables in the pot until the onions start to appear translucent. Season with salt and pepper, generously. Add the broth to the pot and bring to a slow simmer. When the soup gets going, toss in the spinach and add the soy sauce and sesame oil. When the soup is officially simmering, add the potstickers.
- Serve it up in bowls and garnish with cilantro.
- The original recipe calls to fry the potstickers first and add to the soup. Totally delicious but I found the potstickers loose their 'crunch' which is a big part of the appeal of a potsticker, in my opinion. So I prefer to make the broth part of this recipe and come time to serve, fry the potstickers fresh and pour the broth over.
