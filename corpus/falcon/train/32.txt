Overall, UTPA ranked among the top 25 schools throughout the U.S. in three categories of the magazine's listing for the 2009-2010 school year. The magazine based its rankings on data from the U.S. Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.
The University ranked fourth among the magazine's "Top 25 Grad Schools for Hispanics" in the country in enrolling students in graduate programs in 2009, up two spots from its rank in the magazine's list a year ago. In Fall 2009, out of 2,390 students enrolled in graduate programs at UTPA, 1,839 were Hispanic, according to the list, which was published in the April 4 edition of Hispanic Outlook.
The rankings show efforts by the Office of Graduate Studies in encouraging more people to attain more education is paying off. The office has increased its use of social media and hosted more community events and workshops, among other initiatives to promote UTPA's graduate programs, said Sylvia Adalpe, director of Office of Graduate Studies, Academic Centers and Continuing Education.
Last month the office had a record high number of people attend its Grad Fair. More than 550 people attended that event.
"We're excited to see more of a response from the local community and outside the Valley," Adalpe said.
The office is also focusing on graduate student retention. In January 2010 the office opened its Graduate Resource Center on the third floor of the Administration Building to provide graduate students and faculty with information and other assistance at UTPA. The center was made possible through funding from the U.S. Department of Education's Title V "Promoting Post Baccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans" program.
UTPA also ranked eighth in awarding master's and Ph.D.'s in education in 2010 and 18th in awarding master's and Ph.D.'s in business/management/marketing, according to the magazine.
UTPA has earned a spot on Hispanic Outlook's lists, including its "Top 100 Colleges for Hispanics", since the late 1990s. The magazine began its "Top 25 Grad Schools for Hispanics" list less than a decade ago, said Jason Paneque, the publication's news desk and copy editor. UTPA has made that list since 2008.

By by Spotter 07/26/2012
Oxnard Mayor Tom Holden is set to announce that he will not seek re-election as mayor. After 18 years on the City Council, Holden is telling friends that he has been neglecting his optometry practice and his wife and three sons for too long. Oxnard Council meetings routinely run until midnight. There are committee meetings and weekends filled with social events and charity dinners. Like any parent with a busy schedule, he has been missing far too many sporting and school events involving his children. Holden told his close friends that he wanted to step aside and not run two years ago because he had accomplished what he set out to do: lower the crime rate, balance the city’s financial picture and bring more jobs to the city. But the district attorney’s investigation into rumors of corruption at City Hall made him want to stick around until his name was cleared. That happened earlier this year when the DA released a lengthy report saying while spending practices at the city were not exactly by the book, there was no criminal wrongdoing by Holden or other Council members. While Holden still feels the report unfairly hinted at wrongdoing while not offering proof, he feels the report allows him to step down from public life with a record of accomplishment.

Hey Tom... your name was not cleared in the eyes of most Oxnard residents - we fondly remember Pat Holden and HIS integrity.. what will your legacy be ?
Tom Holden will not seek another term because he is a liar and a perjurer. Their has been no report by the County that has vindicated anyone. The only thing that keeps him out of jail is a statute of limatations!
Crime is still up in Oxnard and the city’s financial picture is a mess, Holden has accompleshed nothing!

And it's so hard to ignore her. She was wearing a beautiful blue and green shirt today and she looked so cute and thought I might just grab her head and kiss her right then and there. She makes my stomache fill with butterflies. My heart trembles in my chest. I just wish soooo badly for us to walk down the hallway holding hands and knowing that nobody could tear us apart. Then reality snaps back in and I see her rush to class with her friends and I'm left standing in the hallway, alone, with a broken heart.
Hang in there... my crush is a straight girl, too, and it does hurt to know that someone just can't like you that way... I hope that someday you will get to be with a special someone that you love.

"Come stai, Treeg? Treeg, Treeg, come stai? Ciao, Treeg!"
The salutations are returned in Italian, but with a distinctly Texan inflection that the Italian men are too generous to criticize. In fact, they seem appreciative of the earnest effort "Treeg" is making, of the American’s desire to become a paisano.
"Treeg," the popular newcomer, is Kenneth Trigg Dealey-Highland Park native, cousin to the Dallas Morning News Dealeys, and of Irish-English extraction-truly an unlikely Italian.
But Gioacchino Longobardi, a pianist and conductor of some distinction from the Isle of Capri, explains that Dealey is a bona fide celebrity here. Because Dealey is the one who is bringing Italy to Texas. Over a glass of smuggled-in La Palia, Trigg Dealey, Dallas’ newest brand of oil baron, unfolds his grand quest and exposes the conservative Texas institution that would thwart it.
THE ITALIAN IZATION OF TRIGG Dealey began in the late 70s when his travels on the Italian Veterans tennis circuit took him to Riva del Garda and the island of Ischia. There he discovered the heart-healthy benefits of the Mediterranean diet, with its concentration on breads, pastas, fruits, vegetables, legumes, white meats, fish, and fat from olive oil. Dealey plunged into the health craze with gusto, and all things Italian soon became an obsession.
When he became a single parent in 1984, Dealey hired Italian nannies to care for his daughter, and he began to study the language and culture. The more people he met, the more his spiritual bond with Italy grew. He yearned to create a solid business tie to the country.
When Dealey discovered that olive oil was gaining in popularity at home, he began to study the prospect of acquiring an olive oil distribution franchise for Texas.
To learn more about this new oil business, in 1988 Dealey joined the Northern California Olive Oil Council, a group that promotes the only existing commercial industry of olive producers in the states. Until World War II, a substantial olive oil business thrived in California, begun with trees imported centuries before by the Spanish. After the war, though, the competition from cheaper vegetable oils effectively shut down the industry.
Decades later, in the 1970s, a number of winery owners rediscovered the old olive groves and decided to try to revive the trade. They determined that a boutique market existed for expensive, first-pressed extra virgin olive oil, and several small estate bottlers began to spring up.
The response to their product was positive even though the oil they produced was what Dealey describes as "the harsh Spanish variety made primarily from table olives." For the next few years, Dealey observed the progress in California while continuing to monitor the strong growth of U.S. imports.
Then in 1989 Dealey’s idea to import and sell olive oil locally took a new turn. Dealey discovered an extensive 1985 Texas A&.M study by the late James O.
Denney and extension horticulturist George Ray McEachern. The study defined a "thermal adaptability zone" in a large portion of southwest Texas that might support the cultivation of fruit-bearing olive trees. The study also indicated "that a number of Texas sites show temperature patterns similar to where the olive is cultivated." Olive trees growing here in Texas? To Trigg Dealey, the possibilities seemed endless.
The prospect of actually growing olive trees in south Texas spawned a research effort for Dealey over the next few years, and he set out to gamer support for his ideas from anyone who would listen. But while the Texas Department of Agriculture was supportive, unexpected criticism came from a key player in the Texas A&M Extension Service-one of the authors of the thermal adaptability report.
"At the time, I was floored, simply floored," remembers Dealey. "George Ray McEachern told me pointblank that there was no way I or anyone else was going to grow olives in Texas. It had never been done, he said, and it was not going to be done. No its, ands, or buts. But why would A&M go to such lengths, then, to put together this very expensive study which to me suggested the opposite ? George Ray never gave me an answer to that, so I considered his statements as one man’s opinion, and pressed on."
Dealey was not discouraged, but he was haunted by one thing that McEachern had said to him: that there was no history of olives in Texas. While Dealey found McEachern’s credentials unassailable, something about the horticulturist’s attitude bothered him. Surely someone in this century had plarted fruit-bearing olive trees somewhere in Texas, Dealey thought. If they were there, Dealey would have to find them on his own.
With confidence gained due to support from the state agriculture department and with a gut feeling :hat he had come to trust through the year:, Dealey embarked with his California olive oil council on a fact-finding trip to Italy in November of 1992. It was a trip that would set him on a new life direction, and one that would possibly alter Texas agri-history.
SPAIN MAY BE THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF olive oil in the world, but Italy is the largest consumer; and to Trigg Dealey, Italy is clearly the Ferrari of producers. There he met and consulted with Dr. Giuseppe Fontanazza, a world-famous expert on olives. He observed first-hand the giant estate growers and processors. He attended lectures at the Olive Cultural Institute in Perugia and the Gtrli Museum in Imperia, where he learned about the ancient history of the oil and its diverse and romantic qualities. Dealey knew his course was set.
He determined that he would become the first person to import Italian olive trees into Texas for commercial purposes, the first to propagate those trees, and the first to bottle and sell an estate-quality Texas-Italian extra virgin oil. He would show foreign manufacturers-who he believes dump unregulated, low-quality oils on an inexperienced and unsuspecting U.S. buying market-that Americans are capable of duplicating the most outstanding products that are created in Italy. And, he vowed, he would show the experts at A&M. The journey would not be easy.
Dealey returned from Italy buoyed by the news that Fontanazza had analyzed the thermal adaptability report and agreed with Dealey’s conclusion that olive trees could grow commercially in Texas. With Fontanazza’s assistance and encouragement, Dealey purchased a cross section of 200 choice trees from central and northern Italy as well as a few experimental cold-resistant varieties from Greece. In March 1993, Dealey planted 43 trees as a test at a nursery just south of Austin. Then, on a providential day, Dealey met Baxter Adams.
Adams is known in the Hill Country and within agricultural spheres as the originator and key mover in the Texas commercial dwarf apple tree industry. Ironically. Adams says that die same George Ray McEachern who had tried to discourage Dealey from growing olive trees in Texas had told Adams in the late 1970s that it was impossible to grow apples in the area, Unlike Dealey, Adams had been fortunate to be encouraged and assisted by another A&M extension horticulturist, Dr. Loy Shreve. "Dr. Shreve encouraged me to go to the experts on apples, get their advice, then give it a try-just the opposite of the other boys at A&M," says Adams. After a worldwide research effort, Adams founded Love Creek Orchards near Medina, which today is the apple capital of Texas, with 150,000 trees currently growing within a 150-mile radius.
Because of his experience and success in dealing with the intricacies of soil, pests, diseases, and unpredictable climate, Adams was the perfect person to partner with Dealey. "Texas is a big country,’’ says Adams. "We will grow olives here; it’s just a matter of finding the variety of trees to fit the climate."
Dealey and Adams now have approximately 157 test olive trees planted at Adams’ Love Creek Orchards, southwest of San Antonio. In March of 1995 the trees will be released from federal quarantine and will be ready for propagation. Already, Dealey has made arrangements to plant thousands of trees at additional test sites with growers as far west as Eagle Pass.
But Adams remains ambivalent about the experience he had with A&M. "There are many good people at College Station with whom we work closely and regularly. But history shows that if you are interested in getting into a new agriculture in Texas, George Ray McEachem is not the person you want to talk to. His office is replete with bad science, bad judgment, and bad politics.
"According to A&M, only a fool would try to grow grapes in Texas. And now look at our wine industry here. And apples and grapes are not their only misses. Just ask around. Hell, if it were up to [A&M’s] McEachem, the only things we would be growing here in Texas would be Johnson grass and cactus! It would be an understatement to say that they are not great innovators."
WHILE DEALEY NOW HAD AN EXPERIENCED ally, he was still obsessed with his search for existing olive trees in Texas. Though he was having good luck attracting potential growers for test sites, he lacked the confirmation of a producing tree that would add substance and credibility to his plan. Baxter Adams suggested he talk with his advisor, Loy Shreve,, who had recently resigned from A&M.
"Mr. Dealey called me at my home in Uvalde late in 1992 asking about olive trees," says Shreve. "He seemed real excited when 1 told him about the old trees that I saw being harvested in 1976 over in Asherton. I explained that, of course, as a matter of habit I had included my observations in my monthly report to A&M." Dealey was stunned and relieved when he confirmed that three and possibly more fruiting olive trees existed in the Asherton area and on other possible sites in the vicinity.
Dealey now had the evidence he sought, but his frustration remained over the exclusion from the thermal adaptability report of this key information that had surfaced a full nine years before the report was published.
As recently as September of 1994, McEachem’s response to the possibility of a Texas olive oil industry was immediate and emphatic. "There is no olive oil industry in Texas, there never has been, and there never will be," he stated. "We cannot grow olives in Texas anywhere." He added that "there is absolutely no history of anyone growing fruiting olives here in Texas."
Questioned about the Asherton trees reported to him by Dr. Shreve, McEachern halted, then said that Shreve was much more "liberal" than he. "Look, we’re just real conservative over here," he said. "I would love to see it work for these folks, but we’d rather err on the conservative side. You just can’t encourage people to go out and grow olive trees."
Dealey acknowledges that there are risks involved with planting olive trees, but, he says, there are also potential rewards-big rewards, Texas-sized rewards. He estimates that an estate grove, which takes three years to produce fruit, by handling its own processing, bottling, and marketing, could, at current world oil prices, yield around $7,000 per acre annually.
There’s no doubt that olive oil is a hot commodity. Department of Commerce figures reveal that olive oil imports have almost quadrupled from 64 million pounds in 1982 to an estimate of 247 million pounds in 1993. And, according to the North American Olive Oil Association, olive oil volume sales increased from 9.25 million gallons in 1989 to 12 million gallons in 1993, and dollar sales increased from $185 million to $235.5 million. Olive oil has moved from the shelves of primarily ethnic specialty stores to become the second most popular pour-able oil in the United States, surpassed only by vegetable oil.
As the trend continues, demand may rapidly outrun the current supply. As Dr. Fausto Luchetti, executive director of the International Olive Oil Council explains, "If all 275 million people in the North American market consumed olive oil, no one could supply it."
DEALEY GETS A DISTANT LOOK IN HIS EYES as he launches into the economics of his new oil business, and he seems focused on a vision far from the smoky restaurant. "Agriculture on any basis is a risky proposition, but like Baxter says, ’It can’t be worse than growing cows.’
"My partners and I are proud of our numbers, and we’re going to make this work," he continues, gating into his glass of wine. "Sure I’m excited about pioneering olive oil in Texas. It’s become a real passion, We’ve formed a nonprofit Texas Olive Oil Council to assist potential growers with correct information and to promote standards relative to this industry.
"My goal is to have 5,000 acres producing within 10 years. At 218 trees per acre, that’s over one million trees! We’re part of an explosive movement that is bringing back one of nature s perfect products that has existed commercially for thousands of years. I’m already involved with Texas light crude. Why not Southwest Texas extra virgin?"
ELIXIR OF THE GODS
LIVE OIL HAS LONG BEEN PART OF Mediterranean diets but is relatively new to most Americans. While Dallasites have come a long way from the days when we puzzled over what to do with the stuff on the table at Sru:zi, we prob’ ably have yet to develop the taste of the connoisseur. To help with these finer points, we offer here a crash course on the I elixir of the Greek gods.
MYTHOLOGICAL
ROOTS: As anyone at the Carli Olive Oil Museum in Imperia, Italy, can tell you, the olive tree is firmly planted at the center of the Mediterranean’s mythological history. The most famous story involves a dispute between rivals Athena and Poseidon, who vied for the rule of Attica. Zeus, the father of all gods, promised the land to whoever could offer die most useful gift to mankind. Poseidon offered his powerful horse, Trident, while Athena brought an olive plant, citing its ability to provide shade, warmth, medicinal ointment, perfume, light, and food. Needless to say, she won, and the olive tree became the symbol for the goddess as well as for her eponymous little town, Athens.
HISTORICAL FLAVOR:The Greeks and Phoenicians began exporting olive oil westward to Italy, France, and Spain beginning about 400 B.C., according to The North American Olive Oil Association. By 100 A.D. Romans had become expert producers in their own right, and by 1300 olive oil was considered a staple throughout the Mediterranean world.
HEART HEALTHY? While the Mediterranean diet and its possible health benefits have gotten a lot of press in the last year, it appears that the jury is still out on whether or not olive oil will actually prevent heart disease. Because olive oil has zero cholesterol and has a high level of monounsaturated, rather than saturated, fats-and because it tastes good- its best use is as a substitute for other fats.
BUYERS’ GUIDELINES: Taste is the most important quality in selecting an olive oil-what you want is the true full flavor of the olive. The experts at Zingerman’s, i leading importer, offer these tips: The better oils tend to be darker, running from dark green to gold in color. Extra vi -gin oil has the least acidity and the fullest flavor. Pure olive oil sounds wonderful but is actually inferior in quality, made from lower-quality olives or top-quality olives hat are pressed for a second or third time. If the label reads "first cold pressed," the oil has been made the traditional way with olives ground by stone mills rather than steel presses. This is the most expensive oil and simply the best you can buy. Olivs oil can tun anywhere from a couple of dollars for a grocery store bottie to more than $30 pet liter: the differences lie both in the quality of the olive and in the production process.
SHELF LIFE: Keep your oil in a cool, dark place. An opened bottle can sit on die shelf for one year and an unopened bottle for up to two years. After that, the oil loses its flavor.
WHERE TO GET IT: Specialty shops are the way to go for premium oils. Dallas olive oil aficionado Trigg Dealey recommends buying locally from Neiman Marcus, Williams-Sonoma, Empire Baking Company, and Al’s Import Foods. For olive oil by mail, he recommends Zingerman’s Catering (313-663-3400); Carti Bros. (916-736-3800); and Dean & DeLuca (800-221-7714).

) Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA (
) LETTER OF INTENT RECEIPT DATE: May 15, 2002 APPLICATION RECEIPT DATE: June Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in partnership with the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), invites applications for cooperative agreement research projects that will assess the HRSA-sponsored Health Disparities Collaboratives (HDCs). These collaboratives, initiated in 1998, represent a major, sustained effort on the part of the BPHC to enhance the quality of care provided through its health centers and ultimately improve the outcomes of underserved people. The HDCs have focused on diabetes, asthma, depression and cardiac disease and sought to narrow the gap between what is known and what is practiced. Participating health centers work together with support from regional and national infrastructure through sharing of knowledge and ideas to learn and apply methodologies for organizational change with the objective of implementing a sustainable and generalizable chronic disease management model. This Request For Applications (RFA) represents AHRQ"s and BPHC"s continuing interest in efforts to translate research evidence into practice and to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. As is well recognized, the quality of care must be improved throughout our health care system, particularly for those who are most vulnerable. While existing studies have identified opportunities for improvement and some of the etiologies for substandard care, questions remain as to how quality can be improved across the diversity of environments in which care is provided. Also, few of the quality improvement efforts that have been initiated have been objectively studied to define their impacts and how they can be improved. Under this RFA, one or more projects will be funded to assess the HDCs effects on the processes and outcomes of care provided at the health centers as well as on the centers themselves. While data suggest that the HDCs have been successful at improving quality and patient outcomes, efforts are needed to study the effects more systematically and to understand the collaboratives" indirect effects, the business outcomes and how the collaboratives have affected the efficiency of care. Also, evidence is needed about their impacts on the commitment of senior leadership to quality improvement efforts, and the development of infrastructure and partnerships between public and private organizations to support clinical excellence. Investigators will have access to data including a core set of quality indicators collected by the BPHC and individual health centers. It is expected that investigators will also need to collect additional quantitative and qualitative data at the health center level. Ultimately, it is hoped that the assessments can provide a basis for making the collaboratives more effective as they continue and are applied to new areas including cancer, preventive services and diabetes prevention, thus reducing health disparities for patients with chronic conditions cared for in the health centers and informing quality improvement efforts more broadly. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Background As is widely recognized, the gap between what is known to be effective and what is practiced is wide despite concerted efforts to improve the quality of care. For example, amongst Medicare patients with diabetes, only 71% had a Hemoglobin A1c test annually and 69% had an eye examination at least every two years (Jencks, 2000). 61% of children, ages 5-9, and 59% of children, ages 10-17, are prescribed appropriate medications for asthma. Less than half of patients hospitalized for mental illness receive follow up care within a week of discharge and 71% are seen within 30 days of discharge despite evidence that follow up is an important aspect of management(National Committee for Quality Assurance, 2001). The American health care system has also been plagued by the existence of marked racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. Hispanics and Native Americans have higher rates of death than whites up to age 45 and African Americans have higher death rates than whites up to age 65 (Sorlie, 1995). Hispanics and African Americans undergo lower extremity amputation, a marker of inferior care for diabetes, at higher rates than whites (Collins, 2002). African Americans were 36% less likely than whites to receive inhaled corticosteroids for asthma (Krishnan, 2001). A recent Institute of Medicine report suggests that these weaknesses result from the design of our health care system and that in order to improve the health care quality, systems must be reengineered (Institute of Medicine, 2001). Against this background, HRSA has developed a number of strategies aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities. One such effort is the Health Disparities Collaboratives (HDCs), initiated by the BPHC in 1998. The Bureau is responsible for funding programs in primary and preventive care for underserved, uninsured and underinsured Americans. These include 12 million people, of which 7 million are minorities. Care is provided by health centers that include Community, Migrant, Homeless, School-based and Public Housing health centers as well as Integrated Service Delivery Networks (ISDNs). Under this effort to improve the quality of care and reduce disparities, health centers and networks were invited to participate in the HDCs--programs that take approximately one year in which participants learn from experts and from one another. Also as part of this effort, BPHC funded one Primary Care Association/Clinical Network team in each of five regional clusters to participate in the HDCs and, worked in collaboration with its grantees, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop infrastructure to support the HDCs. The programs, which have been focused on diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma or depression, are based on a learning and improvement model adapted from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement"s Breakthrough Series and a chronic care model developed by the MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation"s Improving Chronic Illness Care Initiative (Improving Chronic Illness Care, 2002). Under the learning and improvement model, each center identifies a team of three to five individuals. The team is typically composed of a leader who has the authority to instigate change as well as to allocate time and resources to achieve the team"s aims, a technical expert who knows the subject and existing processes of care, and someone to manage day-to-day improvement and data collection efforts. During Phase I, the team participates in three learning sessions and a final congress with teams from other centers and expert advisors. Ideas and results are shared amongst the teams. Between each learning session is an action period, during which each center develops, implements and evaluates its change ideas, using the Plan- Do-Study-Act strategy. As the team identifies strategies to improve the quality of care for one condition, it also works on ways to apply the strategies to other clinical areas or sites. After the summative congress, the team enters Phase II, a period during which the team"s organization focuses on sustaining achievements made during Phase I and spreading the models throughout the organization and to other health conditions. The chronic care model is population-based, it relies on knowing which patients have a certain condition, ensuring that patients receive evidence- based care for their condition and empowering patients to participate in their own care. Successful implementation of the model is dependent on six inter-related elements. One is patient self-management, whereby patients learn about their disease and how to prevent problems. Patients set goals for themselves and the clinical team supports them in attaining these goals. The second element is decision support such as evidence-based practice guidelines and protocols that are provided to clinicians so that they can apply the most current knowledge to help their patients. The third component is clinical information systems. Health centers create a registry that is used by the care team to guide treatment, anticipate problems and track progress for the entire population with the chronic condition. Fourth, the delivery system must be designed to support improved chronic care. Visits are planned in advance, based on patient"s needs and self-management goals. Group visits allow patients to see their clinicians and meet with others with similar health problems. Organization of care is a critical element. Health centers, including their leaders and clinical champions, commit to improving clinical outcomes and making organizational goals for chronic illness part of their business strategy. Last, health centers form partnerships with state programs, local agencies, schools, faith based organizations, business and social groups (Health Disparities Collaboratives, 2002). Involvement of the individual centers is supported by infrastructure at the State, regional and national levels. This includes federal partnerships with CDC, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Cancer Institute and the Environmental Protection Agency. Examples of state partnerships include those with diabetes control programs. Local partnerships include those with neighborhood and faith-based organizations. Each cluster, with between eight and thirteen States, is led by a state Primary Care Association that provides oversight, management, training, networking and technical assistance to Collaborative participants. National level involvement entails overall leadership for the effort as well as support for Collaborative operations, management and evaluation. Software and technical support are available through the Primary Care Associations and the BPHC. This RFA builds on AHRQ"s interests in translating research into practice and improving the health of vulnerable populations. A series of relevant RFAs and Program Announcements (PAs) have been published during the last few years: the Translating Research Into Practice (TRIP) RFA (

Potential Data Sources The collection of data by individual participating sites is highly variable in terms of the method of collection and depth, however, there are some elements that have been required for participation in the HDCs including standardized reporting templates of core measures. During Phase I of the collaboratives, participating sites develop registries that are used to track and care for individual patients and enable health centers to monitor the population of patients with a particular condition. The registries are queried monthly and these data, along with self-assessments and narrative descriptions of collaborative activities, are sent to Cluster Directors. Cluster Directors aggregate health center data and prepare a summarized monthly report of the participating centers" activities. At the end of each month, this quarterly report as well as data at the health center level is aggregated nationally and summary graphs are created. During Phase I, compliance with this reporting protocol is high (>90%). During Phase II of the collaboratives, health centers are asked to continue with the same reporting protocol on a quarterly basis. Data collection related to continued activities as well as efforts to spread strategies to other providers or conditions is less complete, however. For each collaborative, there are a number of required core measures as well as a menu of additional measures from which centers are required to select. For example, for the Cardiovascular Disease Collaboratives, each health center is required to report on the percentage of patients with blood pressure <140/90, the percentage of patients who have set a self-management goal, the percentage of patients for whom a blood pressure has been documented at least two times during the last year and the size of the registry. Centers are required to report at least one additional measure from a more comprehensive menu. These include the percentage of patients that are screened for hyperlipidemia, the percentage of patients who have a creatinine during the previous year, the percentage of post-myocardial infarction patients for whom aspirin is prescribed and the percentage of patients that are screened for depression. Teams are also required to assess their level of activity on a scale ranging from 1.0 (forming the team) to 5.0 (outstanding, sustainable results) and report on the development of partnerships such as with community organizations. Patient level data are not reported to the cluster or to BPHC. At least half of participating health centers use software provided by BPHC to collect registry data. The Diabetes Electronic Management System (DEMS) is an example of one such software package. In order to gain access to data at the level of the individual health centers or clusters, investigators will need to form a relationship with the appropriate leadership of the centers or Primary Care Association. A signed data use agreement indicating the availability of the data to the investigator is necessary. In order to obtain data from BPHC, applicants must sign a data use agreement with the Office of Data Evaluation Analysis and Research (contact Charles Daly:
cdaly2@hrsa.gov
). Prospective data collection may be needed to address certain questions under this RFA. Because the HDCs will continue to be offered during the years of this solicitation, it may be possible to collect data from patients, providers, sites, centers, clusters or the national office during Phases I and II of the collaboratives. In the coming year, new collaboratives will be developed in cancer, preventive services and diabetes prevention. Of note, however, the Paperwork Reduction Act indicates that grantees under a cooperative agreement may need approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to collect certain data such as surveys from more than nine respondents. Applicants who are interested in collecting data that will require OMB approval should allow for the time necessary to gain approval as they develop their timelines and make contingency plans should the request be disallowed. Details of the Act and procedures to gain approval are available at:
Objectives and Methods The focus of this RFA is to understand the impacts of the HDCs such that their effectiveness and efficiency can be enhanced and that efforts to translate research evidence into practice, in general, can be strengthened. While data from the HDCs suggest that most sites involved in the collaboratives experience improvements in their care processes, such data are limited and have not been analyzed with respect to uninvolved sites to determine whether change is attributable predominately to the collaboratives. More broadly, while the knowledge base regarding implementation and quality improvement is growing, there is still considerable uncertainty about the most effective mechanisms for improving quality and how interventions can be matched with particular situations. In developing their study methods, applicants should consider the types of research findings that potential users of this research require in order to decide whether or how to apply the HDC methodology or individual interventions. For example, sufficient information is needed about the context of an intervention to suggest whether findings may be generalizable. Dimensions that may be of interest include patient demographics, health center/site structure, staffing, organization, management, leadership and culture, external partnerships at the local, State and national level, financial influences on patients and providers and non-financial influences on patients and providers. Such evidence may be derived from in depth analysis of existing data as well as prospective collection of data. Data may be quantitative or qualitative, including case studies, interviews, surveys and focus groups. It is expected that some questions will be best addressed using data on structure, whereas others may be best addressed using information on processes including those of the organization, the providers and patients, or outcomes including functional and clinical measures, satisfaction and costs to the patient and system. Sample Study Questions Effectiveness of Interventions Which interventions or combinations of interventions initiated during the improvement cycles had the greatest impact on practice? What are characteristics of effective interventions for low literacy and limited English proficiency patients? What are the effects of intra- and inter-site collaboration? How can positive collaborations be encouraged? Additional Impacts What are indirect effects of participation in the HDCs for the clinics, including impacts on patient and provider retention, impacts on patient and provider satisfaction, and impacts from partnerships such as those with community-based organizations and human service providers? Factors Influencing Effectiveness Which factors enable successful initiation, implementation and sustainment of interventions? What barriers limit the impact of interventions? How does patient race/ethnicity, language or socioeconomic position, including educational attainment and literacy impact effectiveness? What are the roles of leadership in implementing the HDC? What strategies can be used to foster leadership for quality improvement activities? What are the roles and effects of cluster, State and national support such as that coming from diabetes control programs? What are the effects of different types of information technology? What are the effects of the partnerships on the effectiveness of the collaboratives? What are the effects of data quality at the health center level? In what ways are data collected, analyzed and utilized? What factors, including clinical, organizational, structural and interpersonal, predict whether a clinic will experience greater levels of improvement under the HDCs? Economic considerations What are the direct and indirect costs of involvement in the HDCs for the clinics, including the number of hours required for staff involvement (both in general and with respect to reporting measures), hours and resources required for partnerships with local and national organizations, efficiency of clinic operations and utilization of clinic resources (both in general and with respect to other areas of clinical practice that are not directly subject to the quality indicators)? What is the business case for participation in an HDC? How do the collaboratives affect State Medicaid expenditures? What metrics should be considered in establishing a business case for participation? Sustaining and Disseminating Positive Change What factors influence the sustainability of improvements and the spread of improvement methods to sites, clinicians and conditions beyond those involved in the original HDC? How do ISDNs affect the impact, sustainment and spread of the collaboratives? MECHANISM OF SUPPORT This RFA will use the cooperative agreement (U01) award mechanism under which the Principal Investigator retains the primary responsibility and dominant role for planning, directing, and executing the proposed project, with AHRQ staff being substantially involved as a partner with the Principal Investigator, as described under the section "Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award." BPHC staff, together with AHRQ staff, will assist the grantee with HDC, health center and primary care association coordination, as needed. This RFA is a one-time solicitation. Future unsolicited, competing continuation applications based on this project will compete with all investigator-initiated applications and will be reviewed according to the customary peer review procedures. The anticipated award date is 9/30/2002. FUNDS AVAILABLE AHRQ and HRSA intend to commit approximately $800,000 in FY 2002 to fund one to three new grants in response to this RFA. An applicant may request a project period of up to three years and a budget for total costs of up to $800,000 per year. Because the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application, it is anticipated that the size and duration of each award will also vary. Although the financial plans of AHRQ provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this RFA are contingent upon the availability of funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. Funding beyond the first year is contingent on availability of funds and satisfactory progress. ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS The Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation are not eligible to apply for funding under this solicitation.

TAMPA — Most teams save the player introductions for when they run onto the field. The Bucs still are having them each week in the locker room.
Al Woods, meet Alex Magee. Derek Hardman, say hello to Ted Larsen.
For the third consecutive week, the Bucs lost two starters for the season — defensive tackle Gerald McCoy tore his left biceps and linebacker Quincy Black broke his arm in Sunday's 17-16 win at Washington.
Both players went on season-ending injured reserve Monday. They join guard Davin Joseph (broken hand) and safety Cody Grimm (broken leg), who were lost Nov. 28 at Baltimore, and cornerback Aqib Talib (torn tendon near hip) and center Jeff Faine (torn triceps), who were hurt Dec. 5 against Atlanta.
But the beat — and the physical beatings — goes on.
"This week we lost McCoy, we lost Quincy Black, two more starters," coach Raheem Morris said. "And the next man has got to go in there and fill in and play well and play well enough to win. We have another opportunity to go out there and do it again."
McCoy, this year's third overall pick, was injured on the third play of the game when he reached to make a tackle. Redskins running back Ryan Torain, who rushed for 172 yards on 24 carries, did most of his damage in the first half with McCoy out.
Because under tackle is so critical to the Bucs defense, replacing McCoy might be the biggest challenge for Morris this season. But defensive end Michael Bennett was inserted at McCoy's spot in the second half Sunday, and his quickness was effective against the Redskins' zone blocking.
Morris said other candidates include starting nose tackle Roy Miller and Frank Okam, who was promoted from the practice squad last week.
"The thing with Bennett is, he hadn't played inside since he was with Seattle, and we saw it on tape," Morris said. "In order to get the quickness we lost from Gerald, we had to throw Mike Bennett in there at halftime, and he was productive for us. He did a good job."
Bennett has been with the Bucs since he was claimed off waivers Oct. 12, 2009. But he has had trouble cracking the rotation at defensive end despite leading the team in sacks in the preseason.
Replacing Black, who missed games against the Panthers and 49ers in November with an ankle sprain, might not be as difficult. The Bucs will again turn to a combination of veteran Adam Hayward and rookie Dekoda Watson.
The timing of McCoy's injury couldn't be worse. At 8-5, the Bucs are in the thick of the race for an NFC wild-card spot and were helped by Green Bay's loss Sunday at Detroit. The Bucs host the Lions and Seahawks before ending the regular season Jan. 2 at New Orleans.
"I felt bad for Gerald because he had played so well," general manager Mark Dominik said. "Last week he didn't have the stats, but he had really been playing better and better every week. And when you're a team right now where we're at, you're frustrated you can't be a part of where it can go. That's really the hard part. For Quincy, too."
Dominik said Morris and his staff have done a good job preparing new players to step in for injured starters. That process began when the organization allowed practice-squad players to travel with the team.
"Some people wonder why we travel practice-squad players," Dominik said. "We travel them and get them prepared so when their day comes up to play in the game, they haven't not been on a road trip, they haven't not slept in a hotel, they've been in the meetings. All that is not new to them."
The Bucs are considering promoting former USF linebacker Tyrone McKenzie from the practice squad for Sunday's game against the Lions.
McKenzie, a third-round pick of the Patriots in 2009, was signed Nov. 10. But introductions might still be in order.
"That's why I kind of laugh when (media members) talk about lucky plays," Morris said of the win over the Redskins on a botched extra point. "I remember football was fun when that guy made a field goal in the snow and it was the Ice Bowl. And guys playing in the snow and a fumble happens and we call it the Tuck Rule. We come off the stage (Sunday) and we get a snap that wasn't executed because of weather and what football is all about and you guys say it's luck. It's kind of disrespectful. Why couldn't it be the slip-and-slide game? And the Bucs win."Edit hours

Article ID:The Gaza War
Hundreds Disappear in Gaza
GAZA CITY — In devastated Gaza the wounded, the displaced and many of the dead are accounted for, but there is no organized search for the missing.
In the makeshift refugee camp behind Shifa hospital distraught family members go between the hospital, the handful of representatives from Gaza police, and the health ministry searching for relatives who’ve disappeared. There are no offices that act as clearinghouses where they might find those lost in the chaos of Israeli bombs and Hamas guerrilla warfare. The hospital—which has become the only sign of any social service and civil bureaucracy left in Gaza—doesn’t even have a list for people who want to register the missing or a roster describing the unidentified dead and wounded.
When I ask hospital representatives for an estimate of how many people have disappeared since the fighting started July 8, they tell me to speak with the health ministry, which in turn passes me off to the police. Then Azmi al Kaishawi, from government media relations, tells me that the war has crippled Gaza’s civil service and I should check with local non-governmental organizations.
“The government isn’t functioning properly, no one is in the offices,” says al Kaishawi. Workers stay away from government buildings because they are Israeli targets. “People come to Shifa, but it’s not designed to handle these things,” he says.
Unforunately, the NGOs and the aid agencies of the United Nations and foreign governments in Gaza are focused on coping with what they already know for certain: over 1,800 people killed, nearly 10,000 wounded and a quarter of the 1.8 million people in Gaza displaced. The mystery of hundreds of disappeared men, women and children will have to wait.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has no overall numbers of missing people and says that it is incredibly difficult to gather such information. According to an ICRC official, who isn’t authorized to speak to the press and asked not to be named, the aid agency relies on the Israelis notifying it about people captured or taken to Israel for medical treatment, the Hamas government to tell it about the dead, and individual families to report missing people that they then try to connect. But the system is so full of gaps and flaws it can hardly be called a system at all.
A few days ago I began talking with members of the Al Jamal family, who are living in the Shifa camp and who’ve been searching desperately since July 20 for 12-year-old Osman Raid Al Jamal. They believed he might have been killed in an Israeli airstrike, but no one had seen his body, nobody could be sure he was dead, and as with so many tragic disappearances, uncertain hope only compounded the pain of imagined loss.
As with so many tragic disappearances, uncertain hope only compounded the pain of imagined loss.
“We have gone to the police and the hospital and they have plenty of cases like this but will not be able to deal with them until after the war,” Osman’s uncle, Rami al Jamal, told me as in the tiny hospital park that’s been turned into a refuge of multicolored tents and tarps for those who fled the demolition of the Shajaya neighborhood between Gaza City and the border of Israel.
Rami kneels on a thin foam mattress next to another of Osman’s uncles, Aram Hellis, as they try to explain what happened. They were running down the street just as a bomb exploded. Three members of the family were killed in the explosion but Osman, the fourth, could not be found.
Three days later a boy was pulled from the rubble during what was supposed to be a temporary ceasefire. The face was disfigured, the flesh decaying. The two uncles had to try to determine from the clothes whether the body belonged to Osman or not, and they decided, finally, that it did not.
Ever since, they have been run in circles as they try to locate Osman. Rami says the family has reported the boy’s disappearance and the circumstances to the Red Cross but was told if he wasn’t found by the end of the war, the ICRC would just count him among the dead.
Osman’s father, Mohammad, has been broken by the days, now the weeks, going back to the neighborhood where whole streets have been turned to dust and shards, then to the networks of chaotic camps where a stunned or injured Osman might have found his way, then to the hospital, and to the morgue piled with bodies, and back to the neighborhood, a carousel of horror and loss.
“Osman’s father won’t give up until his son is found,” Rami told me. In a place starved for resources and facing constant new crises as fighting, punctuated by tenuous ceasefires, drags on, the Jamal family—like an unknown number of others—was on its own searching for a lost child.
And then, on Sunday, on yet another visit to the morgue, Osman’s father looked blankly into a refrigerator full of corpses and suddenly saw among them a piece of fabric that looked like something he remembered Osman wearing. The boy’s body had been there since the day he died, but nobody had been willing or able to help the family find him. In a society barely able to comprehend what it has already seen, once again, imagined hope gave way to certain loss.Patty Loveless

In obstetrics, the term “cephalic presentation” is used to describe a situation in which the baby is delivered head first. This delivery presentation is the safest and most common. Abnormal presentations such as a breech, in which the buttocks or feet come out first, can be dangerous, and may require intervention in the form of a caesarian section for delivery. As a pregnancy progresses into the later stages, a doctor can check on the position of the fetus to make sure that it is lining up properly for delivery. grows larger and space become limited. However, the baby may lie in various ways with a cephalic presentation, and some of them can be dangerous for the baby or the mother. Having the baby come out brow first, for example, can make for a difficult delivery.
The fetus begins to move into position for delivery before the mother goes into labor. If a doctor suspects that a fetus is not moving into the cephalic presentation, she or he may make suggestions which are intended to turn or move the baby into position. Fetal ultrasound can be used to see if the fetus is in the right place, and obstetricians can also tell with palpation. This can also be used to determine if the baby is in an awkward position, but still in a cephalic presentation, to plan ahead for delivery.
Presentations can become complicated when a woman is carrying multiples. This is one of the many reasons that multiples are regarded as a potentially high risk pregnancy. If the doctor suspects that the presentation of a singleton or multiple pregnancy is too risky, a recommendation for a cesarean section may be made. This can be done out of concern for the baby or the mother, and very rapid intervention is available if a delivery starts to go wrong.
The vast majorities of pregnancies end up in a cephalic presentation. The small fraction that do not can be dealt with in a variety of ways. Different doctors or midwives may have different recommendations for handling breech and other positions during labor and delivery.
One of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted. Note that depending on the number of suggestions we receive, this can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Thank you for helping to improve wiseGEEK!1 posts tagged with arrangedmarriages.

Feb. 1, 2012 at 7 p.m.
Updated Jan. 31, 2012 at 8:01 p.m.
A 25-year-old DeWitt County man was arrested Friday on two charges involving injury to a child.
Charles Devon Wasserman is in the DeWitt County Detention Center on $750,000 in bonds after being arrested by sheriff's deputies on charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child and aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury, according to the DeWitt County Sheriff's Office.
Wasserman had been jailed in May on a charge of injury to the same child, but had bonded out of jail at the time of his most recent arrest, said DeWitt County Sheriff Jode Zavesky.
"The investigation into the first arrest led to information that resulted in the additional indictment and arrest," Zavesky said.Laxton’s AZ&PC continue charge up Dutch Hoofdklasse
28 March 2011
Dan Laxton’s AZ&PC continued their charge up the Dutch Hoofdklasse with a comfortable victory over Het Ravijn.
The British player – usually AZ&PC’s star performer in front of goal – failed to find the net but helped his team to a 10-4 win.
GB teammate Adam Scholefield did find the net but couldn’t prevent PVSK-Fuszert slipping to a defeat in the Hungarian National League as they lost out 9-8 to Ujpest Gymnastics Club.
Craig Figes’ UNSW Wests Magpies suffered a rare defeat in the Australian National League.
The Great Britain captain bagged two goals for Wests but his side also missed out by a single goal, ultimately going down 10-9 in Lambton.
Sean King’s SV Weiden suffered a disastrous start to their relegation playoff campaign but recovered to take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five series against Duisburg SV.
Kind found the net once in the opening match but Duisburg – who finished third in Group B – clinched a 7-6 win in front of a home crowd.
It was a different matter in matches two and three as SV Weiden secured 9-6 and 10-6 wins with King scoring once and three times in the two matches respectively.
Alex Parsonage, Mike Bourne and Ric Lawlor all found the net in the Dutch Hoofdklasse but ended up on the losing side.
Parsonage scored twice for UZSC in a 15-10 defeat to MNC Dordrecht while Bourne scored twice and Lawlor once as PSV slipped to a 22-8 drubbing against league leaders Schuurman BRC.How to Apply

The Department of Education (DOE) provides another dog-and-pony show orchestrated by our elitist mayor. The hand-picked panel, nodding their heads like bobble-head dolls, have now closed 117 schools, never voting a single time in opposition to the closings.
Why do we pay for the cost of these travesties? Better still, why even attend when the outcome has been pre-arranged by the mayor’s automatons? It took 30 years to undo what John Lindsay’s decisions did to the school system. How long will it take to recover from Bloomberg’s fiasco?
It’s time we demand that the DOE show us the new plans and programs they will implement when these closed schools reopen with new staff. Other than new teachers, what will be different?
Using the mayor’s own rule of thumb, let’s evaluate him. He’s been in office since January 2002. Schools have continued to fail.
Therefore, he and his administration should be “shut down” and replaced by a new staff!Following on the success of the past Dundee conferences, this year’s looks to be another terrific one.
The Relevance of the Human in Politics, April 27-28, 2012. University of Dundee
Keynote Speakers: Todd May (other keynote to be announced soon)
The Post Graduate philosophy conferences at the University of Dundee have, over the last four years, explored the resurgence of interest in continental metaphysics. This year’s conference will continue to build on this theme, but in an explicitly political direction and explore the role of the human in the contemporary philosophy of politics. With the renewed interest in humanisms of all sorts, we are seeking to address the problematic of the human in politics: are humanistic political philosophies part of a bygone era? What is the potential place for the human, or a robust humanism, in both the academy and the popular sphere? Are the criticisms of post-phenomenological thinkers still relevant in light of recent philosophical interests and world events? To what extent can ‘post-humanist’ philosophies contribute to political desires?
This year, we will take an explicitly political turn by seeking to explore the importance, or unimportance, of the human in politics. Through an examination of the human, the conference will examine one of the overlooked aspects of the subject and subjectivity, a key concern of previous conferences at Dundee, as well as occurring under the unique historical conditions that have seen political uprisings emerge around the globe across various cultural, political, and religious spectrums.
We invite abstracts of up to 500 words for 20 minute presentations on topics generally related to the contemporary importance (or unimportance) of the human in politics.
Suggested topics include (but are by no means constrained to):
- Humanism and/or anti-humanism in Continental thought: particularly in relation to Badiou, Agamben, Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault, Henry, Hardt/Negri, Zizek, Heidegger, de Beauvoir, Malabou, etc.
- 21st Century Humanism
- Humanism and its critics in German Idealism
- Post-human political theory
- Resurgence of interest in Sartre and existentialism
- The role of advanced media in political theory
- Politics and/or economics after ‘The Arab Spring’
- Political theory and the ‘Occupy’ Movements
- Speculative Realism, Object-Oriented-Ontology, and the critique of anthropocentrism
- The conditions of group action
- Neuroscience and political philosophy
- Ontology and Politics
- Feminism and human identity

Coupons are nothing new to the American family. They've been around since before the Depression, but became a mainstay when the economy plummeted in the 1930s. However, until recent economic downturns, coupon usage was steadily declining.
NCH Marketing Services reported that 2009 coupon redemption levels, "achieved the second highest year-over-year growth ever recorded." And 2010 left 2009 in the dust with 332 billion coupons redeemed at a total value of $3.7 billion.
The simple tool of the coupon is a powerful resource in a tough economy. Our family felt as though we had been given a raise when I started couponing several years ago. We now spend just $200 per month on grocery and household items for our family of four, thanks to coupons.
What is extreme couponing, and why all the hype? Very simply, extreme couponing is combining high value coupons with rock bottom sale prices. Several factors have contributed to the coupon craze, but especially the advent of the TLC Extreme Couponing Show.
Extreme couponing requires planning and organization. Knowing sale cycles, store coupon policies, where to get coupons and how to use them are all key factors for success. The availability of printable coupons, eCoupons, and iPhone coupon apps have turned a simple practice into a fine art. Online resources at SimplyFrugalLiving.com provide instruction and time-saving tools that equal significant savings at the checkout counter.
The principles of extreme couponing also apply to retail shopping. With Christmas just around the corner, savvy shoppers will do most of their deal hunting on the two top retail discount shopping days of the year: Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Nov. 28.
Here are four tips to maximize your savings on Black Friday:
Have a spending plan: Set dollar amounts for each person on your list.
Make a list and comparison shop: Using your Black Friday ad papers (some are already posted online), compare at least three stores before you decide where to buy.
Search for coupons: Use the coupon database at SimplyFrugalLiving.com to locate manufacturer's coupons for toys and other items.
Don't forget grocery and drug stores: They will be in on the action, as well.
Since its inception in 2005, Cyber Monday provides an in-home shopping alternative to the hustle and bustle of Black Friday. Retailers will slash online prices and offer free shipping on most items. Cash-back programs such as Ebates.com and ShopAtHome.com will feature rebates of 1 percent to 25 percent on purchases and alert you to online coupon codes that can be used against already discounted prices. Look for deep Cyber Monday discounts at online stores including BestBuy, Old Navy, Kohl's, Target, Toys "R" Us, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, Apple, Sears and more.
If you've been watching the "coupon craze" from a distance, now would be a great time to jump in and see just how much you can save this holiday season. Gifts, food, restaurants, services ... coupons abound in every category making deep savings possible for every shopper.

Sewing these strips is soooo addicting. Try it. I bet you can’t just sew a few. Once you start, you end up sewing for at least an hour.
I now have two sections finished. Each with 92 strips. 5″ across and 68″ down. (The sections aren’t sewn together. It just looks like it.)
I stopped there. Didn’t want to do any ripping out later if I decide to go shorter. I can always add more strips if I want it longer.
What do you think of this fabric for the binding?
It is green but it does have an unusual design. I don’t think it will get lost in all that green. I have it pinned to the quilt top in the first photo. The green in the center has butterflies. It will be the sashing.
Boy, this design sure uses up lots of strips. Perfect for scraps. I only have about 150 cut strips left. And here I thought I cut too many.
Hopefully I can get another 150 from my leftover scraps. Then I will have to use my stash. But that’s a good thing. Feels good using up so many scraps.
Well, got to go to the post office to mail off a couple of packages. I will sew more on my braid quilt later today. Maybe even get two more sections finished. :D
Hope you are having a great weekend. What are you doing?
Wow! You sure are organized! I LOVE the strips you are making, but the material for the sashing is not my cup of tea. I have to be honest. I am not into bold designs. I like the small prints and rich solid colors.
I have started one of my Folded Star pot holders. I have all of my squares cut. I just have to make my bias tape and then sew it together. The cutting board and cutting wheel are sure a treat! It makes things go so much smoother and faster, and the work so much more enjoyable! I have lots to look forward to!
I havent started a braid yet- YET- but hope to soon.
I need to be working on all the mysterys I have going right now- but I can’t! I am off to start a new one at a Bonnie Hunter workshop tomorrow! WOO HOO!
Looking VERY Irish! I like it but would use that fabric for the backing – its too good to use just as binding. For me the sashing would be best if not very busy. The braids would contrast more with them… but maybe you do not like that effect? It could look a bit too stripey overall for you. Busy sashings do avoid accenting the striped effect of columns of braids. Just a matter of whatever you prefer. No one right way, of course.
It’s looking beautiful Donna!!! I agree that the fabric is too pretty to use just for binding. I would use it for the backing because it’s wonderful and you want to see more of it!
Happy New Year! Much continued success on your creative endeavors!
Hi everyone..
Tanya, Happy New Years to you too. I am looking forward to seeing your Folded Star pot holders.
Jess, hope you enjoyed your workshop. Attending a workshop or a retreat is on my list of Would Like To Do’s.
Jude, I would LOVE to use that fabric for the backing. But only have one yard. :( I searched and searched all over the net but can’t find it (called Babble) in green. Oh well. I will use the plainer one for the sashing. And I still plan to use Babble for the binding. That will teach me. I need to plan better and always buy enough yardage. Hope you are well. Thanks for the suggestions.
Lennette, look through your stash. I BET you have some Babble in there somewhere. :D
I will be posting my New Year’s post in a bit. Thanks much for stopping by.
I am writing this after I posted the other two comments, so I don’t know which one will show up first.
Go to Google and just enter the term “BM13 Slate”. There will be a lot of hits that come up for the fabric you are looking for. I found another one. The fabric swatch is about two thirds down the page, but it is there. Here is the link:
Hi Tanya, yep, that is what I searched on.. for hours.. looking at about 50 different entries. I saw all the other colors. I found his (the designer) entire collection, which BTW is very nice. I had never heard of him until buying the green fabric. I may get a few of the other Babble colors. Thanks so much for helping me locate the color I needed.
Donna!
No, I am not trying to spam your blog. I am just so excited to find all of these links for the green Babble material you are looking for! I found another site. It has the material on sale for $8.60 a yard. I think this is the cheapest price I have found so far. It is at Tennessee Quilts. Here is the link:
OH WOW!! I can’t believe you found it. That is exactly what I need. Thank you so much. :D
You’re very welcome, indeed! Glad to have been able to help!El Nuevo Dia (Colombiana) – Pena, Paco

When you come across a page and receive a 404 error have you ever wondered what the numbers stand for? The answer to that question is probably no, but if you have ever pondered it was probably nothing more than a quick thought that bounced back out of your head right after you realize the page you are trying to access is not found (hence the 404 error code). This obviously has something to do with the number 404, but what could these numbers mean and why were they chosen? To dig deeper into why this number was chosen some obvious Google searching was in the near future. After some quick Google searches it looked like some things were coming to light. As it turns out it has a lot to do with the beginning of the internet revolution in sunny Silicon Valley. Back in the 80's there was a man by the name of Tim Berners-Lee that had to commute to work on a temporary highway that was under construction constantly to maintain traffic that was diverted because of another highways construction. His usual commute was on the 101 from Redwood City into Palo Alto, but since the 101 was under construction a temporary highway that was labeled 404 was used to compensate the flow of traffic since part of the 101 was closed. This temporary 404 highway was a nightmare to the entire community, because the ramps to get on or off the 404 were constantly changing which lead to people not being able to find the ramps. Since Tim Berners-Lee had to deal with this on a constant basis it infuriated him to the point that when they were deciding FTP status codes he immediately decided that if a page is not found it had to be a 404 error.
Moral: Just because something is in written word does not mean it is a legitimate source. A great example of something written that is a complete shame is the above fable. This was completely fabricated in my mind. I did do some searching around and found that Tim Berners-Lee did have something to do with creating the 404 error code, but it was based on actual reasoning and not road rage due to construction.

“Vegan” and “Kick your butt” are not words usually associated together. Sure, some may throw fake blood on unsuspecting fried chicken enthusiasts, but that's less in the “butt kicking” category and more in the “being a jerk” category. It’s easy to make fun of vegans, (there's the flatulence issue, just to name one popular way) and we can all do it safely knowing that either they won't notice because they're off somewhere dressed as a chicken or sitting in a pig cage or, if they do find out, their protein-lacking diet will render them helpless in a fight. But that assumption is wrong: here are some vegans who really could kick your butt, and probably would if they caught you milking a cow.
Hanshi Ridgely Abele – Karate master
Ridgely Abele was the winner of the First Florida Professional Championships, the United States Karate Association Internationals, and the 1983 USKA World Championships... and that's just stuff he won. The list of competitions he's been in goes on forever. We really should be calling him Dr Ridgely Abele because the guy has a Ph.D in Asian Combative Studies from Hong Kong University. We speculate that such a field of academic study did not exist before, and was invented purely because there needed to be a way to recognise Abele's sheer awesomeness. As in instructor, he has produced over 300 black belts throughout the world and maintained schools on two continents. And all without a single slice of cheese.
Lori Petty – AKA Tank Girl
You have to have some major chutzpah to steal a tank and survive in a post-apocalyptic waste land. Yes, that was fictional, Lori Petty is not really Tank Girl, but the world were to end tomorrow we're pretty sure Petty would come out on top, and do it all without compromising her vegan ethics. Check out this quote from Jam! Showbiz.
"I'm vegan and we were shooting outside of Chicago and there was nothing I could eat. So I lived on vitamins and Guinness for three months. I don't usually drink beer, but someone told me pregnant women drank it -- that it had extra vitamins in it, or whatever."
This woman lived for ninety days on beer and pills, and directed a movie while doing it! Actually, that doesn't actually say a lot about her after Armageddon survival skills- I mean 'outside Chicago' that's not exactly hostile barren waste land, surely there was a grocery store somewhere accessible? Still, a history of playing tough roles and an upbringing too gritty to recount on a humor website have made her into the staunchest thing under a crew cut. Ask yourself, would you pick a fight with Lori Petty? Would you?
Kenneth Williams – Body builder
See those muscles? Soy protein. Lots and lots of soy protein, enough to be responsible for the clearing of large swathes of rainforest to grow soy beans. Guy eats a lot of soy, is what we’re trying to say here. Williams placed third in the 2004 Natural Olympia contest, a competition who's contestants have been described as looking “less like men than ideas of men as imagined by comic book artists”. Before he became a body builder he was a fire fighter, meaning the man has conquered fear itself. Before you start to worry though, he probably has no beef with you (excuse the pun) and he has little time for fisticuffs between the seven meals his sport requires him to eat every day.
Ruth Heidrich – 6 time Ironwoman champion
She may look like a sweet grandmother, but Ruth Heidrich is the most hardcore person on this list. Ridgely Abele's epic karate skills were no match the cancer that took his life in 2009, Ruth Heidrich on the other hand fought cancer and won. Also, her Ph.D is in Health Education, which is actually a real thing. Kenneth Williams may have placed third in Natural Olympia, but that's small potatoes compared to Heidrich, who is a six time iron woman champion who holds -get this- 900 gold medals for running, at distances of almost any number you can imagine. In 1999, she was named one of the top 10 fittest women in America, meaning she's fitter than about a hundred and fifty million other American women. Being the ubervegan that she is ('vegan' is not hardcore enough for Ruth), she lives entirely on raw food. At 75 she has lived for longer than many of the people reading this article will, unless she shares with us which raw vegetable it is that provides super strength and immortality, though it’s not any of the books she's written so far.
Keith Holmes – Boxing champion
Keith Holmes has knocked twenty five people unconscious, but he did it in a ring wearing comically large gloves, which makes it OK (otherwise it would be assault, and we don't condone that). Holmes is the winner of the 1996 middle weight boxing championship; sure it’s not the heavy weight championship, but what championships have you won lately? Not being one to go beltless, after he lost the championship in 1998, it was only a year later that he got a rematch with the winner and won it back. Though he's lost five matches, no one has ever knocked him out. You don't stand a chance.
Nicky Cole - First woman to walk to the North Pole
Nicky Cole was the first woman to reach the North Pole - on foot. She walked one hundred miles to reach the northern most part of the planet. Walked. What does this have to do with Butt kicking? Everything. She may not be a boxer or a body builder or a karate master, but can you imagine the endurance required to walk to the freakin' north pole? All she has to do is wait to you get tired before giving you a little push, then its game over and she's off home to help Santa with his diet.
Jane Black – Weight lifter
Jane Black is a weight lifter, and not just your average weight lifter, but one who has set world records. Her personal record competitive lifts are a 65 kilo (143 lb.) snatch and an 82.5 kilo (181½ lb.) clean and jerk, which shows whoever came up with the names for weightlifting moves is a big fan of double entendres. But let’s go back and look at those numbers again, 181 pounds. Go get the scales out, we'll wait. How much do you weigh? Could Jane Black lift you off the ground and toss you on your sorry behind? 181 pounds is hardly the scrawny-weakling range. Jane believes, "If I am anything of worth for this earth, it is to be nice to other animals." So she won't hurt you. Well, she won’t eat you at the very least.
But don't get too complacent, Black has been working through The Vegetarian Resource Group, which helps other athletes interested in becoming vegan. So it’s not just these seven people, the ranks of the vegan army are growing, afraid? Perhaps you should be.

>...Alex James has plenty to smile about today: his good friend and foodie partner-in-crime Jamie Oliver has just watched a video of Alex cooking up a festival breakfast – a “campfire bacon sandwich” with spring onions – and given his skills an 8.5 out of 10. “And I’ve never had a 10,” Jamie adds. “Jamie likes my sandwich. That rocks,” laughs Alex.
There has been lengthy debate this morning, canalside in north London, about the relative merits of brown sauce over red sauce, the bread – “it shouldn’t be posh, you want cheeky white sliced”, and the superiority of smoked bacon over unsmoked (this “blasphemy” is where Alex lost marks, although it was, Jamie concedes, an impressive side of bacon “so big you could use it as a pillow”).
This is all in the name of research. At the end of August the pair, who have been friends for years, united by their infectious brand of food geekery, are combining forces to host their second Big Feastival, a celebration of food and music at Alex’s farm in Oxfordshire, with a considerable portion of the proceeds going to the Better Food Foundation, which works to empower schools, trainee chefs and communities to make good food choices.
Together, they’re like two overexcited children, plotting the ultimate midnight feast, alternately going into raptures over hangover cures and horseradish. There are plans afoot for blue cheese martinis and the “biggest piece of cheese on toast in the world”. But for all the larking around and zany recipe ideas, when you get the Blur bassist-turned-farmer-and-cheesemaker and one of the country’s foremost chefs and food campaigners together, it is clear that they’re only joking up to a point. They take their food very seriously.
As do we, these days. The nation’s growing appetite and appreciation for all things foodie means that not only are new boutique food festivals popping up all over the country – celebrating cider, or oysters, or the local lamb – but at our established music festivals an exciting line-up of food is as important as the bands. Gone are the lentils and burned sausages, replaced by amazing local artisan produce and exotic street food – something, just like the music, for every mood or taste. The just-gone Glastonbury (“still the greatest show on earth”, according to Alex) boasted not only of its headliners, but its impressive menu – festivalgoers could choose anything from smoked meats to sushi, speciality cheeses to stonebaked pizzas, elderflower liqueurs to crayfish ice cream.
“British festivals are the best in the world, and I find that people who are discerning about music are also discerning about food,” Alex says. “It’s amazing what passes for a festival in some cases, where it’s used like a buzzword for rebranding posh stately homes for an afternoon. I feel strongly that there has to be camping, and the festival has to stand for something.”
He believes that our increasing fervour for festivals has something to do with a quest for “authenticity”. “And it plugs into our need to be outdoors. People have been dancing and eating on the land since prehistory, since the land was first tilled.” In other words, music, food and family are a celebration waiting to happen, and their summer gathering certainly caters for families. With nine children between them (Alex has five, Jamie four), they are both experienced campers. Both are fans of big bell tents, and Alex advises on filling them with “all the fluffy things”: he’s the glamper of the two.
As a festival veteran, thanks to his years in Blur, and now as a parent, Alex’s top tip for the grown-ups is to “remember all the Ws. That’s wellies, wet-wipes, waterproofs. And whisky. Definitely don’t forget the whisky.”
“At least a third of our effort goes into making the kids giggle,” says Jamie. “That’s what it’s all about.” They will be laying on a vintage funfair, welly whanging, a kids’ kitchen master class, haystack mountain and an appearance by Justin Fletcher (aka Mr Tumble) from CBeebies, who Alex describes as “the matrix of most kids’ happiness”. Their parents can enjoy demonstrations by Rachel Khoo, Valentine Warner and Gizzi Erskine, cooking on stage beside Jamie. “There’ll be lobster rolls, oysters and champagne, artisan hot dogs, street food and Michelin-starred stuff beside each other,” he says.
“Planning the music is a bit like designing a menu, picking the perfect bands for the starter, main and desserts,” Alex adds, listing Basement Jaxx, K T Tunstall and children’s hip hop favourite Rizzle Kicks as a few of the musical stars he’s looking forward to. “It’s a lot easier to get them on board when they know there’ll be great food. Chefs are the new rock stars. People really love seeing cooking live.”
While there will be a huge range of international foods, the “local farming area” underlines the fact that this festival is framed by the best of British produce. “We want people to take their taste buds for a tour,” says Jamie, “but in this country we’re surrounded by amazing food, and we want that to sing for the weekend too. We hope it will be quite gentle but also like a village fete on turbo.”
Alex suggests that they cook crayfish from the river near the house, and there are plans to grow more vegetables and farm more meat which can be incorporated into the event. Jamie nods vigorously in agreement, and they’re off again, embroiled in their project.
They don’t deny that putting on a festival that attracts 15,000 people a day has been a “steep learning curve”, however. “Getting great bands to play isn’t hard, and can take no more than a five-minute phone call; Mark Owen [of Take That] is singing for his supper and I hope he’ll be popular with the Cotswolds housewives,” says Alex. “Organising things like parking is the real work.”
Not to mention “handling” the talent, Jamie adds, momentarily serious. “Rock stars are easy to deal with, but the person with the most difficult demands last year was definitely Peppa Pig, with a list as long as my arm. Never again.
“No, seriously… last year we were running around doing our own thing, but it was a total laugh too,” he says. His favourite memory is of “playing a really serious game of poker in the pop-up pub, when I got totally flash-mobbed by Alex leading the conga right through the game. I was just about to win and all.”
Goodness knows what will happen when cheese martinis are involved. Ultimately, though, it’s about simple pleasures, says Jamie.
“The fact is, a pork bun can be a transcendentally amazing experience when you’re eating it outside, in a field, with your family having fun around you. Life doesn’t get much better than that, does it?”
Feel-good festival food: recipes from Jamie Oliver
Roasted squash and feta salad
This is one of my all-time favourite salads. I love the combination of soft and crunchy textures, and the contrast between the sweet roasted squash and the salty feta. Keep the elements separate, then assemble just before serving to ensure everything stays fresh.
Serves 4
1 large butternut squash;
Olive oil; sea salt and freshly ground black pepper; ½ teaspoon dried oregano; 1 dried red chilli;
2 ripe avocados; juice of 1 lemon; extra virgin olive oil; 4 spring onions, trimmed; 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds; ½ teaspoon cumin seeds; a large handful of pea shoots; ½ a bunch of fresh mint, leaves picked; 100g feta cheese
Preheat your oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Halve the squash then deseed and get rid of any gnarly bits of skin (there’s no need to peel it). Cut the squash into 3cm chunks and place in a large roasting tray. Drizzle with a lug of olive oil and season well. Sprinkle with the oregano, crumble over the chilli and toss everything together until mixed well. Roast in the hot oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.
Meanwhile, halve the avocados, remove the stones and discard, then finely slice the flesh. Place in a large bowl with the lemon juice and the same amount of extra virgin olive oil. Finely slice the spring onions and add to the bowl, then season well. Leave the roasted squash to cool for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast the pumpkin and cumin seeds in a hot, dry pan for a couple of minutes, or until golden and smelling fantastic. Add the seeds to the avocado bowl with the squash, pea shoots and mint leaves, then toss together. Spread the salad out on a serving platter and crumble over the feta.
PS: If you’re a bit of a meat fiend, you could add some crispy pancetta to the mix.
Smoked mackerel and roast potato salad
Serves 4
750g new potatoes, larger ones halved; olive oil,
1 tablespoon coriander seeds; 2 lemons; sea salt and freshly ground black pepper; 4 garlic cloves;
Extra virgin olive oil;
4 smoked mackerel fillets;
2 handfuls of watercress, washed and spun dry; a bunch of spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced;
A handful of mixed cress, to serve
Preheat your oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Parboil your potatoes for about 5 to 6 minutes, drain, then allow to steam dry. Transfer to a roasting tray, crush them lightly and drizzle with a good lug of olive oil. Crush the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar, and peel in thick strips of zest from one of your lemons. Add to the potatoes, season well, then add the juice from one lemon and the unpeeled garlic cloves. Toss it all together, then roast for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden and crispy. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for a few minutes.
Meanwhile, mix the juice of half the remaining lemon with three times as much extra virgin olive oil in a large bowl, season well and set aside.
Scatter the cooled potatoes over a large platter, then flake over your smoked mackerel with a fork. Add the watercress and spring onions to the bowl with the lemon dressing and toss quickly until lightly coated. Scatter this on top of the fish and potatoes, sprinkle with the mixed cress, then serve with some fresh crusty bread.

John Whaitei just discovered the blog, the burlap bag, and saw this quick and simple idea to do with a canning jar for powdered sugar. i love this idea and have been thinking of other things to make these for as well...like cinnamon & sugar, or even poke larger holes for parmesan cheese.
it is super easy to make these yourself. simply use a nail and hammer to poke holes in the metal lid. do as many as you like depending on how much you want to come out at one time (of course, a larger nail will make a larger hole).
so neat, go try it!

Published 2:56 pm, Thursday, October 17, 2013

Zaytoun
Drama. Directed by Eran Riklis. With Stephen Dorff, Abdallah El Akal. In English, Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles. (Not rated. 110 minutes.)
Well-intentioned but heavy-handed, the Israeli film "Zaytoun" is a road movie featuring the unlikely pairing of a 12-year-old Palestinian refugee and a downed Israeli fighter pilot. It's probably best viewed as a fable that tries to strike a hopeful note amid the many woes of the Middle East, but the blunt filmmaking and the near-sentimentality make it hard to buy into.
The film is set in Beirut in 1982, during the Lebanese civil war. Young Fahed (Abdallah El Akal) doesn't care much for school - he leaves the refugee camp every day and endures the intense hostility (and gunfire) of the locals to try to earn a pittance selling gum and cigarettes. Like the other Palestinian boys, he is also undergoing training by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
When an Israeli pilot (Stephen Dorff) is shot down and captured by the PLO, Fahed becomes one of his guards. The boy, who has recently lost his widower father in an Israeli air raid, is burning with hatred for the captive. But he also wants to get back to his ancestral land to plant an olive tree that has been cared for by his father.
The pilot offers a deal: If the boy frees him, he'll take him where he wants to go. Deal accepted, so now the question is, will they be able to rise above their mutual disdain and help each other escape from the hellhole of Lebanon? By this point, the answer is pretty obvious.
Their adventures together as they head for the border include close calls at checkpoints, negotiating a minefield and evading pursuers. There's comic relief from a taxi driver with a taste for the Bee Gees. It's mostly predictable stuff, and it doesn't help that the movie has a soft center. "Zaytoun" is by no means blind to the horrors of the war it depicts, but much of what happens here seems surprisingly lightweight, and its optimism, although admirable, isn't convincing given the context.
It's a shame, because in 2008, "Zaytoun's" Israeli director, Eran Riklis, made an altogether better film, "Lemon Tree," also focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (and also using an arboreal metaphor).
"Zaytoun" has its moments, especially its early depiction of scrappy Fahed's life in the war zone, but it finally settles for peddling a message - why can't we all be friends? - that's far too easy.
Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail: waddiego@sfchronicle.comCampaigners in Rugby are urging the Government to improve drugs education following a sharp rise in deaths relating to ‘legal highs’.
Swanswell, based in Corporation Street, has responded to a new report by researchers from St George’s, University of London, published last week.
It found the number of cases where ‘legal highs’ were identified as the cause of death had increased from ten in 2009 to 68 in 2012.
Researchers also discovered that the prevalence of such substances in post-mortem tests had risen eight-fold – from 12 in 2009 to 97 in 20122.
Debbie Bannigan, chief executive of Swanswell, said: “The number of deaths caused by the use of legal highs is deeply worrying and the figures should act as a stark reminder about the dangers of taking them.
“Not enough is known about the long term effects of legal highs because they’ve not been around very long, and new versions are quickly created after a ban comes in.”
The charity stresses that although ‘legal highs’ are marketed as legal substances, it doesn’t mean they are safe – it just means they have not yet been fully checked and a decision made about whether they are made an illegal drug to use or possess.
The substances often used like illegal drugs such as cocaine or cannabis and can be very dangerous, particularly if mixed with other drugs or alcohol.
They are sometimes advertised as bath salts or plant food, with a warning they’re not fit for human consumption.
Debbie added: “We need to see increased investment in national research to help us understand exactly what the risks are.
“It’ll help develop better drugs education, so that people recognise the harms of legal highs and can make informed decisions about their use.”
Swanswell is currently supporting a campaign led by the Leicestershire and Rutland Substance Misuse Partnership called ‘Legal highs, lethal lows’, which highlights the risks of recreational drug use and links to health risks in isolation or combined with alcohol.

September 15, 2003Officials have arrested a local DJ in connection with last week's car crash that killed two in Coral Gables.
Ervens Prudent, 26, was charged with DUI manslaughter and vehicular manslaughter for the June 9th crash, according to a Coral Gables Police news release.
Officers from the Coral Gables Traffic Homicide Unit obtained the arrest warrant Friday night after toxicology tests revealed Prudent was driving under the influence, the release said.
Prudent rear-ended another car last Saturday that had stopped at a traffic light on Southwest 8th Street and Douglas Road. Both people in the other car, 44-year-old Maria Martinez and 34-year-old Marlon Gutierrez, died on scene.
Prudent is known as DJ A.O.L. in his North Miami community where is a producer and songwriter.
He was placed in custody at Jackson Memorial Hospital where he is still recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash, the release said. He will be taken to the Miami-Dade County Jail after he is discharged.

If they really do believe no vote should be left behind, then they should stop urging Hillary Clinton to quit the race. Not only does she have every right to fight on against the odds, but voters in the 10 remaining contests, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Indiana, are entitled to a say in this nomination battle.
Barack Obama's confidence appears to be giving way to smugness lately. He said last week Clinton can stay in the race as long as she wants to. As far as he and his supporters are concerned, the Fat Lady sang for Clinton weeks ago and it's all over but the crying.
Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. But shouldn't we at least wait for the voters still to be heard from to cast their ballots before placing the crown on Obama's head? Surely, the Obama campaign would not suggest that their votes don't matter.
It was not that long ago that some pols and pundits were predicting that a Democratic nominee would emerge from the Feb. 5 Super Tuesday voting in two dozen states. It didn't work out that way, but if it had, Democratic voters in the 19 states yet to vote would have effectively been disenfranchised, not that party leaders or the candidates would have cared.
We should disabuse ourselves of the notion that popular will nominates and elects presidents. The fact is, winning the popular vote does not guarantee a candidate the nomination or the keys to the White House. The primary system is designed to favor establishment candidates with star power and huge campaign war chests and to produce a front-runner after a handful of early contests, with Iowa and New Hampshire exerting a disproportionate influence in the winnowing process.
In the Democratic primaries and caucuses, delegates count more than the popular vote. For example, Clinton won the Texas primary, but Obama came out ahead in delegates. And in the general election, it is the Electoral College votes — not the popular vote — that elects a president.
Bill Clinton gave Democrats some good advice the other day. "We are going to win this (November) election if we just chill out and let everybody have their say,'' he said.
Some nervous party leaders and Obama supporters may think this primary campaign has gone on too long, but ordinary voters want this historic contest to continue until the last vote is counted in early June. So far, 26-million voters have cast ballots in this primary campaign, and have done so with enthusiasm. Voter registration is soaring and young people, for a change, have taken a keen interest in presidential politics.
It's true that an extended struggle could leave the party bitterly divided going into the fall campaign against Republican John McCain. However, it is not the length of the campaign that risks damaging the party but the candidates' sharp personal attacks on each other. If the candidates were engaged in a serious debate on important issues instead of sniping at each other, it would be hard for anyone to argue that the campaign has gone on too long. The longer the campaign, the more time to test and vet the candidates.
Super Tuesday voters did not know about Obama's relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah "God damn America'' Wright, or that Clinton's story about landing in Bosnia under sniper fire when she was first lady was a lie, as was her explanation that she "misspoke.'' These kind of revelations can sway voters. Who knows what may yet pop up.
Meanwhile, Clinton vows to take her long-shot campaign all the way to the August convention if necessary. She may not be able to overcome Obama's advantage in pledged delegates, but she knows Obama will end up short of the magic number and will have to rely on superdelegates to put him over the top. Clinton's last-ditch strategy is to create enough doubt about Obama's electability to sway enough superdelegates her way. Maybe the Clinton gang thinks Obama will do something stupid, like announce that he intends to choose the Rev. Wright as his running mate.
The Clinton script for an upset goes like this: Suppose she has a streak of victories in the remaining contests and passes Obama in total popular vote. And suppose that Obama has a major stumble, or tanks with white voters who can't understand why he would embrace as his "spiritual adviser'' a fiery pastor known for his outrageous and bigoted ravings. Under this scenario, the momentum would shift to Clinton, a political turn that superdelegates would have to consider before taking sides.
Remember, Democrats created this nominating process some are now cursing. Maybe things would have worked out differently if party leaders had not eliminated the winner-take-all delegate rule to placate Jesse Jackson back in the '80s. As it turns out, the real beneficiary of the new rule, which gives candidates a proportional share of a state's delegates based on the popular vote, is Barack Obama. Who knows, if the party had stayed with the old rule, Hillary Clinton might be working on her acceptance speech by now, instead of praying for a miracle.LCSR post-doc wins NIH Pathway to Independence Award
Muyinatu A. Lediju Bell, a postdoctoral fellow in the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics, has received a National Institutes of Health Pathway to Independence Award for her work developing technology to make surgery safer. This award, which provides a salary and funding for two years, supports younger researchers as they transition from post-doctoral fellows […]Consensus doesn't equal a fact.
First of all, we've all been told marijuana kills brain cells. This has proven to be untrue, or not apparent in any research. The only study that showed that marijuana killed braincells was done on monkeys, that were suffocated with plastic masks, and they inhaled around 70 marijuana joints worth of smoke in 5 minutes. Marijuana doesn't kill brain cells but suffocation sure does.
Marijuana's effects are caused by the alteration of the brain's chemistry for the duration of your high. Done so by the chemical THC, made of C21-H30-O2. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. None of these elements are completely foreign to the body, even in ancient times. --This is contrary to some belief that marijuana's high is produced by the killing of brain cells. And if brain cells aren't killed, then this belief is wrong.
No one has ever died from marijuana alone. Marijuana has one of the highest benefit-risk ratio of any drug or herb. Making it chemically the safest. The only cases of an effect of marijuana killing someone is in the UK where two people swallowed their own vomit. Which has nothing to do with the actual chemical properties. Or if the bud is laced with harmful substances, which again, obviously isn't THC or marijuana itself.
Marijuana does have harmful carcinogens though, however a marijuana user would never smoke as many marijuana joints as they would cigarettes, making it so that even if they were to smoke it, that it still wouldn't be as harmful as tobacco. Tobacco, which is legal for users 18+, tobacco that is sprayed with herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, etc. in a controlled farm, and tobacco that is one of the leading causes of death in the US, and tobacco that has one of the highest addictive properties of any other drug, especially with all of the additives. But it's legal? It's laughable almost.
Plus, there are many other ways to get the THC, which is the chemical that produces the high, into your system for therapeutic benefits, other than smoking. Vaporizers, a blast of heat that extracts the THC into a vapor that you breathe in, or simply baking it into pastries are some of the ways.
Last, but no the only remaining topic that could be touched on, is the problems having marijuana illegal causes. It causes the prosperity of the drug cartels, that shoot and kill over their goods. It causes billions of dollars worth of tax paying money going to a "war on drugs" that is an endless and illogical war to begin with. So basically, the tax payers pay the drug overlords, that shoot the tax payers that get caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time. A bit of a love-hate relationship?
Prohibition will never work, for the simple fact the organized crime will always be a product of it. Mexico being the most recent example, where the new president came in and passed all of these new drug laws, and now look at the turmoil. The turmoil that also threatens the U.S. The turmoil that is completely wrecking a nation. All because of prohibition. And of course the most historic example being Al Capone, who prospered in the era of Alcohol prohibition, which gave birth to organized crime.
And on the note of marijuana being a gateway drug, sure, it could be, but only because it's illegal. Think of it this way, pharmaceutical counters are much nicer than shady street corners populated with drug dealers. And so since marijuana is illegal, it has to come from a dealer or be grown. With the majority coming from a dealer, and the dealer honestly wouldn't care at all for what he sells and to he sells it to so long as he makes money, because for the most part, drug dealers aren't moral people. Thus, they would persuade clients and sell them harder drugs like crack, meth, smack, etc. This is why the gateway drug theory is generally no longer accepted. Plus it's like saying me eating bread led me to eating more harder foods such as lasagna, it doesn't make sense. Or like saying the blind man walks with a stick because the stick made him blind. Marijuana doesn't lead people to harder drugs, curiosity does.
Where the hemp comes in, is that even though it's a different plant from what marijuana comes from, it's still illegal to grow because they look similar. And hemp has historically been one of the greatest cash crops the world has seen and would be the most useful if corn didn't have all of it's genetic modifications. George Washington grew hemp. Hemp, with one acre of land, can produce as much paper as 3 acres of trees. It produces 30% more ethanol than corn, and takes a lot of CO2 out of the air.
And here we are now, still clinging to prohibition and not solutions. Admittedly, crack, meth, smack, etc. are problems, but those are drugs that do have MANY more harms than benefits.
So honestly, do you think that marijuana prohibition is worth it?

With last year's WWDC event, both the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lineup was refreshed, this along with a iOS 6, Facebook integration, Apple Maps, and a re-run-down of OS X Mountain Lion (it'd been shown off in a preview session earlier than the event). This event didn't show a new iPad, a new iPhone, or any other sort of hand-held device.
NOTE: You'll be able to follow along with SlashGear in our WWDC LiveBlog on Monday, the 10th of June at 10AM PST.
Instead, as we're expecting this year again, Apple showed the desktop side of the equation alongside integration of that platform with iOS. The Apple developer event here in 2013 will take a route that will not make a big deal of the hardware side of things: that's best left to events that hold their own clout outside of this developer-focused event lineup.
iPhone 5S or iPhone 6
While it's possible Apple will reveal a second tier in their iPhone lineup with a lower price as they continue to push forth with a hero model later this year, WWDC isn't the place where the company will do it. Like each of the other hardware bits listed below, Apple isn't about to push their developers aside with an announcement as monstrous as that.
Instead, Apple will focus on what it means to be a part of their ever-growing number of users and how developers can capitalize on the fact that they continue to cultivate a strong self-contained ecosystem. They'll reinforce connections with mobile forces like Facebook and Yahoo - new to the world of iOS.
iPods or iPads
While the iPad and the iPod continue to be forces in the market, name brand recognition and all, new models do not make sense to be appearing at this juncture. If Apple does indeed move forth with the rumored environment known as iRadio, both the iPod and the iPad will be mentioned, but they won't be central to the equation.
This is not an abandonment by Apple of either product - instead it's a reinforcement of the idea that the company doesn't need to speak about either at every single event to make people understand that they've still got them for sale. Last year's WWDC saw an after-keynote boost to a few devices including the Mac Pro, while new iPad Smart Cases were silently added to the store.
3rd Party Keyboards
While there have been a few reports this week of Apple opening their borders to allow in apps such as SwiftKey to the mix, bringing in 3rd-party-made replacements for basic elements like the on-screen keyboard, it's not something that makes a whole lot of sense with Apple's current (working) developer model. While such a system works with Android, Apple wouldn't risk a keyboard app interacting incorrectly with an app that, for whatever reason, requires the standard iOS keyboard to function.
Apple may, on the other hand, open their app boarders with some information on developer-themed devices. It's not impossible that Apple might eventually create a device that breaks with their trend of a completely Apple-centric ecosystem - it does remain very, very unlikely, of course.
Mac Pro
If Apple refreshes the Mac Pro, they'll do it as they did last year - under cover and after-event. The Mac Pro is a machine whose heyday was several years ago, and it's certainly not part of a market segment Apple would benefit greatly from going after with force. Unless Apple works with a lower-priced iPhone and sees such an offering work miraculously, then decides they can offer a low-priced desktop machine that's still super-powered, the Mac Pro will remain in the shadows.
Other than that - everything is up for grabs! Sort of. There's still a limit to what makes sense for Apple to unveil or speak about, and it's always worth remembering that this is a series of developers chats and meetings, not a full-fledged press event for products. We shall see soon!Jenna Rich

The National Science Foundation has released news on a study that helps explain limb loss in whales.
“Hans Thewissen and his colleagues report that ancient whales–four-footed land animals not unlike large modern dogs–evolved into graceful, streamlined swimmers through a series of small genetic changes during the whales’ embryonic development.”
See Carl Zimmer at The Loom for a recent update on The Path Toward Leviathan and his earlier “whale chronicles“.Shifting from UN-speak into his colloquial mode he noted that the last time Australia sat on the Security Council was 1986, and it had been "a long time between drinks ... We're about to have a go. I think 30 years is a fair enough old wait between drinks and I think it's time we actually got cracking and see what support we can get." He added that success was far from guaranteed but "you have to declare your intention and run like fury and that's what we intend to do."
Since that time DFAT has indeed run like fury on the issue, investing large diplomatic and financial resources in its bid for the seat allotted to the Western European and Others regional group. Last week, however, Australia's prospects took a serious blow when Hashem Yousseff, chief of cabinet to the secretary-general of the League of Arab States, announced that our consistent support for Israeli interests at the UN could undermine our chances. The Arab League of course commands a significant bloc of votes so their opposition is a serious threat.
Australia's rivals for the Security Council seat are Luxembourg and Finland. Neither could be regarded as a middle power, but both are considered to have a more even-handed voting record on Israel at the UN. For Australia this raises the embarrassing possibility of being beaten to the seat by Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of only half a million.
The Arab League's announcement was quickly labelled as "blackmail" by the Australian's pro-Israel columnist Greg Sheridan and by local Jewish groups. The Israeli embassy in Canberra pronounced that "Any nation considering their support for a vote on a Security Council seat should first reflect on the merits of the nominee and the contribution that they may make to international affairs before considering their own self-interest."
Colin Rubenstein from the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council denounced both Yousseff and the Arab League for having "rarely displayed any inclination to be a constructive force for Middle East peace and their traditionally retrograde and unhelpful strategy of focusing on boycotts and diplomatic posturing to isolate, condemn and debunk Israel [which was] again on display in Mr Yousseff's statements.
Taking a different approach, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry president Robert Goot chose to praise Australia as a means of chastising Yousseff, who "should know that Australians do not succumb to stand-over behaviour. Goot allowed that it "would be a good thing for Australia to have a seat on the UN Security Council", but thought it would be best to lose our ambition "if the price for obtaining it is to abandon our principles and bow to bully-boy threats". Goot expressed his confidence that Australia's leaders had the "moral fibre" to continue supporting Israel, apparently predicting that we would therefore need to forget about the seat.
So what is all this about? How can it be that Australia's Security Council prospects have been caught up in this distant conflict and are any of our other national interests involved?
There is no doubt that Australia has been a strong and longstanding supporter of Israel. This began with Doc Evatt who midwifed, so to speak, at Israel's birth and subsequently arranged for post-war Jewish immigration from Europe such that Australia received more Holocaust survivors per capita than any nation besides Israel. Since then our leaders have consistently expressed their admiration for and loyalty towards the Jewish state.
Coalition governments have been particularly supportive, peaking under John Howard, who was described by one Jewish Australian leader as having "raised the Australian-Israel relationship to new heights" but with only a mild hiccup during the Whitlam years, Labor governments (present government included) have spoken and acted very similarly. Interestingly, Israel's adoption of more brutal policies towards the Palestinians under the Sharon and Netanyahu regimes has not affected our government's support, although opinion polls show that these policies have diminished the public's respect for Israel, in Australia as elsewhere.
This support is reflected in our voting record at the United Nations and other international fora. During the Six-Day war, for example, the Holt-Gorton government was described by Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban as "endemically pro-Israel". The Fraser government either abstained or voted against UN resolutions critical of Israel, often as part of a minority of three or four. Bob Hawke was famed for his support of Israel and became a close ally of Jewish community leader, Isi Leibler, subsequently a financial backer of the ACTU.
The Howard government regularly joined Israel, the US and its four satellite Pacific states as the only votes against resolutions calling for change in Israeli policies. These have included resolutions calling for the cessation of settlement-building in the occupied territories, condemning human rights violations in the territories, calling for the Geneva Conventions to apply there and requiring Israel to comply with the finding of the International Court of Justice that its "security" fence is in breach of international law.
The Rudd Government changed our vote regarding the cessation of settlement-building in the territories and for the Geneva Conventions to apply there but maintained Howard's opposition to seven other resolutions, including one regarding Palestinian human rights, on which we were again joined by only Israel, the US, its four Pacific satellites and Canada. Our government also joined these countries and five other states in boycotting the Durban II World Conference Against Racism, on the grounds that it would probably involve criticism of Israel's policies. Following Ehud Olmert's "Cast Lead" invasion of Gaza in December 2008, Rudd supported "Israel's right to self-defence" and the need for a diplomatic solution that will "bring a halt to rocket attacks against Israel by the terrorist organisation Hamas, [and] ... a halt to armed shipments into Gaza". (The Gazans meanwhile were to be the object of "humanitarian concern".)
In line with this position, Australia has since joined a small minority (Israel, the US, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand and several Eastern European nations) in voting against the acceptance of the UN-commissioned Goldstone report on human rights violations during "Cast Lead".
It is not hard to understand how these actions and words can lose Australia a lot of international support with the Security Council seat as just one aspect of this. Diplomats and journalists who have served in the Middle East have long warned of the dangers to our reputation from what is seen in Middle Eastern eyes as a policy of ignorant one-sidedness. Ross Burns, ambassador at different times to Lebanon and Syria and to Israel, describes Australia's interests as perceived "solely through the optic of our relations with Israel ... [and] our stocks [with other Middle Eastern countries] have never been lower. Former ambassador to Israel Peter Rodgers also sees Australia as having adopted an "unbalanced" position in international fora that "only encourages Israel's leaders to avoid the realities of their situation to their own detriment, and in consequence, ours". A third former ambassador to the Middle East, Pierre Hutton, describes how Australia's official attitudes are perceived there as at best out-of-touch and at worst uncritically pro-Israel.
An important contributing factor to this history is that foreign policy-making in Australia is quite unorganised, with influence flowing directly from lobbyists to politicians, rather than being mediated through a formally applied set of principles. This results in our being especially vulnerable to lobbying from groups such as the pro-Israel organisations.
And then there is trade. Trade with Israel increased under the Howard government but remains modest and strongly in their favour: our exports there in 2008–09 totalled $262 million while imports were $715 million. It has long been dwarfed by our trade with the Arab Middle Eastern states (exports of $9.3 billion in 2008) which is also rapidly growing — by 30 per cent from 2007 to 2008.
Opportunities for further expansion are also growing and not always taken up. For example, US trade with Libya grew from $18 million in April 2006 to $4.9 billion in 2008 and exports from Germany and China also increased. Libya needs goods that Australia excels in supplying, for example agricultural machinery, but our exports there remain minimal.
We have no embassy in Libya to raise our profile and Austrade's official Libyan business advisory is discouraging. Our Austrade office in Egypt (a growing economy) was shut down last year following earlier closure of offices serving Jordan and Syria. These closures, of course, diminish trade opportunities, but also Rudd's hope of selling Australia internationally as a sagacious middle-range power capable of contributing even-handedly to the Security Council (and other) international deliberations.
In her June 2009 Jerusalem address to the Australia Israel Leadership Forum, Julia Gillard reminded her audience that Australia was the first to vote in favour of UN Resolution 181 which established the state of Israel and she described how "our support has continued as strongly as ever since". Is it time for some change? Or should we follow Robert Goot's advice and abandon the Security Council seat quest if this looks like conflicting with our loyalty to Israel?

I wonder what Doc Evatt would have thought of Israel's record in the ME since its creation.Uncritical support for Israel is a condition of the US alliance, apparently, and Israel is 'family' as far as the Americans are concerned,so what else can a sychophant Australian government do but support the insupportable and defend the indefensible, along with the Americans.

Getting to the real truth behind the Arab Israel conflict has been lost over the extended period of Jewish immigration and expansionism to what were fundamentally Arab lands. The genesis was basically a well organised practice of illegal immigration that was supported by European and US governments, albeit that the UK had to suffer many casualties during their period of control from the terrorists who bombed and murdered to achieve their stated aim of creating their own sovereign state.
The suppression of truth, both tacit and active, and the control of access to areas of conflict to anyone who might give an alternative understanding of what is really going on, means that our ability to be fair and impartial has been heavily biased in the favour of the state of Israel rather than the Arab communities that were invaded and then illegally occupied for many years.
Until we can properly understand both perspectives in this conflict we will be driven by our own prejudices, only a full appreciation of history and the truth, which I would expect to very ugly at times from both sides of the conflict will be helpful in finding lasting solutions.

It is hard to understand precisely what Ailsa Burns is objecting to. She seems to misunderstand the difference between what she calls "uncritical support" or "ignorant one-sidedness", and support for Israel's right to exist. Most of the international community support the latter. They - including the Australian government and previous governments - also support the right of the Palestinians to an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip via a two-state solution. As far as I am aware, the Australian Government also enjoys a good relationship with the PA, and does not support Israeli settlements in the Palestinian Territories.
The Australian relationship with Israel has not always been as pally as Ailsa suggests. Rather than referring to retired diplomats who seem to hold one-sided and jaundiced views, she should read the objective and balanced account by archival historian Chanan Reich, Australia and Israel, which documents the ups and downs of this relationship.
But at the end of the day, Australia and Israel are both liberal democracies with relatively free media and social freedoms, and vigorous trade unions, and have much in common. This is the basis of their friendship. Unfortunately, the current non-democratic nature of Palestinian (and most Arab) political culture doesn't lend itself so easily to close connections.

Except for P. Mendez, hooray for everything above.
Australian votes on the Security Council would be nothing more than another 'follow' America, come what may, israel can do not wrong. I have said this before, I say it again.
We DO NOT deserve a place on this council, probably never, ever will whilst we uncritically support a colonialist oppressor and occupier, a grouping of people plainly guilty of gross War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, thus annoying about a third of the World's population.
We play war games with Burma, cozy up the new Dictator in Sri Lanka, lick rear ends of the Indonesian generals.
What a wonderful addition to the Security Council we would be.
Huh!

Philip Mendes, what we have done is say we support the Palestinians' right to an independent state, then stand behind Israel as it does everthing to make its realization impossible. And deny the Palestinians at every turn when they protest against this. I say this qualifies as "uncritical support".

First off a slight correction. Operation Cast Lead was launched in December 2008 not December 2009 and it was launched by the previous government led by Ehud Olmert not the current government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.
The author maintains that
<cite>The Arab League of course commands a significant bloc of votes, so their opposition is a serious threat. </cite>
this goes to the very heart of the uphill battle that Israel faces at the United Nations and why so many people, within Israel and in the International community, are at odds with the United Nations. The Arab bloc, along with the African bloc and several European states that rely on the Arabs for economic reasons, ensure that Israel cannot get a fair hearing. Considering that many within the Arab bloc are still at war with Israel it suits them that they control the majority vote within the UN General Assembly. They ensure that the spotlight constantly shines on Israel regardless of the infraction (hence why the oft-repeated claim that Israel has had more UN resolutions passed against than any other nation combined is a moronic charge) and ensure that member states within the Arab and North African blocs are rarely, if ever, rebuked or investigated by the UN. The credibility of various UN bodies is also seriously diminished by this bloc voting systems. The 'Human Rights Council', the laughable and extraordinarily bias successor to the Commission on Human Rights, was rebuked by its own Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon for "singling out only one specific regional item given the range and scope of allegations of human rights violations throughout the world".
The article asks if we should indeed be changing our stance at the United Nations and the answer is no. Regardless of whether or not we lose this seat it is imperative that we ensure that we do not lose our sense of right and wrong. The moral majority of the United Nations, such as the US, Australia, Canada, Germany etc, those democratic states that have the basic tenants of human rights enshrined within their actions, all side with Israel and against the immoral, dictatorial, theocratic states such as Iran, Sudan, Libya, North Korea etc etc who oppress their own citizens from speaking out against them.
Australia's rejection of the Goldstone was morally justified. The Goldstone report is fundamentally flawed and anyone would recognise this if they happened to read the entire document. The report not only disproportionately blames Israel (and immorally states that Israel had a military doctrine of deliberately targeting the civilian infrastructure) but it appears that their primary military analyst on the report, Col (ret) Desmond Travers, stated that 'only two' rockets were launched by Hamas in the month prior to Operation Cast Lead when there were in fact more than 30 rockets were fired at Israel by Hamas on Decembers 16,17,18 alone. Travers ignorance shows that this 'report' is not worth the paper it is printed on.
(please see:...
and...)
In conclusion Australia's stance at the United Nations should remain unchanged. Increasingly more and more countries are joining the stance against the significant Arab/African blocs as we have seen with the nations that rejected the Goldstone report and boycotted the hateful Durban II review conference. Australia should stick by its moral compass and not give in to the hateful theocracies and dictatorships that control the UN with their petro-dollars and spit on the Human Rights charter.

Granted the apparent Orwellian world of the ME, "Animal farm" and the "Eye for an eye" policies over there have left most of the parties closest to the situation blind and bitter.
Those of us far removed who should be able to see reason are too concerned with narrow short term benefits such as exports and trade and cudos and self-interest.
Maybe rather than cowtowing to the UN and big power interests, we should be boycotting them and setting an example by concentrating more on the Asia - Pacific region, where we live, and think as well as act more locally, and let the UN and globalisation go take a flying leap.
After all China, japan and India will look after our economy, ie if we don't criticise their human rights records, stop their whaling,or bash up their students.

Australia's continued support of Israel has far more to do with having more common ground such as democracy, rule of law and religion, rather than it being a total lack of support for Palestine, who as a member of the Arab League are just as ethnically and racially prejudiced (if not more so) than Israel, who at least accepts non -Jews as citizens.
And no doubt many Australians are frightened by the extremist, fundamentalism of political groups such as Hamas gaining too much power and so tend to identify with Israel as a much safer, more modern and forward thinking option to support.
Also I'm sure most Australians would not believe that by supporting Israel this means not supporting Palestine, as support for the two states need not be mutually exclusive.
Hopefully, if Australia does gain a seat on the Security Council it will be by remaining true to our own values and principles, without fear or favour to any other state or nation.
Because sometimes economic values are, or need to be overidden by social ones.

I do agree with Raffe that it is "is imperative that we ensure that we do not lose our sense of right and wrong.". For precisely that reason I feel it is time for Australia to adopt a more balanced approach to ME issues.
For me and it seems, many other Australians, Israel's abhorrnet policies and actions mean that any claim Israel may have had to the high moral ground has long since disappeared. Ongoing brutal military occupation - after 40 years, there are no credible excuses left for ongoing occupation except expansionism - regularly-recurring war crimes and the never ending massacres of Palestinian civilians, including women and children offend my sense of right and wrong. Nor is it any defence to claim that the other side is just as bad/worse. Israel is responsible for its own actions and must face up to the consequences.
To me, it seems that the basis for a long term peace in the ME is clear to everyone bar the combatants. This involves a two state solution, with respect for security and territorial integrity, based on the internationally recognised pre-1967 borders.
This is the basis of the Arab League's current proposals for a peaceful settlement of outstanding issues, so it is not credible to argue that these proposals won't be accepted by the Arab side. Israel came close to this position with Barak's proposals in the past. I dare say a referendum on these proposals in both Israel and Palestine would achieve a popular endorsement for peace and co-existence. It would hardly be remarkable that, given the chance, ordinary people on both sides would choose peace where their leaders and "statesmen" cannot.
Australia's most effective, most moral and happily enough, most self serving contribution to a lasting peace in the ME would be to adopt an even-handed position supporting these proposals and to abandon its uncritical support of Israel's expansionism and consistent attempts to integrate the West Bank into the Israeli nation.

How do our DFAT officials in Canberra find the cheek to reject the Goldstone report?
Goldstone, a Jew with a conscience and a jurist criticised for dealing with the truth, is just another victim of Zionism of the brand created after Herzl wrote "Der Judenstaat" (The Jewish State) back in 1896 and the founding of the World Zionist Organization which has morphed into modern day Israel.
For more than a century Zionists have been misleading themselves and others that their criminal intentions are somehow "democratic".
Goldstone highlights how we are all misled, Zionists and peace lovers alike.
The images of the IDF’s white phosphorus shells bursting over UN refugee shelters will never be removed from our collective memory. Not only that, but initial bold faced lying and Israeli denial that it used white phosphorous is also stored in our collective memory. The perception that Israel committed a massacre in broad daylight is not going to be wiped out, ever.
But for a very small and insignificant minority in Australia, and despite the efforts of our DFAT in Canberra, Australians are largely not divided about Israel being a criminal state and the biggest threat to world peace.
The repulsion towards Israel and its brutality is actually a growing unifying force amongst humanists, peace lovers and democrats throughout the world.
Justice Goldstone has introduced to the record of world history his report and from that report Israel will never be exonerated.
The courage of Goldstone can be best understood when considering the fact that, despite being a Jew his report criticises Israel, which defines itself as the Jewish state, and by extension it may have had from the gullible west for the idea of Jewish nationalism with special privileges reserved for themselves in every country across the globe. As it happens, not a single humanist stands up against Goldstone or his balanced report.
And yet, as much as humanists are united behind the Goldstone report, our democratically elected leaders in Australia fail to confront Israel and its Jewish lobbies and until they do we have no place at any forum which affects the future or the security of our global community.Time Traveling With Brian Unger

Summer 2012 is about to begin according to the meteorological calendar with only less than one month to go. We are also entering that point in the spring season where temperature and precipitation patterns are beginning and generally will lag through most of the summer. It is important to note several simple, but important characteristics during the summer months to help procede with a forecast. Over this period in the year, the polar jet surges to the north locking the cold air across the immediate poles. This allows for a less-amplified and generally meager subtropical jet to linger across the southern United States occasionally throughout the summer, but generally its influences are not noticeable.
(Source: North Carolina State University Meteorology Department)
This orientation prevents most all middle-latitude cyclone development. Therefore the primary precipitation initiators are along associated weak shortwaves and cold fronts. Also warm-core tropical systems play a large role in precipitation trends across the nation later in the summer. This jet stream setup prevents most organized precipitation events occuring over a wide region and therefore regions must rely on convective QPF patterns to receive rainfall. Conditions during the summer are generally drier than the other months of the year. Also given several factors representing seasons, warmer air is funneled across much of the nation with tempereatures upwards of 100F during heatwaves across the Northeast.
Summer patterns are generally more benign than the winter months and therefore less anomalous for the most part.
If one looks at recent decadel trends, average summer means are generally on the positive side regionwide. The last below normal summer for the contiguous United States was 2009 featuring the 34th coolest mean on record. 2011 featured the second hottest summer on record for the United States, especially courtesy of the anomalous heat wave across the southwestern United States.
(Source: NOAA NCDC)
Teleconnections and ENSO regimes have less of an impact on mean conditions across the United States in summer than during the winter months. Therefore direct correlations are a tad more difficult to make especially given an ENSO regime change that will occur this year. The current La Nina (or past La Nina given conditions are no longer being met) will begin to shift towards an El Nino. The image below is the current CFS output for Nino region 3.4 indicating El Nino conditions peaking towards late summer and early fall.
(Source: NOAA CDC CFS)
A study produced by Zhuo Wang, C-P. Chang, and Bin Wang by the Naval Post Graduate School and University of Hawaii reported small correlations for ENSO regimes during northern summers. Link. The findings were generally consistent and noted weak correlations particularly during El Nino summers, while La Ninas featured a dominate and anomalous anticyclone over the central United States. Summers generally were hot nationwide during a La Nina and quite dry across the central United States.
Looking more specifically at teleconnections including the NAO, MJO, etc is not as helpful in the summer. While there is some research to indicate correlations towards temperature and precipitation trends, these studies still do not have clear results.
Another correlation many forecasts like to highlight are temperature trends from the winter and extropolated to summer. Again this correlation is backed by undefined research and statistics. But it is important to note that by late spring, patterns have often set up and become very stagnant for the following few months. Given the recent anomalous warmth (excluding the April cold spell/snowstorm) and dry conditions, it is likely that we may see a continuation of this pattern as we move foward into summer.
(Source: US Drought Monitor)
Drought conditions are already developing across portions of the Northeast despite short term relief from a few synoptic precipitation events over the past week or two. Long term departures are well below normal particularily across much of New England.
This summer forecast will generally be loosely based on the current ENSO status and recent temperature/precipitation trends across the Northeast. While a simplistic forecast in itself, summer forecasts are typically of lower confidence than other times in the year.
While La Nina continues to diminish as we enter neutral conditions presently, SST anomalies are beginning to warm into El Nino ranges according to the latest SOI numbers. Temperature means this summer have a higher likelihood of averaging above normal especially following rollover techniques from the previous 90 days. But without defined ENSO forcing and meager teleconnection influence, I would expect the heat to be more benign than the record warmth during 2010 and 2011. Extended heat waves will be less common than last summer, but a few days of touching 100F cannot be ruled out for the Northeast metropolitan corridor. The hottest conditions are also more likely to persist earlier in the season before the El Nino really begins to intensify.
Current CFS operational output supports a near normal temperature regime for the summer months, but again looking at the latest trends, above normal temperatures are of a higher possibility.
(Source: Climate Prediction Center NOAA)
Precipitation will likely be the bigger news story if the set pattern continues over the next few months. With deficits already greater than 5in+ for the year for some climatological reporting stations, these numbers will likely continue to grow. Drought conditions will worsen, although extreme drought conditions are unlikely. There are no indices and trends signaling any extreme dry weather. Convective precipitation will play a big role and cause localized areas of normal precipitation in some areas.
For hurricane frequency along the east coast, there is nearly a 50/50 probability for a strike. I know this sounds silly, but that is how probability and statistics is used in the meteorological field. There are no definite trends leaning for or against a higher probabilty of an east coast landfall. Current ENSO by early Fall signals that this hurricane season will be quieter than normal.
In general this summer has a higher likelihood to feature slightly above to above normal temperatures with a chance for below normal precipitation for most of the Northeast.

September 20, 2011 — Gordon Gray, the United States ambassador who witnessed the tumultuous revolution that brought sweeping changes to Tunisia, will speak Tuesday, Sept. 27, at 10 a.m. in Room 306 of the University of Wyoming Classroom Building.
When the first pro-democracy protests started in Tunisia last December, Ambassador Gray observed first-hand the beginnings of the "Arab Spring" that swept across North Africa into the Middle East. The revolution in Tunisia ended the 23-year rule of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, paving the way to freedom and a new era of individual rights for the Tunisian people.
Gray will share his experiences and observations during a town hall sponsored by UW International Programs, continuing the university emphasis on providing internationalization opportunities for both students and faculty members. He will lead an open forum at UW to take questions, discuss his experiences and share his thoughts on the future of U.S.-Tunisia cooperation. His visit to UW will also help to revitalize the close connections between Wyoming and Tunisia that were established and flourished during the past decade.
One successful connection between the two countries is, ranging from providing professional military training to seeking ways to use aircraft to combat invading locusts. Tunisian military personnel met with Wyoming business and political leaders during visits to the state..
"Tunisia's military is unique among the Arab Spring countries in that it sided with the people immediately, and refused to shoot its citizens," says Anne Alexander, UW's International Programs director. "There were lots of protests, but the military took the citizens' side -- civilian control of the military. Part of that may be the influence of the Wyoming National Guard, and part of that was that the president who was overthrown wanted to keep the military small and uninfluential in government affairs."
Such visits by influential world leaders are not uncommon at UW. In recent years, UW has hosted Zhou Wenzhong, China's ambassador to the United States, and John Bruton, the European Union's ambassador to the United States, among others. Former President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, will speak at UW Friday, Oct. 14, at 3:30 p.m. in the Arena-Auditorium.

Once you solve a puzzle you get a star rating based on the number of moves it took you to do it.
A three-star rating means that you solved the puzzle in the minimum possible number of moves. A two-star rating means you did it pretty well, and a one-star rating is the consolation prize for solving it at all.
There are 30 puzzles packaged with this app, so you must be quite an expert (or have a lot of time on your hands) to earn a three-star rating on every puzzle.Oia Mare Villas

Now it’s june, though, and he is widely considered to be about the 18th best prospect in the 2014 NBA Draft.
What the hell happened? Well, for one thing, NBA teams are starting to get the idea that they don’t have to rely on the NCAA to develop players for them. That’s huge.
Also, it really helps that LaVine has tons of athletic potential—or maybe I should say inches.
He recently took part in a little pre-draft workout for the Lakers, and he impressed the hell out of everyone with his ridiculous 46-inch vertical.
Not just anybody can jump 3.8 feet in the air. This probably played a big role in his meteoric rise in draft projections, wouldn’t you think?

Whitworth has Highest Teacher Placement
Rate in State for Institutions with Undergraduate Certification Programs
More than 72 percent of Whitworth's 1997-98 certified teaching graduates were
employed as teachers within a year of completing their degrees, the third highest
placement rate in the state, according to a report issued by the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction.
Whitworth had the highest placement rate in the state among institutions offering
undergraduate teacher-certification programs. The University of Washington in
Seattle and the University of Puget Sound had slightly higher placement rates
(78 percent), but both schools offer only master's level teacher-certification
programs.
"The bulk of our students are in our undergraduate teacher education program,
and undergraduates are much more likely than master's-level students to go on
to graduate school or choose an alternative career path," says Dennis Sterner,
dean of Whitworth's School of Education. "For programs offering undergraduate
teacher certification, a 70-percent placement rate is considered to be nearly
full employment."
The state superintendent's report documents that 3,303 teachers were certified
in Washington during the 1997-98 school year, and 1,616, or 58.64 percent, of
those graduates were employed as full-time teachers during the 1998-99 school
year. Whitworth's School of Education certified 126 teachers and placed 91,
or 72.22 percent, of its graduates during the reporting period. Among teacher-training
programs on the East Side of the state, Whitworth had the highest placement
rate and the third largest class of graduating teachers, behind Eastern Washington
University (416) and Washington State University (346).
Whitworth's placement rates have consistently been among the highest in the
state in recent years. Sterner credits several factors for the program's ongoing
success, beginning with recruitment of top students. Nearly half of Whitworth's
incoming freshmen graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes.
Once at Whitworth, Sterner says, students in the School of Education perform
particularly well. Among Whitworth students who will be student teaching in
the fall, the average college GPA is 3.6, he says.
Another important factor in Whitworth's success is the effectiveness of the
School of Education's Office of Certification and Placement. Sterner formed
the office in 1992 with the mandate to produce the highest teacher-placement
rate in the state. The office's two-member staff works closely with personnel
managers at school districts statewide to position Whitworth graduates for teaching
jobs.
Staci Vesneske, director of certificated personnel for Spokane's District 81,
says Whitworth's placement office staff is especially proactive in providing
opportunities for its students to interact with school administrators leading
up to the hiring season, and in counseling students on how to best focus their
job searches. Whitworth's School of Education also prepares its graduates well
to meet the changing needs of today's schools and students, Vesneske says.
"Whitworth constantly seeks feedback from districts, schools and administrators
about what's working and what needs to be refined, and the college adapts its
programs and courses quickly in order to accommodate what schools need from
their teachers," she says. "Whitworth's program focuses on life-long learning
and professional development so that their student teachers are expected to
collaborate, plan and work in teams. This is critical for the educational reform
process."
The most significant factor in the college's high placement rate may be the
consistent success of Whitworth graduates in the classroom. In addition to being
well prepared technically and well informed in their fields, Sterner says that
Whitworth-trained teachers are known for their dedication to students.
"Because of our institutional, value-centered mission, we attract prospective
teachers who really feel called to serve their students," he says. "Beyond that,
our program places a particular emphasis on diversity and multicultural issues,
so our graduates are equipped to succeed in a wide variety of settings and with
a wide variety of students. Year in and year out, Whitworth-trained teachers
perform well in the field, and that has given our program a wonderful reputation."

If you have ever had Knox Blocks, then you are close, but Pate de Fruit is an elegant grown up fruit paste made with pure unsweetened fruit puree, sugar and unflavored gelatin. It's very easy to make if you already have the unsweetened fruit puree on hand. Wanting to find a simple recipe for pate de fruit that didn't require pureeing fruit or ordering fruit purees from a speciality store, I began searching online. After looking at numerous recipes, I found one which used fruit preserves, marmalades or jams as a substitute for the fruit puree. Since these fruit concoctions are sweetened, the amount of sugar necessary to make a proper pate de fruit is decreased.
Pineapple Pate de Fruit
8 leaves gelatin
2/3 cup, water, divided
3/4 cup, granulated sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 cup pineapple preserves
vegetable oil cooking spray
caster or superfine sugar for coating.
Coat a 4 inch square dish with cooking spray. Set aside
Soften gelatin in 1/3 cup water. Set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine remaining 1/3 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a boil. Add the pineapple preserves, stirring until melted. Add softened gelatin, stirring again until gelatin melts. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour into prepared dish. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours for the pate de fruit to firm up. Before cutting into squares or fancy shapes, coat the top of the pate de fruit with a layer of the superfine sugar. Use a wet knife to facilitate the cutting process. After cutting into shapes, roll in the superfine sugar to coat. Uncoated pate de fruits can be kept for a week in a tightly closed container.

AUBURN, Ala. — Time and again this summer, Auburn coach Gus Malzahn and offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee have been blunt about Auburn’s receiving corps.
With Auburn looking for one player to step up and be the team’s “go-to” receiver, tight end C.J. Uzomah said Tuesday he can fill that role. (Photo by Todd Van Emst)
Both have expressed that one player has to separate himself to take on the responsibility of being the team’s “go-to” receiver. It takes on even greater importance knowing that Auburn’s top pass-catcher last season, Emory Blake, left a massive void in his wake. Blake’s 789 receiving yards represented 42 percent of the Tigers’ total 1,879 receiving yards last season.
So who will step up to take Blake’s place?
If C.J. Uzomah has his way, that lead receiver will be a tight end.
It’s an undertaking the junior said he’s already given “a lot” of thought.
“I think everybody would want to be that guy in a pressure situation to step up on third down, or if you need a last-second touchdown, then who are you going to throw it to?” he said Tuesday. “Everyone is working and battling to fill that position. I think this offseason everybody has been training their hardest to be that guy.”
Uzomah played in the shadow of starting tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen last year. That is, until Lutzenkirchen had season-ending hip surgery in October, which pushed Uzomah into the starting lineup. But it wasn’t smooth sailing for the Suwanee, Ga., native, who broke a bone in his right hand late in the season.
Expectations are far greater heading into 2013. Uzomah has already been named to the Mackey Award watch list, which goes to the nation’s top tight end. While he said it was “an honor to be mentioned” as a candidate for the award, Uzomah knows how little weight that carries when you actually step on the field.
“Personal accolades and individual accolades are rewarding,” he said, “but we’re hoping to make it to the (Georgia) Dome and the national championship. That’s what our sights are on.”
But even Uzomah had to admit it “would be a lie” if he said the newfound praise didn’t add to the pressure he already puts on himself to perform at the highest level.
“There is always going to be expectations for me to perform every week,” he said. “I feel like that pressure is going to be there for all of us now with this new staff saying ‘It’s A New Day.’ I think that pressure is going to be there no matter what. It’s up to us to step up to the plate and take it head-on.”
To better handle the additional responsibilities he’s taken on this season, the junior has honed in on the areas of his game that need improvement.
“I was trying to focus a little more on my blocking and putting my hand in the dirt just because that’s still been a huge emphasis on me personally,” he said. “Coach Lashlee and (tight ends) Coach (Scott) Fountain have talked to Brandon (Fulse) and I about how they want to utilize us in this offense. Splitting us out a little bit is one of the things we’re going to have to do, blocking the corner, blocking the safety, blocking the defensive end, blocking the linebacker. We’re going to be moving around a lot.”
That means Uzomah is constantly shuffling between the backfield, the slot and the outside receiver positions. If he didn’t put in time at all the spots, Uzomah joked he’d probably look “like a chicken with his head cut off.” While he has a lot on his plate, Uzomah can’t do everything.
That’s why he’s been pleased to see the eagerness of the incoming receivers.
“They are just as anxious to get out there as I have ever seen a freshman class, including our freshman class,” Uzomah said. “They have wanted to be in with the first, second, and third group no matter what. They are always asking to get in, asking for advice, asking for tips on how to shake a corner or something like that. They have been really sure-handed.”
None have impressed Uzomah more than Tony Stevens. The Florida native has “shocked” Uzomah with his performances during “captain’s practices.”
“He has grown up a lot because you’ve got to have that growing up stage from high school to college,” Uzomah said.
But when asked whether any of the freshman receivers — including Stevens — were ready to contribute immediately, Uzomah refrained from answering. Without the benefit of seeing them in pads, it’s too soon to tell. But in Uzomah and other veterans, the newcomers have a saving grace.
Never underestimate the power of knowledge and experience.
“Watching film and looking at a playbook is one thing,” Uzomah said, “but having people that have played in the offense and been in the offense that can help you fine-tune the little things, especially with someone as meticulous as Malzahn (or) Lashlee, I think that pays dividends.”
[…] Thursday, the War Eagle Extra blog was buzzing with a trio of different entries. First, there was profile of tight end C.J. Uzomah, who said he was up for the challenge of becoming the Tigers’ lead receiver. Readers made for […]

Special to the Clayton News Daily and Henry Daily HeraldATLANTA-- State Road and Tollway Authority (SRTA) Acting Executive Director Gena Abraham announced this week that Teresa "Terri" Slack will become Chief Operating Officer effective Feb. 18. "Terri Slack has close to 19 years of government finance experience, concentrating in enterprise operations," Abraham said. "I worked closely with her at the Georgia State Finance and Investment Commission, where she now serves as director of authority financings. Her prior service as treasurer/director of strategic development for SRTA, along with extensive leadership experience in both the public and private sectors, makes her the perfect choice to direct the operations of SRTA." For the last year, Slack has served as the director of authority financings for the Georgia State Finance and Investment Commission. Prior to that, she was the treasurer/director of strategic development for the State Road and Tollway Authority. In her position with SRTA, she oversaw a $1 billion debt portfolio issued on behalf of the Georgia Department of Transportation, as well as identified funding sources to improve mobility in the state of Georgia. Prior to joining SRTA, Slack was the CFO for Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, Florida's state-run property & casualty insurance company. There, she was responsible for a $5 billion dollar debt portfolio. Prior to joining Citizens, she was the Chief Financial Officer for the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority, where she oversaw the structuring and issuing of authority debt, all aspects of accounting, finance, and the heads of the IT, Human Resources and Business Development departments. Slack has coordinated two of the largest bond issues in the state of Florida; $1.1 billion for the authority and $3.05 billion for citizens. She holds a dual Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics and Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and a Masters of Business Administration from Southern New Hampshire University. She serves on the Issuer's Advisory Council to the SEC's Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board; as the vice chairman of the International Bridge Tunnel & Turnpike Association Finance Committee; and the Government Finance Officer's Association standing committee on Cash Management.

Yassin Aref and Mohammed Hossain were charged last year with supporting terrorists in a money laundering scheme. The new indictments include more specific allegations that the pair attempted to provide support to Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamic extremist group based in Pakistan that is on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations.
Aref, 35, is the imam of the Masjid As-Salam mosque in Albany. Hossain, 50, is a founder of the mosque. Both men have been free on $250,000 bond since shortly after their arrest in August 2004.
U.S. Atty. Glenn Suddaby did not immediately return a call seeking an explanation of the new charges Thursday evening.

TAMPA -- Principal Owen Young got the news first, and blasted it out to his school's many supporters with a "Breaking News" email. After two years of struggling, Middleton High had officially been taken off Florida's list of most troubled schools.
"I received word of our removal from the list this morning around 6:00 a.m. from superintendent of schools, MaryEllen Elia," he wrote on Friday. "As a result of community support, your prayers and the hard working Instructional staff of Middleton High School, the student body and faculty, I can truly say, we are doing it!"
Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters confirmed that Middleton was taken off Florida's "Intervene" list after improving its state grade from D to C and making sufficient improvements among at-risk groups in both reading and math. No other schools have been removed from this year's list since it was issued last summer, she said.
Hillsborough officials have made no secret of their objections to the state's Differentiated Accountability system and the extra state requirements and scrutiny it brings. While that attention has brought needed help and resources to Middleton, they say it's far easier to land on the list than it is to leave. For example, Franklin Middle School has languished on the list despite earning two C grades.
Despite the good feelings, Young said his job of raising Middleton's performance is far from done. But he said the community's support and engagement have made all the difference.
"Thank you," he wrote. "The Middleton High School Family and I are truly appreciative of the commitment and support you have all given to us."

Most private, for-profit colleges won’t qualify for money under new standards for graduation and student-loan default rates
Most private, for-profit colleges in California, including nine and ITT Technical Institute to Coleman University and Sage College. Online colleges — including Bridgepoint’s Ashford University, which had a 15.3 percent loan-default rate in 2009 — already were not eligible for Cal Grants..
The Cal Grant cuts, signed into law last month, are part of ongoing efforts to wrestle with the state’s budget crisis. Money saved from the cuts will go into the general fund.

By Amy Poulin, University of Pennsylvania, provided the SAVMA HOD portion of this report.
Posted Sept. 1, 2003
A contingent of veterinary students 382 strong (compared with last year's 274) enhanced the AVMA Annual Convention in Denver. The students spent the week attending continuing education sessions, visiting the exhibits, networking, socializing, and acting on measures before the Student AVMA House of Delegates.
The students could take much-deserved breaks from the flurry of convention activity at the Nestle Purina Student Lounge, created expressly for them in the convention center. There, they could sit back and chat with their peers in a casual setting, enjoy a complimentary daily luncheon, and munch on salty snacks and Nestle candy. Paige Salveter, program manager for Nestle Purina, said many students frequented the lounge, enjoying the beverages and a place to "hang out." Board games and contests were available to help students relax between sessions. They could even indulge themselves in a free 10-minute massage while listening to music videos. The sponsor gave each student gifts and drew a student's name each evening for a personal digital assistant.
The SAVMA House of Delegates, composed of two representatives from every veterinary college in the United States, as well as two each from the Atlantic Veterinary College (Prince Edward Island), Ross University (St. Kitts), and St. George's University (Grenada), congregated from July 19-21. This body of delegates represents more than 10,000 veterinary students and is the link between veterinary students and the AVMA.
The SAVMA HOD passed a newly revised and clarified Constitution, Bylaws, and Manual. This was no small feat, as the past SAVMA executive boards spoke via monthly and, more recently, weekly conference calls and several in-person meetings during the past year and a half to reorganize more understandable and usable documents for the entire SAVMA organization.
One of the SAVMA HOD's main emphases is the importance of facilitating open communication between delegates and SAVMA chapter presidents at their respective colleges. This will help them stay better informed on local and national issues.
The SAVMA HOD has nine committees that meet the afternoons following the conclusion of the general house business. The committees accomplished several tasks. The Animal Welfare-Human Animal Bond Committee finished developing an animal welfare survey that is to be completed by veterinary students, established application guidelines for two scholarship awards, and initiated ideas for the creation of a Web site that will be accessible by all SAVMA members for updates on animal welfare issues.
The Emerging Issues Committee discussed development of a survey to ask students what the most effective way would be to deliver new, important information. Results of a wellness survey completed by veterinary students this past year were discussed, as well as submissions for an essay contest, "How Technology is Changing Veterinary Medicine."
The Education and Licensure Committee has delegates who act as liaisons in meetings conducted by the American Association of Veterinary State Boards, the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, and the National Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. They compiled and disseminated results of a survey taken by the class of 2003 regarding their experiences with the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination.
The Governmental Affairs Committee is informing students about H.R. 1367, the National Veterinary Medical Service Act, a loan-forgiveness program for veterinary students that is presently before the House of Representatives. The committee is also trying to increase the number of veterinary students who are registered to vote.
The International Veterinary Student Association continues efforts to facilitate exchanges between foreign and American veterinary students.
The Multicultural Student Affairs Committee has begun planning of an outreach program to promote the veterinary profession to high school and undergraduate students. The committee provides awards to veterinary students who promote diversity and multiculturalism within the profession. The committee also maintains communication between minority students and the AVMA.
The Native American Project reviewed and improved the procedure for arranging an externship with one of the four veterinary clinics within the Navajo Nation. Project members also updated the SAVMA Web site with a revised brochure and awarded several stipends to students who have completed the externship.
The Public Relations Committee has a student liaison to the AVMA Council on Public Relations. They created a Public Relations CD-ROM for all delegates to present to their SAVMA chapter members. This committee also awards the prestigious Teaching Excellence Awards, which were given to Drs. Anna Dee Fails and Souvigny Salisbury at the AVMA General Session (see page 765).
The University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine will host the next SAVMA Symposium in March 2004. The symposium committee will be posting all updates to its Web site:. The symposium is a yearly opportunity for veterinary students from across the country to get together for educational opportunities via lectures, wet labs, and social events.
Funding was made possible for one or two delegates to attend the "Global Veterinary Opportunities and Responsibilities Workshop," Jan. 4-6, 2004. Delegates were asked to give a 15-minute presentation answering the questions "What can the profession do to rebuild Iraq?" and "What could the profession accomplish with $500,000,000?" The workshop sponsors are the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges; the Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, Professional Development Staff; and the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps.
Prior to the conclusion of the SAVMA HOD, the new SAVMA Executive Committee was installed. Congratulations are extended to SAVMA President Tim Paul, University of Tennessee; Secretary Amy Poulin, University of Pennsylvania; Treasurer Jennifer Burggraf, University of Illinois; Intervet Editor Lily Su, University of California; and International Exchange Officer-Elect Nicole Scott, Colorado State University. They will join previously installed Information Technology Officer Terri Sympson, University of Missouri, and International Exchange Officer Liz Nix, University of Florida.Results 1 - 12 of 12 Page 1 of 1

I never really liked Talyor Swift, so this could be biased. But she has taken it too far. I was practically yelling at the tv when she hosted SNL for still holding a grudge over something so stupid. SHE sneeds to bury the hatchet. Joe did that long ago, and Nick isn't intending to do so by singing her song. He's covered multiple hit songs, so it really doesn't surprise me that he also chose to do that one as well (don't do it in Denver, Nick)I can't believe how people are still getting a rise over something that happened almost a year and a half ago. Whether you're a Jonas Brothers fan, a Taylor Swift fan, both, or neither, just let it go. So the relationship didn't work, a lot don't. And I totally agree with the 27 second conversation. She hung up on him. He was probably trying to explain himself, but her being the immature one hung up.
He is just doing it because he wants to cause controversy, so people will watch him and buy his album. Does how singers get to be famous, don't believe? , ask Taylor Swift and Angelina Jolie and others around
I love the jonas but what joe did was plainly wrong. He was wrong not because he broke up with taylor but bacause he did it over the phone...I don't care how busy he was but no man should ever breakup with a girl through the phone (oops! I guess is a boy). A breakup is never easy,it need to mature minds to talk it over in a face-to-face conversation rather than on the phone. Yes taylor went too far with the whole thing (especially saying it in every interview she did) I don't mind the song she sang him because i think its cute. Am still a fan of taylor and jonas brothers. The both made mistake but its time for love to reign like nick said.
Joe didn't mean to break up with Tayor in 27 sec a phone call works both ways you can end it or the other person can.But everytime i see Taylor in an interview she brings it up,Like let it go.And Joe on the other hand (:Joe oh Joe:) Says it didn't work out and thats it.Maybe Nick is trying to Be Nice, Burry the hatchet Hopefully Taylor won't say "Nick Jonas apoligized to me in 27 seconds Ya"ll"
Have a nice day:)
Rachel I totally agree with you she keeps holding a grudge and mentioning the break up In every interview whilst when Joe is asked about the breakup he says oh it didn't work out, that's it.
Joe and Nick didn't treat Taylor and Miley bad, both sides of the story haven't been told and Nick isn't arrogant in any way the Jonas Brothers are normal boys from New Jersey who have an amazing talent. Nobody can criticise them because they still act the same now as they did when they first became famous. Their parents have taught them to" live like you're at the bottom even if you're at the top."
It seems to me that Nick was being nice and not holding a grudge, Taylor Swift talks about the break up as though it's all Joe's fault she's the one acting immature by slating him in videos, songs and on Saturday Night Live too.
It's a super popular song and that's the only reason he sang it. T-Swizzle >>>>>>>>>>>> all 3 Jonas Brothers.
Nick is disturbingly arrogant. Can't stand him.
well..i hate the jonas bros mainly because of how joe and nick treated Tay and Miley..i havent changed my mind bout them but that was kinda cool of him i guess...
Nick was being nice by congratulating Taylor on her success, Joe did not break up with her immaturely. Taylor wrote the song forever and always about Joe and is constantly criticising him maybe Nick was just being nice as all of the Jonas boys are.Denver Blogs: Raising expectations

Band of Buccaneers
She had held on to the memory for so long, had searched for so long, that she was completely shattered when this man before her dared to threaten her vision of truth. She almost broke down in tears-how that the noble man she sought for for so long be a pirate-the scourge of the seas?
Skulls was a bloody pirate and nothing could change that fact. No matter how much Armeria wished for the man she loves to be that which he once was it would never be.
Anger coursed through her veins at the thought-not of the man she once knew, but the man before her now. He was the infamous Skulls and he couldn't even send a note or a missive or God, even a message in a bottle for all she cared, to let her know "Hey, I'm still alive, so if you've been wondering, now you know and don't have to trek the world and the high seas or seek vengeance for my death." It was the least he could do for her!
And when he extended his hand and offered her what she wanted so bad-a home and a place in his heart, she actually paused. In all her dreams, she imagined it differently. He was still the same man she loved, albeit slightly coarser around the edges, and well-hello, pirate, but a bounty didn't mean anything to her.
He was the captain of her heart. She spent this long searching for him, and she definitely wasn't going to let him get away that easily. Even as his had stayed extended, waiting for her touch of acceptance or slap of denial, his sparkling eyes seemed to not only contain a hint of happiness but a spark of something-a challenge.
Her eyes narrowed at the sight, causing the infamous man's smirk to grow even further.
She realized then and there it was time to wake up: there was no one who would be dubbed innocent on a pirate ship. If you aren't against them, then you might as well join them. She grabbed his hand with a tight, strong grip and looked straight into his eyes. She never backed away from a challenge after all.

In honor of Pizza Patron’s new and controversial LTO product launch, the La Ch!#gona pizza, the brand is promoting a one-day inaugural event. On Saturday, April 5, from 11 a.m. to midnight, every customer that visits a participating location and passes the Legendary and Ancient Aztec Ritual of La Ch!#gona will receive a large La Ch!#gona pizza at 50 percent off the regular price of $7.99.
“The Aztecs are known for being tough warriors, and this challenge should be doable for our customers, men and women, who are true Chingones,” says Andrew Gamm, brand director for Pizza Patrón. “I don’t want to give anything away; customers must visit a store in person to discover the details of the ritual.”
Despite debate over the pizza’s name and Pizza Patron’s assertion that it has the right to use Mexican slang, the company has forged ahead with the La Ch!#gona pizza launch and has experienced an increase in store traffic weeks before the product launch on March 31.
“Customers have been coming in and asking for the pizza by name as soon as the news of the controversy began to circulate,” Gamm says. “We knew then that our offering, that not only packs heat but is amazingly tasty, would be a winner with spicy food lovers that are always up for challenge to prove they are ch!#gón enough.”
The company’s new LTO is a large, hand-tossed style pizza made with Mozzarella cheese. It features 5.5 ounces of proprietary jalapeño-stuffed pepperonis and is topped off with diced jalapeños. Available for a limited time only, the pizza has a recommended price of $7.99. Prices and availability may vary by market.Conference speakers to focus on reaching Muslimsby C. Walter Overman
Nabeel Qureshi was a devout Muslim until he met a Christian who could defend the gospel and authority of the Bible.
His encounter with this Christian set in motion a personal journey to discover the truth about Jesus Christ and the Bible. After several years of intense research and study, he concluded that the Bible is the infallible Word of God and that Jesus Christ is the true Son of God.
The former devout Muslim is now a Christian author, apologist and director of Creed 2:6 Ministries, an organization committed to reaching Muslims with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Qureshi will speak during the evening session of the annual statewide evangelism conference Feb. 25 at Pleasant Garden Baptist Church. The conference will focus on equipping believers to better love, relate to and share the gospel with Muslims.
“It is our biblical command to love our Muslim neighbors and to reach them with the Word of God and with the hope of the gospel,” Qureshi said.
Qureshi and I hope that’s what we do at this conference.”
Fear and Persecution
Nik Ripken, an expert on the persecuted church and author of The Insanity of God: A True Story of Faith Resurrected, will also speak during the evening session. Ripken’s interviews with more than 600 Christians in 72 countries indicate that faithfully proclaiming the gospel will lead to persecution, regardless of the country.
“What we have been able to do is look at how Almighty God and Satan are at battle globally. Whether it has a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Hindu, a post-modern face – whatever lostness looks like there is only one God and there is Satan in opposition to him,” Ripken said. “We have a global view of how this spiritual battle is being waged.”
In the United States, that spiritual battle often manifests itself for Christians in the form of fear. For Muslims who come to faith in Jesus, the result is often persecution.
Ripken said it is not uncommon for Muslims in the United States who come to faith in Jesus to endure persecution from Muslim friends and family on a level that surprises many Americans.
“What we see is Muslims coming to Jesus as if they were still in the Middle East,” he said. “Their persecution in America is as quick as if they never left their home country.”
Ripken said young Muslims who come to faith in the United States are sometimes forced by their families to return to their native country or are disowned altogether.
The key to helping alleviate persecution is to disciple former Muslims as if they live in a Muslim country, which means discipling them in house churches and avoiding public announcements of their conversion.
But first, Christians in the United States must develop a sense of urgency to reach Muslims with the gospel.
“See past the Islam and see Muslims as people who are victims,” Ripken said. “They are captured by Islam and we don’t give them a second choice.”
Fear is often the biggest barrier between Christians and a faithful witness to Muslims. Ripken said that Christians must recognize fear as a tool of Satan, and that by sharing the gospel they can use fear to their advantage.
“If you are a follower of Jesus Christ you have no right to be afraid of Muslims, even if you are in Afghanistan or Pakistan,” he said. “You can either use fear as a tool against Satan or you can allow Satan to use fear as a tool against the gospel.”
Ripken is praying that conference participants will leave with an understanding of what is at stake for Muslim converts and a renewed sense of Jesus’ call on their lives.
“I want them to take away that we are asking Muslims to be willing to die for Jesus at the point of conversion, where most of us are not willing to die for Jesus when we’ve lived in a Christian world all of our lives.”

The latest group to become native to North America came too late to cross the Bering Land Bridge, sailing instead in small boats from east Asia, and forming what anthropologists call the Thule culture in western Alaska around 1000 CE. Their legends preserved memory of the Dorset culture they displaced as giants called Tuniit. By 1300, they had reached Greenland, where Norse colonists called them, the Tuniit and the Beothuks skrælingar—”wretches” in their language. They called themselves “Inuit,” or “the people” in their own Inuktitut language. English speakers came to call them by a name of Algonquian origin of ambiguous meaning (often presumed to be “eaters of raw meat,” though this seems incorrect): “Eskimo.”
The Inuit have not lived long in the arctic reaches of North America, but their adaptations to such a harsh environment are impressive, nonetheless. The Arctic is actually a desert, due to its low precipitation. It is not just the biting cold or the driving winds that make the Arctic such an incredibly difficult environment, but the low precipitation and sudden storms one finds in a desert, as well. Little can grow there but small grasses, mosses and lichens, but these form the basis of an Arctic ecosystem nonetheless. Caribou dig through the snow to find those lichens and grasses that spring up in the short summer growing season, and these constitute a major source of food for the region’s predators—primarily polar bears, and the Inuit themselves. The Inuit are unique in many ways; one of them being that their diet is nearly 100% meat. Inuit will scrape the stomachs of caribou for undigested greens, which can make up the main source of vegetable matter in Inuit diet. Many Inuit, however, have relied more heavily on seal hunting than caribou, and some have even occasionally hunted polar bears—some of the most powerful, most dangerous animals in the world.
The Inuit innovated incredibly elegant and ingenious technologies to deal with the harsh environment. Kayaks were invented by the Inuit for water transport and hunting. The igloo is a marvel of architecture, built from the one material the Inuit had in abundance—snow. It is a structure that effectively maintains heat, can be built in a few hours by a skilled Inuit, and can last for weeks or even months if that is needed..1
Yet even their ingeniously elegant technology could not completely cope with the harsh ecology of the Arctic all on its own. With so few material resources, the greatest resources available to the Inuit were one another. The division of labor in Inuit society helped deal with the problems of Arctic life.
Life on these precarious margins meant that every member of an Inuit band played an essential role. While her husband hunted, an Inuit wife spent much of her time making clothes-scraping hides, chewing the leather to soften it, and sewing the pieces with sinew. Every seam had to be windproof and watertight; a leaky boot could lead to crippling frostbite. Children and grandparents helped as they could-preparing food, packing sleds, harnessing dogs, setting up tents.2
Inuit beliefs adapted to their ecology, and helped also to support their society on such a difficult environment.!”3
Western anthropologists have tried to shoe-horn the Inuit into a model of hierarchy, though the umialik or “rich man” is a head of his family, whose attained power comes through personal skill and charisma, and the wealth of a large family.
Highly successful umiliaks differentation. … For the Inupiat prior to their encounter with the West, people rather than things were the crucial resource.4
This is a heart-warming sentiment, but we must remember that the Inuit lived in an ecology so marginal that they are unique among hunter-gatherers in that their existence was genuinely difficult. Protecting that resource—one’s family—led to tactics as violent as any modern civilization employs to protect material assets.
In War Before Civilization, Keeley relies almost exclusively on horticultural peoples, so while he might provide a strong critique of the “Noble Savage,” he nonetheless helps to underline th connection between war and food production. The major exception are the Inuit. Keeley readily admits that with the Inuit, we are dealing primarily with homicide, rather than anything we would appreciate as “warfare,” but he also points to the lower population of the Inuit, and argues that as a percentage of population, the Inuit lost more people to escalating blood feuds than most industrialized states lost in the wars of the 20th century. Rachel Attituq Qitsualik, an Igloolik Inuit who has worked in Inuit sociopolitical issues for the last 25 years, writes about Inuit culture often for Nunatsiaq News. She details how a blood feud develops:.5
In the same series, she underscores the point with how conflict can arise not just from out-and-out killing, but even from wounded egos, and how this leads to a humility eerily reminiscent of the San, and the tradition of “cursing the meat” that Richard Lee discussed in “Eating Christmas in the Kalahari.”.6
Qitsualik goes on to describe how anthropologists would often unwittingly set off feuds by focusing on one given contact and naturally praising his skill—leading to the sorts of inequality that stoke Inuit cycles of revenge. To some extent, we might conclude from this that Keeley’s numbers for Inuit violence may be inflated by the very same processes that recorded them, but there is also little doubt that blood feuds and revenge were major elements of Inuit life long before anthropologists came onto the scene.
We can see in these two forms a common thread beginning to emerge, suggesting what we might inuit as the underlying reason why the Inuit would be so exceptional among foragers in their propensity for violence: the Arctic is a very harsh place to live. Resources are few and far between; the most important resource for survival is one’s community, one’s family. If a member of your family is killed, reprisal is usually necessary—in order to maintain balance between competing families, but most of all, in order to establish that destruction of one’s most important resource is a dangerous and costly thing. Failing to avenge a fallen family member sends a signal that a competitor can be eliminated without fear of reprisal: it invites further destruction of one’s most essential resource—one’s family. This point is further underscored by the importance placed on self-worth and ego. Confidence in one’s self, and trust in one’s family, were the bonds that made this approach possible. If people and relationships are the most important resources of Inuit life, then confidence and trust are as vital to that economy as banking, interest and loans are to a monetary economy. This view is supported by the fact that Inuit violence was seasonal.
With the coming of spring, a general truce again went into effect. Inupiat men living in the Kotzebue area north of the Seward Peninsula put away their weapons and moved onto the ice for seal hunting, interspersed a little later on with the pursuit of schools of sheefish. Women took overall responsibility for processing these harvests. Farther north at Point Hope, Wainwright and Barrow, coastal Inupiat hunters spent a large part of April and May in search of the bowhead whale, enroute to summer feeding grounds in the Beaufort Sea. At this same time, hunters would occasionally search for caribou along the upper Utukok and Colville Rivers.7
In that case, the Inuit fight for the same reason anyone else fights—to protect and to expand their resources. The Inuit represent a unique case in that the resource they protect and try to expand is the family. As such, blood feuds and revenge are not allowed to escalate out of control. The Inuit have developed ways of ending the loss of so many precious resources, and concluding escalating blood feuds. singer’s.8
Violence and war are functions of scarcty (though, as Kelly demonstrates,9 the relationship is not as simple as “scarcity causes warfare”—rather, scarcity provides the impetus, and following abundance the means, for warfare). Foragers are typically not bound by scarcity,10 but the Inuit live in an exceptionally difficult ecology. For them, scarcity is a genuine part of life; we should not be surprised that conflict and violence are thus also part of Inuit life.
The Inuit propensity to violence is almost certainly a direct result of the fact that the Inuit make their living in the most harsh, unforgiving, and marginal ecology in the world—an ecology where agriculture has absolutely no chance of survival. In such an environment, the Inuit have necessarily created one of the most unique foraging cultures, an outlier on the foraging spectrum in many regards, including the prevalence of violence. Though some Inuit have spent nearly half their total time in North America in contact with European cultures, for others, European ways of life are relatively new, and for the elders, the “old ways” are still in living memory. Though often dismissed as nostalgic by the younger generation, the elders insist that even living on the edge of the world, their quality of life has suffered greatly with the introduction of European technologies, culture, and patterns of thought and speech. Perhaps they are simply being nostalgic, or perhaps we should take them at their word—that even the poorest, most marginal foragers have it better than the most “advanced” civilizations of the First World.

Do we get to mark this up as a success (?) for Sen Stevens /North Pacific

I protest, deny and object to this destruction of Eskimo, Indian and Aleut resources
we have depended on since time immemorial.
The Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts are not a party to the State constitution document.
We never consented to OR never were we ALLOWED to vote
for the Constitution.
(The Statehood Act Sec. 4 - the price for “statehood”: thanks for the disclaimer
clause, but we are still not a party to the document.)
According to the UN Charter of 1945 (a treaty document) specifically Sec. 76(b)
regarding the Non Self-governing territories of which Alaska is on the list,
the Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts were supposed to
vote for independence, or self-government .
Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts were NOT allowed to vote
(The State of Alaska constitution document
Article V Section 1: Suffrage: stated we had to speak and write
English, take a test). Some tried and were escorted away.
Why wasn’t there a Rappatour WATCHING and demanding
that we be voting for independence or self-governance???
That Constitution was voted on by the non-natives RESIDING in Alaska.
And the military personnel based up here were approved to vote by the US Pres. that
the military personnel could vote and still get paid OVERSEAS
pay AND keep their “homebase/point of entry” into the military so the feds pay
for their return to their “homebase” when they’re finished with their
“duty”. PLUS the military personnel got paid for voting for statehood.

I hadn’t heard they were so violent. I wonder why? I knew they didn’t get along with the indians living below them.
Do you think all the wife swapping might have reduced violence? Kind of like bonobos?
Comment by Ted Heistman — 19 October 2006 @ 1:11 AM
The Inuit are consistently thrown back at me as a counter-example: foragers who are violent, foragers that use euthanasia, etc. Why that is, and why they’re not exactly representative of the “forager experience,” is the whole point of this article, but it mostly comes down to one essential fact—they live in the fruggin’ Arctic!
That’s an interesting hypothesis about the wife-swapping. Might be; I’d love to see if anyone’s ever looked into that.
Comment by Jason Godesky — 19 October 2006 @ 9:21 AM
I know inuit dogs are more violent than other breeds of dog, not with humans but with dogs. I know some people who have these type of sled dogs. They are still just like what you saw in the movie “Nanook of the North”
maybe the inuit are violent for the same reason their dogs are. Because they are not domesticated.
Dog mushers that race in the iditarod of bred out most of the dog agression genes. If they have a dog that is a fighter they cull it from the gene pool. You could say the dog musher has a monopoly on violence in an iditarod team.
So you have these heavily armed men in inuit socety, used to killing their food everyday, there is no State to bring order and monopolize all the violence, so they sort things out for themselves.
Makes sense to me.
Comment by Ted Heistman — 19 October 2006 @ 1:36 PM
I wouldn’t call the Pygmies or the Bushmen domesticated, either, but they’re also not very violent. So it can’t just be a question of being undomesticated.
That explanation also suggests that violence is in our nature, and I don’t think it is. When you make that argument, though, you also justify civilization: if we’re by nature violent, then it is good for us to be domesticated, and civilization is justified in suppressing our nature because our nature is a bad thing.
Comment by Jason Godesky — 19 October 2006 @ 1:44 PM
uh… careful there (deja vu?)
Violence Is in our nature… but it is in our nature in a way quite different from how our culture defines it.
Let’s say we have the capacity for violence but culture and circumstance makes ALL the difference as to when, how, how much it is expressed…
Janene
Comment by janene — 19 October 2006 @ 2:09 PM
Therein lies the crucial difference between having a capacity for violence and being violent. We all have a capacity for violence, just as Bushmen or Pygmies are perfectly capable of fighting or killing, but I wouldn’t call them violent, and while the capacity for violence is very much part of human nature, I would argue very strongly against the notion that human nature is violent. That difference is all the difference.
Comment by Jason Godesky — 19 October 2006 @ 2:16 PM
Gotcha. I can agree to that

Comment by janene — 19 October 2006 @ 2:29 PM
First of all human nature is very hard to define. Some people think it is a totally empty concept. Like Fredy Perlman for example.
We can observe violent chimps and peaceful bonobos, and draw conclusions based on their behavior but for humans our perceptions are collored by lofty moral ideals.
From what I have read of the San bushmen, they have a murder rate similar to other societies.
Why is not the case that muder is typical of human and animal behavior? Why must we always hearken back to a peaceful golden age that may never have existed?
I mean if we share common ancestors with chimps and chimps commit muder, why is it not the case that murder is part of human nature?
Comment by Ted Heistman — 19 October 2006 @ 4:15 PM
Human nature is very easy to define—just like elephant nature, wolf nature, bee nature or shark nature. It’s certainly not an empty notion; it’s just that as humans, we have something invested in it, and often we are very intent that it must not be what it actually is.
I’ve actually already written a bit on chimps, bonobos, and human nature elsewhere. I couldn’t have picked a better example myself that our ignorance of our own nature is quite willful.
I’d be very interested in what you’ve read about the San, though, because from what I’ve read, murder is virtually unknown.
As for why murder’s not the case, it hasn’t a thing to do with a golden age—I’d accept it if that’s what the evidence pointed to. I just see no evidence for it. It also makes no evolutionary sense.
But since the capacity for violence is part of human nature, and since any healthy society has some expression for violence, I’d say that it’s quite obvious that humans are capable of murder. The question is, is murder common? Are humans inherently violent, as opposed to simply being capable of violence? That’s a big difference.
Comment by Jason Godesky — 19 October 2006 @ 4:21 PM
Well, what it comes down to me is wether or not a person wants to create a utopian society where there is no violence.
The way most societies have achieved an approximation of this is to have the state monopolize violence and to supress the freedom of its citizens.
Words like “rare” “capable” and so forth are pretty vague and relative.
People kill each other that is a fact. Is this a part of human nature that needs to be changed through eugenics programs or sociological experiments or is it somthing to be accepted?
I tend to put a higher premium on freedom and personal autonomy that in security and order.
I also don’t want to overly romanticize hunter gatherers. I think its obvious they fight and make war and commit murder. They come up with cultural ways to control it but its there.
Primitive people carry around weapons, the men are warriors they have neighbors that they consider enemies, and within their society they are more close knit and affectionate and intimate.
I think in civilized society we have balanced things out. Less violence and less intimacy.
Comment by Ted Heistman — 19 October 2006 @ 6:30 PM
Hey Ted –
less violence? Are you kidding me?
Janene
Comment by janene — 20 October 2006 @ 12:06 PM
A society without violence cannot be utopian. Humans will always have violent tendencies. We get mad, and we want to hit things. For males especially, violence can be a very primal and effective way of connecting with something real—see Fight Club. A society without violence is a society that relies on repression of a natural instinct—and thus, cannot be utopian.
But when you let the violent impulse play itself out, does it really go all the way to murder? Not usually, I don’t think.
I think when violence is allowed to run its course, you end up with less violence than when you try to repress it. I think our society’s idea that violence is qualitatively “bad” has led to our society becoming hyper-violent. We’re never given a healthy outlet for violent emotion or impulse, and so it simply builds and becomes pathological. It eventually finds in release, but when it does, it’s compounded by the failed attempt to stop that. Primitive societies have a much healthier attitude towards violence, and so experience much less actual violence than civilizations. Civilizations try to repress violence, and by deeming violence always and everywhere illegitimate, create the conditions for far more violence to take place.
The first evidence for war, archaeological, in cave paintings, or anything else, only goes back to 12,000 BCE—not long before the Neolithic, or in it by some estimates. Questioning the relationship of war and violence to “human nature” and hunter-gatherers is not anything vague, or even romanticizing “Noble Savages”—it’s refusing to accept a Hobbesian view of ourselves without question. There’s very good reason to question the notion that violence, war and murder are aything but aberrations, and it’s high time we did so, rather than passively accepting such things as necessary evils.
Comment by Jason Godesky — 20 October 2006 @ 3:26 PM
Well, it looks to me like your premise is to counter the argument that we need civilization to keep humanity’s violent impulses in check.
My argument is that it doesn’t need to be countered. It is better to have freedom even if it brings more violence with it.
I think it would though. I think all men would need to know how to fight and use weapons. I think people would need to be armed when they travel around.
I think a lot of people would prefer to live in a more secure enviroment than that however.
In the midst of a civilized society people have that. Sure much of the foundations of the society are based on conquest abroad and opression at home, but still things are safer on an interpersonal level; a local level.
I do think it is part of human otogeny to fight. I agree it is better not to repress that.
I don’t think this is the view of most anti-civ anarchsits coming from a left perspective. The argument there is that all violence is bad and that the main reason civilization is bad is because its violent.
I think its just better at violence making it more sophisticated and impersonal. Its better at exploitation and domination through threats of violence.
But to live in a primitive society means killing for food, very likely killing other people in battle close up and face to face and carrying a weopon when traveling.
I want to acknowledge that. Not rationalize it away.
That relationship with violence does not exist for the average middle class member of a first world country.
Comment by Ted Heistman — 20 October 2006 @ 6:06 PM
Even if what your acknowledging is nothing more than a Hobbesian mirage? Even if it’s all just for fear of being called an idealistic, Rousseauian Romantic? I agree that part of our problem with violence is our distance from it—we hire soldiers and slaughterhouse workers to do our violence for us, we try to remove ourselves from the essential violence of all animal life, and part of rewilding is learning to do our own violence, to kill an animal and eat it, and be prepared to defend ourselves against other humans, should it come to that. But does it often come to that? Is it human nature to kill each other? Is it commonplace, or is it exceptional? Is it to be expected, or is it a freak thing that happens only every so often? I’ve studied enough about war to know a few things. I know that for millions of years, there’s no evidence of it whatsoever—not one spearhead lodged in a rib cage, not one broken skull, not one cave painting of a glorious victory in battle. Then, about 12,000 BCE, the cave paintings appear. With bows and the Neolithic, you start to see arrowheads in people’s rib cages. War and murder are recent inventions in human history, as recent as agriculture itself. I’m not interested in acknowledging anything that isn’t true, even if someone wants to call me a Romantic for it.
Comment by Jason Godesky — 20 October 2006 @ 11:56 PM
The interplay between violence and egalitarianism in the Bushman and similar groups contrasts sharply with the various monopolies of violence in our own societies. Basically, as all Bushmen are armed, and all know how to kill, and there is no state restraint, everyone comes to understand a very simple rule: Be nice. Don’t hang sh*t on anyone else or you’ll get killed.
With us, violence is complicated by the (often strictly theoretical) prospect of state intervention and a great uncertainty regarding outcomes. Perhaps the parties will just stand around screaming ‘F*ck you!’ at each other. Perhaps they will indulge in what is effectively ritualistic punching, but battery nonetheless. Or someone might end up on the ground with a boot in the head. Or the knives or guns come out. Or the law and the courts get involved, and even minding your own business can look guilty under forensic investigation. Many people will endure low-level violence in possibly ambiguous circumstances rather than endure the complications of the law. And so far I have not even considered the reality that social position enables violence in our societies, and that some people can literally get away with murder.
The net result, then, is a much greater prevalence of what we might call ‘ego violence’ - mouthing off and lower-level assaults, with this behaviour spread ‘undemocratically’ (for want of a better term). Some people get to indulge in practically costless violence against others.
Personally I think the simple clarity of the Bushmen way has a lot more going for it. Violence of any form against other people is understood by all to have very serious consequences, in virtually all cases. And that is as it should be.
Comment by Eric — 25 October 2006 @ 11:28 PM
Is there any evidence that other people around the arctic were similarly violent like the Sami of northern scandinavia or the Samoyedic people in Russia? Or is it a case of those people adopted reindeer herding and thus live lives of less scarcity?
Comment by Andy — 26 October 2006 @ 4:13 PM
That’s an excellent question. I don’t know. But I’ll bet that Piers Vitebsky’s The Reindeer People: Living with Animals and Spirits in Siberia would be a great place to start looking….

Reading through this post again, I suddenly remembered an article I read years ago about the Icelandic notion of [i]frith[/i].
Here it is:
[url][/url]
I think it can provide some additional insight to a lot of the things Anthropik has been talking about lately.
A short excerpt regarding violence:
[quote appl ication to those individuals and groups who lay outside the boundaries when it came to a conflict of interest between the two. Nor could any notion of absolute, unbiased justice make a dent in it: defending one’s kindred was always right, no matter how wrong their actions were.[/quote]
And another one about [i]frithguilds[/i], which grew up as a way to replace the traditional bonds of kinship, fealty and worship that broke down as northern European society grew larger and more complex:
[quote]The general provisions of the frithguilds were as follows:
Members of a guild were not to engage in strife with each other; but if they did do so, they were not allowed to bring it before any court for litigation, excepting the court of the Guild itself..
Every brother of the Guild was obliged to help every other one in lawsuits (by being an oath-helper, by guarding him in court and out, and so forth).
If a Guild-brother was killed, other Guild members must refrain from eating, drinking, or having any social connections with his slayer, and must aid the dead man s heirs in seeking vengeance or restitution. (See Groenbech, Vol. I, Ch. 1)
By these descriptions, we can gain a better understanding of our forebears’ expectations of frith, of its value to them and their dependence on it for support and safety. [/quote]

Whoa. I didn’t realize Groupwise 8 was that far off. Hoping to refresh the Authorized Beta in February means Groupwise 8 probably won’t be out until around Brainshare. This is good to know so I can plan what to do in the meantime.
So, what is the expected release timeframe for GroupWise 8? I’ve seen a GroupWise 8 logo somewhere that had ‘March 15, 2008′ on it.
Can GMS for Linux also run under VMware ?
Thanks for the update!
As you mentioned GMS, are you aware of the problems with GMS2 at the moment?
See forums, groupwise.7x.wireless, reports of duplicating items, appointment dates changing.. from many sites.
We opened ServiceRequest on these issues and got an answer that there is really nothing to do in order to fix ir :/ Weird.
We may have to shutdown whole GMS service becoz of the problems.
This is a great thing! In the past when I’ve opened Service Requests or submitted defects, it’s always been a matter of hope and luck to determine if my issues are addressed in the latest code.
Many thanx to Dean and the GW Team.
–Bob.
We have feedback saying that it does work, however, Nokia have not validated it in VMWare so won’t support it
Sami – the duplication issue is fixed in SP3. The appointment issue is new to the team here. Please can you mail me offline with the SR#? aevans@novell.com
I hope that 7.0.3 has improvements for the web access agent. It crashes far too often in our environment.
We have been cautious about talking about specific dates for shipping Bonsai. Bonsai needs to go through Beta, Public Beta and then finally release. Our most specific guidance to this point is ‘Summer 2008′. However, please watch this blog for updates and exit criteria. It is more important that we release a quality product than to push the product out before its time.
See comment above…
This is not expected GMS behavior and not what I would call an appropriate response from NTS. Please contact me directly and let’s see if there truly is a bug or something we can do.
You’re too late Dean – I already took care of Sami. Well, I’ll take credit for it, someone else is actually doing the hard work
Thanks for the update. It is much appreciated. We are currently busy with a project that is reliant on the release of 7.0.3. From a planning perspective what would you reckon the possibly to be that 7.0.3’s final release will slip beyond Feb? Just to elaborate. Our reliance stems from the update of the SOAP interface which is required to get our Document Management client that runs on Linux to work.
the appointments issue is now here:
Hi Dean, so my question is ref groupwise and Gwava. Will Sp3 fix all those annoying issues between the two??? gwava digest crashing groupwise clients, mta and gwia failing to shut down etc etc
i hope that in groupwise 8 and/or bonsai cross platform you resolve/implement the check in/out document function, so i can migrate to linux plaform 😉 Thanks
We are having a lot of stability problems with the current release when GWAVA is in the mix, most of the problems are due to MTA loosing comunication and not closing/restaring gracefully, forcing a system reboot in a 1000 user post office.
My main concern/need is a new GW 7 code release that soles those stability problems.
JM we had same issue…In the end we turned to the Gwia scan which is way more stable…the MTa shuts down ok but we have Gwia hanging and a power off is the only solution if a reboot is required
Does anyone have a link for a list of fixes in 7.0.3? We have a tremendous amount of shared addressbook, and other replication issues we’re hoping are on the list…we realize the list wouldn’t be complete as of yet.
I sure hope you get this out by June because I timed my OWG purchase w/software assurance just for bonsai. My var said, “should be out before end of year”. Now summer? There’s no way I’ll buy OWG licenses over again because of a delayed product. I want better end-user features like 99 out 100 GW shops and if I can’t get bonsai with my paid software assurance then the next product I upgrade to will start with a Z. I don’t mean to sound rude, but last time I paid for Novell software assurance I got the short end of the stick and this will be the last time it happens again.
There are several fixes for GWAVA, APIs and our partners in 7.0.3, but I am sorry – I don’t know the details or background on the exact problems you may be experiencing.
We are now in Public BETA – take a look

Three new Drive-E powertrains
Volvo Car Group’s new two-litre, four-cylinder Drive-E engine family is launched in the autumn of 2013. Initially, the new S60, V60 and XC60 are available with three engines from the new engine family: The 306 hp petrol turbo T6, the 245 hp T5 and the turbo diesel D4 with 181 hp. A new 8-speed automatic gearbox contributes to a refined drive and excellent fuel economy.
The new T6, 6.7 l/100 km (157 g/km) in the V60 and 7.3 l/100 km (169 g/km) in the XC60.
The turbo charged T5 has 245 hp and 350 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption with new 8-speed automatic is 5.9 l/100 km (137 g/km) in the S60, 6.1 l/100 km (142 g/km) in the V60 and 6.7 l/100 km (157 g/km) in the XC60. 99 g/km. The equivalent figures for the V60 and XC60 are 3.8 l/100 km (102 g/km) and 4.4 l/100 km (116 g/km) respectively.Fuel consumption with new 8-speed automatic is 4.1 l/100 km (108 g/km) in the S60, 4.2 l/100 km (111 g/km) in the V60 and 4.6 l/100 km (123 g/km) in the XC60.
Lower fuel consumption
The fuel consumption of the 115 hp, four-cylinder D2 diesel in the new Volvo S60 with a manual gearbox has been improved to a class-leading 3,9 l/100 km, which translates into CO2 emissions of 103 g/km. The corresponding figures with the automatic gearbox are 4.1 l/100 km and 107 g/km. Its estate cousin, the new Volvo V60 D2, also has class-leading fuel consumption at 4,1 l/100 km (108 g/km) with the manual and 4.2 l/100 km (110 g/km) with the automatic gearbox.
All figures are EU Combined and preliminary. Full information on all engine and gearbox variants is available in the Technical Specification.

The three-spoke steering wheels can now be accompanied by paddle shifters for cars specified with automatic transmission. They turn the automatic box into a manual with the benefit of gear shifting.
Electrical Power Assist Steering on the S60 and V60
The Electrical Power Assist Steering (EPAS) in the S60 and V60 have Pedestrian Detection with full auto brake, which watches out for people walking into the car’s path.
From autumn 2013, the S60 and V60 can be specified with two new systems: of vehicles in the blind spots on both sides of the car.

Ship Model Plans - Prins Willem
The Prins Willem was probably the largest ship with a square stern belong to the Dutch Company of the East Indies. Built at Middelburg during the years 1649-1650, under the direction of the carpenter Cornelis Speldernieuw, the Prins Willem set sail on her maiden voyage towards Batavia on the 5th May 1651, with a crew of 276 including 93 soldiers and 22 women and children. On her return home, the ship was temporarily loaned by the Company to the General States, which had entered into conflict with Great Britain. For her use as a battleship, in addition to the demolition of her forecastle and relative stern bulkhead, 6 guns were added to the battery below deck, by opening up 3 new portholes on each side of the bow in the area of the removed bridge. For a short period, the Prins Willem served as flagship to the famous Admiral Witte de Witt; in October 1652, it took part in the battle of Duins when it was considerably damaged.
Handed back later to the Company, the ship from 1653-1660 operated again on the commercial routes to the Indies; on the 23rd December 1661, the Prins Willem set sail from Batavia with some other ships heading for the Low Countries, commanded by Arnold de Vlaming Van Oudshorn, Governor of Ambon.
The small fleet never reached its destination: perhaps due to a violent storm, the ships were wrecked near the Saint Brandon Rocks, going down with all their cargo.

Oh wait, that's just Britney Spears.
In Jamie Lynn Spears' case, she's laying low at home in Louisiana and Mississippi, making sure Maddie Briann has everything she needs.
Being away from the shining lights of Hollywood is making it all easier to learn the ins and outs of first-time motherhood, says Jamie Lynn.
"Around here, everyone has the same focus," Jamie Lynn told family celeb gossip magazine OK. "The focus is family, and that's a good way to live."
Jamie Lynn Spears, 17, has been taking parenting classes and enjoying the new house she shares with baby Maddie Briann Aldridge and fiance Casey Aldridge.
While the former Zoey 101 star and her 19-year-old baby-daddy have not yet set a date for their wedding, they remain closer than ever.
Jamie Lynn, who revealed to OK! that her labor was induced, said she gave birth with no complications to Maddie Briann Aldridge naturally, and that Casey was the one and only person she wanted by her side in the delivery room."Once I got in there, my doctor was just so calm and so good that really, it was not bad at all," she says.
"I was just talking to Casey. You know what's so weird? I was asking him if he was okay. He was like, 'Yeah.' We were both so excited."
A nursery is set up for Maddie Briann Aldridge at one end of the house.
For now, though, her proud parents like having her next to them at night, so she sleeps in a bassinet in the same room as Jamie Lynn and Casey.
"She is very good," says Jamie Lynn Spears. "She'll feed every two or three hours. When she wakes up in the middle of the night, I'll feed her and she goes right back to sleep. There's no screaming and crying."
"We get up in the morning, and she gets her little bath," she added. "Then I get my bath. We have a routine, and I love routines. I've worked one out with her, and we're happy going about our little life."

The baby looks ugly..it can never look like a celebrity baby..coz its from JLS...if not Casey's...I dont know but these two sisters can never ever produce like cute baby girls...definitely not the likes of Suri or Violet...The horsehair bracelet on Blake Greene's wrist is more than just an accessory.
It's a celebration of the lives of her horses, Shady and Dixie. The horses had been with Greene since she was a little girl; both recently passed away.
"To have something like this is really priceless. It's a word that's sometimes overused, but really, it's a cool thing to have them with me all the time," Greene, a Tallahassee photographer, said.
Greene couldn't carry this special memory around with her without Lisa Phipps, lead designer of Chic Verte, who created the piece.
"There are so many things that are thrown away or people walk by every day that are beautiful," Phipps said. "They can be repurposed and given new life as treasures or mementos that you can wear and keep with you all the time."
When translated from French to English, the name of her line, Chic Verte, means "fashionably green" — which suits her business well. Every piece is created from natural and environmental materials like wood, feathers, antlers, shells, acorns, shark teeth, eel skin and coral. The environment elements have all fallen on their own and the animal pieces all come from animals that aren't alive any longer.
"The materials I use are really just anything that I come across that I find interesting or pretty," Phipps said.
Phipps also encourages people to bring in heirlooms or items of value to incorporate into the jewelry, such as pearls that fell off a relative's pearl necklace, an old compass found during an adventure, or —like Greene — horsehair from family horses. She takes these items and integrates them in with the natural materials to create earrings, belt buckles, bolo ties, necklaces, bracelets or other items.
"When a horse is getting older or about to pass away, I've always taken a cut of my horse's mane or tail and kept it in a box," Greene said. "She (Phipps) gets the importance of taking something that's beyond special and turning it into such a great beauty that I can carry with me."
The Phipps family has a history in the jewelry making business. Mrs. William Klamp — Phipps' husband's great-grandmother — began making jewelry in Chicago in 1898. Years later, the family business would travel to Tallahassee and be passed down to Phipps. Although she always enjoyed making pieces, Phipps had decided to take a break from the business after her children were born.
That is, until a red oak tree fell on the Phipps family property in September 2013. She became mesmerized by the natural designs and divots in the tree. She got an itch to be creative and knew she had to do something with the wood.
Her husband brought the tree back to her workshop. There she began to make wood sculptures, which would eventually bring her back to jewelry-making.
"I started with sculptures and they were beautiful. But turning it into jewelry, you can take it with you, you can enjoy it," Phipps said. "Especially for people who work inside, they've got this reminder that there's something out there."
Her workshop is a living testament to the philosophy she holds about her jewelry. The outside space next to her home allows her to embrace the wilderness and channel it into her pieces. There are boxes on top of boxes full of different shapes, sizes and types of wood, feathers and other organic materials.
"Appreciating nature for its beauty and the value of being able to spend time outside is so special for me," Phipps said.

Forum page
this wiki
Good Evening! I've been using WoWWiki for awhile now.. Whenever I have ever had a problem, or needed an outside opinion/reference, this site has always been my first stop-shop for what I need. So, I naturally decided that contributing to the site would only be fair with how much it has assisted me over the years. However, I've looked over the rules, guidelines, and policies, and unless I'm mistaken, or just plain missed it.. I haven't seen anything on the appropriateness of profanity that exists on some pages.. Primarily in videos. What is the "rule of thumb" regarding this? My thought process is that it shouldn't exist on the site.. Not that I'm trying to "censor" or "hide" from it, nor to hide others, like children, that use this site several times a day.. I just believe that there are better ways to communicate in an article/video than using profanity, regardless of intent. Some guidance would be greatly appreicated. Thanks for your time!
--AúroraKil'J (talk) 03:46, December 19, 2010 (UTC)
- If there are particular videos or section with profanity that you wish to identify and be considered for review, you can use the
{{cleanup|<reason>}}tag, but unless the profanity is extreme (constant or about child pornography or something), I would judge the content on it's usefulness to adding knowledge about the game or warcraft. The fact is, alot of videos have a sound track that is basically a voice chat session while playing and people use profanity when they get excited. There's also "trash talking" which happens frequently.Apple announced the release of the highly anticipated tablet computer, called "iPad", and this was a red-letter day for Steve Jobs' world conquering company in two other ways. This week, 25 years ago (January 24th 1984), the first Apple Macintosh 128K went on sale becoming the first commercially successful personal computer to feature a mouse and graphical user interface. For all you Apple Cultists out there, this week (January 30, 1982) Richard Skrenta wrote the first publicly released PC virus, called "Elk Cloner", on an Apple computer. One day the company will just make iEarth and we'll all move in. On with the news...
- Remember the scene in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith where Darth Vader realized his wife Padme was dead and let out that whiny scream? Well, I could press the "Nooooooooo!" button all day long. [SciFiWire]
TOSS-UP: Which Chinese to English translation is funnier: Darth Vader's "Do Not Want!" (A bootlegger's translation of "Nooooo!") or "All Your Base Are Belong to Us" (A translation of the video game phrase "CATS has accepted control of all of your bases")?
- TOSS-UP: The animation company Pixar has decided to make all their future movies in 3-D. If they go one step further, which would you rather watch in "Smell-O-Vision": Cars 2 (about a world dominated by cars instead of people) or Toy Story 3 (about a group of living toys looking for their grown up owner).
- I hate upcoming production news, so let's get all the reboot movie and television news out of the way in one go:
* La Femme Nikita - It may be good, but just maybe. Jennifer Garner's Alias pretty much closed the book on female spy television. [SliceofSciFi]
* Planet of the Apes - This one just feels desperate, but the idea of doing a quasi-sequel telling the story of Cesar, the ape that led to the world of "dang dirty apes" might be worth seeing. [CHUD]
* Mortal Kombat - This movie sounds kinda cool, if they keep techno music.
- Michael Bay says Transformers 3 will feel "very different" from the other two, which means it will have a coherent plot and defined characters.
ODDSMAKERS: What are the odds that we'll see a robot cry in TF3?
- OVER/UNDER: Since J.J. Abrams may not come back to direct the sequel to the wildly successful sci-fi film Star Trek (2009) it's not going to be as good. Using the sequel profit formula (Sequel gross = Original gross + Gross/2) this film will make exactly $486,595,028.
TOSS-UP: Which Star Trek villain would you rather see in the sequel: Intelligent reptilian humanoid Gorns or genetically engineered super-villain Khan Noonien Singh?
- China recently changed the name of their famous "Southern Sky Column" mountains in Zhangjiajie, Hunan province to "Avatar Hallelujah Mountains" in honor of James Cameron's 3-D science-fiction epic Avatar floating mountains. Next year I'm saving up to go to the "Great Avatar Dark Knight Titanic Blade Runner Wall of China." [/Film]
- There's an inane rumor that Will Smith (Hancock) is slated to play the star-spangled superhero Captain America and now the Internet Movie Database is showing him in the role as "rumored". While this would be progressive it would ruin the franchise because he could never play Captain America with enough gravitas to do him justice. [ComicBookMovie]
Happy Anniversary
- This week, on January 28th 1813, Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice was published in the UK setting the standard for 19th century novels on class and status.196 years later, Seth Grahame-Smith publishes Pride and Prejudice and Zombies coming soon to a theater near you.
- While definitely not a happy anniversary, this week (January 29th, 1986) the U.S. Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart after lift off, killing all seven astronauts on board. I still remember I was in class when the news broke and it shattered my image of space travel forever as being safe and reliable.
- On January 28, 1958 Lego patented it's iconic set of bricks. The company, founded in 1932 by Danish carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen, has produced over 400 billion bricks since then and millions of fond memories. Interestingly, the name comes from the Danish phrase "LEg GOdt," meaning "play well."1. Please introduce yourself to the readers (how you started in swimming, education, experience, etc.)
I started swimming very young at the recreational level, following my older brother into the pool (our sister followed suit and we all swam in college. Our parents did as well). Swam or the YMCA of the Triangle Area in Raleigh, NC. Graduated w a degree in Sport Management from the University of Michigan. Olympic & Pan Am Gold Medalist and World Championship and Pan Pac team member.
2. You’ve swam for some great coaches, what was the most valuable thing each one taught you?
Values I learned from my coaches as they relate to the sport of swimming:
- Ron Turner (club coach growing up at YOTA): Belief in preparation.
- Bob Bowman: Belief in limits, and breaking them.
- Jon Urbanchek: Belief in enduring through the process.
- Sergio Lopez: Belief of swimming as an art.
- Sean Hutchison: Belief in myself.
3. How do you incorporate mobility training into your routine during the year and at a meet? Do you feel swimmers need more mobility than the range of motions required in swimming?
Swimmers require a high level of mobility. That is an area I could improve. I try to increase mobility through simple band exercises (think rotator cuff exercises). Much of what we do in the water and in dryland works against our range of motion. I try to stay cognizant of this. It’s never a bad idea to incorporate simple exercises into warm up that encourage shoulder/hip/ankle mobility.
4. Do you follow any nutritional guidelines? What about at a meet?
I tend to eat a healthy diet, so I put as much into my body each day as I feel I need. In our sport, like many, protein continues to be undervalued while carbohydrates are pushed too hard. For athletes training twice a day and also weight lifting, repairing the muscles through appropriate protein intake cannot be stressed enough.
5. Do you take any supplements? If so, what and why? How do you incorporate strength training into your program?
I only take a multi vitamin an iron supplement once a day. I also have a protein shake twice a day, but it is FDA approved, so it is technically “food”.
6. Do you feel strength training translates to pool strength? Why?
When I do a strength training exercise (“weights”), I answer the following to myself…”Does this movement reflect part of my stroke in the water?”
In the past I have found myself doing weight lifting exercises that do not correspond to the freestyle stroke. For example, a traditional bench press movement reflects freestyle in no way. I have scratched this from my regiment.
7. What exercises (dryland, drills, etc.) have most helped you become an elite freestyler?
IKKOS Training.
8. What flaws are your trying to improve in your free?
Continuing to improve my connection between my kick and pull.
9. What is the most common flaw between your good and elite middle distance freestyler?
The catch. Look at what the elite swimmer does with the catch at the top of the stroke. They don’t rush, they establish each stroke with near perfection. Swimming fast does not necessarily mean moving your body fast.
10. What was the most exciting race at the Olympics?
Watching Nathan get his hand on the wall in the 100 free was amazing. The relays are always the most fun.
11. What is next for Charlie Houchin?
Take some time off! Review the past four years, enjoy time with friends. Recharge. Then get a picture in my head of the next four years that I believe in, chart the course of action, and execute!internals:windows:libs:bzip2

The company said memory modules running at 1000MHz would be commercially available shortly.
“The PQI TurboMemory DDR2-1000 uses original DDR2 – 667 DRAM IC and tested with the latest Gigabyte motherboard, the GA-8I955NXP in dual channel to achieve speeds of over 1000MHz. DDR2 – 1066 speeds was achieved when working in single channel pushing DDR2 memory module speeds to the next level,” PQI said in a statement.
PQI28000 memory modules are certified to operate at 1GHz clock-speed with CL5
Earlier this week OCZ and ASUS announced that they could achieve 1000MHz clock-speed using OCZ’s memory modules and ASUSTeK’s mainboards. OCZ also promised to bring such high-speed memory products to the market. Still, 1GHz memory overclocking milestone is not something truly new: Some enthusiasts have already managed to overclock Corsair’s DDR2 PC2-5400UL (667MHz) DDR2 SDRAM to 1174MHz using Intel’s D955XBK mainboard.
It is uncertain when memory modules officially certified to function at 1GHz reach the market and what the actual price on such components would be. Still, even if it is much higher than that of typical DDR2 memory, it is not addressed to the general public, but overclockers, as even the world’s latest core-logic sets do not formally support memory speeds beyond 667MHz.HOLT RECEIVES HIS SECOND
UNIVERSITY TEACHING AWARD
The second time around is even better than the first,
says Frank L. Holt,
two-time winner of a university-wide teaching excellence award.
Holt, professor of history, was awarded a 2005 Enron Teaching Excellence
Award. Yet, it isn’t the first honor he has received from
the university.
“When I won the University Teaching Excellence Award in 1990,
as well as the college’s Master Teacher Award in 1989, I think
it was because of my enthusiasm. Now, it’s because of my experience.
I have grown within the profession as a scholar and a mentor,”
Holt said.
In support of Holt, one student wrote, “Few professors possess,
much less openly display, such a love and a passion for their subject
matter as professor Frank L. Holt does.”
The award carries with it a trophy and a $5,000 check from an endowment
established by the Enron Corp. Nominees must be tenured/tenure track
faculty demonstrating excellence in teaching.

- Intro
- Born in Belfast in 1924, my family's first camera was of course a Brownie. Poor as the results are, they can give a great reminder of long-dead friends and relations, and modern technology certainly can enhance them wonderfully though it can never find information that was not there in the first place.
I'm not a photographer, but I love taking snaps recording unusual events or lighting effects. My husband had the good cameras; he spent a lot of holiday time photographing fulmars on the coast of Berwickshire in Scotland.
Now I have many boxes of his slides which I hope to make time to sort through before I die too - so I'll try not to spend too much time enjoying the wonderful photos on TrekEarth or using my digital camera to capture the ever-fascinating view of the harbour outside my windows!
Meantime I'm renovating my website, Mixter Maxter.

Thanks to: Hobsonphile, for beta-reading.

Author's note: Written for Multiverse 2005. The request was for an encounter between Garak and Bester. If you're unfamiliar with Babylon 5: the character of Alfred Bester, a powerful and ruthlesstelepath, was played by Walter Koenig, aka Pavel Chekov in Star Trek.
Coming in from the Cold
It's a truth universally acknowledged that the last thing a ship on a covert mission needs is an unannounced visitor. This is all the more true if the visitor in question might or might not be an important and venerated Starfleet official and the ship in question is short of life support, deflectors, guidance system and core matrix.
I was wondering, not for the first time, whether throwing in my lot with the Federation really had been preferable to being executed by Dukat.
But I am getting ahead of myself. Before reporting the incident in question, I should probably introduce the dramatis personae, as the good doctor's favourite playwright was wont to call his assembly of illogically acting characters, the location and the time. It happened during the Dominion War – an appellation which, for the record, I find vaguely insulting. It was not the Dominion, after all, who got reduced to ruins and desolation as the result of it. Admittedly, titling it "The Cardassian War" would have caused confusion, as there were quite a few of those in our history, and naturally the Federation did not want to sully their good name by combining it with the word "war" if they could avoid it.
So. The Dominion War, and at a quite desperate point, too. The Federation had sent out Captain Sisko with a minimal crew, including yours truly, to destroy the sole existing manufacturing plant of Ketracel White in the Alpha Quadrant. We succeeded, in no small part because we were using a captured Dominion ship, but we also ended up in the above mentioned lamentable circumstance. Dr. Bashir, newly entranced with mathematics, suggested it would take us no less than 17 years to reach Federation space without our warp drive.
As the official record would have it, this was when our ship stranded on a planet together with another ship full of Jem'Hadar and their obnoxious Vorta, Keevan. But then, have you ever known an official record to include everything? Of course you haven't. Certainly not any record that I had anything to do with. As my… mentor, Enabran Train, used to say, official records are for small-minded bureaucrats, and neither of us can be called that, can we, Elim?
(He was not the most modest of creatures.)
Now of course we did eventually land on the extremely rocky and extremely inhospitable planet the record mentions. But after the destruction of the base and before this involuntary detour, something else happened. What sensors were still functioning on our ship picked up a small space ship of unknown type and origin, with a black omega painted on it, and a human inhabitant. The ship's systems were failing, and the inhabitant's life signs were unstable, so Captain Sisko, who still felt guilty about shooting on a Federation ship earlier to maintain his cover till the base got destroyed, ordered the person to be beamed on board at once.
(Captain Sisko and guilt, and the accommodation of same. Now there is an entertaining tale of its own. But I digress.)
It turned out to be a man, around 70 years of age, unconscious for lack of oxygen though otherwise in relatively healthy condition. Later on, we noticed he couldn't move one of his hands, but that was a defect which had nothing to do with his recent circumstances. What Dr. Bashir, who examined him, noticed right away was this: He looked exactly like one of the highest-ranking Starfleet admirals, one Pavel Chekov.
"You can't imagine what a shock that was, Garak", the good Doctor told me over lunch. "Admiral Chekov was one of Kirk's crew. I mean, the man's a living legend. And we did know he was in charge of some of the crucial Dominion War operations. But his being here, in that strange ship which exploded almost as soon as we had beamed him out of it, that made no sense. Besides, the man might have been old but not old enough. Chekov is over 100. So naturally I thought we had a Changeling at our hands, who just hadn't gotten the impersonation right and had managed to fool the sensors about his life signs."
He looked down on the table, in that manner he has when he feels guilty, which looks far more attractive on him than it does on Captain Sisko. Dr. Bashir, you see, does actually believe in the ideals he's spouting.
"Otherwise I would never…"
"Of course you wouldn't."
Dr. Bashir told the Captain. The unconscious visitor was promptly isolated and guarded at once, with every available gun pointed at him, but as I mentioned earlier, we were a rag tag crew. The Doctor took a blood sample, which refused to change, but then, there had been the precedent of Martok whose impersonator had provided a blood sample as well, strategically placed within his body. At this point, the man woke up, or appeared to, if he was simulating, looked at the guns pointed at him and said:
"Charming."
Afterwards, everyone's memories suffered a short blank. Everyone's, that is, except for mine and those of the Ferengi Nog. To our amazement, we saw the valiant crew members put their weapons down, mild as Cardassian nichalas. The Chekov doppelganger noticed we didn't follow suit, took one of the guns, and pointed it at us. To be more specific, at me, who was standing right in front of him. Besides, he probably assumed I was the more dangerous opponent, and who am I to argue?
However, this allowed Nog to, as the humans phrase it, "get the drop" on him. Ignoring or discounting Ferengi is a habit that I must confess I had shared for years of my life, but my exile had taught me otherwise. Besides, Nog had had recent experience with hostage taking. (This experienced involved him, myself, the Chief and a day of my life I'd rather miss; not that I believe in regrets per se, but I'd rather be not guided by an experimental drug when performing assassinations. A matter of professional pride.) In any event, he came up on the stranger from behind and knocked him unconscious, at which point the rest of the crew came to their senses again.
"A telepath," Captain Sisko concluded grimly. "And a powerful one."
"Good thing Ferengi and Cardassians are immune to that kind of thing," muttered the Chief.. "Good work, Nog."
Dr. Bashir kept running tests. "He still reads as human," he said, frowning. "Not Betazoid or Vulcan or any of the telepathic races. And definitely not as a Changeling."
"Doesn't mean he can't be a Dominion agent," Sisko declared. "Someone who just happens to look like Admiral Chekov comes across a vital Starfleet mission and shows powers ideal for a spy? He could be…"
Bashir's face fell. He probably knew what Sisko was going to say next as well as I did.
"…genetically enhanced. And selling his services to the Dominion, because of Federation law."
"Sir, there is no proof of that," Bashir protested.
"Other than him influencing my crew and drawing a weapon on us?"
"Well, he did wake up surrounded by weapons pointed at him," Bashir said. "Which is my fault. I was so sure he was a Changeling. Perhaps if we could have just let him wake up in a situation where he feels safe, we could find out…"
"This ship is falling apart as we speak, and we're behind enemy lines," the Captain said bluntly. "There is no such thing as a safe situation. And we can't afford to have a security risk on board."
"You're not suggesting we should just kill him," Bashir said, horrified. Three months into the war, and he still was capable of that. I do miss him, you know. Sisko looked as if he couldn't decide whether to say "no, of course not" or "yes, of course", so I came up with a little suggestion of my own, in the interest of efficiency and universal safety. Which would have been compromised if the only physician on board had spent the reminder of the trip agonizing about one of his patients being killed, no matter how sensible an option that would have been.
"Captain," I said, "since we know his telepathy doesn't work on me, why not let me be there when he wakes up, to… pose a few questions?"
It didn't take anyone around long to interpret my offer correctly.
"Captain, you can't let that Cardassian butcher torture a human," O'Brien exclaimed with disgust.
I couldn't resist. "As opposed to a non-human, Chief? There is still the possibility our guest is merely a modified Changeling, you know. If they were able to make Constable Odo human as a punishment, they should be able to repeat the procedure for other reasons."
Bashir stared at me.
"Garak, you can't."
"Time is off the essence," Sisko said abruptly, as I knew he would. "But you're not interrogating him alone. Ensign, you're to remain with Mr. Garak there entire time."
Nog looked less than trilled – hardly surprising, considering the last time we had spent in close proximity – but nodded.
"How humane of you, Captain."
"It's a precaution," Sisko said coldly. "I've had quite enough of Cardassian allies entering into secret arrangements with the Dominion behind my back."
I could have pointed out that if I had been willing to follow Dukat's example, I would have chosen a less obvious way, but I just nodded. Bashir looked at Nog with a relieved expression. He must have missed that Sisko had not ordered the Ferengi to interfere if my methods grew less than savoury for Federation tastes. Or perhaps he believed that I would not use such techniques in front of an adolescent boy.
As I said, the good doctor was an idealist.
A few words about the man I was about to interrogate. For a human, he was small of stature, with dark, greying hair, a nonedescript, rounded face, and as I saw during the few moments he had been awake before, dark eyes. Whether or not he resembled Admiral Chekov, whom I have never met, I couldn't say. But he certainly had a better dress sense. Starfleet uniforms, no matter the ranks, excel in their spectacular banality, blandness and need to make the human body less attractive. Our involuntary dressed, however, was dressed in simple but elegant black. Leather, no less. He even had gloves.
Once the room was cleared of anyone but me and Nog, who had his rifle pointed somewhere between me and the prisoner, I said:
"You can stop pretending to still be unconscious now. I always prefer a conversation with neither party insulting the other's intelligence."
Obviously, the stranger shared this view, as he did abandon the pretense, and sat up, looking at me.
"As do I."
He had a very precise, cultured voice. This was unfortunate, as it reminded me of Cardassia, and what passed for homesickness with me did not exactly heighten my mood in those days.
"Undoubtedly, you have an explanation about what brought you in a region of space where being human results in less than enthusiastic welcomes."
"Naturally, though I can't say I can complain about the enthusiasm," he replied, looking at Nog, who did his best to convey an impression of stoic fortitude and managed to look slightly ill as a result. "Usually people need at least an hour or so before pointing guns at me."
"How tardy of them," I commiserated.
"Extremely lethargic," he nodded. Nog frowned, as if wondering whether or not to suspect me of fraternizing with a likely enemy. On the other hand, the talk of lethargy might have reminded him that time, as Sisko had put it, was of the essence. Pity. I rarely had the opportunity for some not war related conversation any more.
"So what brings you to this singularly charmless part of the galaxy, Mr…?"
He tilted his head slightly.
"Garibaldi," he replied without hesitation, which gave me the immediate certainty that he was lying. Not that he was bad at it; but I am an expert, and besides, he did not strike me as the trusting type who would surrender his true identity immediately.
"I'm afraid the explanation is rather banal. My starfury had a malfunction on my way back from an equally charmless space station, I dropped out of hyperspace, and a few not very interesting hours of waiting later, I found myself rescued by your gallant crew."
This could be a lie as well, or the truth. Banal explanations tended to be far more likely than any of the scenarios that entertaining holoprogram of Doctor Bashir's comes up with, but then again, he would know that when inventing a lie. However, despite what the young Ensign watching us might believe, finding out the truth wasn't really the point of our little dialogue.
"The truth," said the supposed Mr. Garibaldi, "isn't what you really want to know, though."
"Why, Mr. Garibaldi, one would almost assume you were a telepath."
He smiled. I had immediate heartwarming flashbacks of Enabran Tain demonstrating the way to interrogate political dissidents to me.
"But I thought he can't read…" Nog started, then stopped when I gave him a look.
"The truth is usually just an excuse for a lack of imagination," our prisoner said. "And I could be a mundane and still realize your problem, though admittedly what I got before your Captain left us alone helped. You're all pressed for time. He wants answers, and he doesn't believe in coincidences. So what he really wants is an excuse to dispose of me, and you're the only one who can give it to him. He can tell himself he really did try to find out who I was before killing me."
"It's the Starfleet mindset," I said. "At his heart, he's a pragmatist, but all that cloying propaganda he grew up with causes the permanent need for self-justifications."
"Oh, trust me, I recognize the type," he said. "Mundanes in uniform are the same everywhere."
"I wouldn't call our gallant Captain mundane," I demurred, and Nog, who by now looked almost as horrified as he had done when I had held a knife at his throat, burst out:
"Captain Sisko would never order murder!"
"Young people are the same everywhere as well, I'm afraid," I said, and the man in black nodded.
"I have to admit," he said, "that dying because of a conflict I'm not at all concerned with when my people are fighting to preserve our kind strikes me as something of a waste, though."
"I empathize," I said, and I did. At least with this latest war, I could tell myself that my actions would ultimately benefit Cardassia, and perhaps even my death, if the Federation managed to get me killed in one of their increasingly desperate enterprises. Out of curiosity, I added: "You wouldn't define the human species as your people, then? The current conflict here touches them rather deeply."
By now, I was willing to consider the theory that this "Garibaldi" had come from the parallel universes from which and to which there had been increasing tourist expeditions in recent years; it would make sense of his referring to his slightly different vocabulary – for example, I had never heard of a ship called a "star fury" -, his uncanny resemblance to that Starfleet admiral and the scanners identifying him as human. But though I myself have never participated in said tourist expeditions, Bashir and several other members of the Federation crew had, and their tales had been rather heavy on the solidarity they felt with their species in said parallel universe. I can understand the feeling; parallel universe or not, I doubt I could see Cardassia in any version and not be affected. Which was why the attitude of our guest interested me.
"Oh, I'm invested in the survival of the human species," he said. "Just not in yesterday's relics . Would you care whether some versions of your prehistoric ancestors duked it out with someone else when they're otherwise busy keeping the current form of your species in a nice little ghetto?"
"Mmm," I said. "You know, we actually have an advanced human being on board. He comes with the Starfleet mindset, too, I'm afraid, which means he'd disagree with your definition of species."
For the first time, he gave the impression of being curious.
"There is no other telepath on this ship," he said. "I'd have sensed it."
"I didn't say he was a telepath. Genetically modified is the term, I believe. But I find it interesting that you see being a telepath as your primary identity. You must be aware that there are other species with telepaths. Would you define a non-human telepath as "your people" over a non-telepath human, Mr. Garibaldi?"
He regarded me thoughtfully, if you forgive the bad pun. Nog looked anxious, probably because this wasn't at all how he had imagined the interrogation to go, or perhaps because he was still pondering whether we were right about what Sisko had really wanted of me, and interested despite himself.
"No," he said at last, with the faintest touch of surprise in his voice, and then it grew non-committal again. "But then, every species treasures their heritage. I don't think museums would get away with the prices they charge if it weren't for some rudimentary sentimental attachment to one's ancestors, do you? Some of mine just happen to still be walking about."
"You sound like a Founder," Nog told him, for the first time addressing him directly. "They think they're better than everyone else, too."
"If the Founders are the shape-changing species very much on your Captain's mind, they probably are," the stranger said wryly. "Though he seems to think he has his own set of demi-gods to fight them with. It's all terribly repetitive."
"Your conflict is similar?" I probed.
"Not anymore," he said sharply. "We got rid of our demi-gods, but the mess they've made is still lingering. They created us, in a manner of speaking, as canon fodder for their wars, and it would be wonderfully convenient if we were to depart quietly now that their war is over. But ours has barely begun."
He interrupted himself, and smiled again.
"You know, it's a shame you're not really interrogating me. You're quite good at it."
"Thank you," I said modestly.
"Surely by now enough time has passed to accommodate your Captain's scruples. Shall we get on with the killing part?"
"I'm not letting him kill you," Nog said, and pointed his gun directly at me. He had that look of nervousness and determination again which had become all too familiar these days."You're not killing him, Garak. It's not what the Captain ordered, and it's not what Starfleet stands for."
"You're the only one in this room holding a weapon, Ensign," I replied and barely refrained from rolling my eyes. Talking to the prisoner, I continued: "Remarkable, isn't he? He doesn't trust you in the slightest, and thinks you're probably a Dominion spy, and we have been, as my ill luck would have it, comrades-in-arms these recent months. But he still would kill me to protect you, because you are an unarmed prisoner, and he didn't even grow up with this mindset. It's rather infectious. Like a virus."
"You don't need your own weapons to kill," Nog said tonelessly, rifle not wavering. "I've seen that."
"Has he now," "Garibaldi" said to me, and it took me a second to realize he had not moved his lips.
If you can read my mind after all, why didn't you stop this a long time ago, I thought.
I can read you, he said. It's not very comfortable, and it takes some adjustment, but I can do it. But your shields are too strong for me to influence you, which would indicate you had some mental training. Interesting, since you don't have the slightest telepathic abilities. I'd love to compare, but we just don't have the time. Unfortunately, your young companion here remains a complete blank; it must be the species.
Ferengi are inconvenient this way, I commented. I take it you have a deal to offer.
He did. I have to admit telepathy has its distinct advantages. It is not nearly as time-consuming as spoken conversation, and far more discreet. As far as Nog was concerned, mere moments passed before I said:
"Time to make up your mind, Ensign. Do you want to risk us being captured by the Dominion just because of Starfleet regulations? Where is the profit in that, Nog? Be a good boy and give me your weapon."
"No," he returned, focused entirely on me, tension and resolve so evident in his young Ferengi face that it didn't disappear even after the black-clad man from another universe had knocked him unconscious.
Afterwards, things proceeded smoothly. By now, our vessel was close enough to a planet we could actually and, or rather, crash on. Or, for that matter, use a transporter towards. My new and very temporary ally modified everyone's mind but mine and Nog's; he'd have preferred to wipe out knowledge of his existence altogether, but that would have left us with no choice but to dispatch of Nog as well, and I did feel a certain obligation towards the Ferengi. Consequently, the crew was led to believe that the Chekov doppelganger had confessed to being a genetically engineered being, a clone created by the Dominion, and had tried to escape whereupon I was forced to take Nog's weapon and shoot him, disintegrating him in the process. There were some other accommodations as well.
"You don't want them to trust you as well?" our guest asked me. "I could arrange that. None of them do, you know, though the Doctor rather urgently wants to."
"Trust makes me sloppy, so I'd rather you didn't," I replied, and from the look he gave me, he understood. I could have added that I also didn't want to waste this opportunity on such personal indulgences. It would have been against everything a Cardassian should be. For all their platitudes about ideals, I have yet to meet the Federation citizen who manages to keep the larger goal, the needs of the state, as a priority all the time.
The war had been going rather badly, you see, and I was somewhat afraid they would ultimately concede defeat. As this would have left my planet in the possession of the Dominion and ruled by an irresponsible egomaniac, it just wouldn't do. But with a little rearrangement by the telepath fate had given me, I had made sure that Benjamin Sisko would do everything, and I mean everything, to ensure the Dominion was defeated. Now, there would be nothing and no one he wouldn't sacrifice to achieve this goal. No leftover scruples would get in the way. Sisko, of course, was not Starfleet, and not even the highest ranking official in the sector – this would have been Admiral Ross – but after having observed the man for some years, I had faith in him. He would carry the day. When he had truly made up his mind. And now I had made it up for him.
Naturally, I had no immediate way of testing this, as my former prisoner pointed out when I accompagnied him to the transporter platform.
"I can see what you mean about trust," he said. "Yours in me is rather disconcerting. I expect to make mistakes any time soon."
"It's not much of a gamble on my part," I replied. "If you didn't do as I asked, we're still in much the same situation we would be in if I had indeed killed you. And I hate wasting a potential resource."
"As do I," he agreed. I set the transporter to beam him far away from our likely crash site. How he intended to get off the planet I had no idea, but then again, that wasn't my problem. It was his.
"Well, it's been a pleasure, Mr. Garak," he said, and stepped on the platform after I had told him how the procedure worked. Transporter technology was apparently not something his universe possessed, which required some modification of my theory about his origins.
It must have been some aesthetic dissatisfaction with loose ends, but I couldn't resist. My hands hesitating over the transporter controls, I observed:
"I like a pseudonym as much as the next man, but I must say "Garibaldi" really doesn't suit you. To me, it conjures up some holoprograms Dr. Bashir uses, with eye-rolling black curled humans breaking out into song every other minute."
"Indeed?" he asked, amused. "Well, we can't have that. How does Bester sound to you?"
"Much better," I returned, and pulled the controls. In the moments before he faded out of sight, he raised his left hand to his head and said "Be seeing you."
Then he was gone. The transporter rather confusingly indicated he had travelled a far larger distance than I had set, and I wondered whether I had inadvertendly managed to get him back to the place he had come from, given that transporter accidents had started the entire universe-crossing trend. Not that I spent much time wondering; I erased all signs of the transport as quickly as I could.
Half an hour later, the ship crashed on the surface of the planet, and in the evacuation procedures, nobody wasted any time wondering whether or not their memories of our visitor were correct or not. Not even Nog, who woke up, was told what had happened by the Chief and spent the entire evacuation glaring at me. But he did not doubt the man I had interrogated was, indeed, dead.
The sad and none too inspiring tale of our time on the planet and eventual rescue has been written elsewhere, and ably. I never saw any reason to add my own little footnote to this episode of the Dominion War. But the nights are long and cold on Cardassia now, with the ashes of our dead still carried in the winds when we go outside, and sometimes, when I try not to think about the task ahead for me, I find my thoughts returning to past years. And I wonder what became of Mr. Bester, and the conflict he returned to, if he did. For all his intelligence, he seemed to believe it would result in some kind of utopia with "his people" ruling the rest of the world. It's an all too familiar dream, and I taste the results every hour of every day now.
So, somehow, somewhere, I suspect, does he.After something of a lull, I am back to blogging and hope that the upcoming MoFo challenge will reinvigorate me for two of the things I love best in the world: cooking great vegan goodies and boasting about them! I think I must already be feeling the effects because, at lunchtime today, I took a deep breath and signed up to become an Iron Cupcake.
Yes, you *did *read that correctly: an Iron Cupcake!
The website happily proclaims:
This is the central hub for the ultimate world-wide cupcake competition. A monthly ingredient, a monthly challenge, fabulous prizes, new ways to find other cupcake fanatics just like yourself.
And, as far as I can see, the idea is that each month a new ingredient is proposed for inclusion within those little packets of fun we call cupcakes. From the IC site, the challenge:
is a way for bakers from anywhere, all over the world, to take place in the ultimate flavor challenge and promote world peace, one cupcake at a time.
Last month's challenge was basil - a herb more commonly considered in connection with stewed tomatoes and with pesto than with cupcakes, I suspect. However, I learned of it through Vegan_Noodle and was inspired both by her creative use of this wonderful leaf and her subverse thumbing-of-the-nose at Hurricane Ike. So, now I want in! I have emailed the IC folks and begged to be included on their blogroll so hopefully we will soon see Cackleberry listed there too.
Bring on the next challenge: I am ready!
Oh, and Stay Vegan, Friends!The 2013 season for Pasadena City College divers culminated with season-best performances for the Lancers at the South Coast Conference/Southern California Championships held April 12-13 at El Camino College.
Lancer women's frosh diver Gwen McKinley put up a season-best score of 147.35 points to take third place in the South Coast Conference 3-meter board competition. McKinley finished tied for sixth place in the SCC in the 1-meter board with 130.30.
"In the 3-meter, Gwen finished every dive vertical and looked so graceful she drew applause from the crowd on several dives," said PCC head coach Terry Stoddard. "The judges liked what they saw and scored her high on every attempt."
On the 1-meter diving, Stoddard said, "Gwen improved steadily all season her first year in the sport. Her last three dives were her best three of the competition to give her a season-best score."
In men's 3-meter diving, freshman Lancer Chris Anderson hit his season-best score of 177.45 points to take third place. Anderson (from Monroe High) did not participate in the 1-meter diving due to a prior personal commitment on Saturday.
Anderson's score was 13th best out of 40 overall Southern California divers, the largest men's field in region diving history.
"After hitting his head on the board at the Cerritos meet (March 28), which required five stitches, Chris became very focused on finishing the season with a flurry. He nailed his entry on his last two dives to pass two of his opponents at the end. It was a great finish for him to come all the way back to take third place."
The season has concluded for McKinley and Anderson as only the top 10 scoring divers (two alternates) qualify in each gender and each board for the CCCAA State Championships. The points scored by the pair will contribute toward the final PCC team scores at the South Coast Conference Swim Championships that will be held April 18-20 at Chaffey College.

BANGALORE: Minister for Information and Publicity Katta Subramanya Naidu has said the State Government will shortly set up a university for media studies.
Speaking at a function organised to mark press day and the platinum jubilee of the Karnataka Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) here on Wednesday, Mr. Naidu said: “We will ensure that the university starts functioning soon,” he said.
The Government has named the Karnataka Media Academy as the nodal agency to start the process of setting up the university.
Mr. Naidu found fault with the media for deliberately hiding certain facts and exaggerating non-issues.
“You sensationalise and blow up unimportant issues, but dismiss important matters with a little or no coverage, and this has to change,” he said.
The Minister said journalists who criticised politicians whenever they did not act as per their words, should also live up to the ideals they espoused.
Referring to the demands placed before the Government by KUWJ, Mr. Naidu promised that it would issue free bus passes for journalists. He said the Government had already introduced the Yeshasvini health insurance scheme for journalists and increased the amount set aside for the Journalists’ Relief Fund from Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore.
Prize money
Home Minister V.S. Acharya said the Government would increase the prize money for the TSR Award from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2 lakh.
In his inaugural address, Speaker Jagadish Shettar said there was a need for a debate on whether the media was using its powers properly.
Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah said the initial fears of the print media’s survival with the advent of electronic media had turned to be unfounded. Chairman of the Legislative Council Veeranna Mathikatti; R.P. Jagadish, Media Adviser to the Chief Minister; president of KUWJ H.S. Sudheendra Kumar and general secretary of KUWJ Gangadhar Mudaliar were present.
Felicitated
On the occasion of press day, the Patrakartara Vedike felicitated a host of journalists and non-journalists for their contribution to society.
Those felicitated with the Hoogar Memorial Media award included Chief News Photographer of The Hindu K. Gopinathan, cartoonist Prem Kumar, and features writer of Vijaya Karnataka A.R. Manikanth.
Director of Doordarshan Kendra, Bangalore, Mahesh Joshi, journalist and freedom fighter Patil Puttappa and vedike president Mahesh Babu were present.Sun, 03/10/2013 - 3:00pm to 5:00pm

Revlon Matte Lipstick Reviews
LovelyRevlon really knows how to make lipsticks. I really like the matte finish on these. They are a true matte and are long lasting. They really stay put. I find them a wee bit drying, but that is typical for me with a matte lipstick. — 3 years, 6 months agoTheLacqueredLady | 751 reviews

It's a classic!This product for me is a classic, it's been around for a while and I love the classic look too of the packaging. This is the lightest of my favorites almost like a light salmon/peach, and because it is matte it is not as hydrating as some of the others but it feels super lightweight almost like there's nothing on your lips (which I love). It is pretty long lasting as well, but does require touch-ups a few hours after application. — 11 months, 3 weeks agoGlitzGlamBudget | 135 reviews

Smoked PeachNice pigmentation and glides very well just don't apply to much or the colour will become to intense and chalky looking. Looks very nice under lipstick because it's matte and not not shimmery. I think I still prefer Revlon's ColourBurst (I'm Canadian we add a u to things) and Super Lustrous a bit better because they have wider shade ranges but these are great if you prefer matte lipstick or just a natural I'm wearing lipstick but it doesn't look like it kind of look. — 3 years, 8 months agoCliniqueLover | 297 reviews

The reason being, most people are too optimistic or too pessimistic. In those rare situations where you meet the realist / pragmatist, things only get worse. They leave you confused.
Most often i have resorted to reading to keep my not so useful conversations down. I write a weekly review of the books i read (Check for Books and Me for recent reviews). These have helped readers identify books that have enhanced their work and their lives. So when i come across book lists, i generally tend to dig into them to find a few gems that i can pick for my next read. And once in a while i share the lists i read as well – so that people who love to find their gems can do so as well. So today while i was reading online, i came across two interesting lists of books. Please see if you will like the many books mentioned in each of them.
Greg’s 2012 Digital Tonto Reading List is a interesting list of books across subjects. Whatever be your interest, you are bound to find some useful and enlightening picks.

New England Revolution's big lead paves way for Jermaine Jones to make debut in "perfect game"
The New England Revolution had been rolling out the red carpet to welcome Jermaine Jones into the fold all week long.
On Saturday, the club extended that welcome by allowing him to make his MLS debut in the second half of a match that saw the Revolution cruise to a 3-0 victory over Toronto FC at BMO Field.
“Today was a perfect game,” said Jones. “The first 20 minutes was amazing and I would say there was only one team who were going to win this match and we showed it. It was easy to come in being up 3-0.”
With a front row seat for the first 65 minutes of the action, Jones saw his new club strike quickly. In the second minute of the match, Revs stalwart Lee Nguyen picked off a lazy pass by Toronto, dribbled in, and with wide open space in front of him, smoked a shot home for New England’s quickest goal of the season.
Kelyn Rowe’s 21st minute blast had New England in the right frame of mind at half and when Teal Bunbury touched home a Charlie Davies pass in the 58th minute, Jones time was nigh.
“Jermaine has been really good all week and for us,” said coach Jay Heaps. “Jermaine has been excellent with our group and we wanted to get him in there and fit him in like a training session.”

In the 65th minute, the move was made when Jones subbed on for Daigo Kobayashi in central midfield. Ranging east-to-west and north-to-south, Jones immediately showed off his skill set behind bursts of speed, great ballhandling, backtracking on defense, and even a bit of intensity when arguing a call against a teammate.
“I was happy to be back on the pitch in a game,” said Jones. “It’s always good when you get the minutes and you win them. Everybody was great today.”
Having a six-week layoff, Jones was not expected to start after just four training sessions, but getting 25 minutes, and three points, are the first small steps towards what he and the team hope will be a solid push towards the top of the table.
“I was talking to the coach before,” said Jones. “We wanted to go step-by-step. It was a long break for me and I can feel it. I need time on the pitch, of course. Today was 25 minutes, next game a little bit longer, but I will try my best to be 100% fast.”There's a juicy rumor making the rounds, but it is being reported by the New York Post, and not by some vague blog. But, it looks like KKR and Providence Equity Partners have been in discussions with EA, with the talks at "very early stages".
We've seen EA's share prices drop 37% this year, but the rumors have spiked their stock prices by close to 5.5% ,or 72 cents, seeing them hit $13.81 thanks to the talks. EA's market cap sits at around $4 billion with one source saying they would be willing to cut a deal if it were at $20 per share.
One of the weirder things going on with EA, is that they've been slowly buying back stock from investors, which could be a preemptive move if they were considering putting up a 'for sale' sign. EA hasn't only been watching their share prices tank, they've not been able to make success in the market lately. This comes down to gamers not willing to part their hard-earned cash for a new game at the current $60-or-so pricing, instead, they're jumping on mobile and casual games which can be played for free.
Smart devices are also chomping down on more market share, which has put more and more pressure on developers. EA are also not the only ones that are feeling the pinch, with Activision-Blizzard also looking for a buyer earlier this year, but the talks ended up not going anywhere. EA told the New York Post that they don't comment on rumors and speculation [of course] while Henry Kravis from KKR declined to comment.Debating the Absolute Weapon
To the degree that the history of arms control has been written at all, it has generally been told as a series of missed opportunities or "lost chances." Roosevelt's failure to take Bohr's advice and reveal the Bomb's existence to Stalin, Truman's initial hesitancy when faced with Stimson's suggestion to approach the Soviets immediately on "international control," Truman's decision over the objections of Oppenheimer and others to proceed with the H-bomb, the failure of the United States to press harder for a multiple-warhead or "MIRV" ban in the SALT I negotiations in the early 1970s--each of these has been taken as a critical turning point in the arms competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. In each case, as various writers have it, a more enlightened policy on the part of the United States--in particular, a well-timed gesture of unilateral restraint--might well have broken the "action-reaction" cycle and in this way circumvented or at least alleviated the arms race that followed.
The prototypical "missed opportunity"---indeed, perhaps the most widely studied and historically debated weapons decision of the nuclear age--was President Truman's 1950 decision to proceed with the hydrogen bomb. It is this tale of "missed opportunity" that has provided the basic model for many of the others, in part because it was understood very much in these terms at the time. The tale in brief: The General Advisory Committee (GAC), the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and a group of scientists including Oppenheimer, recommended in the fall of 1949 that the United States not go forward with the hydrogen, or

We live in a world where rape is commonly and intentionally used as a weapon of war. Where the widespread violence against women and their bodies is worldwide, and media and capitalism combine to convince women to seriously harm our own bodies. And we as Asian women have an added layer because of the double oppression of both sexism and racism.
And it is within this context that says, “According to the World Map of Average Breast Size… South Asian women are bigger with an average “B” breast cup. Go South Asians!” He does not consider the rampant violence on women’s bodies in our society, including sex trafficking, child trafficking, or domestic violence. He uses examples of soft porn as supposed science. He ends with a plea, “Please email photos of your boobs to koji[a]8asians.com. I wouldn’t say no to an inbox full of ‘research.’ ” Joking is really an excuse to say what one really wants without taking any responsibility for it..
These articles serve only to perpetuate stereotypes of Asian women and reduce us to our body parts.
By publishing these posts you are not only hurting our entire Asian community you are making your site an uncomfortable and unsafe place for women to visit.
I look forward to seeing action on this matter.

You want to establish relationships without seeming pushy or overeager. We've narrowed down three main steps to consider when working to gain online readers: comments, social media interactions, and advertising opportunities. If you hope to boost your web presence, then follow these dos and don'ts of Internet networking.
- Do identify other websites that you admire, and become an active follower of them. Comment regularly and interact with the author to let them know that you appreciate the content.
- Don't comment on other blogs and ask the writers to follow your site too. It's a bold move that can come off in a negative way. Chances are, if you leave nice comments, they're likely to click on your username anyway.
Social Media
- Do follow your favorite sites on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Note what it is that you like about their social media presence for your own web presence, and engage with their content every once in a while.
- Don't be the reader who constantly likes or replies to everything another person posts. Bottom line: you want to be an appreciative fan, not just another notification.
Advertising
- Do look into sponsorship opportunities on other websites. If one of your favorite blogs offers ad space, then get in touch to see if it's a good option for you.
- Don't sponsor each and every website you follow. Be selective about your web presence, and only associate your brand with other sites and companies whose audience may be similar to yours.

Getting the answers to basic zoning questions quickly and easily, day or night, has just gotten easier. Clearzoning, Inc., based in Lathrup Village, Michigan, has developed a new interactive zoning map that works with its Clearzoning product (a user-friendly zoning code) to not only help users find the zoning classification for individual properties, but also quickly access applicable zoning standards in a colorful, easy to understand format.
Many communities struggle with conventional zoning codes that are confusing and complicated. These old codes sometimes discourage development or result in unintended consequences. For example, some quality developers avoid communities with complicated, burdensome regulations and out-dated zoning codes.
The planning and zoning experts at Clearzoning want to change all that by revolutionizing the way local codes function. Clearzoning's president Rod Arroyo says, "Our idea is to transform zoning codes into easy-to-read, better organized, digital documents. Black and white text is replaced with colorful graphics, and hyperlinks make it easier to find just the right ordinance section that applies."
And now, the community's zoning map can also be made available online, with zoning standards just a click away. This saves staff time at the counter and adds transparency to government regulations.
Clearzoning's CEO Dave Birchler is excited about the new interactive zoning map, noting that, "Tying these two tools together will make them even easier for officials and citizens to use on a daily basis, and it can guide the development community in a more effective way."
Lathrup Village City Administrator Matt Baumgarten agrees, "Lathrup Village is on the verge of an economic development boom and being able to communicate this much information in a single click is a great advantage for us. Clearzoning remains on the cutting edge and our community is benefiting from their expertise."
Clearzoning believes that with advances in technology and widespread accessibility of the Internet, every community should be able to make their zoning ordinance, zoning map and other codes available online for easier access for the public as well as staff and officials. Clearzoning's Geographic Information Systems (GIS) specialist Sheila Starks points out that, "we developed this new mapping tool so that it can be used by any community-even if they do not currently use GIS or publish their GIS data online." Highlights of this new tool include:

From the medical community, it is termed a “learning disability”, as previously referred to; and is characterized by a difficulty-not necessarily and inability-to learn in the most standard ways that our children are educated in school. So, most specifically, this means that those experiencing the most basic symptoms of Dyslexia, experience difficulty reading, writing, and spelling.
Often, Dyslexia will manifest itself in children who seem to have problems learning the most basic functions of reading, writing, and spelling-and cannot keep information in their short and long term memories. There is no known cause associated with the condition, but there has been a link between genetics and its appearance in certain individuals.
You may be wondering, what exactly occurs in the body, when Dyslexia is present. Basically, the brain is not sending and receiving messages efficiently-and thus, receives messages of learning topics as muddled and mixed up-causing extreme confusion-and subsequent, depression and/or self-confidence issues.
The most significant misnomer about this disease or condition is that it is not signature of an un-intelligent or slow learning individual. The subject may be-conversely-very intelligent, just unable to send and receive the messages required for proper learning-efficiently. This said, a person with Dyslexia typically, just needs another way to send messages of perception and learning to their brain-i.e. another style of teaching is often necessary to bring out the individual’s learning potential.
In the long term, what does the condition, once diagnosed mean to the patient and their family? Unfortunately, Dyslexia is not something you just grow out of. Instead, it is a lifelong hindrance; but it doesn’t have to be. If diagnosed and paid attention to early in one’s childhood; with the proper teaching, lesson plans, and self awareness of how they can learn; than success can prevail for the Dyslexic patient.July 3, 2007

After all, the title of their last album was "Will Rap for Food" and featured songs like "Thugged Out Since Cub Scouts" and "Fukinwichu." Regardless, the trio of Deacon the Villain, Mr. SOS (official group member since 2002) and Kno hold it down with underground hip-hop that's as dope as it is comical.
Lest you think "Southernunderground" is another of their whimsical titles, the trio actually do hail from points due South - Kno from Atlanta, SOS from Florida, and Deacon from Kentucky. You wouldn't know it from their debut or this followup album though, because the flows sound like any East coast backpacker cult favorite - and that's definitely meant as a compliment. On the promo copy at least, the fictional DJ Billy Bob pops in with the occasional "yee-HAW!" to remind you they are from the South, a comical element one would actually miss if cut from the CD; not unlike the infamous noises of braying animals recorded into reviewer copies of a De La Soul release.
Most of the music is handled by Kno throughout, who easily qualifies as one of the underground's most underrated. The whistling melody and soft jazzy backdrop of "Appreciation" could lull you to sleep, while "The South" has a boom bap and flute dap so snazzy you'd mistake it for The Beatnuts. "Rain" is a somber track with a Kanye West feel, split into halves with different predominant instruments unified by a common tempo and haunting chorus. The sporadic work handled by outsiders neither detracts from nor upstages Kno's beats, but instead sounds so appropriate to the mix you'd mistake them for his. RJD2's work on "Seasons" featuring Masta Ace is to Kno's "Doin Alright" as Domingo's "Southernunderground" is to Kno's "War." Trying to find a flaw in the music is as difficult as trying to block out Shaquille O'Neal in the lane - no matter what, they score.
No great beats are complete without great rhymes, so Deacon and SOS live up to the high standard these tracks set in admirable fashion. Of course, it's possible some of the lyrics are so Esoteric they'd even go over 7L's head, but readers of the CoFlow/Def Jux boards are undoubtedly going to chuckle when they hear this one from "The South":
"Yeah, and I can battle rappers for cash or sell trees
But I feel like +WillHigh+, cause I just wanna drop an +El-P+
Respect when it drops if not I make your girl put her breath on my cock
while tellin her it tastes like peppermint schnapps"
It's not all jokes though, as "Doin Alright" illustrates a more serious side:
"Back in the 16th century, way WAY back in the day
Nostradamus predicted the end of the world will be on May, 5th
1999 and I don't know how
But as I'm writing this that's only one day from right now
What the fuck? I pull up, to shelter my truck
Look up - NAH, Earth ain't about to erupt
Open my door, get up, slam it shut, Marv whattup?
Let me get a bag of ice and a stack of plastic cups
For a, minute we chat bout life and alladat
Then we dap, check you out tomorrow night I'll be back
Grab a, beadie and light it, turn the key and start drivin
Back off into the night and, then I start to get frightened
Thinkin - damn! In my whole life I was just a dreamer
I never got to put on a show in a packed arena
I wanted to go on Rap City and act witty
But all I ever did was put up with hoes who act shitty
What a whack pity - damn, was I choosin a road
that didn't get me there in time and I'd be losin our globe
Hold up I'm losin control, thinkin realistically on it
What could fuck up a planet in one day without warnin?
And even if the world does end, I can't be mad at guys
Cause life coulda been much worse, at least I'm satisfied
At least my dad's alive, married to my mother
I have a sister and friends that I can call my brothers
At least I have life, some people they life is stolen
Set up for a crime but behind bars is where they hold 'em
We got kids killin kids cause Earth is cold
Women usin abortions as a form of birth control
It hurts the soul and leaves a scar on your conscience
But it's a blessing that I made it through this nonsense
So even if this would be my last night
At least when it's over I'd be doin alright"
If you think that's heavy, the second verse is about the World Trade Center. The whole vibe of the song though is ultimately that you should give up about worrying what could happen, and just live life to the fullest. That's a concept the Cunninlynguists embrace, from the raucous reminiscence of "Old School" to the straight up skills of the Cunnin crew and Masta Ace on "Seasons" to flip the script political thoughts on "Dying Nation." No matter where you tune in on "Southerunderground" you'll find a well thought out album where the craft of hip-hop arts is taken seriously even when it's made silly. By mixing the absurd, the abstract, and the absolution of a rapper's soul, the Cunninlynguists have created an album which is the paramount opposite of "sophomore slump." These sophomores get straight A's, occasionally sounding nerdy but in the process always sounding funky.

Why, you may ask, are Lori and I making a role-playing game rather than an adventure? After all, we are best know for our work at Sierra On-Line, an adventure game publisher. And our most popular games – the Quest for Glory series – looked and played a lot like other Sierra adventure games… with a few twists.
To us, those twists make all the difference. Quest for Glory are wolves in sheeps’ clothing, RPG’s in the guise of adventures.
So one answer is, we’ve never actually made a pure adventure game. Quest for Glory? RPG in adventure clothing. Shannara? Adventure game with RPG features. Castle of Dr. Brain? Educational puzzle game in an adventure game engine. Mixed-Up Fairy Tales? Children’s storybook in an adventure game setting. Our other games are even farther away from the adventure game mold.
The Trouble With Adventures. Maybe they’d ask a friend for help, but most of them were perfectly content to spend months working through the puzzles in one game.
Now things are different. People have no patience because they don’t need any. All of the answers are a few clicks away on the Internet. Unfortunately, getting a hint is a lot like eating a salted peanut – It’s impossible to stop at one.
Role-playing games have a big advantage there. Most RPG “puzzles” rely on building up your character’s abilities and using them well. You can go to a hint site to find out how to play better, but winning the game is still up to you to play. The game designer has a lot more power to control the length and difficulty of an RPG than an adventure game.
The popular first-person shooter genre is also immune to Internet hints, but Lori and I find those games boring. They rarely make you think, and they rely on fast hand-eye coordination to win. That’s fine; it’s a valid form of game play. We just don’t think it should be the only form.
What’s In a Game?
“What’s in a game? That which we call an RPG
In any other game would play as well.” – Shakesmeep
When we say that Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is an RPG, we mean that traditional RPG features are its main focus. You will explore, fight monsters, gain new skills, find items that help your character (mostly in combat), and improve your abilities through game play.
When people talk about adventure games, they mean you explore, find and use inventory items, solve puzzles, and usually talk to characters in the game.
Both types of game have quests. In truth, you can incorporate all of the elements of an RPG into an adventure game – as we did with Quest for Glory – and everything we think of as part of an adventure game greatly improve a role-playing game.
In tabletop roleplaying, the best games use all of the elements of both computer RPG’s and adventures. We think a great role-playing adventure should do the same.
The Heart of the Matter
So why are we calling Hero-U an RPG and not an adventure?
- 1. Branding – It’s a way of reaching a wider audience that might not have played classic adventure games.
- 2. Budget – We can make a better RPG-style game for less money than it would take to make a great graphic adventure.
- 3. True Love – Our hearts are in role-playing games. Lori and I met over a Dungeons & Dragons table, and we moved to Oakhurst because we wanted to develop RPG’s. We like the challenge of honing our character’s skills, learning new abilities throughout the game, and having the power to fight evil directly. It’s fun getting your frustrations out through imaginary slaughter!
So when you’re talking about Hero-U, please call it an RPG as we do. It’s ok to wink if you’re subtle about it. We don’t like to make games that fit neatly into a single category. Hero-U will have something for role-players, adventurers, questers, combatants, and puzzlers.
We want you to be too involved with playing your character’s role to worry about what kind of game you’re playing..
And that’s why we RP.
I’m sorry if you were waiting for an instant reply ; living in a different time zone, when you’re writing I’m sleeping, and vice-versa :
Thank you very much for having published my post (and corrected some of the syntax mistakes) !
I think a lot of people will contradict my statement, and that’s precisely the goal
This keeps the Kickstater project full of life and moreover help people to express their fellings about games (and therefore help you to better understantd what they’re waiting for).
I love to debate ; the only problem is that it’s REALLY a time consuming activity. However, I’ll try to clarify my demonstration as much as I can directly on the KS Update comments section.
Posted: November 5th, 2012
You speak English better than many a native American, TAHR. You made great points with your comments and they were good discussion points.
I would not have played World of Warcraft if a friend hadn’t encouraged me by telling me how much role-playing there was in the game. It had a lot of role-players flocking to the game in the beginning. It soon lost the role-playing and eventually it lost everything I enjoyed about the game. I only started playing Star Wars because my son recommended it. SW is a brilliant failure – it won’t survive long because they did not put enough time into the “Multiplayer ” part of the MMO. So I hope that I will be able to finish the stories of all my characters before SW goes belly-up. However, since I can only play a few hours every once in a while, I’m not holding my breath.
I liked “Day of the Tentacle” because I liked the quirky sense of humor and the puzzles were easy enough that I could solve them without a hint book. Alas, I really suck at Adventure Games. That’s the reason that QfG and Hero-U will be more about problem-solving than about puzzles.
Yes, it’s true that we are weighing the game play toward the “Good” side of the alignment scale. If we had more time and a bigger budget, we would balance out the sides better. But unless we get some additional funding, we are on a tight schedule for design. And so I’d rather devote more time and energy into the Hero Shawn than the Rotter Shawn.
Posted: November 5th, 2012
“I think its well-worth getting others to read and comment upon. We’re going to use this as an update starting point.”
I would be honored. Even though it would make me more ashamed of my syntax problems.
Being a native english speaker is the kind of skill I can only have in RPGs :/
“I would argue that some RPGs are all about role-playing. Star Wars: the Old Republic really goes out of its way to give your character depth, motivation, and relationships in the game. ”
I have to try this game. I must say that the fact that its based on the new trilogy of movies + the fact that it’s presented as a competitor of World of Warcraft (which to me is more a Third Personn Shooter with swords than a RPG), hasn’t kindled my curiosity like you do.
“But I didn’t enjoy the “Grim Fandango” game – the puzzles were too convoluted or obscure for me to solve without a hintbook.”
I’ve had the pleasure to finish Grim Fandango without using a hintbook.
Sure it’s a very difficult game, but it’s also the best exemple I could think of to illustrate the debate about “what makes the difference between bad (impossible to sovle) puzzles and hard puzzles”. Grim Fandango is a hard game to beat, but it’s hard to be a hero anyway 😉 And most of the best movies have the most original solutions you could think of (like climbing to the top of clock to catch the lightning because you know the exact timing
thanks to an anachronistic leaflet, and inject it via a wire and a hook into a time machine).
.”
I would add that it will be a richer game, if you can explain Shawn’s actions (good or evil) by looking at his background. I agree that is not your job to tell a RPG gamer how he would play Shawn (that would make no sense), however, due to technical limitations, and moreover due to common sense of storytelling, you still have to organise your simulated world around a certain kind of behaviour (trying to make good grades, friends and a over). You could have decided that the game would be richer if hawn would act like an absolute rotter.
This is the delicate balance we were talking about last time (between the character’s point of view and the player’s one).
Posted: November 4th, 2012
Nice demonstration, TAHR. I’d like to elevate this out of the comments ghetto. I think its well-worth getting others to read and comment upon. We’re going to use this as an update starting point.
I’ve always been a role-player. Like you say when you are doing’d love to see “Grim Fandango” as an animated movie. I really enjoyed the “Beetlejuice” cartoon of by-gone days. But I didn’t enjoy the “Grim Fandango” game – the puzzles were too convoluted or obscure for me to solve without a hintbook..
I began design for Hero-U.
Posted: November 4th, 2012
Having read “Project Update #8: Puzzling Problems and Mighty Meeps”, as well as the PC Gamer article, I’d like to share my point of view (again 😛 ) :
To me,
Role Playing Games are about problems,
and Adventure Games are about puzzles
(in the very specific way those two terms are defined in the PC Gamer article).
Why ? Because in fact,
Role Playing Games are NOT about Role Playing,
and Adventure Games are ALL about Role Playing.
Explanation :
In a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game, I AM an elf ; an elf fancied from MY imagination ; not a human playing the part of Legolas and trying to guess what Legolas would do in such a situation.
I’m not, like on a movie set, an actor learning a script and pretending to be an elf while he’s deliverings his pre-written lines.
In Sins of the Fathers, this IS where I actually play a role, the role of Gabriel Knight.
The ONLY difference with a movie is that the director doesn’t give me the script, I must guess it (what would totaly uninteresting to watch.
This post is not only about finding the right terminology, it’s about the concepts behind the labels we use. would be a new definition of “hard”.
I’m aware that Hero-U won’t necessarily match with my very specific definition of “the Best Computer RPG”, however, your project have all my support
If you see a flaw in this demonstration, please let me know…
Posted: November 4th, 2012
Exactly, TAHR, we’re trying to create a very different sort of game that incorporates all the genres by borrowing the best elements and mashing them together. Hero-U won’t be quite like any other game. Nevertheless, it will be fun to play.
Yo won’t regret checking out the MacGuffin’s Curse demo – the only complaint I had about it is that I couldn’t tell when I got to the end of it – and then I had to go get the entire game to play. Corey has played it several times now, just to appreciate the puzzle style.
Posted: October 30th, 2012
After having read “Project Update #4: Pre-Halloween Parties” and watch Andrew Goulding’s video, I’ve decided to make enquiries about MacGuffin’s Curse, which looks like a really nice puzzle game (I think I will look for a playable demo).
During my research, Google pointed at this article written by Corey : “Puzzling Under a Full Moon” ( ).
In the comments section, Corey adds :
“I’m not sure we’ve ever seen a really large number of puzzle games. A few of exceptional quality stand out – in no particular order:
-The Seventh Guest
-Lemmings
-Fool’s Errand
-Castle of Dr. Brain
-M.U.L.E.
-Tetris
-Portal
are a few that come to mind.
The nice thing about puzzle games is that they can still be fun long after their graphics and technology becomes obsolete – The point is solving the puzzles, not eye candy (although the eye candy in Seventh Guest was amazing at the time).”
That exactly confirms what I was explaining (about Puzzle games (Myst-like puzzles) VERSUS Adventures games (inventory/dialogue based puzzles). We’re on the same tune
In fact, Hero-U is the combination of 3 genres (not 2) : RPGs, Adventure games, AND Puzzle games.
It has taken me a long time to understand this.
Posted: October 27th, 2012
Thanks, Isair. Hero-U will look a bit different from the QfG games, but there will be even more story and characters than the Glory games. I’m sure that Quest fans will be pleased.
Posted: October 27th, 2012
That hand painted concept art is so beautiful, top-down dungeon too not bad at all. It remind me Albion (especially this part: ). Combination of dungeon and clasic point and click (?) adventure sounds good. Quest for Glory series is also very unique and funny after all. I wish good luck with this interesting project.
Posted: October 27th, 2012
We’re definitely ‘re-branding’ our campaign as we go along. We know that our game will appeal to a broad range of tastes. We just need to let the players know that. So for now, Hero-U is an ‘Adventure-Role-Playing’ game rather than a ‘Role-Playing Adventure’ game.
The mainstream players have little interest in a game that requires more thought than visceral reaction. Let them play Quake (or its descendents)!
Posted: October 25th, 2012
I’ve been seeing positive response to update #3 on the mix of adventure and RPG elements. Well done.
“I am thrilled by update 3 on Hero-U…glad they addressed the RPG vs Adventure concern!”
“Okay, the update got my attention back (even though I’m not backing yet).”
Posted: October 25th, 2012
I think you’re exactly right about the rarity of adventure games helping forge adventure game enthusiasts into this tight-knit backer community, who appreciate quality games enough to chip in with both funds and time. On the other hand, mainstream gamers don’t tend to show up on kickstarter in droves, because they are keeping themselves occupied with the stuff being advertised on gamespot and IGN, so why bother risking money on pre-orders?
So the more you can attract dedicated adventure gamers as backers the better, and then once the game is made those fans can see for themselves that it has the old QfG story-telling flair with a different look, you won’t need to ‘advertise’ to them any more. At that point you won’t be asking the skeptical mainstream to do pre-orders — the game will exist and you can sprinkle review copies around those big review sites that give mainstream gamers ideas on what to try.
Posted: October 24th, 2012
It occurred to me just Why the Adventure Game Community is more tightly knit than the RPGs – because Adventure Games are so rare. RP gamers, even the ones who prefer the ‘old-fashioned’ style games, can find the modern descendents of those games. They’ve been playing World of Warcraft and SWtOR. But there have been no true offspring of Adventure Games in the modern game world.
I agree with you – our target market should be the Adventure Gamer. They are the ones who will be happiest with Hero-U when they get to play it. I will point out though that LSL, Space Ventures, and Jane’s Kickstarter projects did not make all that much money. Corey and I did the math on how much it will cost them to make an Adventure Game. They will be very lucky if they ship those games without additional funding from somewhere else. And they promised exactly what the Adventure Gamers wanted to see.
Double Fine Adventures was a Black Swan. Who wouldn’t want to play another Monkey Island with Ron Gilbert designing it? Frankly, when I think of fun Adventure Games, I think of LucasArts. I think their games were more friendly and fun than most Sierra Games. In truth, at the beginning of the 90’s, Sierra on-Line was THE Adventure Game company. By the mid-90’s, the company everyone mentioned when they talked about Adventure Games was LucasArts.
If we can tap into Double Fine’s fan base and convince them that Hero-U will be fun and exciting, then we have a chance of doing more than break even with this Kickstarter.
Posted: October 23rd, 2012
Note that I’m not saying you need to commit yourself to the classic adventure game graphic style if it’s not affordable, just saying that if graphics are stated to be the only thing that is less adventure game-ish than QfG series, then it will be easier to get adventure game fans to consider looking past the graphics to the detailed story and puzzles, some of which happen to take place in a practice-dungeon setting.
Posted: October 23rd, 2012
Lori, I know it’s hard to say yet whether the RPG marketing emphasis is helping or not, but I have a preliminary impression that it’s not. I have seen a handful of Project Eternity “Obsidian Order” members, but some of those who showed up have also backed straight non-RPG adventure games (like Broken Sword or Jane Jensen). Meanwhile there are some frequent adventure-game-backers who are holding back because Hero-U is “less” adventure than Quest for Glory, and they want it to be the same mix.
The adventure game crowd on kickstarter is more tight-knit because they are so counter-mainstream (except in Germany) that they have to help fight for enough publicity to get their favorite games funded, so it could just be that I’m more aware of the missing adventure gamers than the additional RPG fans. However it’s also true that the core fans who have been inhabiting your kickstarter thread and upvoting articles are just about all in that adventure game camp (plenty with dual interest in RPGS of course).
So you might want to reconsider the core audience for the Hero-U that you want to make — it may really be adventure gamers. Adventure gamers are very appreciative of story, while the standard cRPG crowd is into lots of character customization and open-world exploration. The PE backers were into all the different classes, races, attributes, skills, avatar customization… and a large part of that customization clashes with the sort of story you want to write. So does the aspect of exploring a big world, as you’ve already explained.
I say all this as someone who appreciates both types of games: Hero-U seems like an adventure game with RPG flavor, just like QfG series. If that’s true, explicitly say so to the QfG fans who ought to love Hero-U but are currently feeling a bit abandoned in pursuit of the bigger RPG crowd.
Posted: October 23rd, 2012
Thank you, Perdoname, for your thoughtful and concerned comment. I can understand why you are upset with some of the things we have said lately. I agree with you, that comment about the “Insidious Internet” was just plain dumb. (I like the alliteration, though…)
My two favorite Adventure Games of all times are “Monkey Island” and “Day of the Tentacle.” They were fun to play and had a great sense of humor. While I don’t think anyone considers “Day of the Tentacle” to be a “beautiful” game, its art style was as quirky as its story.
However, I’ve never played a lot of adventure games. I’m not all that good at figuring out puzzles.
Andrew Goulding, our programmer, has made two games with his Brawsome Company – “MacGuffin’s Curse” and “Jolly Rover.” Jolly Rover is a traditional Adventure game, a sort of “Doggy Island” with pirates and canines. “MacGuffin’s Curse” is the most fun I’ve ever had in a pure puzzle game.
The answer to “Why is Hero-U emphasizing the RP over the Adventure” game is two-fold:
1. We want to reach an audience beyond Adventure Game players (and so we are emphasizing those aspects at the moment)
2. We can’t afford to do an Adventure Game on $400,000 dollars. Adventure Games are art and programming intensive. Realistically speaking, we can’t see putting as much game play as we plan for Hero-U in an Adventure-style perspective for under $800,000-$100,000, and we didn’t think we raise that much money on Kickstarter.
However, I ask you to look at most of the concept art we have for the game. Does this look like a sterile, boring dungeon to you?
Most of our art team really wants to do Adventure Game-style paintings and artwork. I’d love to do the whole game with this look. Realistically speaking, we can’t afford to do the whole game this way. However, we can have moments in the game that use this sort of beautiful art.
What we will do is find ways to make all our artwork beautiful – even the dungeon crawls.
But I believe that a game is more than the graphics. ‘Day of the Tentacle’ didn’t need traditional ‘Adventure Game Graphics’ to pull off a fun game. It was all about the story, puzzles, and above all, the characters.
I promise you that Hero-U will have as involving a story, quirky character interaction, and humor as any Quest for Glory. We’ll also be giving the player the opportunity to pass or fail in his Rogue Class, make friends or bitter enemies, and maybe even fall in love. There will be more things to do and puzzles to solve and, yes, monsters to outwit or destroy than any QfG game.
We don’t want to re-do what we have done in the past. We want to do more.
(So please forgive us for sometimes inserting our foot in our mouth about Adventure Games.)
Posted: October 23rd, 2012
First off, let me say that years ago I purchased (no illegal copies) Hero’s Quest 1, QFG1 VGA, QFG2, QFG3, QFG4 (including CD version) and Castle. I enjoyed all these games and found them to be exceptionally well-crafted and worth every penny and then some. Quest for Glory was one of the most memorable series of games to come out during that period.
I also want to thank you for allowing players the opportunity to provide feedback here.
So, it is with the utmost respect that I offer the following feedback.
I am extremely disappointed that you have chosen to take Hero-U in a more RPG-style direction and away from the Quest for Glory mold. I am also disappointed by what appears to be a lack of appreciation for what makes adventure games so special and unique.
You write:
“When people talk about adventure games, they mean you explore, find and use inventory items, solve puzzles, and usually talk to characters in the game.”
Wow, how sad that you reduce a truly unique gaming genre to nothing but a short list of gameplay features, which, from the way you describe them, could be found in many other kinds of games. Is that all an adventure game is to you? While it is true that some “adventure games” are more like scavenger hunts (e.g., KQ4, a very fun game, by the way), some of the best (e.g., Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island, Gabriel Knight) are immensely enjoyable because of their compelling stories, memorable humor and ingenious, story-driven puzzles. Jane Jensen has said that she prefers the term “interactive fiction” to “adventure games” because “interactive fiction” better reflects the fact that these games often work best when their necessarily linear gameplay detracts as little as possible from the pacing and delivery of the most important component in the game – the story. Adventure games (or whatever term you want to use) are more than just a handful of incidental gameplay features; adventure gamers, from what I have seen, often enjoy these games because the fun comes primarily from the strong stories and story-driven puzzles, without too much (if any) RPG-style, abstract character point building/ monotonous grunt work to distract from the plot and story mood/atmosphere.
Speaking of atmosphere, I want you to know how much I enjoyed the Sierra game engines with the many individual, unique “rooms.” These richly detailed rooms did so much to help create believable worlds and to create a particular atmosphere in a way that a minimalist, top-down perspective could never do.
I also have a problem with the way you repeat the same old cliche that adventure gamers back in the day were somehow more “patient” than adventure gamers today.
You say: …
Now things are different. People have no patience because they don’t need any.”
I don’t want to go on and on about this, but just wish to point out that this is a ridiculous notion, and I am especially disappointed to see it repeated by the creators of Quest for Glory (!). Adventure gamers were no more patient then than they are now. If they wanted to “cheat” or find walkthroughs, they could find a way to do so. Today, adventure game fans obviously have more options to cheat, but we are more than capable of resisting the urge to do so. Yes, adventure games are probably a niche market and for a particular kind of player, but there are still plenty of gamers who specifically seek out these types of games. The recent funding successes of several Kickstarter adventure titles more than backs this up. To suggest that the existence of the internet is some kind of insurmountable obstacle to creating or playing adventure games is more than a little silly.
Anyway, you guys can make the game you want to make. I have no doubt your new game will get funded and will be very well-made. Wish you great success.
However, just know that at least one fan of your previous games is disappointed that the new title will apparently (maybe I’m wrong) put a greater emphasis on more traditional RPG “dungeon crawl” and will feature a stripped-down, sterile looking game environment. Oh, why, oh, why couldn’t you have had all handpainted backgrounds. The beautiful handpainted art in the previous QFG games had a timeless quality and added a lot.
Sorry for the long comment, and thanks again for giving us the opportunity to provide feedback.
Posted: October 22nd, 2012
Precisely, TAHR.
It’s a delicate balance in game design. In QfG, we tried to go more with trying to accommodate what the player would want to do. In Hero-U, there are things that Shawn (and therefore the player) will have to do. Like go to class occasionally… Fortunately, most of the time, the player and Shawn will want to do the same things. And most of those things do not include going to class.
Posted: October 22nd, 2012
Yes, that’s one the big difficulties of combining the RPG genre and the Adventure genre : there are two points of view to mix, the (RPG) player’s one, who wants a great freedom of action, and the (adventure game) character’s one, who wants to follow his own path according to his personnality.
The balance between the two will be hard to set, but as the designers of the Quest for Glory series, you’re certainly among the most qualified game designers who can take up this chalenge.
I’m really impatient to play Hero-U.
This is definetely the kind of audacious project I want to support.
Posted: October 22nd, 2012
Ok, I agree, all game puzzles should be from the point of view of the main character. Alas, many of the early adventure games didn’t seem to be designed that way.
Seventh Guest had the most random types of puzzle, but the mood and the graphics really made the game entertaining. We played it on an extremely dark, extremely slow PC eons ago. It gave the game even more atmosphere.
With our QfG games, you could usually remove the combat and the game would still be a game. If you removed the puzzles, there would still be a story to follow and characters to talk to. Of course, the game was richer for having all of those elements working together.
With Hero-U, we want to have a more tightly integrated game. Combat won’t be something that gets in the way of gameplay and story. Combat is a means to the goal. Likewise, the puzzles will be as much a part of the combat as the story is.
As game designers, we have to ask ourselves not only “What would Shawn Do?” but also, “What would the Player do?” We need to think about the sorts of things that a player might want to do in the game, and then find ways to reward and encourage their behavior. After all, the game isn’t about us. It’s about You and about Shawn.
Posted: October 22nd, 2012
“However, under the right circumstances one could have some amount of the mechanical puzzles in a “true” adventure game, as long as it was well integrated into the detailed story… ”
I totally agree, and I like your exemple.
“I think games with an emphasis on Myst-like fancy graphics and puzzles could use a new label”
So do I. The double meaning of the “adventure game” label is confusing for a lot of people.
Actually, I sould say triple meaning because in the late 90’s Tombraider was called…. an adventure game :/
Posted: October 21st, 2012
Actually that was a brilliant explanation — I’ve said for a while there are really 2 genres both being labeled as adventure games, with Myst and Gabriel Knight being good examples of each. I think games with an emphasis on Myst-like fancy graphics and puzzles could use a new label, perhaps “exploration games” which is what Amanita Design calls their Botanica game, light on story but heavy on graphics and puzzles. However, under the right circumstances one could have some amount of the mechanical puzzles in a “true” adventure game, as long as it was well integrated into the detailed story… for instance, making a rogue reason logically to figure out how a trap works in order to disarm it.
Posted: October 21st, 2012
Lori: Again, thank you very much for having take on your time to answer. I really appreciate it
I will clarify what I mean by “Myst-like puzzles” and give you my personal point of view about this. I hope it will feed the reflection and help…
By using the term “Myst-like puzzles”, I’m not refering to pixel hunting. Pixel hunting never really bothered me. This is part of the exploration aspect of adventure games.
To me, games like Myst aren’t adventure games. They are puzzle games, just like Tetris or Puzzle Bobble. The story there is just a pretext : you can take the puzzles of Ripper an put them in The 7th Guest ; someone who never played those games won’t notice anything. You can even remove all the puzzles from The 7th Guest, and the story will still be there.
If you remove the puzzles of a “real” adventure game, like Sins of the Fathers, nothing will remain, because the puzzles ARE the story.
When you combine the objects in the inventory and then use the result on interactive elements of the backgrounds, when you’re trying to figure out what line of dialog could change the mind of this character, you’re not wondering “What would Jane Jensen do in this kind of situation ?”, but “What would Gabriel do ?”.
When you’re playing Myst and spining gears of machines to solve some mechanical enigmas, you’re not thinking of the story, you’re doing your homeworks, some kind of math & logic exercices. I’m not saying this is not fun, but to me this is not “adventure games” in the way Sierra and Lucasarts have defined the genre.
Sorry if my english is not too good ; I hope my sentences are still understable…
Speedster: If you’re still there, what is your opinion about this ? Please, correct me if I’m wrong.
Posted: October 21st, 2012
TAHR: I was never a real fan of Myst-like puzzles – they were too much like “hunt the Pixel” – I spent a lot of time just clicking on the screen to find something that actually did something useful. Our games will have puzzles that are inventory based, yes, but they are also skill based (use your stealth to avoid a nasty monster, then set a trap for it), and some are dialogue based (how do you sweet-talk that person into helping you?) The other type of puzzle we will be using are the ones from “MacGuffin’s Curse” that involve moving things and changing the layout of the dungeon so that monsters can’t gang up on you.
We’ll have plenty of variety and many different things to do in the game.
Thanks for your support! We’ll give you your money’s worth.
– Lori
Posted: October 21st, 2012
TAHR is exactly right — I have been posting that quote on threads at another adventure game forum. It gives a nice little insight into the sort of games Hero-U series will be, would be good to work it into an upcoming kickstarter update
Posted: October 20th, 2012
Hi,
Me again
I’m one of your backers now.
Thank you Lori for the reply.
Your thoughts about RPGs making sense are interesting :
-The possibility to trick big monsters instead of fighting them the kamikaze way.
-Dead rats that won’t drop magical swords and gold.
-etc.
You should put those kind of concrete exemples on your KS page.
I think that’s part of what people want to hear (and play !)… Well, in my opinion
The “sandbox” term could be as well in the description of the game. That’s a key word that speaks to a lot of players.
About the puzzles in the game, well maybe it’s my level of english, but I have some difficulties to figure out if they will be Myst-like puzzles (like in…Myst), or if the will be inventory based puzzles (like in Gabriel Knight or Space quest for exemple).
Anyway,
I wish you Good Luck !

I have to admit that I always thought of the QFG series as an RPG presented through a point-and-click adventure lens. I’m pretty sure that the back of the QFG Anthology box even outright declared that the series were role-playing games. At the time, I didn’t really understand what that meant yet so it was a bit of a shock for me when I learned that other games in the RPG genre included Final Fantasy and Shining Force, games that I loved but in an entirely different way than QFG.
I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m excited to hear that Hero-U is being envisioned as an RPG series with a Cole twist.
Posted: October 16th, 2012
Hi, TAHR, Corey and I love RPGs, and we put the RP in Adventure Games with our Quest for Glory games for Sierra On-Line. Quest for Glory 1: So You Want to Be a Hero was one of the first ‘sandbox’ designed games that gave you the freedom to run around, explore, help people, or practice your skills as you want to do.
Hero-U will be a more structured game than many RPGs. It’s got a very strong plot line and all of the qualities you expect from Adventure Games except for the “Guess the Designer’s Mind” class of puzzles. (You know that sort of puzzle – the one that you have to try everything in your inventory in hopes that some item will do something useful, even if it makes no logical sense whatsoever.)
Hero-U will have turn-based combat that will be more like “Hmmmm…A big nasty monster that can chew me to pieces… How do I trick it into falling into that pit?” rather than “Hack and Slash anything that moves.” It won’t have the ability to loot a dead rat to find a magical sword and twenty gold pieces. We like our games to make sense.

Heheh… I’m just reminded of how me and my brother think of what RPG stands for. I see it as Role Playing Game and he sees it as Rocket Propelled Grenade.
That amusing tidbit aside, that’s propably a good move. Even though Hero-U will blur the genres, there is a much bigger market for RPG’s (the nonexplosive kind).

Hi,
“The Andromedan Post” brought me here.
I just want to say :
If you ever succeed in combining in one single game the simulated freedom of RPGs (like Elder Scrolls) and the interactive brillant writing of some adventure games (like the Gabriel Knight saga), you will definitely be my gods.
I’m probably one of your future backers. Just need to know more details about the gameplay ; I’m waiting for the KS page to be launched and to see more about this promising project.
Thank you.

The internet can be used to hack through a lot of different types of games, really. I’ve never had the problem of requiring walkthroughs for Adventure games, having played them extensively all my life. I think one thing that helps make them work is when they use some kind of bare hint system to keep you on track, because as much as we want to be forced to think, being stuck for an hour is annoying. The Tex Murphy game strike me as one of the most effective uses of this approach.
The important thing is for you two to make the game you are driven to create. I personally never felt you needed to explain yourself on that.

For getting rid of the snow that has accumulated on our cars we can use a snow broom. This broom is used to make sure that any snow that is found on your car can be taken off without any damage to the car.
Unlike other snow removal items the snow broom can brush the snow off the windows and body of the car and the outside paint will not have any scratches showing as a result. The snow broom is made from polyethylene foam that has been molded into the form of a soft brush. As the brush is made from polyethylene that is very durable you will not find this snow broom breaking due to cold weather.
Since many people need a safe way to remove the snow from their cars there are many companies that make snow brooms. All of these snow brooms feature the ability to remove snow from various surfaces like store awnings, pool covers and all types of vehicles. The added benefit of using a snow broom is that you are sweeping the snow away from you.
At this point you are probably wondering how a snow broom can reach across a car and brush the snow away from you? You will find that many of the snow brooms have a telescopic handle. This simply means that you can extend the snow broom to the length that you want. Therefore when you are brushing the snow off the car or other surfaces you can just stay on the other side of where the snow will fall.
When you are choosing a snow broom you should look for one where the head of the broom is recessed. This will let you carry out the business of clearing the snow without any worries about the broom head scratching the exterior surface of your car or any other item that you are clearing free of snow.
There are other facts that you should look for in a good quality snow broom. These requirements will include a detachable broom head, telescoping handle and soft yet durable polyethylene foam head. One other item that many car owners would like is that of a snow broom that you can take with you wherever you travel.
Since many of these requirements are valid ones you will need to look for a snow broom that fulfills all of the requirements that you may have. When you have found the perfect snow broom you will need to buy and take it home with you to begin clearing away the snow from your car – quickly and easily.Nainitaal is peaceful hideout.

Good for 2 days trip to view Natural Beauty.

very picturesque hill station , and centrally located lake and some nice view points. Not much to do , so ideal is a day visit .
There is a night train from delhi to kathgodham. From Kathgodham you could hire a taxi to reach Nanital. As a touristy place, naturally its very crowded. However, if you chose to stay on the other side of the lake(opposite to nanital city) its better as the place is less crowded.

US Department of Labor's OSHA cites roofing contractor in Newton, Kan.,
for repeatedly exposing workers to fall hazards and other violations
WICHITA, Kan. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Adrian Torres, doing business as A & E Roofing in Newton, with two serious and four repeat violations for exposing workers to fall and other hazards at a Wichita-area worksite. Proposed penalties total $58,200.
OSHA initiated its inspection in February 2011 when employees of the company were observed performing residential roofing work with no means of fall protection.
"There is no excuse for employees to be exposed to fall hazards such as these. Employees working at heights must be protected," said Charles E. Adkins, OSHA's regional administrator in Kansas City, Mo. "All employers, and especially those in high-hazard industries such as roofing, must take the necessary steps to eliminate hazards from the workplace."
The serious citations allege that the employer did not have an accident prevention plan and allowed employees to work in areas with a possible danger of head injury without wearing protective helmets. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.
The repeat citations allege a lack of fall protection for employees working at heights, a lack of necessary training on fall hazards, improper use of ladders and a lack of training on the proper use of ladders. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The company was cited for similar hazards in September and November of 2007.

Editor’s Note: This is the second of a two-part series
On May 2, 2008, Matt Mulligan was signed as a rookie free agent by the Miami Dolphins. His career in the NFL had started.
He would bounce around the league, from Miami, to the Tennessee Titans, New York Jets, St. Louis Rams and Green Bay Packers before he finally came home to the New England where he currently plays for the Patriots.
When he and his wife Stephanie found out he was going to play in New England, the couple was thrilled. Stephanie also grew up in Maine, and attended the University of Maine at the same time as her husband. Their paths didn’t cross, however, until after college when Mulligan’s agent introduced them.
“We were ecstatic to come here,” Mulligan said. “I was just praying to have a job, and now I get to play for such a pristine organization.”
An added bonus is that the majority of Stephanie’s family now lives in Rhode Island and often turns out for Mulligan’s games in Foxboro. Having his family so close and supportive in invaluable, he said.
“It’s incredibly important,” Mulligan said. “My mother and church in Lincoln (Maine) brought me up. They genuinely care about you as an individual. My mother was instrumental in teaching me that it doesn’t matter what you do, who you are ... my church and family molded and shaped me and my father still teaches me how to be a man.”
And it is support that has gotten Mulligan this far. It has been the ability of others who have seen his potential over the years that have pushed him forward to take the risks.
“I believe everything has been orchestrated for me,” he said. “It’s been an incredible blessing.”
Mulligan and his wife Stephanie experienced another blessing earlier this year when they welcomed their first child, Clara, into the world. When asked if he would put his daughter seven-month old daughter in sports at an early age, he said no.
“Kids should be able to do what they want to. If (Clara) likes to do it, sure I’ll encourage it. But I see kids burn out when they do too much,” he said.
And if anyone can say it doesn’t matter when you first swing the bat or pick up the ball, it’s Mulligan. Friedberg said the fact that Mulligan started football later has served him well.
“He’s going on a seven-year NFL career when the average career is three years,” Freidberg said. “Because he didn’t play the sport growing up the years of abuse have not taken a toll on his body.”
Mulligan said especially in a physical sport like football, it’s okay to start later.
Page 2 of 2 - “If you are an athlete you will be able to pick up the sport,” he said, adding that kids playing sports need to remember to rest their bodies. “Even in the pros, athletes need a break.”
And when on break, the Mulligans often head to Maine, where they have a house in Lincoln.
“It’s one of the last places in life where you can get away. There is no traffic, one street light ... sometimes I love seeing more deer than people. I love the area. People are laid back and really hard workers. Hard workers are everywhere but they are definitely hard workers in Maine,” he said.
Mulligan can add himself to the list of hard-working Mainards. Some may say it was luck while others argue it was his natural athletic ability; but there is no denying that hard work played a role in where Mulligan ended up.
“My biggest thing is no regrets, if you want to become something ... just give it a try. If it doesn’t work out, something else will come down the line that’s better suited for you,” Mulligan said. “Work hard and go for it. Good things will happen.”
And now that his teammate and starting tight end Rob Gronkowski is out with a season-ending knee injury, Mulligan will once again have the chance to demonstrate to fans just how far hard work can take you. With Gronkowski out, Mulligan took the field at tight end. Instead of trying to run through a Browns defender, he instead attempted to lift his 275-pound frame up and over for yardage. When asked if he was channeling his inner Gronk on the play he said, “I do my own thing, but hopefully Gronk would be proud.”
And a lot of people are proud, especially those back in his home state of Maine.
Coach Price, the first to take a chance on a big, athletic kid who never played a down of football, said he while he would like to take the credit for jump starting his former player’s successful career, he admits the credit belongs to only one person — Mulligan.
“He is a high quality person, it is simply incredible how far he has taken his career,” Price said. “He hasn’t lost who he was and were he comes from. He is not conceited and very humble. There is no magical pill for success, it’s about hard work, loyalty and showing up everyday. That is what Matt is all about. We love Matt and love what he’s done, there is no human being more deserving to be where he’s at than Matt Mulligan.”

We recently asked four Haverford alumni who work at Google to talk about how college helped to prepare them for their careers. Peter Allen and Joe Malin (both HC '78), Aaron Kaliner (HC '97) and John Saroff (HC '98) all participated in the interview, which took place, as one would expect, via a round-robin instant messaging conversation using Google Chat.
HC: Hi friends
Peter: Hi
Aaron: Hi
Peter: Welcome to Google
John: Hello!
Joe: Hi!
HC: Thanks so much for agreeing to do this. I can't tell you how jazzed we all are. Your fellow alums are going to love it!
Aaron: Good stuff.
Joe: I think the honor is all _mine_.
HC: So, I’m not sure if you all know each other, but could you all tell what you studied at Haverford and when you graduated?
Aaron: I graduated in 1997 with a history degree.
Peter: Sure. 1978 (same as Joe, but we never knew one another very well). English and Classics.
Joe: This is Joe. I was originally class of 1975, but I graduated in 1978. I studied Chemistry (one reason I never met Peter).
Peter: Yup, didn't do any chemistry in college...
John: I was 1998, History (I think that Aaron and I were in Roger Lane's Western Civ together)
Aaron: Great class -- wish I could go back in time.
Joe: Oh yeah! For one thing, I'd make much better friends with Emo (Steve Emerson, HC’s new president), he was only one year ahead of me, and with Barry (Barry Zubrow, Chairman of the Board of Managers), who was in my original class!
HC: LOL! How is each of you involved with Google?
Peter: We're Googlers! Maybe you wanted a more specific answer...
Aaron: I'm the Manager of our Google Publisher Solutions Team in NYC -- joined the company in late 2005.
Joe: Good point. First and foremost I'm a Googler. I am also an information engineer for internal documentation in Mountain View. I joined in late 2006.
Peter: I am the director of Google University (very much a work in progress). Joined Google last April.
John: I'm a Strategic Partner Development Manager on our TV team in New York - joined in early 2007.
John: (if you can figure out what any of us actually does by our title - free prize!)
HC: I was just going to ask!
Aaron: am I the longest running Haverford employee at Google? It's amazing that two years here makes me a long-timer.
Peter: Another free prize awarded.
"Haverfoogler"?
Joe: Forgler
Peter: Sounds vaguely criminal.
Joe: Squirgler
Peter: I think we may be having more fun than you intended...
Joe: LOL
Aaron: Just to give some context, we call ourselves Googlers and new employees Nooglers.
Joe: It's part of Google culture
HC: Fun is great! We like fun.
So really what is Publisher Solutions? Or Google University?
Aaron: Google Publisher Solutions is a team focused on providing web publishers with a variety of monetization options. (Believe it or not, we use the word "monetization" a lot around here – definitely never used that word at Haverford.) Basically, we work with big websites on advertising-related partnerships.
Peter: Hmm. Well, Google University focuses on developing innovative education for Googlers in a variety of areas, from leadership and people management to basic business and professional skills.
HC: Is it targeted toward Nooglers, Peter?
Peter: We do Noogler orientation, but also have programs for folks at every level.
Peter: This is all very new - it just started last spring - so we're planning and building at the same time. Someone described it as "building the airplane while flying it."
HC: Is Google a lot like that, flying while building?
Aaron: No question about it -- with so much experimentation throughout the company, it's a constant juggling act.
John: Absolutely. Exhilarating and windy at the same time.
Aaron: It all seems to come together though.
Peter: And particularly if you think about how new the company is - and how much we've grown...
Joe: I would say that we have a bias towards action. Let's do something instead of talking about it.
John: Build early, iterate often.
Peter: Well ... we assume we can't find the perfect solution the first time out, in isolation. Part of the "iteration" process is getting feedback from the market - and from within and adjusting as you go. from the market - and the company -
Joe: Peter is right.
HC: How is that kind of culture/attitude different than other places you've worked?
Joe: OY! Yes. I've worked for about 6 or 7 Silicon Valley companies, including both startups and powerhouses (HP, Oracle). Google has the most brilliant, forward-looking culture of all of them.
Aaron: I've always been impressed with the way decisions get made here -- it's such a consensus-based culture. Reminds me of Haverford.
Peter: Except faster!
John: Great point, Aaron. It's totally different from other places. I've worked at two other companies (a traditional NYC law firm and a "big media" company) and the pace here is much faster and much more forward-looking.
Joe: Yes, fast consensus. HP (the old Bill and Dave HP) was consensus too, but very slow and traditional.
Joe: I find it very motivating.
HC: And so how did your experiences at Haverford help prepare you?
Peter: I'd say Haverford was helpful in teaching me how to think, how to write, how to learn ... and how to be respectful of other people's opinions.
Joe: At Haverford, nobody told me what to think. They always asked "What do you think?" And also, "do you agree with this writer, and if not, why?"
John: I think Haverford got me ready to be really participatory - no place to hide in small environments like HC (socially or academically) and much the same skills are required at Google. Know your stuff, have an opinion, and advocate it.
Aaron: I was on a few different committees at Haverford and saw how it was a great model for decision-making (if a bit slow). By forcing everyone to come to consensus, you had to learn to listen, think creatively, respect other people and move forward.
Joe: Excellent point, John! I agree. At Google it's never "somebody else's job", it's _yours_. We are all the company.
Peter: Which is not so different from Haverford - the sense of collective responsibility and ownership
Aaron: That's true -- at Haverford, if you saw a problem, you were empowered to do something about it. Same with Google.
Joe: Haverford also gave me a very participatory education in science. I deal with very technical issues here, and it helps to have analytical training.
Aaron: I do think Google has a very open culture -- our executive group encourages open questions, critical thinking, constructive criticism -- similar to what I remember from Haverford.
Joe: Well, we have regular meetings that gather various levels of the company. It's accepted that people will ask important questions and expect good answers.
Peter: Another interesting thing - and this chat shows it - I've never worked anywhere where written communication is so important. How well you deal with e-mail (both volume and quality) really matters.
Aaron: Also, it's pretty typical that we're running this interview through a Google chat -- so many decisions get made quickly online in small groups.
Peter: Folks, with regret, I have to head to another meeting. Please let us know when this is published, and thanks for the opportunity.
HC: Peter, thanks so much! I'll keep you in the loop!
Peter has left
John: When we have X-Functional Meetings of any size with product, engineering, sales, business development - it really is important to pitch your ideas with the same critical thinking that we learned at Haverford and to really LISTEN to the feedback that comes from the audience
Joe: I learned the value of information and communication at Haverford. I studied science, but my writing was as important as my other work. Which is why I went from software engineering to technical writing!
HC: Do you all have any advice for HC students as their considering career paths?
Joe: Study hard, come to Google. Especially people in computer science. Or not. Go do what you really love doing. You'll be richer for it, and you _will be successful_.
John: The company I work for didn't exist 10 years ago and my job didn't exist 10 months ago. Follow your passions (in my case media) and be prepared to find interesting challenges in places you wouldn't expect them.
Joe: Good point, John. I've been working in Silicon Valley for 26 years, but only 2 years at a time doing the same thing.
Aaron: I would definitely recommend that students reach out to alumni, but make sure you're prepared for the conversation. Think ahead of time about what you want to get out of our time together.
John: I would REALLY emphasize your point. COME PREPARED. I want to help students very much, but they've got to come prepared and smart about what they want and are willing to work hard and use critical thinking
Aaron: Also, I think that people from Haverford tend to overlook sales as a great career opportunity. I didn't consider it when I graduated, and now I'd strongly suggest a sales role to anyone with good communication skills, who enjoys working with people and is goal-oriented.
Joe: I hope that HCers don't overlook anything as a career.
HC: Sage advice, really! I want to thank you all so much!
Joe: our time was too short...
Aaron: thanks.
Joe: Say hello to Emo for me, maybe he remembers me after all these years...
HC: oh I will definitely do that
John: he is super impressive - great to have him on board!
Joe: oh yes. I was totally blown away when that was announced, as in "Hey! I _KNOW HIM_! :) I also think he was the smartest person I ever met at H'ford
John: I'm Co-Chairing my 10 year reunion in May - so we'll see you there!
Joe: Kewl!

(800) 927-7671disclosure: I received the necklace to review and one to giveaway. No other compensation has been given. My opinions are my own and I always have my own opinions anyways.
I received the cutest necklace from Dogeared Jewelry via Zappos.com the other day. It has a little gold dipped heart dangling from an 18″ chain with a lobster claw closure…which makes it much easier to put on and take off. It retails for $60.
I didn’t think I would love it as much as I do. It’s typically not my taste. But, I put it on immediately and haven’t taken it off since. It’s adorable. Seriously.
The necklace can be found on Zappos.com. A site which I’m sure pretty much all of us are familiar with for shoes, bags, clothing and accessories ranging in every price. Make sure you check out the other Dogeared Jewelry products!
Anywhoo, I have a quick little Mothers Day giveaway. You can win this exact necklace. Keep it or give it to someone, I dunno. It’s really darling though.
This giveaway ends this Sunday, May 5th at midnight. That should give enough time to receive the necklace before Mothers Day.
disclosure again because that’s how the FTC wants it: same holds true what i said up at the top of this post. I received a necklace. Nothing else. My opinions weren’t swayed because they never are. You’re welcome.
Pick me!!
Love the Silver Moroccan Earrings.

mp3 - download>Click here to listen to the post-match audio of Wollongong Hawks coach Gordie McLeod and captain Mat Campbell The 'Cats were disappointed with last Friday night's loss to Adelaide and only managed 13 points in the first quarter against Wollongong, but after that hit back hard with a 33-point second quarter and then responded tremendously to a fight back from the Hawks early in the last period.
Wollongong tied up scores at 66-all with just under seven minutes to go, but the Wildcats took over with the next 10 points, and then back-to-back threes to Kevin Lisch and Shawn Redhage to secure the 16-point victory.
The win was the 12th consecutive in Perth for the Wildcats against Wollongong with the Hawks now still not having won in The Jungle since November 5, 2005.
The win improves the 'Cats to 4-1 on the season ahead of road games to Gold Coast and Cairns next week, and then away trips also to Melbourne and Wollongong the next weekend.
Kevin Lisch top-scored for the Wildcats with 17 points to go with six assists and five rebounds.
Brad Robbins was outstanding in the absence of Damian Martin with 16 points, six assists and six steals.
He also nailed 2-of-2 from beyond the arc and 7-of-8 from the field.
Luke Nevill played his best game in Wildcats' colours also with 13 points and five rebounds.
Shawn Redhage hit 12 points, seven rebounds, three assists and three steals.
Jesse Wagstaff scored nine points and pulled in five boards.
Matt Knight had six points to go with 10 rebounds as well.
Cam Tovey had five points and NBL debutant Everard Bartlett hit four points in the first 12 minutes of his career after signing during the week as a replacement for the injured Martin.
Greg Hire also scored three points in five and-a-half minutes and Drew Williamson hit two points.
Wildcats coach Rob Beveridge was delighted in the end with how his team responded from last week's loss and then the first quarter against the Hawks.
"They play a type of defence that makes you second guess, and doubt, yourself with a lot of switching and sagging off.
That really gets in the players' head and it's a real mental thing.
We just didn’t play assertive enough in that first quarter and that's why we only scored 13 points," Beveridge said.
"Obviously we made those adjustments, came out a lot more assertive and to finish with 87 points after 13 in the first quarter shows that we adjusted to that and did a lot better job.
It was all about defence this week because we put on a poor performance last week, but tonight we were very good.
"We were playing against one of the best half-court teams who can execute and I thought we did a tremendous job defensively.
We probably got caught up in their half-court game and for us to grind it out, and pull it out how we did in the end was very pleasing.
" The Wildcats got the opening basket of the game on a strong post move from Robbins, but then Wollongong was able to open up an 8-2 advantage following back-to-back threes from Rhys Martin.
Knight, Tovey and debutant Bartlett helped the 'Cats back within one, but five points straight late in the quarter for Wollongong through Mat Campbell gave the visitors a four-point quarter-time advantage.
Nevill started the second quarter on fire for the Wildcats with eight points in 2min 5secs to start off and put the 'Cats back on top.
Another three from Campbell soon after saw the Hawks regain the advantage, but after back-to-back buckets from Robbins the Wildcats led the rest of the half.
That included a three from Redhage and another on the half-time buzzer to Lisch as the Wildcats took a 46-37 advantage into the main break.
After an open three to Robbins to start the second half the Wildcats' advantage was all of a sudden out to double-figures and stayed around that mark for most of the third period.
It was back out to 10 again when Bartlett nailed a three, but Showron Glover helped Wollongong back to within six by three quarter-time.
Wollongong hit back early in the last quarter breaking even when Glover hit a three-pointer, but that sparked the 'Cats into action.
Tovey and Robbins hit baskets, Redhage a free-throw, Robbins a three and then Redhage a two on a 10-0 run.
After a score to Glover for Wollongong, Lisch and Redhage hit consecutive threes and the Wildcats went on to win by 16 points.
The Wildcats now play Gold Coast next Saturday night and Cairns on Sunday before returning to Perth, and then flying back over east to face Melbourne on November 18 and Wollongong two days later.
Perth Wildcats 87 (Kevin Lisch 17, Brad Robbins 16, Luke Nevill 13)

This article focuses on how to set up templates, groupings, and the naming structure. However, creating a robust monitoring system involves much more.
In this article, we will learn the following:
- Setting up and maintaining the configuration files that can grow along with your IT monitoring system
- Configuring the dependencies for easier root cause analysis of IT problems
- Creating the templates for easier management of similar hosts and services
- Using the custom variables for easier customization of objects
- What flapping is and how it works
Creating maintainable configurations
Enormous effort is required to deploy, configure, and maintain a system that monitors your company's IT infrastructure. The configuration for several hundred machines can take months. The effort required will also depend upon the scope of hosts and services that should be tracked—the more precise the checks need to be, the more the time needed to set these up.
If your company plans to monitor a wide range of hosts and services, you should consider setting up a machine dedicated to Nagios that will only take care of this single job. Even though a small Nagios installation consumes little resources, as it grows, Nagios will start using more resources. If you set it to run on the same machine as business-critical applications, it can lead to problems. Therefore, it is always best to set up a dedicated Nagios box, even if this is on a slower machine, right from the beginning.
Very often, a good approach is to start with monitoring only critical parts of your network, such as routers and main servers. You can also start off with only making sure that essential services are working—DHCP, DNS, file sharing, and databases are good examples of what is critical. Of course, if your company does not use file servers or if databases are not critical to the production environment, you can skip these. The next step would be to set up parenting and start adopting more hosts. At some point, you will also need to start planning how to group hosts and services. In the beginning, the configuration might simply be definitions of people, hosts, and services. After several iterations of setting up more hosts and services to be monitored, you should get to a point where all of the things that are critical to the company's business are monitored. This should be an indication that the setting up of the Nagios configuration is complete.
As the number of objects grows, you will need to group them. Contacts need to be defined as groups, because if your team consists of more than one to two people, they will likely rotate over time. So, it's better to maintain a group than change the people responsible for each host individually. Hosts and services should be grouped for many reasons. It makes viewing the status and infrastructure topology on the web interface much easier. Also, after you start defining escalations for your objects, it is much easier to manage these using groups.
You should take some time to plan how group hosts and services should be set up. How will you use the groupings? For escalations? For viewing single host groups via the web interface? Learn how you can take advantage of this functionality, and then plan how you will approach the setup of your groups.
If your network has common services, it is better to define them for particular groups and only once—such as the SSH server for all Linux servers and Telnet for all AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) machines, which is an IBM operating system that is mainly used by IBM enterprise-level servers. It is possible to define a service only once, and tell Nagios to which hosts or host groups the service should be bound. By specifying that all Linux servers offer SSH, and all AIX servers offer telnet, it will automatically add such services to all of the machines in these groups. This is often more convenient than specifying services for each of the hosts separately.
In such cases, you should either set up a new host group or use an existing one to keep track of the hosts that offer a particular service. Combined with keeping a list of host groups inside each host definition, this makes things much easier to manage—disabling a particular host also takes care of the corresponding service definitions.
It is also worth mentioning that Nagios performs and schedules service checks in a much better way than it does host checks—the service checks are scheduled in a much better way. That is why it is recommended that you do not schedule host checks at all. You can set up a separate service for your hosts that will send a ping to them and report how many packets have returned and the approximate time taken for them to return.
Nagios can be set up to schedule host checks only if one of the hosts is failing (that is, it is not responding to the pings). A host will be periodically checked until it recovers. In this way, problems with hosts will still be detected, but host checks will only be scheduled on demand. This will cause Nagios to perform much better than it would if regular checks of all hosts on your network are made. To disable regular host checks, simply don't specify the check interval for the hosts that you want checked only on demand.
Configuring the file structure
A very important issue is how to store all our configuration files. We can put every object definition in a single file, but this will not make it easy to manage. It is recommended to store different types of objects in separate folders.
Assuming your Nagios configuration is in /etc/nagios, it is recommended that you create folders for all types of objects in the following manner:
/etc/nagios/commands /etc/nagios/timeperiods /etc/nagios/contacts /etc/nagios/hosts /etc/nagios/services
Of course, these files will need to be added to the nagios.cfg file. After having followed the instructions while installing Nagios 4, these directories should already be added to our main Nagios configuration file.
It would also be worthwhile to use a version control mechanism such as Git (visit), Hg (Mercurial, visit) or SVN (Subversion, visit) to store your Nagios configuration. While this will add overhead to the process of applying configuration changes, it will also prevent someone from overwriting a file accidentally. It will also keep track of who changed which parts of the configuration, so you will always know whom to blame if things break down.
You might consider writing a simple script that will perform an export from the source code repository into a temporary directory, verify that Nagios works fine by using the nagios -v command and only if that did not fail, we will copy the new configuration in place of the older one and restart Nagios. This will make deployment of configuration changes much easier, especially in cases where multiple people are managing it.
As for naming the files themselves—for time periods, contacts, and commands, it is recommended that you keep single definitions per file, as in contacts/nagiosadmin.cfg. This greatly reduces naming collisions and also makes it much easier to find particular object definitions.
Storing hosts and services might be done in a slightly different way—host definitions should go to the hosts subdirectory, and the file should be named the same as the hostname, for example, hosts/localhost.cfg. Services can be split into two different types and stored, depending on how they are defined and used.
Services that are associated with more than one host should be stored in the services subdirectory. A good example is the SSH service, which is present on the majority of systems. In this case, it should go to services/ssh.cfg, and use host groups to associate it with the hosts that actually offer connection over this protocol.
Services that are specific to a host should be handled differently. It's best to store them in the same file as the host definition. A good example might be checking the disk space on partitions that might be specific to a particular machine, such as checking the /oracle partition on a host that's dedicated to Oracle databases.
For handling groups, it is recommended to create files called groups.cfg, and define all groups in it, without any members. Then, while defining a contact, host, or group, you can define to which groups it belongs by using the contactgroups, hostgroups, or servicegroups directives accordingly. This way, if you disable a particular object by deleting or commenting out its definition, the definition of the group itself will still work.
If you plan on having a large number of both check command and notify command definitions, you may want to split this into two separate directories—checkcommands and notifycommands. You can also use a single commands subdirectory, prefix the file names, and store the files in a single directory, for example, commands/check_ssh.cfg and commands/notify_jabber.cfg.
Defining the dependencies
It is a very common scenario that computers, or the applications they offer, depend on other objects to function properly. A typical example is a database on which an e-mail or web server will depend. Another one is a host behind a private network that depends on an OpenVPN service to work. As a system administrator, your job is to know these relations—if you plan to reinstall a database cluster, you need to let people know there will be downtime for almost all applications. Nagios should also be aware of such relations.
In such cases, it is very useful for system monitoring software to consider these dependencies. When analyzing which hosts and services are not working properly, it is good to analyze such dependencies and discard things that are not working because of other failures. This way, it will be easier for you to focus on the real problems. Therefore, it allows you to get to the root cause of any malfunction much faster.
Nagios allows you to define how hosts and services depend on each other. This allows very flexible configurations and checks, and distinguishes it from many other less advanced system monitoring applications. Nagios provides very flexible mechanisms for checking hosts and services—it will take all dependencies into account. This means that if a service relies on another one to function properly, Nagios will perform checks to make sure that all dependent services are working properly. In case a dependent service is not working properly, Nagios may or may not perform checks and may or may not send out any notifications, depending on how the dependency is defined. This is logical, because the service will most probably not work properly if a dependent object is not working.
Nagios also offers the ability to specify parents for hosts. This is, in a way, similar to dependencies, as both specify that one object depends on another object. The main difference is that parents are used to define the infrastructure hierarchy. Parent definitions are also used by Nagios to skip checks for hosts that will obviously be down. Dependencies, on the other hand, can be used to suppress notifications about the problems that are occurring due to dependent services being down, but they do not necessarily cause Nagios to skip checking a particular host or service. Another difference is that parents can only be specified for hosts, whereas dependencies can be set up between hosts and services.
Dependencies also offer more flexibility in terms of how they are configured. It is possible to specify which states of the dependent host or service will cause Nagios to stop sending out notifications. You can also tell Nagios when it should skip performing checks, based on the status of the dependent object.
Dependencies might also be valid only at certain times, for example, a back-up service that needs to monitor your system all of the time, but that needs to have access to networked storage only between 11 PM and 4 AM.
To aid in describing how objects depend on each other, Nagios documentation uses two terms—master and dependent objects. When defining dependency, a master object is the object that needs to be working correctly in order for the other object to function. Similarly, the dependent object is the one that needs another object in order to work. This terminology will be used throughout this article, to avoid confusion.
Creating the host dependencies
Let's start with host dependency definitions. These are objects that have several attributes, and each dependency can actually describe one or more dependencies, for example, it is possible to tell Nagios that 20 machines rely on a particular host in a single dependency definition.
Here is an example of a dependency specifying that during maintenance, a Windows backup storage server in another branch depends upon a VPN server.
define hostdependency { dependent_host_name backupstorage-branch2 host_name vpnserver-branch1 dependency_period maintenancewindows }
The following table describes all of the available directives for defining a host dependency. Items in bold are required when specifying a dependency:
The question is where to store such dependency files. As for service definitions, it is recommended that you store dependencies specific to a particular host in the file containing the definition of the dependent host. For the previous example, we would put it in the hosts/backupstorage-branch2.cfg file.
When defining a dependency that will describe a relationship between more than one master or dependent host, it's best to put these into a generic file for dependencies—for example, we can put it in hosts/dependencies.cfg. Another good option is to put the dependency definitions that only affect a single master host in the master host's definition.
If you are defining a dependency that covers more than one master or dependent host, it is best to use host groups to manage the list of hosts that should be included in the dependency's definition. This can be one or more host group names, and very often, these groups will also be the same as for the service definitions.
Creating the service dependencies
Service dependencies work in a similar way as host dependencies. For hosts, you need to specify one or more master hosts and one or more dependent hosts; for services, you need to define a master service and a dependent service.
Service dependencies can be defined only for a single service, but on multiple hosts. For example, you can tell Nagios that POP3 services on the emailservers host group depend on the LDAP service on the ldapserver host.
Here is an example of how to define such a service dependency:
define servicedependency { host_name ldapserver service_description LDAP dependent_hostgroup_name emailservers dependent_service_description POP3 execution_failure_criteria c,u notification_failure_criteria c,u,w }
The following table describes all available directives for defining a service dependency. Items in bold are required when specifying a dependency:
As in the case of host dependencies, there is a question of where to store the service dependency definitions. A good answer to this is that store dependencies in the same files where the dependent service definitions are kept. If you are following the previous suggestions regarding how to keep services in the file structure, then for a service bound to a single host, both service and the related dependencies should be kept in the same file as the host definition itself. If a service is used by more than one host, it is kept in a separate file. In this case, dependencies related to that service should also be kept in the same file as the service.
Using the templates
The templates in Nagios allow you to create a set of parameters that can then be used in the definitions of multiple hosts, services, and contacts. The main purpose of the templates is to keep parameters that are generic to all objects, or a group of objects, in one place. This way, you can avoid putting the same directives in hundreds of objects, and your configuration is more maintainable.
Nagios allows an object to inherit from single or multiple templates. The templates can also inherit from other templates. This allows the creation of very simple templates, where objects inherit from a single template as well as complex templating system, where actual objects (such as services or hosts) inherit from multiple templates. It is recommended to start with a simple template. Multiple templates are more useful when monitoring larger number of hosts and services across multiple sites.
It is also good to start using templates for hosts and services, and decide how they should be used. Sometimes, it is better to have one template, inherit another, and create a hierarchical structure. In many cases, it is more reasonable to create hosts so that they use multiple templates. This functionality allows the inheritance of some options from one template and some parameters from another template. The following is an illustration of how the templates can be structured using both techniques:
This example illustrates how the templates can be structured using both hierarchy and multiple templates inheritance. The preceding diagram shows how to use templates for host definitions. Similar rules apply for services as well, but the inheritance structure might be quite different.
In both of the methods shown in the preceding diagram, there is a distinction between critical and non-critical servers. Hosts are also split into ones that are Unix-based and ones that are Windows-based. There is also a distinction between the two branches that are configured—Miami and LA (Los Angeles). Furthermore, there is also a generic-host template that is used by every other template.
Usually, such distinctions make sense, because Windows and Unix boxes might be checked differently. Based on the operating system and the location of the machine, different people should be assigned as contacts in case of problems. There may also be different time periods during which these hosts should be checked.
The example on the left shows the inheritance of one type of parameter at a time. First, a distinction is made between critical and non-critical machines. Usually, both types have different values for the notification and check intervals, as well as the number of checks to perform before generating a notification for a problem. The next step is to differentiate between Windows- and Unix- based servers—this might involve the check command to verify that a server is up. The last step is to define templates for each system in both of the branches (Miami and LA). The actual host definition inherits from one template in the final set of templates.
The example on the right uses a slightly different approach. It first defines different templates for Unix and Windows systems. Next, a pair of templates for critical and noncritical machines is also defined. Finally, a set of templates defines the branches Miami and LA. The actual host definition inherits templates for the operating system, for the level of criticality and for the branch to which it belongs. It inherits parameters partially from each of the templates.
In both cases, attributes that are passed at different levels are the same, even though the approach is different. Usually, the templates that define the operating system also define how a host check should be done. They might also indicate the time period over which a host should be checked.
Templates for critical and noncritical machines usually specify how notifications should be carried out. If a host is crucial to infrastructure, its owners should be notified in a more aggressive way. Similarly, machines that are not affecting business directly do not need that much attention.
Templates for locations usually define the owners of the machines. The locations are not always branches, as in this example; they can be branches, floors, or even network connection types. Locations can also point machines to their parent hosts—usually computers located in the same place that are connected to the same router.
Creating the templates
Defining the templates in Nagios is very similar to defining actual objects. You simply define the template as the required object type. The only difference is that you need to specify the register directive and specify a value of 0 for it. This will tell Nagios that it should not treat this as an actual object, but as a template. You will also need to use the name directive for defining template names. You do not need to specify other directives for naming objects, such as host_name, contact_name, or service_description.
When defining an object, simply include the use directive and specify all of the templates to be used as its value. If you want to inherit from multiple templates, separate all of them by commas.
The following is an example of defining a template for a Linux server and then using this in an actual host definition:
define host { register 0 name generic-servers check_period 24x7 retry_interval 1 check_interval 15 max_retry_attempts 5 notification_period 24x7 notification_interval 60 notification_options d,r } define host { register 0 use generic-servers name linux-servers check_command check-host-alive contact_groups linux-admins } define host { use linux-servers host_name ubuntu1 address 192.168.2.1 }
As mentioned earlier, templates use name for defining the template, and the actual host uses the host_name directive.
Inheriting from multiple templates
Nagios allows us to inherit from multiple templates and the templates using other (nested) templates. It's good to know how Nagios determines the order in which every directive is looked for in each of the templates. When inheriting attributes from more than one template, Nagios tries to find the directive in each of the templates, starting from the first one. If it is found in the first template, that value is used; if not, Nagios checks for a value in the second one. This cycle continues until the last template in the list. If any of the templates is also inheriting from another template, then a check for the second level of templates is done recursively. This means that checking for a directive will perform a recursive check of all of the templates that are inherited from the currently checked one.
The following illustration shows an example of this situation. The actual host definition inherits three templates—B, F, and G. Template B inherits A, F inherits D and E, and finally, D inherits attributes from template C.
If Nagios tries to find any directive related to this host, the first thing that will be checked is the actual host definition. If the host does not include the directive, Nagios will first look under B, as this is the first template that should be used. If it is not found in B, Nagios will recursively try to find the attribute in A, as it is used by template B. The next step is to look in F along with all of the templates it is using. F inherits D and E. The first one to check is B along with all parent templates—this dictates that D, C, and the next E should now be checked. If the attribute is still not found, then template G is used. Let's assume that the following directives (among others) are defined for the previous illustration:
define host { register 0 name A check_period workinghours retry_interval 1 check_interval 15 } define host { register 0 use A name B check_period 24x7 } define host { register 0 name D use C max_retry_attempts 4 } define host { register 0 name E max_retry_attempts 3 } define host { register 0 use D,E name F notification_interval 30 } define host { use B,F,G host_name ubuntu1 address 192.168.2.1 notification_interval 20 }
For this particular example, the values for the address and notification_interval directives are taken directly from the host ubuntu1 definition. Even though notification_interval is also defined in F, it is overwritten by the actual host definition.
The value for max_retry_attempts is taken from the template D, regardless of whether it is also defined in C. Even though the template E also defines a value for it, as D is put before E, the values defined in both of them are taken from D.
The value for check_period is taken from B, which overwrites the value defined for the template A. Values for retry_interval and check_interval are taken from A.
Even though the preceding examples mention host configurations, templates for other types of objects work in the same way. Templates are often used extensively for service definitions. They usually use a similar approach as the one for hosts. It is a good idea to define templates for branches depending on the priority or type of service, such as a template common for all services in a specific branch, another template for all services for web / mail / other applications and for critical / non-critical / backup servers. This increases the maintainability of the configurations, especially for the larger setups. It is much easier to change contact address or notification settings for all the critical applications if that info is defined in the template used by all services. In this case, our configuration may have several templates, and most of the service definitions will just re-use existing templates, perhaps only specifying how checks for those services should be made.
Contacts, on the other hand, usually use only a couple of templates. They depend on the working hours and the notification preferences. The remaining parameters can be kept in an individual contact's definition. Very often, users may have their own preferences on how they should be notified, so it's better not to try and design templates for that.
Using the custom variables
The custom variables allow you to include your own directives when defining objects. These can then be used in commands. This allows you to define objects in a more concise way, and define service checks in a more general fashion.
The idea is that you define directives that are not standard Nagios parameters in host, service, or contact objects, and they can be accessed from all commands, such as check commands, notifications, and event handlers. This is very useful for complex Nagios configurations where you might want commands to perform nontrivial tasks for which they will require additional information.
Let's assume we want Nagios to check that the hosts have correct MAC addresses. We can then define a service once and use that custom variable for the check command. When defining an object, a custom variable needs to be prefixed with an underscore and written in uppercase.
The custom variables are accessible as the following macros:
- $_HOST<variable>$: This is used for directives defined within a host object
- $_SERVICE<variable>$: This is used for directives defined within a service object
- $_CONTACT<variable>$: This is for directives defined within a contact object
For the preceding example, a macro definition would be $_HOSTMAC$.
These variables can be used for command definitions, notifications, or time periods. The following is an example of a contact and notification command that uses a custom variable for the Jabber address:
define contact { contact_name jdoe alias John Doe host_notification_commands host-notify-by-jabber _JABBERID jdoe@jabber.yourcompany.com } define command { command_name host-notify-by-jabber command_line $USER1$/notify_via_jabber $_CONTACTJABBERID$ "Host $HOSTDISPLAYNAME$ changed state to $HOSTSTATE$" }
Of course, you will also need a plugin to send notifications over Jabber. This can be downloaded from the Nagios project on SourceForge (visit). The previous example will work with any other protocol you might be using. All that's needed is a plugin that will send commands over such a protocol.
A very useful client called EKG2 (visit) allows you to send messages over various protocols, including Jabber, and has a pipe that can be used to send messages over these protocols. A sample command to do this can be as follows:
define command { command_name host-notify-by-ekg2 command_line /usr/bin/printf "%b" "msg $_CONTACTEKGALIAS$ Host $HOSTDISPLAYNAME$ changed state to $HOSTSTATE$\n" >>~/.ekg2/.pipe }
A major benefit of custom variables is that they can also be changed on the fly over an external command pipe. This way, the custom variables functionality can be used in more complex configurations. Event handlers may trigger changes in the attributes of other checks.
An example might be that a ping check with 50 ms and 20 percent packet loss limits are made to ensure that the network connectivity is working correctly. However, if the main router is down and a failover connection is used, the check is set to a more relaxed limit of 400 ms and 50 percent packet loss.
An example configuration might be as follows:
define service { host_name router2 service_description PING check_command check_ping_limits _LIMITS 50.0,20% } define command { command_name check_ping_limits command_line $USER1$/check_ping –H $HOSTADDRESS$ -w $_SERVICELIMITS$ -c $_SERVICELIMITS$ }
When a service that checks if the main router is up (that is, it is in a critical state) an event handler will invoke a change in the limits by sending a CHANGE_CUSTOM_SVC_VAR command () over the external commands pipe to set the _LIMITS custom variable.
Understanding flapping
Flapping is a situation where a host or service changes states very rapidly—constantly switching between working correctly and not working at all. This can happen due to various reasons—a service might crash after a short period of operating correctly or due to some maintenance work being done by system administrators.
Nagios can detect that a host or service is flapping, if Nagios is configured to do so. It does so by analyzing previous results in terms of how many state changes have taken place within a specific period of time. Nagios keeps a history of the 21 most recent checks and analyzes changes within that history.
The following is an screenshot illustrating the 21 most recent check results, which means that Nagios can detect up to 20 state changes in the recent history of an object. It also shows how Nagios detects state transitions:
Nagios then finds all of the changes between different states, and uses them to determine if a host or service is flapping. It checks to see if a state is the same as the result from the previous check, and if it has changed, a state transition is counted at this place. In the preceding example, we have nine transitions.
Nagios calculates a flapping threshold based on this information. The value reflects how many of the state changes have occurred recently. If there are no changes in the last 21 state checks, the value would be 0 percent. If all checks have different states, the flapping threshold would be 100 percent.
Nagios also differentiates older results from newer ones. This means that a state transition that took place during the previous 18th check will cause the flapping threshold to be much lower than a transition that took place during the previous third check.
In our case, if Nagios would only take the number of transitions into account, the flapping threshold would be 45 percent. The weighted algorithm used in Nagios would calculate the flapping threshold as more than 45 percent, because there have been many changes in the more recent checks.
Nagios takes threshold values into consideration when estimating whether a host or service has started or stopped flapping. The configuration for each object allows the definition of low and high flapping thresholds.
If an object was not flapping previously, and the current flapping threshold is equal to or greater than the high flap threshold, Nagios assumes that the object has just started flapping. If an object was flapping previously and the current threshold is lower than the low flap threshold, Nagios assumes the object has just stopped flapping.
The following chart shows how the flapping threshold for an object has changed over time, and when Nagios assumed it started and stopped flapping. In this case, the high flap threshold is set to 40 percent and the low flap threshold is set to 25 percent. Red vertical lines indicate when Nagios assumed the flapping to have started and stopped, and the grey area shows where the service was assumed to be flapping.
It is worth noting that the low flap threshold should be lower than the high flap threshold. This prevents the situation where after one state transition, flapping would be detected and the next check would tell Nagios that the object has stopped flapping. If both the attributes are set to the same value, an object might be identified as having started and stopped flapping often. This can happen when the flapping threshold changes from below threshold to above threshold or vice versa. This might cause Nagios to send out large number of notifications and cause its performance to degrade.
Summary
When creating or extending Nagios configurations to monitor large number of resources, spend some time planning the layout of your configuration. Some people recommend one file for each single definition, while others recommend storing things in a single file per host. We recommend keeping similar things in the same file and maintaining a directory-based set of files.
In this article, we have learned about setting up a directory and file naming structure for configurations. Using proper guidelines for naming and creating the files will help make the configuration maintainable when managing tens and thousands of hosts and services.
We have also defined dependencies, and covered how it can be used to make Nagios automatically notice when a problem is related to other host or when the service is not working properly. We have also learned how to use templates to help define a large number of objects, and how multiple inheritance can be used to automate the defined objects.
This article also describes how to use custom variables to access specific information about a host, service, or contact from another object, such as specifying limits for check commands or protocol-specific identification for sending notifications. We have also learned what flapping is and how Nagios uses it to prevent sending notifications about hosts or services that keep changing their state.

Fig: Favorite Linux Distribution Voting Results
1. Ubuntu
Like most of you, Ubuntu is my #1 choice for desktop Linux. I use it both at home and work. Ubuntu is the #1 in the Linux desktop market and some use Ubuntu for the servers also. Ubuntu offers the following three editions.
- Ubuntu Desktop Edition
- Ubuntu Server Edition
- Ubuntu Notebook Remix
Additional Details:
- Ubuntu Download Page
- Created by: Canonical Ltd., (who also provides commercial support, if you need it)
- Used As: Desktop and Server
- Latest Version: Ubuntu 9.04
- Read more about Ubuntu Distribution at wikipedia.
Refer to our Ubuntu Tips and Tricks article series.
2. Debian
Debian is also called as Debian GNU/Linux, as most of the basic OS tools comes from the GNU Project. Lot of other famous distributions are based on Debian, which includes our #1 distro Ubuntu and many others — such as Knoppix, Linspire, Damn Small Linux etc.,
Additional Details:

3. Fedora
Fedora is sponsored by Red Hat. If you are interested in experimenting with the the leading technologies, you should use fedora, as the release cycle is very short and fedora tends to include the latest technology software/packages in it’s distribution.
Additional Details:
- Fedora Download Page
- Created by: Fedora Project (sponsored by Red Hat)
- Latest Version: Fedora 11
- Based On: Red Hat Linux

4. CentOS
If your organization does not want to spend money on purchasing Red Hat support, but still want all the benefits of the red-hat distribution, this is obviously the best choice, as this is totally based on the red-hat enterprise Linux.
As you can imagine the Nort American Enterprise Linux vendor mentioned in the quote below is Red Hat.
From the CentOS website: CentOS 2, 3, and 4 are built from publically available open source SRPMS provided by a prominent North American Enterprise Linux vendor. CentOS is designed for people who need an enterprise class OS without the cost or support of the prominent North American Enterprise Linux vendor.

- CentOS Download Page
- Created by: CentOS Project
- Latest Version: CentOS 5
- Based on: Red Hat Linux

5. Red Hat
This is my favorite server distribution. If an organization doesn’t mind spending dollars on purchasing the red-hat support, this is always my #1 recommendation to any organization who runs mission critical applications.
On a side note, one of the reason I like Red Hat Linux for mission critical production application is that Red Hat tends to take some of the new features from Fedora, which is well tested by the community.

RE: Top 5 Best Linux OS Distributions
Linux Mint, a distribution based on Ubuntu didn’t make the top five. Where did it place in your survey?
Regards,
Ken
Gentoo is best for me.
I also think Linux Mint should be between the top five.
i think that we should do the survey separately
for servers and desktops..
i do hands on 2nd,3rd,5th as per ranking as i spend mostly on servers
never tried other ditros
on server front which is best i wanted to know..
Actually I’m somewhat surprised that Ubuntu would be considered the “top” among the geeky readers. Most of the comp sci “geeks” I knew before liked their flavor of Linux for the geek-niche factor and their ability to esoterically modify everything about it. So, I would hear about gentoo or RedHat or some other type of Linux a lot but not Ubuntu because it seemed too easy, too watered-down and too popular.
@Joshua, Maybe it’s because we are getting older (my first true Linux install was Debian 1.3 back in the mid 90s) I used to enjoy spending days working on a new install to get things to work right, install all the apps I needed and tweak things to my taste. But now I need my computer to do work and can’t have it down for days while I get it working properly. Ubuntu installs easily, has large repositories and I haven’t had to struggle with any hardware issues for quite some time. Plus if I recommend this distro to a friend to try, I can easily help out if they have a question since I use it on a daily basis.
…from
Pitr [thinking]: What?! The Chief is havink Debian runnink on his machine?! outrageous! Nothink a disk wipe and a Suse install will not be fixink.
Chief: Pitr, What are you doing?
Pitr: Installink Suse on your machine, boss man.
Chief: But why? What difference does it make what flavour is on my machine? The shareholders don’t care, my machine doesn’t care, and I certainly don’t care!
Pitr: You see, boss… every time you are clickink mouse in Suse, you feed small hungry child. Every time you clickink mouse in Debian, God, he is killink a kitten.
Chief: Oh my Lord. I had no idea!
Pitr: Just thank gods that you did not use Red Hat! Clickink mouse each time creates new Linux distro!
…as for myself;
I would have picked ubuntu 8.1 but I up/down graded to 9.04 and I have spent as much effort testing/degugging the O/S as I have spent actually doing my own work. I don’t even have any blacklisted hardware in my machine. But Intrepid Ibex was difficult to find fault with.
Anyway, by definition, this is a poll which indicates what our favorite distro is, as opposed to which distro is actually better. That would require a lesson in software metrics from the ACM. : )
…but it could be done.
After all, we’ve always been able to objectively compare apples to oranges when it comes to windows and linux, right? ; )
So why not bust out the hard/soft/derivitive metrics for a distro comparo? There would be no voting involved, sad to say, cause I do love a good online poll, but it would be an incredibly geeky thing to do.
What I can state, based solely on personal experience, is that Knoppix has never (ever) let me down. Using Knoppix for recovery purposes has saved my data everytime.
Knoppix +1 YAy
@All,

@KenW, Rafael,
As you see in the above ranking, Linux Mint came almost at the bottom. Just both of your votes would’ve pushed it up in the ranking.
@Srinivas,
I agree. I’m pretty sure that most folks who voted for Ubuntu are using it as desktop. Probably a separate server for desktop and servers may show a different results. We’ll conduct such survey in the blog very soon. Thanks.
@Joshua,
Like Scott has mentioned, it is just too easy to set it up and running. Moreover, Ubuntu is the famous distro among the newbies. Since I didn’t separate desktop vs server distro in the contest, it is no surprise Ubuntu came on the top.
@Scott,
You installed Debian in mid 90’s? mm.. You are definitely as wise as Master Yoda. In mid 90’s I was playing around with Solaris. You are absolutely right about Ubuntu, for some of my non-geeky (read it as — Microsoft, self proclaimed geeks) friends, who wants to know what is all the hype about Linux, I recommend Ubuntu to them.
@cronjob,
Very hillarious discussion between Chief and Pitr.
You are absolutely right. This list shows only the favorite disto. But technically may not be the best.
It would be interesting to create a poll where every disto can be rated based on features, technical-aspects, functionalities. What are the different technical-aspects you would consider for every distro to be rated, if we have to create such poll?
Hello Ramesh:
Thanks for putting the onus on the customer. : )
Have you ever worked for IBM? ; )
That’s a nice push back though Ramesh. I ask for metrics, and you ask me to get some. lol
(In all actuality, I like the fact that you respond to the geeks that frequent this board. Many such boards put out the info but, give no clue as to whether or not there is anybody who cares on the other side of the web site.)
Anyway, I will start digging.
tayl
Hi
what you told is right. But what happened to linuxmint.
Ubuntu really tops in desktop edition and it is really easy to use than other linux edition
@cronjob,
I never worked for IBM. But, I’ve worked closely with IBM/KPMG/E&Y consultants on different projects. Sometimes putting onus on the customer may be a good thing, which gives the opportunity for the customer to think about their business.
Anyway, I didn’t mean to push that back onto you. I’m really interested in finding out what kind of metrics you would be interested in seeing. Thanks for start digging on it. Let me know what you find out.
@Vivek,
Thanks for the comment. Like I’ve mentioned to “KenW and Rafael”, Mint got only one vote and just three of your additional votes would’ve pushed Mint from the bottom to a reasonable level.
Please tell me what is different between each of distributions?
Fedora is my personal favorite, then Arch, then Backtrack.
GENTOO IS BEST
Ubuntu was with i started off with like 3 years back… like one fine day, i had my Windows machine go kaput on me and i was actly tired of the constant reinstallations… so those three days in which i didnt bother to touch my computer, i introduced myself to Ubuntu.. and my word, was i hooked..
i had used Red Hat and Fedora in college. But i didnt know their capabilities.. still dont..
Now around a month back, i have started off exploring Sabayon 4.2 . it looks great, plays great, media and devices work outta the box.. but a lot of the deal is like totally messed up, you can get to points where you end up in dead ends. i want to try something else now… tired of what sabayon is offering.. is it back to ubuntu for me or can you guys suggest me onto something?
For a light-weight distro that runs fast and does most anything people do on a laptop I would say GOS. It’s Ubuntu based but the performance is much faster.
For a full brown distro Ubuntu is nice because it has so many users, great forums, very stable. This is an opensource distro however and you need to add proprietary software to get some common desktop/application features working. Mepis is a really nice distro out of the box that performs most of what you would do on a computer without modification. Suse is stable and easy to work with. Its a bit bulky however and has performance issues on older machines. Fedora is nice but not the most user friendly distro. Mandriva is comparable to Fedora in terms of user experience in my mind. Sabyon is interesting, very cutting edge but a bit unstable and has more hardware compatibility issues than other distros.
Whatever distro you choose perform a search for “distro name perfect desktop” and you’ll find guides to customize the distro (for major distros). for example. is a good source of information on Linux distros.
Good luck and thanks to the many developers, hacks and geeks that provide us so many great choices.
I’m a lifelong Windows user that was just recently introduced to the world of Linux. I’m glad there is a FREE alternative the the $400 for upgrades Microsoft is demanding for a product key for Windows 7…
Anyway, I’m currently using Xubuntu, which is a spinoff of Ubuntu with the Xfce desktop environment. I like it a lot. I tried Mint, Fodera, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, SUSE, and a couple of others. For me, Xubuntu was the easiest, most flexible, and most customizable. Or, I finally got the hang of Gnome by the time I got to Xubuntu… 😉
I’m a newbie on linux. Any advice on what distro should I use on laptop?..
My vote for Ubuntu.
At Ijes16: I would DEFINITELY recommend EITHER Ubuntu or Mint. Both are extremely easy to install as a dual boot (if you choose to keep Windows or OS X on your computer), both are plug-n-play (hardware drivers are automatically detected and loaded, so your stuff just… works), and both are beautiful OS’s with highly customisable GUI’s. Have fun and let us know what you decide and how its working out for you.
I’ve gone thru a vigorous search for the best linux distros 2010 regarding ease of use and functionality as well as its looks. for any windows users especially, who wana try out wat linux is, i recommend the following:
1. JoliCloud ( I loved its concept, its like using iPhone with big tabs and icons.)
2. Linux Mint 8 ( easy to use and pretty)
3. Pardus 2009.1 (best KDE desktop so far and stable with nice collection of software)
Well, I always liked Red Hat, then they started the free desktop version to test the RedHat core called Fedora, but Fedora doesn’t includes some open source free libraries (for GPL sake) so I moved to Debian! Since Ubunto is a Debian branch I stick to Debian just for love. But personally I found Ubunto the most simple to use, simple enough for non IT folks.
Can Somebody tell me which Linux version is the best one to get used to command line in linux. I want to boot in Commandline. I don’t want GUI at all. Which one is the best. If it can be done on Fedora too. Please letme know how to do
Farooq, I’m guessing that what you need is to load the kernel, its modules and little more. Skip loading X and the desktop environment and you’re done! This you can do with just any Linux Distribution!
Remember that Linux is the mostly the Kernel and not the whole set, that’s called a Linux Distribution. The Kernel just by itself would not work by itself, it needs to be loaded, for that you need a Linux Loader (LILO or Grub) (which is basically a boot program that loads the Kernel to the memory and points to the Kernel entry point). The last thing you need it the command line working, to receive and process input from the keyboard and display it on the screen, the common program to do this is Bash. Just having this you can run any simple (independent) binaries, but you will probably end up needing some libraries and some other support apps.
Advice: Try installing a SlackWare distribution from scratch and stop when you have the minimum system running which consists on just the LILO and the Kernel (and the modules, if any). But the easy and fast way is to get one of those incredible small PEN drive distributions because they probably are just what you need.
If you’re on the clock check DSL (Damn Small Linux) it’s a very popular small Linux Distribution.
Have fun!
Ubuntu is simply the best.. I have been using it from its version 7.10…
Only one time I have migrated to Suse, but was not impressed. So I switched back to Ubuntu again, now using the version Jaunty Jackalope…
Ubuntu Rocks…
HI. I have been using some of the distro and Ithink they are pretty good. ilike Fedora,Ubuntu ,Mint and Suse. Which one is better ? All of them really.
you could do a lot wth them. They are improving everytime so i would recommend them to anybody. i am using Mint 9( Isadora) on a quadcore Amd machine and have no problems. I have also worked on some other machines and it works as well.
It’s dissapointing more people didn’t vote for Slackware and its derivitaves.
Zenwalk really is my favorite, and I run it both on a general desktop (everybody at my house uses it, and I do the administration) and on a laptop (personal – programming, Blender 3D, GIMP). Wonderful to work with *and* administer.
– Sigh –
* Personally, I can’t stand Ubuntu. It has screwed me over more than once, with screwy graphics drivers on the desktop and totally breaking after an update on my laptop. So yeah, you could say I have a vendetta – I just say Ubuntu sucks.
* I would rather side with an Red Hat derivitave than a Debian derivative, but I just like Slackware derivitaves more, maybe because it was my first distro (NimbleX 2007), and maybe because there’s less auto-management crap to deal with when sitting at a TTY as root.
Go Slackers! Even though I don’t use Slackware, I’m still one at heart 😉
Wow. Ubuntu has brainwashed the populace. Congrats, I guess.
I’m (was, actually) a Slacker. I like the distro, but my one problem was the lack of a package manager that is not stupider than a brick wall. Slapt-get wasn’t good with updates to the whole system, and swaret… never tried it.
Zenwalk & netpkg all the way!

I like to use Puppy Linux
Puppy is a small fast distro, great for fixing those messed up other than Linux distros
Ubuntu is the best Desktop but not capable as a server.
RedHat is a liar, who pretend an high-quality server, but give you nothing, or maybe I forget to mention the outdated packages (e.g. php-5.1.6) Of you can pay it more($2000/yr) to get php 5.3.4.
FreeBSD — the best Internet server!! It beats all the other servers. Try it, and you won’t regret.
From all these only Debian passes as linux distro. All others have ported too many windows flaws that made them somewhere between linux and windows. While Debian gets ubuntized, it looses it’s advantages too.
Sadly, most linux distros try to do everything on their own – that is great if you want to use it as a shovel (like windows), but it gets terribly wrong as soon as any internal problem appears. Last one I got into today with mandriva (that is far more stable and user friendly than fedora) – after tranfer of system from drive to drive system keeps waiting two minutes for the root partititon it already found according to dmesg – kernel is probably not a reasonable source of hw information anymore. After this everything works as it did before. All redhat things from rh5 to latest centos fail install when they encounter a problem with install media – that is too absurd. I reported it in time of rh6 (even before getting first debian) and 10 years were not enough to add one if statement. Specific distro based preconfiguration options for Grub are big nightmare in many cases (at least ubuntu and mandriva).
This kind of problems is very non-unix by their nature, but they started to appear as companies try to make money of linux by porting windows problems to it to make it comparable. That is the same mistake Apple did in System 7.6 and every next to end up just as a bit better type of windows without any real advantage (eye candy is no advantage, it’s just eye candy). I used Apple system 7.5.5 until 2001 for all my office work no matter what linux/windows/OS2/whatever was on my PC.
So my list would be:
1. Debian
– not too selfservicing with great package management,
2. Slackware
– very basic anything allowing YOU to manage the system. Absence of basic management disables it for userfriendly desktop or loaded server.
3. Mandriva
– for destop of windows people. Even my mother installed it successfuly yesterday, while she was unable to with windows and redhat8 which is during the install basicaly the same like today’s fedora.
4. LFS
– to learn how the linux realy works
5. CentOS
– if you realy need redhat like distro for any reason.
@PP: New does not mean good, in many cases exactly the opposite. Php is a fun thing that is badly managed and putting newest on production server is generaly bad idea. I am far happier with outdated and bugfixed version.
The biggest advantage of redhat is compatibility with specific closed hw vendors who make only RHEL and SLES packages with binary kernel modules. That is the moment I use CentOS and pray loud.
@Ramesh Natarajan (8): Installing debian in mid90s happened to be far easier than to instal redhat in that time. I always hear these linux was hard – well yeah, it took me two days to start the X window for the first time, but after that it was again a piece of cake until these closed 3D drivers come.
To me making debian desktop reasonable in mid 90s was harder than with OS/2 Warp 4, but still easier than with windows. Yeah, basic desktop in widows takes just long time with next, next, next – but is that really a usable environment for anyone?
@Dejf
Security holes always happened on outdated packages, this is why we have to keep our packages updated. PHP upgrade not only provide new features, but also provide bug and security fixes, same to other open-source packages.
Xubuntu has taken over Ubuntu after the introduction of Unity framework.
You know, I didn’t really like Unity all that much when I first encountered it. I’ll say it — I HATED IT! …at first. I chose to work with Unity on Ubuntu for the sole purpose of learning how to use the interface efficiently. I have a VM of Fedora 15 with GNOME 3 so that I can do the same thing.
I think that we get comfortable with our GNOME 2.x and KDE 3.x until we are forced to evolve. This is the direction that the major DE’s are going, guys. I don’t have a problem using KDE 4.x, Unity, and I’m getting used to GNOME 3.x (though I think the developers still have a way to go). XFCE, LXDE, and any number of smaller WM’s are great alternatives to GNOME, KDE, and Unity.
Since using Unity, I’ve come to appreciate the feel and power of the Unity desktop. I’m almost embarrassed to say that I like it. It isn’t my favorite, but it is the most unique desktop experience I’ve had so far in Linux kernel OSs.
linux mint is getting better than ubuntu
Having had now eleven years of linux experience I have come to the conclusion that the most reliable Linux distribution is hands down Slackware. Slackware is unaltered from the authors and has been the most reliable OS I have ever worked with over the last 11 years period. Having said that I will also note that Linux is my 23 operating system in my lifetime. yes I am over 60 years old and started with computers in 1968. Debian is the next most reliable Linux distribution but it alters the packages from the authors. Both Debian and Slackware are not for the novice computer user.
This article obviously focused on the most popular Linux OS distribution. In my opinion clowds the quest of the best Linux dristribution. After all what is best, is it the most popular or is it the most reliable. For me I choose reliability. If I upgrade a package or kernel I want that package or kernel to work. I do not want it to render my computer a desk weight as both Ubuntu, Fedora and OpenSuSE has.
If you are in business and demand a prime time (Reliable) OS that is consistantly dependable and trusted then you can not go wrong with RedHat and or CentOs.
Slackware is a great 32 bit OS but at times one requires a 64 bit operating system expecially when solving large complex problems cost effectively. Then you need RedHat or CentOS.
why Redhat on fifth no
Thank you Linux developers for what you continue to create. Windows users for over a decade. I’ve been transformed by your brilliance. Windows user no more. Thanks again.
hello,
I am using centos … centos is the best server in linux.
Guys
check pinguy OS it it much better than ubantu
I am not quite familiar with Ubuntu, but I have heard that it looks like windows…Easy to use, quite visual.
I like fedora and RHEL, the packages managements is beautiful
Arch is pretty new for me. It ‘s not supposed to fit to a newbie because the depending of packages is not clearly. It always drive me crazy as the packages conflict…
SuSE is an excellent distro too. I used Ubuntu for my desktop a few years ago, liked it fine but continued exploring. Had Fedora for a few months but kept going back to OpenSuse on my home computer. It could be due in part to using SLES at work; but I have liked the robustness of the distribution, the helpful user community and YAST!
Thank You
i like ubuntu………
thank you unbuntu
Ubuntu 11.10 is very good as I use it in my Desktop and Laptop.
Redhat should be on top as it used mostly on Enterprise environment, Ubuntu works as desktop for Server.
Don
Tried Red Hat back in the mid-90’s, but Linux was over my head at the time. Went back to WinXP for 15 years, and finally got sick of reinstalling it. Tried Ubuntu for a month and learned quite a bit about GNU/Linux commands, then I switched to Debian. Absolutely love Debian! Especially how it’s a probably the largest community GNU/Linux distribution in existence. I recommend upgrading to Debian Testing, instead of Debian Stable, if you want access to newer packages in the repository.
Slackware is my favorite distribution.
I used Ubuntu for a while but after trying Debian’s SolusOS I would never go back… ever. I use Xubuntu on a very old machine and it is fantastic to bring old machines back to life or even better than stock but for my main OS SolusOS can’t be beat. I love Using TAILS but not really an option for a Desktop OS…
Slan
thanks for one of the top 3 Unix sites on the net along with Catonmat and Fuzicast. You guys make the community!!!
I am using the ubuntu . but I don’t know much more about ubuntu so kindly send me link the ubuntu . because i just want to read about that . sagar vats
Ubuntu has always been my number one choice for work or home, Canonical has been committed to proving easy to deploy, best supported and cutting edge distro that has made my life as a Linux evangelist much easier. Now I have my entire university running Ubuntu back and front end. My team of faculty and students have managed to deploy Ubuntu in corporate world in India which was quite resilient to anything to do with desktop Linux so yes, I agree with you, Ubuntu is hope for Linux thanks to Shuttleworth.
Ubuntu for me ….sort of. Pinguy OS a variant is easy to use and the kids can get the hang of it easily, plus it looks good.
I recently tried a couple of Linux distributions on my new computer. I tried Mint and Ubuntu, and I must say that they both suck. I can’t get them to download any software from the Internet. They don’t even have any applications capable of running any software from any disk that I put into my optical drive. Stay away from Linux operating systems and go with Windows.
Still use Corel Linux 2.2.xx on Tosh Satellite from laate 1990’s for word processing. 233mhz with 92.5 mb mem, quite zippy! I use Knoppix for the sharkey waters of th see web.
I’ve used pretty much all of the major distributions over the last 15 years. I was settling into Fedora until they changed Gnome, at which point I switched to Centos. Then I discvered Stella, which to my mind is as good as it gets. It’s a remix of Centos, so it’s rock solid, and it has all the software repsitories that Centos doesn’t include by default. Install it and it’s ready to go.
red hat is the best os compare to other it’s user friendly virus free, speed,reliability, security
Hi Sir,
Why ubuntu linux is u’r favorite any advantage over another distro?
i really suggest everyone to be AWAY FROM WINDOWS 😛
i really liked Debian&Ubuntu&CentOS&Mint :))
but im using Debian now…

About the Author.
I bought this book for the nutrition class I was taking. I read this text book from cover to cover (not something I can do with most text books). This text book was well written and very interesting.
Nice presentation of information; easy to understand and apply. Lots of colorful diagrams and pictures. Love the tear out chapter quizzes in the back (caution if you buy the book used,they might have been ripped out). I did find one error in the quizzes: Chapter 12, question 9-the answer should be “b” and the key has “d”. Other than that-love it!
I don’t tend to agree with some of the information in this book as they base it on so many of the government recommendations which are less than optimal, but it does offer some overall good information, although a bit technical if you are a lay person in nutrition. A good book to have in your library.
This is a great book with valuable information, it is set up nicely and is easy for the reader to understand.

Dropped ... Chris Yarran pays the price for his bad body language. Source: Herald Sun
Chris Yarran's petulance has cost him his spot in the Carlton lineup for Friday night's AFL blockbuster against Hawthorn at Etihad Stadium.
AFL Round 8
Friday, May 22
Saturday, May 23
Sunday, May 24
Yarran apologised for his poor on-field body language after he was made the substitute in last Friday night's narrow loss to Essendon.
But he and Simon White were left out of the side.
Andrew Carrazzo returns from a calf muscle injury and Josh Bootsma is also back in the senior side.
Veteran Essendon defender Dustin Fletcher is again out of the side with a groin injury for Saturday night's home match against Gold Coast.
The 38-year-old also missed three games earlier this season with the same problem.
Will Hams was dropped as the Bombers recalled Tayte Pears and Jackson Merrett.
Matthew Leuenberger, Daniel Rich and Tom Rockliff headline a whopping seven changes for Brisbane ahead of Saturday's away match against Fremantle.
Brent Moloney's back injury is the only forced change.
Jordan Lisle, Mitch Golby, Niall McKeever and Sam Mayes are the other inclusions.
The Lions dropped James Polkinghorne, Patrick Karnezis, Billy Longer, Jack Crisp, Sam Michael and Marco Paparone.
Adelaide reacted to last weekend's shocker against Sydney by dropping three players for the must-win match against Richmond this Saturday at the MCG.
Brent Reilly, Sam Kerridge and Brad Crouch lost their spots and Jared Petrenko has a shoulder injury.
The Crows recalled David Mackay, Matthew Jaensch, Matthew Wright and Luke Brown.
Hawthorn will regain ruckman Max Bailey and forward Jack Gunston for Kyle Cheney and Sam Grimley, who were dropped.
Reece Conca and Brandon Ellis return from injury for Richmond, who lost Matt Dea to a calf injury and omitted Sam Lonergan.
The Suns brought in Daniel Gorringe for Charlie Dixon, who has an ankle injury.
Fremantle brought in Alex Silvagni for Cameron Sutcliffe.
Port Adelaide dropped Campbell Heath and lost Jarrad Redden (shoulder) for Sunday's away clash with Greater Western Sydney.
The one confirmed omission for the Western Bulldogs ahead of Sunday's game against Collingwood is defender Tom Williams, who is out for the rest of the season with a shoulder injury.
Have your sayEditorial: Democracy dependent on us all
Early voting has begun across the state. We can’t stress enough the importance of what is taking place between now and May 6.
Our part is not to name candidates to endorse; rather, we encourage participation at all levels of our democracy. We firmly believe that competition for these important leadership positions will yield to us better candidates, a more informed public and an end result that is positive for our community. We also believe participation in the voting process is crucial to the most people being represented.
While the four-year cycle for the president’s election may leave all others as “off years” or “mid-terms,” they are all crucial. And in fact, in many communities just like a number of ours in the Tri-County, it is those elections in “off years” and “mid-terms” that have governing bodies elected which will affect us most directly.
Whether we vote early or wait until Tuesday, May 6, let the message be clear: we must participate.
• From time to time, we offer a well-deserved salute to various entities when “their day” comes around. We never promise to get them all; the list is quite lengthy.
April’s closure — yes, can you believe it? — will bring to a close National Stress Awareness Month and National Autism Awareness Month. We’ve also seen National Volunteer Week, National Library Week, Earth Day and Administrative Professionals Day. Today ends National Medical Lab Week and Sunday closes National Playground Safety Week.
Kindness and appreciation doesn’t need a designated day, week or month. Nor should we let our awareness of significant causes be similarly limited. Share words of adulation regularly, and keep the causes that touch our lives in the forefront daily.
• An enduring figure in the fight against racial justice left us this past week when former prizefighter Rubin Carter died.
Carter, nicknamed Hurricane because of his ferocity and power, was imprisoned for 19 years in connection to a 1966 triple murder. He was convicted in 1967, then retried and convicted again in 1976. In 1985, appeals finally won him the fight of his life.
Admiration for Carter extends beyond his resilience against racial injustice. He rose above bitterness and anger, empowered by a positive attitude.
Carter was 76.Vancouver riot kissing couple identified

It is impossible that someone would be so oblivious to what is happening around them in such turmoil. Is the world retarded or is it just this part of the world that can’t see or can’t care for what is true or not true. At least the cops had the human sense to see at a glance that this was a fake. I don’t want to be inconsiderate but i’m glad i’m not the mother of that bum.

Six months ago the Scotch whisky industry was in a state of fevered excitement as the Speyside Distillery Co. was sold off by its Swiss parent company to the North Yorkshire firm of Alexander Muir & Sons. Speyside was a Glasgow-based blender and bottler, founded in 1955 by the infamous George Christie who spent 30 years building his own distillery beside the Spey. In contrast, Muir's business was set up by Sir James Ackroyd seven years ago as a small sales and marketing operation for Scotch which he continues to run from his family home – Birstwith Hall in North Yorkshire.
The current state of the industry may have had more to do with the fate of the Canadian giant, Seagram, whose drinks division finally went under the hammer for a record-breaking US$8.15 billion a week before Christmas. Although the two events appear totally unconnected, they seem to symbolise the increasing polarisation within the trade. The Seagram sale demontrates further contraction at the top but the Speyside story, and that of Bruichladdich previously, shows everyone that there's plenty of life further down the scale. And the bigger the major players get, the bigger the crumbs that fall off the high table – as one notable independent noted: “By the time they reach us, they're bits of toast.”
James Ackroyd spent most of his career among the corporate giants, starting with the Distillers Company in 1965 where he ascended to the position of Senior Export Manager before switching to Martini & Ro...Looks like Benghazigate is getting momentum

Give her a break ya'll she's goin' through a hard time ya know! Honestly, I think she needs a good friend to help her cope with all the stuff that's been going on with her. That's alot for a young mother of 2 to handle on her own. And what asses she has working for her, if she loses respect from her fans and is labeled trash, she won't have the money to pay them. I say get some balls and show her that you care. In the end she'll realize you were only trying to help. I mean C'MON! The FIRECROTCH guy?
Britney is sinking to an all-time low. ____________________________________ Don't tick me off. Or you'll get it.
Deba yes it does. very instantly. True Women show what they are worth when they go thru things. Ur friend is a real woman and I can imagine how lucky you feel to be apart of her life. ;)
RCL I have to agree, if Brit was "poor and a women of color", Child Protective Services would be considerding an investgation of her "possible" poor parenting. I can only hope the poor kids are more than likely with mother or KFed's mother....hmmm, at this point anyone who cares would be an improvement. Question: How will she ever explain to her kids the pictures of her "puhnanny"?
oh well! I really envy how madure she is for 20 years old... life changes thats all...
Deba big props to ur friend. I found nemo!
sorry who... my bad...
I just dont really agree with that, my best friend (how is a single mom) has been a mother for the past 4 years,yes, she likes to go out, yes she like to drink and every time in while she takes a day off from being a mom and have a good time with us, the girls. I have never seen her wasted, she had never done any of that stupid bullshit Shitney has done... you know how old is she? 20 years old. If we go out on a wekeend and next weekend we invite her to join us, she would say "no I cant I have to take care of my son, I cant always ask my mom to do it for me all the time". She lives in another country (is the question of age pops out). Being a single mom is a not excuse for indecent behavior or making stupid choices. My friend understood the fact that her life changed from the moment she got pregnant, she does not regrets anything, but you know she is grown up and behaves like one. NOT AN EXCUSE!
Im sorry Im not getting how a 2 week period of of being a mom for an entire year makes her an unfit mother. Lets face it these kids are probably with Grandma and safe and sound shes going out at night while they are sleeping. Its no different then if she was a single mom that had to go on a business trip for work. But if she got drunk on a busniess trip showed her cooch and was a normal person she wouldnt be a bad mom right because she isnt Britney spears. My Co-worker gave me a theory that I want to share. On these cooch shots. The really bad ones where shes in the black dress look staged totally no way she cannot know shes undieless and her legs are wide open. Shes getting paid off that bc I bet there really is a tape or some photos that kev is or was going to try to sell or leak now whatever he has isnt worth hardly nothing its been seen. I found nemo!
My prediction for 2007 is Betty Ford by Valentine's Day....
Who is Brandon Davis?
The most unfortunate thing about Britney behaving like a child is that she has two very young children of her own. This is really not about her career, it's about really really poor parenting skills. If she were not famous, and just happened to be some girl, her kids would be taken from her by Child Protective Services! I've never been a fan...never thought she could sing, never thought she was cute. She has always been a gimmick-driven spectacle, and this is really just par for the course in my opinion. She needs to wake up and realize that she is a mother and that at this point in her life, her children's needs come before her own. Forget career, forget fame, forget all of that. Those kids should be number one on her list of priorities.
Wow the outfit is horrendous!!!!! What a shame she was a superstar. Right now she's just pissing all over her career :-(
britney u make me want to puke! disgusting trash!
i think i give up
Wooooowwwwww, I'm speechless. xoxo
she really cut her skirt with scissors? wow. that sums it up to me pretty much, this b*tch is a millionaire many times over and she cant even get her skirt hemed, pathetic and brandon davis is so gross he looks like the joker or something...i wish she would just so away its all so embarassing, team federline all the way. "stay far from timid, only make moves when your hearts in it and live the phrase sky's the limit."
Leeah - I'm pretty sure she has no clue who is taking care of her kids. Doesn't seem to be a priority to her.
Who's taking care of her babies while she's out partying? Maybe she wants Kevin to get the kids.
do you girls remember how proud we were of brit when she announced she's leaving k-fed? well... that was a sweet 15 mins....
We're surprised by this? Why? The girl was married to K-Fed, what did we expect? She wants to be an "it" girl. Going out, partying every night with the dirtiest girls in Hollywood. Good luck during that custody battle. Poor kids. Really. Two low-lifes for parents.
well, I hope she has invested well b/c ain't no way in hell she's gonna have any kind of comeback...
She had a great 48 hours then went to hell....fast!
She could be a star if she would just give up this idea that she has taste. Horrible taste in men too.
She looks so wasted on the pirst picture. FUCK BRITNEY! Dont you realize you are hanging out with the undesirable people from Hollyweird??????? I wonder if I can adopt her kids... wait Im only 20 years, Im so young. Oh yes! Im not a white trash trailer park whore... man! that outfit its just so Las Vegas Hooker... thats harsh! Im sorry hookers in Las Vegas... yes, you guys look a lot better...Apps to be rated, All, Pre-teen, Teen and Mature
Google Android Market apps will be required to have a content rating following concerns that the store exposes children to unsuitable content.
Starting over the course of the next few weeks, Market apps will all have one of four different ratings; All, Pre-teen, Teen and Mature, initially rated by the developers; }
Developers of current apps will be required to add ratings in the coming weeks, with those that aren't automatically labelled as Mature. The hope is that the more risque content on the Android Market will no longer make it onto the phones of minors.
In a blog post, Google revealed that it was responding to "a top request from Android users."
Eric Chu, who works with the Android Developer Ecosystem says: "Starting in a few weeks, we will be showing content ratings for all applications on Android Market. This new capability will provide users with additional information to help them select the best applications for them."
In the past Google has been criticised, namely by Apple CEO Steve Jobs, for its somewhat laid back attitude towards vetting apps in the past, compared to Apple's total porn lockdown.

Small portions of lean beef can be part of a healthy diet because beef is high in protein and contains essential vitamins and minerals. Healthy ways to enjoy beef depend on the cooking method, portion size and choice of the right cut of beef. How the steer is raised is also important.
Grill burgers and steaks
Whenever possible, choose to grill your beef. Dry heat, as compared to frying, cooks off much of its unhealthy fat. You can choose to grill outdoors or use an indoor grill. Watch what goes on that burger, however. Piling on double cheese and bacon will quickly undo any health benefits a low-fat grilled burger can provide. Be sure to skip the fries with the steak and have a hearty salad instead.
Choose lean cuts
Many cuts of roasts and steaks are low in fat and can be part of a healthy diet if eaten in moderation. According to the Mayo Clinic, the U.S. Department of Agriculture lists 29 cuts of beef considered to be extra lean, meaning a 3.5-ounce serving has only five grams of fat. Among these cuts are eye of round roast or steak, sirloin steak and top round roast.
Choose meat that has very little fat and trim as much as possible before cooking. When choosing ground beef, select the product with the lowest percentage of fat.
Go natural
It was only in the middle of the 20th century that cattle ranchers started finishing cattle on a high corn and soybean diet, which increased the fat content and decreased the good nutrients in beef. Packing cattle densely into feedlots required dosing them with high levels of antibiotics to prevent disease. Growth hormones were added to their diet. Try to limit or eliminate this kind of beef from your diet.
Some farmers are going back to feeding their cattle a natural diet of grass. Beef from grass-fed cattle has, according to the beef farm Heart Healthy Natural Beef, a high level of omega-3 fatty acids and is low in bad fat and calories. It is high in vitamins B6 and B12 and has far less saturated fat than beef from grain-finished animals.
Tweak favorites
You can still enjoy favorite foods such as spaghetti, chili, beef stew, tacos and Sunday roast. Just tweak your recipes to add more vegetables. Serve spaghetti with whole grain pasta and pair a roast or steak with brown rice rather than potatoes.
Beef can be an important part of a healthy diet. Just control portion size, serve it as a treat rather than a staple, choose lean cuts and pair it with healthy side dishes. Choose grass-fed beef for lower fat and better health.British tourists are more likely to be killed in Thailand than any other destination, according to new figures released today.
Motorbike accidents are the main reason why 269 Britons died there last year, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).
The figures mean that Thailand has the highest rate of deaths in proportion to the number of British tourists of any country worldwide. In the year to March, an estimated 860,000 British tourists visited Thailand.
This figure also makes Thailand the country where, proportionately, British tourists are most likely to end up in hospital, according to the organisation’s BritishKNOXVILLE - The parents of Johnia Berry, whose brutal murder went unsolved for three years, have settled a civil lawsuit against the owners of the apartment complex where the crime occurred.
Michael and Joan Berry of Lawrenceville, Ga., had sued Brendon Park Apartments, Brendon Park Associates and First Management Services Inc. of Nashville for $3.1 million. The Knox County Circuit Court lawsuit alleged that the defendants failed to provide adequate security arrangements for the complex near Cedar Bluff Road and had not warned tenants about crimes in the vicinity prior to Johnia Berry's murder in December 2004.
The case was set for trial Feb. 5, but a notice filed today stated the case was being dropped after the parties had reached a settlement.

A new study shows that breastfeeding fights obesity later in life, according to the Seattle Times. British researchers reviewed body mass index (BMI) numbers for 740,000 post-menopausal women and found that those participants who breastfed their infants had a 1 percent lower body-fat measure than non-breastfeeding women for every six months that they nursed. Although there was no evidence that breastfeeding immediately induces a lower BMI (the average age of study participants was 57.5 years old), the later-in-life advantage has a wealth of health benefits for moms.
Who doesn't want to be thinner or at least have a healthy body type and weight? While we all have heard about the many benefits that breastfeeding has for the baby, this new research has a definite impact on mom herself. Unlike many of my mommy friends, I wasn't able to breastfeed. After having some fairly severe complications during delivery, I was left with two long-lasting truths: 1) I was fortunate to have a healthy baby boy, and 2) I had to take a daily medication that was contraindicated for breastfeeding. Basically, the meds passing through my breast milk would surely poison my son; making nursing a no-no. Little did know that my breastfeeding friends would end up at least 1 percent thinner than me when we reach middle age.
Not only does this study demonstrate the aesthetic benefits of breastfeeding (i.e., a thinner build), but it also speaks to the health advantages. Study co-author Valerie Beral stated, "A 1 percent reduction in BI may seem small, but spread across the population of the U.K., that could mean about 10,000 fewer premature deaths per decade from obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers". When it comes down to it, finding that breastfeeding fights obesity can translate into breastfeeding fighting the many diseases and conditions that come with a high BMI.

Photo Credit: MorguefileMotoGP correspondent Bruce Allen previews the Catalunya round of the 2011 season. Check back on Monday for the full report of the Catalan Grand Prix.
Heading into the 2011 season, hopes were running high for a number of premier class riders. Jorge Lorenzo was coming off his first MotoGP world championship. Teammate Ben Spies, last year’s ROY, earned a promotion to the Yamaha factory team and the high expectations that came along with it. The factory Honda team of Casey Stoner, Dani Pedrosa and Andrea Dovizioso spent the offseason blowing the competition away.
The iconic Valentino Rossi had the dreams of an entire nation riding with him, and newcomer Marco Simoncelli wasn’t backing down from anyone. Yet, barely two months and four rounds later, it’s shaping up as a two man race, as Lorenzo and Stoner have begun to elevate themselves above the fray, a trend that is likely to continue this weekend. The Gran Premi Aperol de Catalunya, the second of four Spanish rounds, offers an opportunity for the two rivals to further distance themselves from the field.
Recent Catalan History
The 2009 edition of the Barcelona round was, for me, one of the great MotoGP duels of all time, as Rossi eventually snaked teammate Lorenzo in the last turn to win by 9/100ths of a second. In that race, Stoner finished a distant third, an eyelash ahead of future teammate Dovizioso. Last year it was Lorenzo’s turn, winning by almost five seconds, while Pedrosa and Stoner slugged it out for second place, Pedrosa eventually prevailing despite having gone walkabout on Lap 1. The 2010 race was noteworthy not so much because three aliens took the podium, but because a couple of notable non-aliens – Randy de Puniet and Alvaro Bautista – claimed the fourth and fifth spots, respectively.
Bad Timing For Dani Pedrosa
My mother always told me that in life, timing is everything. She should have saved that noise for Dani Pedrosa, whose timing this season could not be worse. Catalunya marks the beginning of a six-races-in-eight-weeks sprint, and Pedrosa enters it with a busted wing, courtesy of that brutal takedown by Marco Simoncelli in France. On Wednesday, Pedrosa revealed what pretty much everyone had suspected – he is sitting out Round Five. I make him unlikely for Silverstone next week, and he will likely be less than 100% until at least August in Brno.
Pedrosa entered the weekend solidly in third place for the season, having podiumed in Qatar and Jerez and won in Portugal before the French debacle. He will remain stuck at 61 points this week and probably next. Meanwhile, both Lorenzo and Stoner have had success in Barcelona, as has Dovizioso, who trails Pedrosa by only 11 points heading into the weekend. It is highly likely that Pedrosa will find himself sitting in fifth or sixth place when Round 7 rolls around in Italy a month from now.
For a guy who had a legitimate shot at the 2011 title, this all must come as a crushing disappointment. That’s the bad news. The good news is that it promises the beginning of a new blood feud in the premier class, and you just can’t have too many of them. Heck, even the suits are getting involved, as Alberto Puig and Fausto Gresini have been exchanging shots in the media, Gresini insisting Simoncelli is getting a raw deal, and Puig suggesting that Simoncelli ought to go to jail for his conduct in France! Simmer down, fellas.
The Carlo Pernat Interview
Carlo Pernat is one of the classic characters of MotoGP, a crusty old Italian dude with an opinion on everything. He currently manages Loris Capirossi, a thankless task, and is an apologist for Marco Simoncelli. In a recent interview on the GPOne website, Carlo offered up some typically candid observations on the 2011 season, including:
- The season is over but for the shouting, as Stoner and Honda have a mortal lock on the title. Since last season, Honda has taken major strides forward, while Ducati has made virtually no progress and Yamaha has actually taken a step backward;
- Dani Pedrosa is too small in stature to compete for the title;
- His boy Simoncelli “lacks race vision,” which sounds much kinder than “is a threat to everyone on the grid, including the brolly girls”; and
- Rossi’s podium in France was deceptive, in that both Pedrosa and Simoncelli were clearly faster than The Doctor until the incident on Lap 18.
Simoncelli to the Race Direction Woodshed
In an unusual announcement on Monday, The Powers That Be have invited Simoncelli to a meeting in Catalunya to “further discuss” the Le Mans fiasco. This sounds a bit ominous, kind of like being invited by the KGB to the basement of the Lubyanka Prison to discuss one’s reactionary political views.
The “invitation” appears to have had the intended effect. Prior to this week, Simoncelli has stridently defended himself, claiming his racing style to be no more or less aggressive than anyone else on the track, which is, of course, pure nonsense. Suddenly, today, he appears to have had a change of heart. Today, it seems, he has realized the error of his ways, and is now promising to be a little more cautious on the track. Today, he wants to turn the page. Yeah.
Racing fans have long memories. For example, every year at Indianapolis I see guys wearing “Pedrosa Sucks” t-shirts, with Pedrosa’s run-in with Nicky Hayden at Estoril in 2006 is still front of mind. It will be interesting to see how long Simoncelli’s new religion lasts; my guess is that it will be largely gone by the second lap on Sunday, especially if he finds himself in contention.

Unfortunately, the Spanish Riviera will not be at its meteorological best this week, as the forecast calls for cool, damp conditions for the next five days. The best chance for rain, at this point, is Friday, and temps are expected to be in the low 70’s. As we’ve seen many times over the years – most recently at Jerez – cool wet weather is often accompanied by surprising race results. If the sun is shining, expect to see Stoner, Lorenzo and Dovizioso on the podium Sunday. If not, your guess is at least as good as mine.

MotoGP and other Professional Competition coverageBY RYAN BLACK | rblack@ledger-enquirer.com
AUBURN, Ala. — Auburn players never got tired of hearing the bell in the locker room this summer.

When the bell rang, it meant good things were happening, signifying that someone in the locker room achieved a personal record. The player doing the honors of ringing the bell, of course, was the same one who set a new high.
“When somebody rings the bell, it fuels the emotions in the weight room,” linebacker Jake Holland said Thursday. “Everybody gets pumped up and cheers everybody on. It makes it more of a unit instead of just one guy getting better.”
Strength and conditioning coach Ryan Russell’s program has done wonders for the Tigers, Holland said. Not just from helping them get into better shape, but due to the spirit of competition it fostered.
“He gives us goals, the PRs (personal records), that we like to hit,” Holland said. “A lot of people have hit that. That gives you a goal, a platform, to get better every week.”
Holland will similarly have to use fall camp as a platform to state his case for increased playing time. After starting 16 games over the last two seasons, Holland enters fall camp as the backup to Kris Frost at middle linebacker. In his four years at Auburn, Holland said he couldn’t recall a time when there was so much competition among the linebackers unit.
The Pelham, Ala., native welcomed the challenge it presents.
“I’m looking forward to getting better, going out there and learning from Coach (Ellis) Johnson and winning my spot back,” he said.
As tough as it is for an experienced player like Holland to crack the starting lineup, it’s even tougher for an incoming freshman joining the fray. It’s not just about learning what to do on the field. It means adapting to living on your own for the first time and dealing with the rigors of college-level classes.
So what advice does Holland have for true freshman Cameron Toney?
“Cameron and I are good friends,” he said. “I’m looking forward to passing it along to him, teaching him what I know. I’m looking forward to this camp to see what he has to offer. Coming from high school, it’s a big step. You’re living on your own. You’re having to go by a schedule everyday. It’s a little different. If you have guys ahead of you to show you the ropes like I did, it makes it a lot easier.”Follow The Republic on social media:

It nurtures individual creativity among its student body while instilling a deep sense of commitment to community. It offers excellent academic degree programs in several design fields that also prepare students for professional careers as high school teachers. In this sense, it is unlike any other Israeli institution of higher learning in design – namely, the integration of the cutting-edge in professional skills with teacher-training program.
The campus location, in the heart of Haifa's multi-cultural German Colony neighborhood, reflects the ethnic mix of the students as well as the School's mission to foster mutual respect and encourage continuous dialogue. The NB School – a non-profit making organization - is a recognized academic institution authorized by Israel's Council of Higher Education to award Bachelor degrees to its graduates (B. Ed, B.Arch.Ed, B.Ed.FA & B.Ed.Des).
DESIGNERS OF THE NEXT GENERATION
The NB Haifa School of Design awards academic degrees in five main disciplines:
Visual Communications;
Architecture;
Photography & Media; Non-Fiction Film
Fashion Design;
Management
Some 750 young Israelis are enrolled in these programs (with additional 350 students participating in non-academic diploma-studies). The majority hail from Israel's northern region.
The. The School's faculty-members are active teaching-oriented individuals, as well as creative professionals. Many are acclaimed in their fields, and participate in artistic activities (including exhibitions, master-classes and workshops) in Israel and abroad. They interact with their students in small, hands-on classes, and freely share their own real-life experiences.
A STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY
Situated mid-way between Haifa's harbor and the world-famous Bahai Gardens, the NB School fully addresses the needs of a modern educational facility, with state-of-the-art laboratories, a modern resource center, "smart" classrooms and sophisticated visual communications equipment. The campus includes a large outdoor area, the Entrance Plaza, connecting The School and the German Colony neighborhood, and an amazing top-floor balcony with a view of the Mediterranean Sea. Both offer students a place to meet, a corner to read, or a quiet spot to enjoy a moment of reflection. their began the rout with an 11th-minute volley and, although Germany looked to be the better team after an early period of Brazil pressure, there was little indication of the devastation about to be unleashed.

In Parkinson’s disease, this means replacing dopamine cells in the brain, the main type of cell that degenerates in this disease.
In November, Center investigators published a study on a new strategy for using embryonic stem (ES) cells to graft human dopamine neurons into preclinical models of Parkinson’s disease. Historically, ES cells have shown the ability to become dopamine-producing neurons in the test tube, but have not been effective at treating Parkinson’s disease when transplanted into a living organism. However, the new technique has revealed promise in three animal models of Parkinson’s, reflecting the potential for dopamine cells’ survival and function in the brain.◅

Reply by Madness_Hero, posted on May 07, 13These delicate rose cookies are an all-time Christmas favorite in many countries. They are crisp and delicious little cookies, light and ethereal, crunchy and beautiful! The cookies are made using a rosette iron. In Sweden and Norway, these delicacies are called Scandinavian Rosettes. The shape of the cookie depends on the rosette iron. In India, they are known by various names – achappam, roce cookies, etc.
It is not the cookie dough that is shaped or dropped here, but the cookie batter – sounds odd, doesn’t it? A few simple ingredients go into a simple batter – eggs, sugar, milk, all-purpose flour, and a pinch of salt (vanilla optional) are combined to form a crepe-like batter. Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or wok, and immerse the rosette iron in the oil. Carefully, lift the iron and dip into the batter, making sure you do not immerse the iron in the batter. If completely immersed in the batter, the cookie will not come off the iron. It takes about a minute for each cookie to turn golden brown, remove, and drain on paper towels. Cool and store in an airtight container. Dust confectioners’ sugar before serving (optional).
Rosette irons come in various shapes and sizes, and here is my rosette iron.

Pete's New Haven Style Apizza in Washington, D.C., had just opened its third location, and the owners needed to bring in new people fast. Naturally, they tried a Groupon daily deal promotion: customers could pay $10 and get a coupon for $20 in food at the newest restaurant, no restrictions.
"We sold a huge amount quickly," said co-founder Joel Mehr—6,000 certificates, to be exact. Business swelled at the start and then again at the end of the promotion in September 2011. Then things slowed again. With $90,000 worth of redeemed meals translated into actual hard food costs of $18,000, Mehr says, "I don't think it was a bad one-time thing to do." But Pete's won't repeat the experience in the near future.
"We're not doing any more promotions with anyone of this style, mainly because we have no control over when we discount people coming into the restaurant," Mehr said. Having to honor discounts on a busy weekend night was counterproductive because the restaurant was already busy with "people in line waiting to pay full price for pizza."
It could have been worse. Since daily deal sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial became hot last year, there have been high-profile stories of restaurants that lost thousands from promotions gone wrong. And yet, many establishments have successfully used them. Differences between winners and losers are clear strategic use of promotions; negotiation with the deal company; and smartly-constructed offerings that make money (or at least don't lose it).
Daily deal sites get merchants to offer heavily-discounted specials. The site sends the promotion out to its e-mail list of subscribers. Would-be customers purchase the special in advance. The deal site collects the money and pays a portion to the restaurant (often amortized over a multi-month life of the promotion). The customer presents the appropriate coupon on arrival for the food or service.
Aside from anecdotes in newspapers and on websites, how have restaurants taken to daily deals? A recent study by food-industry market research firm Technomic showed that about 40 percent of the 400 restaurants it surveyed had participated in a daily deal promotion. The experience of the restaurants was surprising.
"Conventional wisdom is that it's a good deal for the consumers and a bad deal for the restaurants," said Technomic executive vice president Robert Goldin. That's because the deal sites supposedly take half of the revenue and control too much of how the promotion will work. But, as Goldin put it, "conventional wisdom is usually not wisdom."
About half of the establishments had overall positive experiences, with 69 percent seeing new customers and 53 percent getting at least some repeat business from the new customers. "It's working for some but not others," he says. You can see the contrast in the single case of Zapatista, a Mexican restaurant with three Chicago locations.
In January 2010, when its second location was four months old, Zapatista offered a $40 coupon for $20 through Groupon to build traffic to the new site. "We sold 4,000 of them, and it was overwhelming at times," says president David Yanda. "It served its purpose of getting our name out, but from a business sense of making any money, that didn't happen."
The coupons represented $160,000 of food at list price represented. Roughly 27 percent food and an 80 percent redemption rate meant an actual outlay of about $35,000. Because the deal ran from January into the restaurant's busy summer season and the new location was naturally growing its own customer base, it wasn't possible to determine how much the promotion contributed to long-term improved traffic. Under the deal terms, Groupon kept too much of the revenue to make the experience economically worthwhile on its own.
And yet, Yanda is in the middle of another Groupon promotion. Why? Management at Zapatista has become smarter about how to use daily deals and robust competition for Groupon has made effective negotiation a lot easier.
The most recent promotion started in September 2011 to generate traffic and word-of-mouth for the third location. Yanda structured prix fixe deals ± $29 for two people and $89 for six—that included an appetizer, entrée, beverage and dessert. Because the non-entrée items had relatively high-margin items, much of the discount was off items that had low food costs. Zapatista could structure a meal that let the restaurant actually make money on every customer.
Groupon needs to close business deals to keep growing and to keep competitors at bay. It isn't in a good position to walk away, so Yanda negotiated an arrangement under which Groupon's take was "in the neighborhood" of 25 percent. That was far better than the 50 percent it has often tried to get from merchants and increased the money Zapatista could make per deal.
Furthermore, Yanda limited redemption times to avoid busy weekend nights, when tables could be filled with customers paying full price, and capped the total number. As a result, Yanda not only got a promotion that fulfilled an important goal—increase foot traffic at a new location, though attracting people to an additional part of the day or new menu offering would also make sense—and also offered a positive ROI.
That wouldn't surprise Goldin. By time-limiting discounts; focusing on parts of the menu that can support discounting; and, most importantly, learning how competition is forcing daily deal sites to be more accommodating, he said restaurateurs can make effective use of discount sites as one of their marketing tools without losing their shirts in the process.

El Paso Pipeline Partners Increases Quarterly Distribution to $0.58 Per Unit
<p class='bwalignc'> <b>Distribution Up 18% From Third Quarter 2011</b> </p>
Wednesday, October 17, 2012
El Paso Pipeline Partners Increases Quarterly Distribution to $0.58 Per Unit16:07 EDT Wednesday, October 17, 2012 HOUSTON (Business Wire) -- El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EPB) today increased its quarterly cash distribution per common unit to $0.58 ($2.32 annualized) payable on Nov. 14, 2012, to unitholders of record as of Oct. 31, 2012. This represents an 18 percent increase over the third quarter 2011 cash distribution per unit of $0.49 ($1.96 annualized) and a 5 percent increase from $0.55 per unit ($2.20 annualized) for the second quarter of 2012. EPB has increased its cash distribution 18 consecutive quarters since its initial public offering in November 2007. Chairman and CEO Richard D. Kinder said, “EPB had a good third quarter. Our performance reflects solid results from our stable, regulated pipeline and storage assets, significantly increased demand from natural gas fired power plants and contributions from dropdowns. Looking ahead, we expect EPB to realize cost and growth synergies as a result of Kinder Morgan, Inc.'s acquisition of El Paso Corporation, which closed in the second quarter this year.” EPB reported third quarter distributable cash flow before certain items of $149 million, a 32 percent increase from $113 million for the comparable period in 2011. Distributable cash flow per unit before certain items was $0.71, compared to $0.55 for the third quarter last year. Third quarter net income before certain items was $154 million compared to $118 million for the same period in 2011. Including certain items, net income was $151 million versus $131 million for the third quarter last year. For the first nine months, EPB generated distributable cash flow before certain items of $427 million, up 16 percent from $369 million for the first three quarters of 2011. Distributable cash flow per unit before certain items was $2.06 compared to $1.89 for the comparable period last year. Net income before certain items was $426 million versus $405 million for the first three quarters of 2011. Including certain items, net income was $411 million compared to $460 million for the same period last year. The 2012 certain items for the first nine months total a net loss of $15 million, while the 2011 certain items for the first three quarters totaled a net gain of $55 million. Business Overview For the third quarter, EPB's assets produced total earnings before DD&A and certain items of $299 million, up 17 percent from $256 million for the same period of 2011. “Growth in the quarter was driven by contributions from the May 24 dropdown transaction in which EPB acquired the remaining 14 percent interest in Colorado Interstate Gas (CIG) and all of Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline,” Kinder said. “Additionally, EPB benefited from completed expansion projects on Southern Natural Gas (SNG) and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities on both SNG and CIG. Gas fired power generation demand on SNG was up 26 percent compared to the third quarter of 2011 and 47 percent versus the first nine months of the year. CIG realized an increase in natural gas fired power generation demand of 13 percent versus the third quarter last year and 44 percent compared to the first three quarters of 2011.” Outlook As previously announced, EPB expects to grow its distributions per unit at an annual rate of approximately 9 percent from 2011 to 2015. EPB expects to declare cash distribution of $2.25 per unit for 2012, a 17 percent increase over the $1.93 per unit it distributed for 2011. “EPB's distribution is supported by a diversified portfolio of pipeline and LNG assets which generate consistent cash flow through various market conditions, as more than 90 percent of EPB's revenues are derived from fixed-demand charges,” Kinder said. In 2012, EPB expects to generate cash flow in excess of distributions of over $95 million and earnings before DD&A of almost $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately $80 million from 2011. Other News Southern LNG Company (SLNG) filed an application with the Department of Energy in August requesting long-term, multi-contract authorization to export up to 4 million tons per year of LNG (equivalent to approximately 0.5 billion cubic feet of gas per day) from its Elba Island Terminal in Chatham County, Ga., near Savannah. The authorization would allow the export of LNG from the terminal to any non Free Trade Agreement (FTA) country. The application is the second part of a two-part export authorization request by SLNG. In June, SLNG received DOE authorization to export domestically produced LNG to FTA countries. CIG has submitted an application to the FERC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and authorization to construct a new, 7.75-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral, system modifications and appurtenant facilities to the High Plains System to make it bi-directional, enhancing flexibility and transport capacity. The fully subscribed $25 million High Plains expansion project would provide up to 600,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of additional takeaway capacity from the Denver-Julesburg basin to Kinder Morgan's Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colo. Two shippers have signed long-term, firm-service contracts for 250,000 Dth/d of natural gas, with the right to ramp up to 500,000 Dth/d after the first year. CIG is requesting that the FERC issue the project a certificate by April 1, 2013, to allow time to construct and place certain facilities into service by June 30, 2013, with the remaining facilities to be completed by Oct. 31, 2013. SNG has executed a five-year contract extension associated with moving volumes from an existing Mississippi receipt point to a new location at Rose Hill, Miss. The volume shift, combined with facility modifications, will produce added system efficiencies for both SNG and Tennessee Gas Pipeline (owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners). Volumes total 285,000 Dth/d. The incremental revenue for this receipt point has a total term value of more than $48 million. The project is expected to be in service Nov. 1, 2013. SNG successfully extended 1.2 Bcf/d of firm contracts through Sept. 1, 2014. The contracts were set to expire Sept. 1, 2013.

Airy home, 11-year-old Rasheed Johnson traveled to the Borough's Fresh Start Program to receive an even better one, a shiny red Olympic Top Pro Wheel Chair.
"I've waited all my life to get this chair," Rasheed said.
When they heard of his plight, the operators of Fresh Start told the children they serve in Darby Borough. Borough officials, along with state elected officials and other organizations in Delaware County, organized a fundraiser that raised money to get Rasheed a new one.
"I'm really amazed caused no one imagined that people would do this," Rasheed said.
"I love this community, it's amazing how people can come together when a tragedy happens; it's really amazing and I am blessed and thankful to this community," Rasheed's mother Stacy said.
It is extraordinary for a community which has seen more than its share of suffering and tragedy to reach out to help a boy in Mt. Airy.
"It is definitely our pleasure to do this for him; it is definitely our pleasure to do this for him," Darby Borough Mayor Janice Davis said.
But Rasheed did not come empty-handed. The event was also aimed at giving thanks a week before Thanksgiving, complete with a warm meal for needy children.
"We all cooked and even Rasheed made some sweet potatoes," Fresh Start Program CEO Leslie McGirth said.
He also helped hand out food baskets to needy families.
"This is wonderful and I hope that we can continue doing things for other people," Joyce Goberson of Darby said.
Darby Borough is more often than not in the news for something bad happening; tonight saw a shining city of good will and generosity bringing joy even to a boy who's not even from their own town.Multiculturalism, Group Rights, and the Adoption Conundrum

I.
In a volume focused on adoption it may seem odd to be reviewing books that make no explicit mention of children, much less adoption. The books discussed here, Will Kymlicka's (2001) Politics in the Vernacular: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Citizenship, and Bikhu Parekh's (2000) Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory, are recent additions to the debate over multiculturalism. Growing out of both communitarian and post-colonial critiques of liberalism over the past 30 years, this debate has developed a number of distinct strands. For purposes here, however, it may be characterized as a discussion around the broad issue of whether and to what extent cultural groups may demand legal recognition, protection, and accommodation for what might be loosely termed "cultural rights." The debate has gained prominence in the past two decades as aboriginal groups and a number of disadvantaged cultural minorities have worked to secure recognition and respect for cultural identities and cultural practices in both domestic and international human rights arenas.
Every contemporary nation-state is grappling with the problem of creating stability in plural societies. Each must come to terms with the need to create conditions under which diverse groups can participate and flourish while ensuring that the whole has sufficient unity and commonality to endure as a social and political unit. With this end in mind, both Kymlicka and Parekh seek to develop a political theory of multiculturalism that envisions a politics attentive to the fact of cultural difference. Both are centrally concerned with the capacity of modern nationstates to move from assimilationist to more genuinely plural and inclusive practices.
Kynlicka approaches the issue as a liberal; his book is chiefly concerned with convincing his (largely liberal) critics that recognizing group rights and group identities is not only consistent with, but furthers, such primary liberal values as individual autonomy, and that this liberal multicultural framework enhances democratic practices in general. Parekh, on the other hand, worries that an expressly liberal theory cannot be genuinely multicultural because it will always devalue nonliberal cultures. His effort, therefore, is to introduce a dialogic model of multiculturalism that will protect the integrity and existence of both liberal and nonliberal cultural groups within a given national community. Both books, in essence, argue for reconstructing nation-states along looser, less culturally homogeneous axes.
Focused as the books are on the meta-questions of nationbuilding, this debate may appear to have little bearing on issues arising out of regulating the family, particularly adoption. However, in the multiculturalism debate writ large, children, although rarely acknowledged, figure prominently. Many of the rights sought are critically tied to children, to whom distinct ways of seeing, speaking, and belonging must be passed if a cultural group is to maintain its integrity and cohesion. For many disadvantaged groups, the task is not only to protect a set of existing cultural understandings but also to revive cultural understandings that have been displaced or obliterated by dominant cultures. In addition, for groups whose members have been scattered and (more or less) assimilated into a dominant culture, there may be a strong imperative to gather the diaspora of a community.
The questions surrounding the recognition of cultural identity and securing that identity with legally cognizable rights are thus grounded in more fundamental questions about how the boundaries of individual and communal belonging are imagined in theory and effected in law and public policy. …Hotel Tropico Playa

on naming of John Sharp as next Chancellor of Texas A&M University System
"I have often said that education is the greatest equalizer that allows all Texans to reach their full potential, achieve economic success, and contribute to the growth and prosperity of this state. The individuals that lead our institutions of higher education have a tremendous responsibility for attracting and retaining the best talent and making sure that students receive a top-notch education. That is why I am pleased that the regents of the Texas A&M University System have chosen John Sharp as their next Chancellor.
"I am confident that his extensive experience and well-known ability to innovate will help bring about exciting opportunities for the students, faculty, employees, and the Texas A&M Campuses around the state such as Texas A&M Corpus Christi and the Texas A&M School of Rural Public Health in my district.
"Sharp's appointment is great news Texas and especially for South Texas given his familiarity with the needs of our students and the huge potential that exists for expanding educational opportunities in this area."The country has an area of 4,361 square miles and a population of 1.7,.Will Prince George be a Marlborough College boy?

Will Prince George be a Marlborough College boy?
Updated 8:41am Monday 14th July 2014 in Latest News By Staff reporter
Speculation is growing that Prince George could eventually be educated, at least partly, in Wiltshire.
When Duchess of Cambridge was 14 she withdrew from independent girls' school Downe House in Cold Ash, Berkshire, after just two terms after being bullied.
Kate started afresh at Marlborough College, where each term costs £11,030,'s grandfather the Prince of Wales also had a difficult time at secondary school. He was sent to Gordonstoun School in Moray, Scotland, following in the footsteps of the Duke of Edinburgh, but was picked on and described his days there as "a prison sentence".
Charles did admit, however, that the school instilled him with self-discipline and a sense of responsibility. It was also where Zara and Peter Phillips, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex were educated.
The exclusive £11,478-a-term boarding school Eton College is well practised at protecting royal princes and also has the advantage of being close to Windsor Castle in Berkshire.
William attended Eton..
Both William and Kate went on to achieve a 2:1 at degree level.Hotel Casafort

that actions speak louder than words is surely true!

During Obama’s first term, the U.S. and Russia agreed to limit their stockpiles to 1,550 weapons as part of the New START Treaty. But in his second term, Obama faces a Russia that feels it must be assertive to make up for what it feels is its diminished stature in the world and, moreover, faces the loss of a client state in Syria.
And Russian foreign-policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told the AP that any plans for further arms reduction would have to involve nuclear-armed nations beyond just the U.S. and Russia.
This might have been just cautionary rhetoric because the chances of getting Britain, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea — and, maybe one day, Iran — around one table to talk arms reduction have to be close to nil.
Obama promised the crowd at the Brandenburg Gate that he would work with NATO allies to achieve “bold reductions” in European-based tactical nuclear weapons.
The German government would happily see the U.S. remove its remaining tactical nukes from German soil, but other NATO countries might object, seeing the presence of even a limited number of weapons as insurance against Russia’s far-larger arsenal.
If the Russians don’t appear to be terribly cooperative, Obama still has congressional Republicans to deal with. Rep. Michael Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, accused the president of seeking the approval of nations that only want to see the United States weakened.
Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that any agreement with the Russians should be in the form of a treaty, meaning the Senate would get to vote on it, and that the president should first modernize the existing U.S. nuclear arsenal..”Gateway slashes workforce after poor results
Weak demand will leave swollen inventories
PC manufacturer Gateway will lay off ten per cent of its workforce globally - some 3000 people - and announced fourth quarter results well below previous estimates.
In a statement, Gateway blamed a slow down of demand for PCs and increased pricing pressures for its disappointing results
Gateway reported a loss of $94.3 million, for the quarter ending 31 December. This included a previously announced $187 million pre-tax charge to earnings related primarily to a write-down on the company's technology investments, without which Gateway would have reported net income of $37.6 million.
The firm recorded revenue of $2.37 billion for the quarter against the $2.64 billion expected by analysts.
Gateway reported full-year 2000 profits of $315.9 million on revenues of $9.7 billion, a 28 per cent decrease from 1999. It will take a charge of $50 million in its first quarter to make the job cuts.
Gateway's announcement followed a profit warning from Hewlett-Packard, which is also being affected by weak demand for PCs.
"Softer sales have caused inventories of our competitors to swell, and have touched off an aggressive pricing environment that will have negative consequences for the PC sector for the next six months," said Jeff Weitzen, Gateway's president and chief executive. ®

Favourite SoftwareThe US capital could well be the only city in the world where lobbyists spend US$3 billion on something that they themselves insist is not even for sale: the votes of US lawmakers.
Washington is crawling with lobbyists — 10,199 of them to be exact, according to Opensecrets.org, the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics.
Over the years, they have come to symbolize the sour side of influencing the powerful and power-hungry in the US Congress, with massive amounts of money sloshing around the notorious K Street corridors lobbyists call home.
Total lobbying spending — seeking congressional or government action on anything from health, energy and transportation industries to defense and agribusiness — amounted to US$3.32 billion last year and this year is on track for about the same.
In an election year like this one, fundraising events can run morning, noon and night.
“Congress is here this week, so there could be dozens every day,” said Kathy Kiely, managing editor of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group seeking more government transparency.
In an effort to shed light on the nexus between lobbying and congressional campaigns, she collects invitations to such events and posts them on a Web site.
The sheer number of fundraisers illustrates the outsized role money has come to play in US politics — and it has only increased since the last election cycle, after a US Supreme Court decision loosened contribution restrictions.
On one day this month, no fewer than 14 receptions were -recorded by Sunlight, starting with an 8am breakfast for Democrat John Garamendi (US$1,000 to US$1,500 per person), a lunch for Michael Fitzpatrick (US$500 to US$1,000) at the Capitol Hill Club — a private social club for Republicans — and a Mexican fiesta for Democrat Ed Pastor (US$500 to US$1,000).
Pastor, a 10-term congressman from Arizona, has already raised US$530,845 for the November elections, but it is still not enough.
“You just try to keep going and raise as much money as you can,” he said, before heading into the event. “If you don’t have money, your campaign will not be very successful ... It takes money, so you need to raise it.”
In the heat of a re-election campaign, lawmakers can devote up to 30 hours a week fundraising by telephone or in receptions, -Sunlight’s policy director John Wonderlich said.
However, does that constitute buying influence? In a moment of candor, Pastor said that it could be viewed that way.
Lobbyists and contributors “do have some influence because Arizona companies, they hire Arizona people, so you have got to be cognizant that your constituents have to be employed and you also have to deal with their interests,” he said.
One figure who long symbolized the ethical shortcomings of lobbyists’ attempts to woo lawmakers was Jack Abramoff.
At the height of his influence, he led a team of 40 lobbyists and had access to the White House. He was jailed in 2006 on corruption charges.
Abramoff claims his 43 months in prison redeemed him and he now crusades against the -institution he once dominated.
“If you ask any member of Congress, they are going to tell you that their vote is not for sale for a US$2,000 check, and they are probably right in the abstract,” he said.
“The problem is this: once you do something like that for a public servant, once you do something that engenders gratitude from somebody, either they are going to express that gratitude overtly and they are going to do something directly back for you, or they are at least going to view you more favorably,” Abramoff added.

I wish I had had a b&w glen plaid tie for the few weddings I attended this summer--looking to buy one now, I see that the recommended ones are silk. However, I had always imagined it (and think I would prefer it) in wool.

Although wool is usually described as more casual, since glen plaid originated in wool, would a wool glen-plaid tie be a traditional/appropriate choice? Silk + glen plaid seems like an anachronism, or ana-textilism.
Well Gents,
I put up the good fight...
I tried to "convince" her with the wedding ties suggested here; a solid silver and a small houndstooth, and finally to oblige her, I tried the white one. Reception was quite good to the first two ties, better than expected, but her face completely lit up when I turned around wearing the white one. At that point, I knew the gravity of giving in to her surely innocuous request. Any reasoning about traditional dress was ignored and at points created frustration. So I am opting for the happy wife equals a happy life.
Here are two pictures: The first a white tie, the second the silver, which was an exact match to the previously suggested Drake's Solid Silver Reppe.
How's that saying go again about permission and forgiveness...

Arrrrggg!The Full House Reviewed shirt is finally here!!! You can buy one right here!!!
I was supposed to get this done about 2 Seasons ago, but I only recently enlisted the help of Bay Area t-shirt company Like Minded People to finally bring you our very first t-shirt. I couldn’t have done it without them! The image for the shirt is also the logo for our new site (which we’ll be fully switching over to later this week~there will be a site redirect on this wordpress account and we’re working to forward the site to people’s rss feeds…), which was drawn by an artist who wanted to remain anonymous for some reason. What, you’re too good to be associated with the Full House blog? Anyway, all of the shirts are hand silk screened and are printed on nice, fancy shirts. Right now they come in 2 different colors but we might make more if there’s a demand.
I would also like to publicly invite Brandon Rowland to e-mail me his info at billysuperstar@gmail.com so I can finally send the shirt I promised him like a year ago. Brandon won our very first contest by getting Dave Coulier to mention the site on twitter. I honestly didn’t think that anyone would win that contest so I was pretty unprepared to award him his shirt, but now I can finally make good on my promise. I hope you’ll send us a picture, Brandon!
Thanks to all you readers for making this happen! I hope y’all meant it when you said you wanted to buy a FHR shirt! I can’t think of a better present for the holidays!Even if Sacha Baron Cohen‘s blue-skinned love child.”

Did Obama 'Blink' ? Joint US-Israel drill postponed to 'defuse Iran tensions'.
Obama 'Blinked' - Joint US-Israel drill postponed to 'defuse Iran tensions'.(Ynet).
A major joint Israel-US military drill, which was set to take place in a few weeks time with the participation of thousands of IDF and US army soldiers, has been postponed by at least six months, Ynet reported Sunday. The decision was made by Defense Ministry officials in coordination with the Pentagon. A number of global media outlets said the exercise will likely take place in the summer – at the earliest.
Israeli officials said the Americans asked to delay the drill so as not to heighten tensions with Iran over its nuclear program and avoid drawing any additional attention from the Arab countries during such a turbulent period. Security establishment officials said the decision was also related, in part, to budgetary concerns. The decision to postpone the drill comes after the US condemned last week's assassination of a nuclear scientist in Tehran and after US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the recent developments in the Islamic Republic..
Obama Has Silenced the Republicans.
Obama Has Silenced the Republicans.(JI).By Prof. Paul Eidelberg.That Barack Obama should disparage the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, the two foundational documents that enabled him to realize what he called the “audacity of hope,” is a monumental display of what animates America’s first black president, the Audacity of Ignorance and Arrogance.
But no less appalling is the incompetent assortment of Republican presidential candidates who hope to replace him. Obama is the perfect target for a candidate that wants to restore American Exceptionalism, for as John Bolton, former US ambassador to the United Nations observed long before the current presidential primaries, Obama is the first “post-American” president. Especially blameworthy is one of the more competent candidates on domestic affairs, former Speaker of the House of Representatives New Gingrich. Gingrich, a professor of history, is familiar with the celebrated “Lincoln-Douglas” debates. Indeed, Gingrich reported in his website—note its name—that Barak Obama, ensconced as President of the United States, skipped the phrase “our Creator” at least four times when citing the Declaration of Independence, even though the teleprompter included the words we are “endowed by our Creator.” See, American Exceptionalism, Vol. 6, No. 25, June 22, 2011. Why doesn’t Gingrich expose Obama’s anti-Americanism? This is what Abraham Lincoln did in his 1860 campaign against Senator Frederick Douglas, who Lincoln accused of violating “our ancient faith” embodied in the Declaration of Independence. Almost any Republican candidate could do this with the exception of Ron Paul, a gentleman from the “American First” school of politics who alas, is also an ignoramus. Obama is a perfect target for Republican candidate concerned about the decline of American Exceptionalism. He can be exposed as a cultural or moral relativist, which would explain the anti-Christian posture he has taken throughout his presidency. The question arises: What’s lacking among the Republican Party candidates? Is it political wisdom or political courage?Are the Republicans afraid of being accused of “racism”? Are they afraid of being accused of Islamo-phobia?Are there no politicians in America with courage and intelligence enough to warn their fellow Americans that when Obama campaigned in 2008 on the theme of CHANGE, he had nothing less in mind than a fundamental change in the political character of the regime—a bloodless revolution? This revolution would stifle individual freedom, on the one hand, and transform the government into bureaucratic welfare state, on the other. In fact, it is precisely in terms of this political revolution that we should understand his political and judicial appointments, as well as his devastation of the economy, which is intended to expand the powers and functions of the bureaucracy which he is stuffing or staffing.An abundance of facts can and should be cited to illustrate Obama’s radical intentions—which may readily be linked to his anti-American supporters, for example, George Soros. But mindless fear seems to have silenced the most eligible Republican candidates.If this is the case, none will expose the greatest threat to America and Judeo-Christian civilization than Islam, to which Obama bowed when he genuflected to Saudi King Abdullah and supported the PLO over against Israel.
Why hasn’t the Republican Party exposed Obama’s treachery?

The Dutch government built the Westerbork refugee camp in 1939 in the north east of the Netherlands.

- Obama, US secretary of defense have warned Jerusalem of dangerous repercussions of strike.(JPost).The United States has begun taking measures to plan for an Israeli strike on Iran in order to protect US facilities in the region, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.The contingency planning came as a result of concern within the US defense establishment that Israel is planning to attack Iran over the Islamic Republic's reported nuclear armament program, according to the newspaper.US President Barack Obama, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and other senior US officials have reportedly delivered messages through private channels to the Israeli government warning them about the dangerous repercussions of a military strike on Iran.Washington is concerned that Iraqi Shi'ite militias may attack the US embassy in Baghdad at Iran's behest. Some 15,000 US diplomats, federal employees and contractors will likely remain in Iraq, the newspaper reported.

-.In its editorial (£) this morning, the Times still clings to the delusion that the ‘Arab Spring’ was the harbinger of democracy in the region. Although it coyly concedes that ‘the path of change is strewn with uncertainties’ such as the fact that ‘Sunni extremist parties have gained electoral support in Egypt, while Coptic Christians have suffered murderous attacks’, such, ah, ‘uncertainties' do not deter the Times from concluding nevertheless that ‘The Arab Spring is nonetheless a movement as inspiring as the fall of communism.’ If the Times was hoping to win this week’s Pangloss Award for the most asinine display of intellectual blindness and wishful thinking, it has surely been pipped at the post by the British Foreign Secretary, William Hague who has also written in the Times. After entering at the start his own coy caveat: ‘Violence and votes for Islamism are a setback but this was never a quick fix’ he nevertheless passes smoothly on from this setback to reason to the quick fix of fantasy: ‘...being realistic does not mean losing faith.

Dane-Elec turned over for the second time this year
Dane-Elec today warned fellow memory distributors to keep DRAM under surveillance following a robbery at their warehouse. The Surrey-based distributor said it was broken into at 2am this morning. But the robbers were disturbed by a security guard and got away with less kit than they intended. Alan Stanley, Dane-Elec general manager, confirmed £100K-worth of 128MB and 64MB modules was stolen. He warn distributors to be "extra vigilant with their memory at the moment. "Be on your guard. And if you see any cheap product, be wary of it." Dane-Elec UK was turned over by villains seven months ago. DRAM robberies -- burglaries, ram raids(where villains rammed vehicles through warehouse doors and hijacks were common in Britain in the heydays of high memory prices (1994-1996.

As ever you can add fuel to the fire below…
I’m in a bit of a pickle. This week (and we’re only half-way through it so far) I’ve spent about an hour of my time scrolling through this tumblr of brides throwing cats. Of course they’re not actual brides throwing actual cats, or rather they are actual brides, but the cats have been photoshopped in by a person, or persons, with a fair bit of time on their hands. The photoshopping itself isn’t especially convincing; I can see perfectly clearly that these aren’t real images, but there’s something so absurd about cats being hurled through the air at a wedding that I’m powerless to stop scrolling.
This isn’t the first time this has happened. There’s an endless stream of blogs out there with similar content, like the London Grumblr, these famous movie posters improved by sharks, and then of course there’s all the Disney princesses with Nicholas Cage’s head on. Every week more of these ‘resources’ vie for my attention (these are all taken from the last few weeks of The Weekender) luring me into their vapid content like the Daily Mail’s sidebar of shame.
Even though I know it’s wrong, I still enjoy this method of killing time, but it does make me wonder what kind of legacy we’re leaving behind in the vast digital wasteland of the internet. Will we look back in years to come at these airborne cats and laugh still? One day far in the future will I tuck my children into bed and show them vintage gifs on the London Grumblr instead of reading them a story, or when I’m old and haggard will I toothlessly reminisce with similarly ancient friends about that blog that stuck shark heads on movie posters? I hope not.
In general I think of this kind of online content as being temporary and having no real longevity. I expect in a year’s time that the Nicholas Cage/Disney princess fad will have finished and its creator moved on to loftier pursuits (maybe pictures of Danny Glover with Mel Gibson’s mouth or Ryan Gosling licking himself). But then, just to completely contradict that idea we printed these cats in famous paintings in last year’s It’s Nice That Annual and gave longevity to something that’s otherwise impermanent. Now I will actually be able to look back on this strange subsection of the online community in a physical printed book that features these coffee break entertainers alongside actual real-world artists and designers.
It’s safe to say I’m left confused about this part of modern culture, despite being right in the middle of it all. What will happen to all this online content in the future? Will this pastime just fade and die as other web-based trends come into play? Is it inherently wrong to print this kind of stuff in a book or should I just stop thinking about it, chill the heck out and get back to my cats and brides?
Please help!Medical Marijuana Advocates File Lawsuit Challenging L.A. Dispensary Ordinance
Medical Marijuana Advocates File Lawsuit Challenging L.A. Dispensary Ordinance
Restrictive provisions amount to de facto ban on otherwise legal dispensaries
Los Angeles, CA — The country’s largest medical marijuana advocacy organization, Americans for Safe Access (ASA), filed a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles today, claiming that certain provisions in a recently adopted regulatory ordinance would shut down virtually all dispensaries in the city. The local medical marijuana law passed by the City Council and signed by Mayor Villaraigosa on February 3rd requires dispensaries to find a new location within 7 days after the ordinance takes effect. In order to comply with the ordinance, dispensaries must be located at least 1,000 feet from schools, parks, libraries, churches and other so-called “sensitive uses,” and cannot abut or be across the street from any residence, which excludes almost all commercial areas in the city.
.” Despite spending more than two years to develop regulations, the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance without maps to show where dispensaries could locate in order to comply with the law.
Among other restrictive provisions, the Los Angeles regulations require that dispensaries “notify the City Clerk within one week after the effective date of this ordinance of their intention to register…at an identified location.” The lawsuit’s plaintiffs, Venice Beach Care Center and PureLife Alternative Wellness Center, two dispensaries that have operated in Los Angeles since before the city’s moratorium, call the 7-day requirement to find a new site unnecessarily prohibitive. Plaintiffs further argue that without the assistance of maps such a requirement is inconceivable.
“We want to work with the city to comply with its regulations, but such unreasonable requirements make compliance impossible,” said plaintiff Yamileth Bolanos of PureLife Alternative Wellness Center. “We are more than willing to negotiate a compromise that would cut short costly litigation.” The plaintiffs understand that the City of Los Angeles is facing a budget shortfall of more than $200 million and want to strike a fair balance between the concerns of elected officials and the needs of thousands of area patients that rely on local dispensaries. Given the city’s economic crisis, many also question the rationale of expensive enforcement action recently taken by the Los Angeles City Attorney.
Over the past few years, more than 40 California localities have adopted ordinances regulating dispensaries. According to advocates, the Los Angeles regulatory ordinance is one of the most recent and most restrictive in the state. Advocates claim that certain provisions in the local law threaten to shut down all of the city’s dispensaries and amount to a de facto ban. “The whole point of the moratorium was to study the impact of restrictions like these,” said ASA spokesperson Kris Hermes. “Unfortunately, a sufficient assessment never happened.” The Planning Department was unable to provide residential buffer zone maps prior to the passage of the ordinance and, according to city staff, may never be able to produce them.
Both plaintiff dispensaries have operated since 2006 without any negative incidents, criminal or otherwise, and have established good relations with neighbors. A recent study commissioned by Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, comparing the number of crimes in 2009 at the city’s banks and medical marijuana dispensaries, found that 71 robberies had occurred at the more than 350 banks in the city, compared to 47 robberies at the more than 500 medical marijuana facilities. Chief Beck observed that, “banks are more likely to get robbed than medical marijuana dispensaries,” and that the claim that dispensaries attract crime “doesn’t really bear out.”

This is an archived mail posted to the Subversion Dev
mailing list.January 06, 2012
When I was last in the Big Bagel (as I call Noo Yawk), a policeman who’d been awarded countless commendations for bravery over 22 years of front-line service was allegedly murdered in cold blood by a black drug dealer. Officer Peter Figoski was 47 and had raised his four daughters on his own. His last act of duty was to respond to a robbery in Brooklyn, where the fleeing black thug reputedly shot him in the face.
The accused, Lamont Pride, was only free at the time of the shooting because he had been let loose for illegally possessing a knife by a black female judge. The ex-con was also wanted in North Carolina for allegedly shooting someone in the foot over the summer.
The day after Figoski’s murder, while people remained in shock at the cold-blooded way the black thug shot an officer who had not drawn his gun, The New York Times ran an editorial praising the state of Pennsylvania for taking another black police killer off the death list. Mumia Abu-Jamal—or some ridiculous name like that—had even more cold-bloodedly killed a police officer lying injured on the ground. The timing was such that the Philadelphia policeman’s widow (since 1981) remarked upon it. It must have amused Jill Abramson, the new Times editor, for a slain cop’s widow to call her unfeeling. Abramson and her type do not much care what working stiffs think of them. To the contrary, they relish the fact that cops, firemen, blue-collar workers, and their ilk do not read or believe the Times.
I do not know Jill Abramson, but rarely have I seen a homelier woman. In a New Yorker hagiography, she was described as coming from a household that ordered and read two copies of the Times—a bit of a waste I would think, but who am I to judge what middle-class Jewish rug salesmen do with their money? All I know is that on her way to the Times building five or so years ago, Abramson was hit by a truck whose front was totally defaced, while she suffered a few broken bones. Now she cheers for a cop killer escaping the lethal injection while ignoring the fact that a black judge let a black thug wanted in another state walk the streets and kill.
The Times is a very nasty piece of work. It aims its hatred at normal white Christian Americans while filling its pages with same-sex marriage announcements, profiles of rap “artists,” and front-page coverage of Catholic priests’ sex abuses.
The Times only prints news that fits its policies. Their latest false outrage is the discovery on Facebook of hostile comments by NYPD officers about the West Indian American Day Parade. Cops used words such as “savages” and “animals” to describe the random shootings of parade watchers, words that had the Times furious with indignation. What words should the fuzz have used? A 56-year-old mother watching the parade is shot dead and the Times is indignant because some cop wrote that the shooter was an animal?
Obviously the Times’ agenda is to undermine the police by depicting them as racist and then collect a couple of prizes for exposing police corruption. Not a single word concerning color was used by the cops—some of whom happened to be black—yet the newspaper played it up in its front page for a couple of days, triggering the usual reaction from opportunistic local politicians calling the incident “disgusting” and “racist.” (The pols avoided mentioning the shootings.)
Blacks are 23 percent of New York City’s population, yet in the first half of 2009 they committed 80 percent of all shootings. Whites, who are 35 percent of the population, committed 1.8 percent of the shootings. So the Times recently ran an extremely long story over two pages about a young black who whined about how the police tend to profile him when he walks around his neighborhood at night. That the cops failed to profile all white people for the tiny minority of whites who commit shootings is deemed an outrage and proof of police racism.
A black man was recently acquitted for carrying an illegal gun by a jury because the arresting officer was a member of the NYPD Facebook group that had called the West Indian troublemakers “animals.” When the Times was quoted in court, the jury was not told—and the Times had not mentioned—the fact that the arresting officer was black. Such are the joys of the world’s most dishonest newspaper.

Vodacom's Head of Brand Communication and Marketing, Kelvin Twissa, said that the clubs have the opportunity to take advantage of the transfer window to enhance their chances of securing the league title.
"The current league table shows clearly that even a team that is in fifth place has a chance of taking the title and of course, the clubs can correct mistakes by bringing in quality players in this transfer window," said Twissa.
He added that the top flight clubs need to positively evaluate kind of players who they need to recruit so as to make scientific registration which will make them stronger for the last lap of the Mainland league. "We have seen a high level of competition in the first round.
This might make the second round even more difficult in hunting for the championship and avoiding relegation. So it is time for each team to set a working strategy before the beginning of the second round of the league," he said.
Twissa said that Vodacom will continue to implement its commitment to promote sports and as the sponsor of the league and will continue to build the capacity and promote football in the country.
"Our national team has been the big talk in the challenge cup held recently in Kampala, scoring a lot more goals and displaying great scoring skills. It is the players who are playing in the Vodacom Premier League as well as those of Zanzibar Premier League that have been a big talk in the tournament," Twissa said.
Twissa also urged Simba and Azam to prepare well for the international tournament is ahead of them. "We wish them all the best for the teams that represents our country in the international tournament.
We believe that we will reach far and our league will continue to improve," he said. Simba will play against C.R Libolo of Angola in the African Club Championship and Azam FC will play against Al Nasir Juba of South Sudan in the Confederation African Cup.As the summer approaches slowly and thoughts of blissful freedom and escape start to taunt us, for some a few weeks away simply isn’t enough. The time is now to see the world as it should be seen – with a backpack and spending time getting to know the people and places of your chosen destination.
One way of truly understanding a culture is to work within a community and many travellers opt to volunteer abroad. The biggest challenge is which destination to choose out of the overwhelming array of choices. Here are a few ideas to whet your appetite, including one or two you’ve probably not considered.
Costa Rica
Costa Rica literally translated means ‘rich coast’ and the coastline of this Central American nation certainly lives up to its name. It’s probably the most expensive place to travel to in Central America due to its popularity but it’s cheaper than much of Western Europe and the US. With its stunning beaches, sprawling jungles and powerful volcanoes, the landscape also provides the perfect backdrop to your voluntary efforts. Whether it’s teaching English to young children, working to rebuild the community or participating in sea turtle conservation there’s a choice of projects to suit everyone. And when you’ve finished all of your hard work, head out for a spot of surfing on those pristine beaches.

Indonesia
Primarily famous for Bali, this enigmatic archipelago in the Indian Ocean comprises over 18,000 islands so there’s plenty of undiscovered territory to explore. You may wish to head to Bali to work with underprivileged children or Indonesia or with orangutans in Java. Whatever you choose, this tropical paradise offers unmatched golden beaches, the Kelimutu Volcano and the Lore Lindu National Park. If you travel in August you’ll also see the Sanur Village Festival, a four day long celebration of marine life held on the beach at Sanur in Bali. With a history dating back to 4,000 BC you’ll encounter a mesmerising mix of culture and spirituality throughout the islands.

Nicaragua
Nicaragua is another increasingly popular Central American destination but not the immediate choice of many travellers, making it ideal for those of you wishing to experience somewhere a little more tourist free. The colonial cities of Granada and Leon offer stunning architectural sites. Take some time out to hike in the Mombacho Volcano nature reserve or visit the sulphurous hot springs north of Leon. These bubbling springs are fed by an underground river heated by the Telica Volcano. For a real thrill take a swim in the translucent waters of the Somoto Canyon which is still relatively un-spoilt (it was only revealed to the outside world in 2004).
Qatar
We thought we’d throw in a bit of a curve ball here. Qatar is not the instant choice for travellers wishing to undertake work abroad and it’s certainly one of the most expensive but it is becoming increasingly popular as a ‘bolt-on’ destination during your gap year. While it’s not a long-term destination – a 30 day visa will be sufficient – it offers places of quiet beauty such as Al Khor with its impressive watchtowers. If you can’t quite remember why you think you’ve heard of Qatar, football fans will know it best as the surprise choice for the 2022 World Cup.
Portugal
This often overlooked gem is gradually working its way up to the top spot of favourite destinations for gap year travel. Portugal’s best kept secret is a surprising array of historical sites, including the World Heritage Site at Porto dating back to Roman times. With beautiful beaches, mountains to explore and ample opportunities for voluntary work, such as teaching English to Portuguese children, Portugal is also cheap to get to and costs much less than Spain.
More on WeAreTraveller: Top Foods You Must Try in Portugal
These are only a fraction of the options available to you on your gap year, from the obvious to the not so obvious. Whatever your preference you’ll find a destination to suit your budget and give you a wealth of new experiences.

Recycling rates exceeded state goals in the 1990's but then in 2000 the rate dropped below these levels. In 2003, Facilities and the Environmental Club took steps to revitalize the program. Residential Life and RHA joined the effort in 2006. The programs that have since been implemented have resulted in improved trends to about a 20% recycling rate until the year 2011. In July 2012, Bucknell made a major change to Single Stream Recycling. It is hoped that the change will propel recycling rates past the plateaued 20% up to over 60%.
What is it? Material Recovery Facility (MRF).
What does it mean at Bucknell?
It means all recyclables can go in one container and many items that were considered "not recyclable" now will be considered "recyclable."
For example, paper towels and all plastics (#1 through #7) are recyclable. Basically, everything will be acceptable for recycling except organics (food/animal waste). Minimal food residue on items is also acceptable.
Inside waste containers will be changed to offer two choices: "Single Stream Recycling" or "Trash."
To ensure everyone enthusiastically recycles, Bucknell changed out the building trash cans to be consistently labeled Single Stream Recycling or Trash. In the near future, Single Stream Recycling cans will be colored blue and trash will be colored beige.
Why Single Stream?
Single Stream promises to make recycling easier for campus population and dramatically increase the recycling rate. It's less expensive; it's more green; and it's easier.
For more information, contact Merritt Pedrick or John Testa in Facilities at 7‑19.With.: Let's start with the first. If there's one thing that everyone in America knows, it's that being fat is really unhealthy. Why do you call it a fake problem?
P.:.
Megan: Those shows on TLC that basically invite the audience to gawk at fat people usually say they'll lose fifty percent of their excess body weight
Paul:..
Here's an idea: Stop harrassing people about their weight. Because it appears that focusing on the idea that being fat actually makes people fatter. At least there's an extremely strong correlation there. I bet if we stopped demonizing fatness people would actually be a bit thinner. They'd certainly be happier and healthier
Megan: What should we do instead if we want to reduce health care costs? Here are some proposed ideas I've heard:
- Taxes on soda
- New urbanism (make people walk more)
- Bring back physical education in schools
- Make gym memberships tax deductible
- Menu labelling.. I know for a fact (because they've told me) that some public health officials engage in what they think of as a noble lie about the effects of physical activity on weight, because they know people won't become more active just to be healthier.
Megan: Is there any evidence this works? Don't people just stop going to the gym when they notice they haven't lost any weight?
Paul: Of course. People aren't dumb. They do the experiment, the experiment doesn't work in the vast majority of cases, so they quit until they get desperate again..
Megan: An economist recently pointed out that we don't encourage people to move to the country, even though rural people live more than three years longer than urban people, and the diffefence in their healthy life expectancy is even more outsized. Nor do we encourage people to find Jesus or get married. We target "unhealthy" behaviors that are already stigmatized.
Paul:.
Megan: And now a convenient scapegoat for our health care costs: if we can just eliminate the folk devils, we can have a new national health care program, and more room on the bus, for free!
Paul: Yes it's a low-calorie free lunch.Phi Theta Kappa Honors

Byline: DR DAVID WYATT
* ost people in Wales are aware of the mighty ring of Edwardian castles in the north of the country built in the wake of Edward I's conquest in the late 13th century.
Edward's "iron ring" of fortifications were designed to be symbols of his power and domination over the previously independent Welsh kingdom of Gwynedd. Yet fewer people are aware of another much earlier attempt to subdue Gwynedd through the construction of a network of castles in the years that followed the Norman Conquest.
Aberlleiniog Castle, which nestles in a beautiful location near the village of Llangoed close to the eastern shores of Anglesey, lies at the very heart of this 'hidden history'.
Situated just a few miles from Beaumaris' huge Edwardian fortification, Aberlleiniog Castle is a simple, yet well-preserved, Norman motte and bailey fortress, built on the orders of Hugh d'Avranches, earl of Chester, one of the first marcher lords appointed by William the Conqueror to the Welsh frontier.
Today, the motte at Aberlleiniog is crowned by a much later structure, probably a civil war fort, which appears to date to the middle of the 17th century. Yet it is arguably the early medieval history of this site which bears witness to one of the most significant yet little known conflicts in medieval Welsh history: the battle of Anglesey Sound in 1098.
This battle reconfigured the geo-political map of North Wales and reversed ambitions of conquest from the east for almost 200 years, allowing an independent and vibrant Welsh dynasty to flourish in Gwynedd.
Anglesey, Wales and the Viking World. We are often presented with an Anglo-centric view of Welsh history with relationships between Wales and England taking centre stage. Yet, it is important to remember that Wales is a westward facing peninsular with a mountainous interior which, to this day, hampers communications between both the north and south and the east and west.
In the early middle-ages, these internal topographical barriers would have been compounded further by widespread forestation and political fragmentation.
Wales, at this time, was made up of a patchwork of competing native kingdoms vying for power and territory. The one unifying topographical feature in Wales was the sea and many of the early medieval Welsh kingdoms had important westward maritime contacts and interactions, both peaceful and violent, with Ireland and the wider Viking world.
The Vikings first came to the Irish Sea region in small sea-borne raiding bands at the end of the eighth century. Over the course of the ninth and 10th centuries they established significant power bases and settled in locations across the Irish Sea region: in the Northern and Western Isles of Scotland, the Isle of Man, Galloway, Cumbria and coastal areas of Ireland.
These Viking settlers soon became embroiled in local politics, they formed alliances, intermarried and many adopted Christianity, yet they retained a distinct identity signalled through their material culture, language and their warrior outlook.
By the middle of the 10th century they had also established vibrant and bustling urban ports such as Dublin, at which mercenaries could be hired and where goods could be exchanged and redistributed across the Viking world.
Unsurprisingly, then, mastery of maritime routes in the region was very important for the Irish Sea Vikings. Perhaps the most important of these routes was the seaway linking Dublin with a significant Viking settlement in the Wirral which, in turn, connected overland to the Viking city of York. This busy Viking route meant that the Island of Anglesey and the coasts of North Wales were of immense strategic significance.
Given the strategic significance of the seaways around Anglesey, and the widespread nature of Viking settlement in the Irish Sea region, then it would be very surprising if there had been no such settlement within Wales. …Fashion your most stylish self.

Summary : After a careless and heartless remark from Miyagi, Shinobu decides to take up his fathers' offer to 'further' his studies. The only thing is.. Cambridge University is in England.
Shinobu wrapped his knuckles smartly against the wooden door. His gray eyes were contorted into an annoyed glare, his full lips were pursed into a frustrated pout and his smooth hands were clenched into shaking fists. Usually Shinobu would have much more patience, especially when knocking on this door but today was different. Today Shinobu was angry.
"Yoh Miyagi, I know your in there! Open the door right now!" He barked and after a moments silence, continued pounding the door. He was well aware of the neighbours peeking out from around the doors of their own apartments, shooting him nasty looks and muttering things like "That stupid kid is making noise again." But honestly, Shinobu didn't care. All he cared about was the fact that he was cold, he was tired and he needed to vent out all the pent up emotion of the day.
It was during one of the teens' short breathers that Shinobus' sharp ears managed to catch a hold of a drawn-out groan through the wood. "Yeah that's right old man! You better open this door right now!" He ordered.
There was more groaning and hushed muttering as the rattling of metal against wood brought a smile of satisfaction to Shinobus' aggitated face. The door swung open and the faint smell of cigarettes and cologne wafted through Shinobu's nostrils.
"Care to tell me why your destroying my door, Shinobu-chin?" Miyagi muttered darkly. His voice sent chills up Shinobus' spine; so dark and rich. The coal-black eyes and slightest hint of stubble protruding from the mans' chin only furthered this excitement. Unfortunately, Miyagi had to interupt his observation. "Shinobu-chin? Well?"
"I.. I'm comming in." Shinobu mumbled hastily and he quickly slipped past the elder man with ease into the small apartment. Miyagi, used to the regular intrusions, stepped back inside and closed the door carefully. He'd be damned if he had to buy a new one. "I take it your staying the night again." He sighed and followed the younger man into his living room.
"..and then he said that I wasn't learning and I said I was and then he sai-"
"Shinobu-chin. Start from the beginning." Miyagi couldn't help but smirk a little bit at the indignant pout on Shinobus' face. "And don't even think about it." He added as Shinobu made to headbutt a wall.
"Fine!;" Shinobu ground his teeth together "Father believes that I'm not maturing enough." The blonde scoffed at the thought before turning on his heel and pointing a finger accusingly at Miyagi. "And thats where you come into it, old man."
"Me? What did I do?" Miyagi's expression was priceless; his jaw agape, his eyes wide and his hands raised in innocence.
"You agreed with him! You agreed!"
Miyagi rubbed at his temples, a habit he had picked up off of Kamijou at the office. "Listen, Shinobu. If your going to run around and point fingers like a mindless child then maybe you aren't progressing as much as Boss would've of liked. You do this everytime something doesn't go your way and to be honest, it's behavior I'd expect from a spoilt seven year old child."
There was silence within the room after that, apart from the soft ticking of the hallway clock and the gentle hum of the fridge. Miyagi frowned. That wasn't meant to happen, Shinobu always had something to say. Always. In fact he had half prepared himself for Shinobu to break into a rant about destiny and love and so forth. What he hadn't prepared himself for were the fat tears that dribbled down Shinobus' cheeks as he fled from the apartment.
What did you guys think? If I get enough reviews I'll continue and the chapters will be waaaaaay longer, I promise. 3A California fraternity has been suspended after a freshman pledge died following a night of partying and drinking.
Fresno police are working with Fresno Sate University to investigate the death of Philip Dhanens. Dhanens, 18, died Sunday at St. Agnes Medical Center.
Dhanens' family said he was kept alive on life support so his organs could be donated. An autopsy is expected to take place after the organ donation is concluded.
"At this point we suspect it is alcohol-related, but we don't have the toxicology tests yet," a representative from the Fresno County Coroner Office said. "We're certain we are doing an autopsy, but haven't confirmed with the doctor."
Dhanens' mother told ABC News affiliate KFSN that he was only a freshman at Fresno State, about two weeks into his first semester. It was during those two weeks that he began the pledging process at the Theta Chi fraternity.
The fraternity held a party on Friday following a formal dinner at its off-campus house. Details about what happened at that party are not publicly known, but Dhanens' mother told KFSN she was called by St. Agnes Medical Center at 4 a.m. Saturday, and told her son suffered severe brain damage.
University officials could not be reached due to Labor Day weekend, but in a press release, university President John D. Welty said, "We are heartbroken at the loss of this young man who had just joined our university community and had a life of promise ahead."CORE MEASURES:

During the trip, McCoy, along with his bodyguard and a couple of other guys, began to spray some of the women with water. Roe claims she protested the water spraying so McCoy ordered his bodyguard Big John to “get her.
Roe claims McCoy and/or Big John proceeded to hit her in the face, causing her to fall to the ground. While she was on the floor, the men allegedly physically restrained her and poured a beverage onto her hair, clothes and body. McCoy and Big John then allegedly, forcibly ejected her from the party bus on to the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.
However some of the women allegedly complained to McCoy about Roe getting the boot, so she was snatched back up from the side of the road and placed back on the bus. The woman claims she was taken to a nearby rest stop, where allegedly the football player once again ditched her and continued on with his party trip. “
As a result of those allegations, Roe is now suing McCoy for more than $50,000 in damages for assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment and negligence.
Roe says she suffered;
“Head trauma, a disc protrusion on her spine, bad sprains, contusions and bruises all over her body, and severe shock.”
However, in the police report that was taken back in December, when the incident allegedly happened, police wrote that they did not observe any visible marks or sings of injury on her body.
And New Jersey State Police Sergeant Brian Polite tells TMZ,
“During the initial meeting with the accuser, she never named McCoy as her attacker.”
Says Andrew M. Smith, LeSean McCoy’s Attorney;
“The allegations against LeSean McCoy are completely, unequivocally false.There are no criminal charges pending [against McCoy] and no probable cause was ever found.This is sadly an attempt to extract money and LeSean will vigorously defend any attempt to collect money through a personal injury claim.”

Ordered from this site numerous times and have yet to have a negative experience.What is in a cookie?
There’s flour, of course, and butter and sugar and eggs, all webbed together more or less permanently by a big plastic paddle, and some torque.
It can get more complicated, though. There’s air, if you look closely. The flour could be whole wheat, like mine, and there could be impossibly big chunks of melty, drippy chocolate, along with salt, and – wait, what’s that spice? Or ginger, pounded and dried and secreted in, along with a hint of saffron. Or maybe moisture, in the form of a swollen oat.
(And, truth be told, in this batch, somewhere, there’s probably a cat hair. Jack tried to stick his paw in the mixer while it was whirling around.)
But that’s not what I mean at all.
The real question is What’s in a cookie that makes it so good to give? It certainly can’t be its nutritional qualities – unless you’re Michael Phelps, you probably don’t need the calories. (Charmian’s right; That Globe and Mail piece on Phelps is hilarious.)
Watching a cookie leave home certainly isn’t the sort of thing that instills calm in an addicted baker. One more cookie out means one less cookie in, and goodness, it’s only cool enough to turn the oven on for so many days in August. One can’t be too strict with inventory.
But still, the giving’s the best part, in my book. In one cookie, you can say I’m thinking of you, and I know you, and If something bad happens, you better not fucking die, because I need you.
Okay, so mostly, yesterday, I wanted to say the latter. My husband’s away for work, which for him means sleeping in an RV next to a beach, where he’s installed instrument upon instrument into the sand in the tidal zone. (Jim’s an oceanographer.)
I don’t really know what those shiny things all do – sure, I have a decent general idea, and I know they’re very expensive and prone to breakage. But when he waved good-bye on Tuesday morning, all I really knew for sure was that he’s going to be very wet for two weeks.
Jim likes getting wet. The way he tells it, there’s nothing dangerous about his fieldwork, and to some extent, in my brain, I believe him. (Here, it’s probably fair to mention that when it comes to safety, I can be slightly dramatic. I’m the type of person who starts concocting outrageous crash scenarios the second I sink into an airplane seat. He’s the kind of person who falls asleep before takeoff.)
But I am decidedly not an oceanographer, which means that what sounds completely sane to him doesn’t really work for me.
(Case in point: Saltwater. The fact is, I don’t even like the ocean all that much. Lake water? Totally fine. But saltwater gives me the heebie-jeebies. Always has. Water isn’t supposed to be sticky, if you ask me. My heart does a little rollercoastery thing when I stick my head all the way under, like I’m swimming in something that might cause an allergic reaction.)
Still, I decided to visit yesterday. First I was going to bring dinner, but weather and work interfered, and it was 6 p.m. before I even thought about driving north. I decided I’d bring cookies.
I started heading toward a big man of a cookie – a brawny specimen, the kind no one could eat in one bite. (The cookie David Leite printed in the New York Times a few weeks ago was the obvious best choice, especially given that I haven’t tried them yet, but please, who has 36 hours? I had one hour.)
So I planned: There would be chocolate, for certain, but given that my husband’s a fan of desserts that bite back, I veered way off the traditional path, straight for the Thai chilies leftover from the soup I’d made a few nights before. Then that chocolate chocolate espresso cookie from last summer popped up in my brain, and you know what I did? I went for a walk. Just took the dog, and let that KitchenAid’s gaping maw have a bit of a time out, slacked wide by itself for a few moments, because who wants a cookie with chocolate and espresso and Thai chilies (and ginger and lemongrass, if I’m really being honest about what I’d planned)? Seriously.
By the time I’d calmed down, I was heading toward big ginger chunk cookies, lumpy with pieces of crystallized ginger and coconut. But at T minus zero, when I was about to stir the chewy bits in, something stopped me: The batter was so lovely-looking, smooth and unfettered. I skipped the pieces and parts, and made – gasp! – what’s essentially a gingered sugar cookie. It’s thin and delicate, and straight from the oven, it shatters and dissolves in the mouth, like the kind of dream you can feel yourself losing as you wake up. Maybe think of it as a gingersnap that’s lost a lot of weight.
The truth is, it’s quite the opposite of the cookie I wanted to bring. Not even the least bit brawny. I piled the first batch into a plastic container – these cookies belong in fancy clear plastic bags, I tell you, with ribbons and stickers – and it seemed so wrong.
An hour later, our dinner plan had hit a bump, and we were eating Chinese food in a gas station in Conway, WA. (I’d hesitate to say it was good, but it wasn’t as bad as it could have been.) I handed Jim the container.
First, he was thrilled. Cookies. Then he opened it and sort of tipped it sideways, like he was looking for the real cookies, or the other halves of the ones I’d brought.
Okay, I admitted. So I made the wrong ones.
These are not cookies for fieldwork. They’re cookies for shoe shopping, or afternoon tea. They’re the kind of bites you have to slip into a purse that has structure, so they don’t get smashed.
I had a flash of my beloved, stranded on the island with his instruments, wasting away because I’d failed to stir in the chocolate chunks.
But does it matter, that I got it wrong?
Maybe not.
Maybe even the girliest cookie has the je ne sais quoi to stand up in the stomach, when a person is in dire straits, and help do what needs to be done.
Or maybe any cookie, no matter its form or content, has the je ne sais quoi to make the giver feel a little bit better, simply in the giving.
Here’s a delicate take on a gingersnap that’s the exact opposite of “manly.” Perched next to a cup of tea or an impossibly elegant scoop of sorbet, the cookie is more of a culinary accessory than actual sustenance – and like the perfect pair of earrings, it’s probably what your guests will notice first. For full shattering appeal, serve the cookies right when they’ve cooled – after a few hours, they become chewy (still good, but less fragile).
For a bit of adventure, try using a flavored salt – I used Ritrovo’s “Saffron and Salt,” which gave the cookies an earthy, fragrant aftertaste without actually making them taste like Indian food.
TIME: 35 minutes active time
MAKES: About 8 dozen small cookies
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tablespoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt (or flavored salt, such as saffron salt)
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two heavy baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon baking mats, and set aside.
Whisk flours, ground ginger, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl, and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand. Add the fresh ginger. (The dough may look a little curdled – that’s okay.) Add the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture in three additions, mixing on low speed until just combined, and scraping down the sides of the bowl when necessary. Beat again for a few seconds on high, until fluffy.
Using a 3/4” ice cream scoop or two small spoons, drop the dough (it will be soft) in 3/4” balls about 2” apart on the baking sheets. (I fit 15 per sheet.) Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through, or until the cookies are browned and crisp at the edges. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
P.S. 9/2/08 I just discovered that my oven is running extremely slow. This recipe may require less oven time. If you give them try, please let others know how long yours take!

You’re so right – half of the deliciousness of cookies is in the giving! (The other half is in the keeping and eating yourself.)
I adore your blog.
Sounds yummy! I always dream about making cookies like this and having a girlfriend or two over for afternoon tea. For some reason, I have yet to EVER do that. Maybe this cookie should be the one that finally makes it happen!
From a cape codder with an oceanographer husband – I know how you feel! :)
Thanks, Julie!
And Andrea – really? Where on the Cape? Too funny!
What jumped out at me there was…gas station Chinese food in Conway? Why? Whywhywhy? We’re not the center of the dining universe up here, but we can do better than that, honestly!
Jessamyn, do you live up there? Tell us where to eat!!!
Hey Jess – we’ve been in Falmouth for almost 8 years now. Love it!

Pingback: Holiday Baking |Anthony De Hooges was 20 years old in 1641 when he crossed the
Atlantic from Holland to New Amsterdam. In the New World
he was a secretary and business manager — quite likely the
first of our ancestors to hold a white-collar job that didn’t
involve preaching!
I have trimmed his log of their harrowing voyage. It’s typical of its times in dealing only
with the bare facts of what happened -- so much so you almost
wish that there’d been a TV reporter there to ask, “How did
you feel . . . ?” (I never thought I’d write that.) Only very
rarely -- see October 4 -- does he convey their own experience of it.
Note the sailing details and the fact that, while they could
determine their latitude by sighting on the sun, they could only
“reckon” their longitude.
1641 July 30
In the year of our Lord 1641, we set sail from Texel with an
ESE wind and a light breeze, in company with 35 or 36 sail, . . .
17 August
Very foggy weather. We sailed six leagues NW by W. The
wind was SW. We tacked again and again. At noon we
stood in toward shore and in the evening we turned again
SW. We should have liked to go to Pleijmuijden [Plymouth]
to get water and hay but could not on account of the fog.
The frigate which was with us stood toward shore. The
galley also became separated from us so that there were
only five of us [ships] left.
18
The wind was SW. That night we tacked again and again.
Before noon we arived between Pleijmuijden and Goutstart
and tacked back and forth. During the night we ran closely
past the Meeuwesteen [Mewstone Rock] and let ourselves
drift along in a calm. A dead horse overboard.
19
At daybreak the wind SSW. A dense fog set in. We found
ourselves before the beacon of Pleijmuijden. There were
only two of us, the vice admiral and ourselves. We thought
it advisable to run in. Before Draeckenkasteel [Drake
Castle] we found five English royal vessels at anchor. . . .
1 October
We were in latitude 21 deg. 17 min. Distance sailed 23
leagues W by S . Wind NE with a light breeze. . . .
4
In the morning after mess we began to put things in order
to see how many casks of water we still had, as each day
we found another one empty. Except for lack of water,
we were resolved to set our course straight for New
Netherland. In the afternoon when all the casks had been
examined, we found that of the 29 casks which we
supposed were still left, only 16 were full. These were
provided with iron hoops; of the others the hoops had
sprung. By reckoning[,] we were still 600 leagues from
New Netherland and the animals consumed at least two
casks of water in three days, so that we had water for
the animals for only 24 days. We began to look at each
other. At last after some questions had been asked we
decided unanimously that for the preservation of both man
and beast it was necessary to go the island of Christoffel
[St. Christopher or St. Kitts] and continue our voyage after
we had obtained a supply of water. We shaped our course
therefore WSW. Wind E by N with a steady trade wind.
Latitude 20 deg. 25 min. Distance sailed 24 leagues. . . .
18
At daybreak we set our sails again and ran into the roads [at Christoffel],
where with God’s help we anchored a little before noon in
10 fathoms. We found in the roads two Zealand vessels,
namely one flute and one frigate. Our course was changed
and we drifted five miles WNW and till morning three miles
NNW; when we came into the roads we had but one cask
of water left. We sent our boat ashore in haste with empty
casks. The wind was SE with a stiff breeze. We reckoned
that we were in latitude 17 deg. 6 min.
19
During the night and also in the morning, at noon and in the
evening the sailors brought some casks of water on board
having fine pleasant weather. Most of the time there was a
land breeze. We saw two sail which did not stop in the roads.
In the early part of the night we took another boat load of
water on board.
20
Sunday; no water was drawn. Meanwhile we filled the casks
in the hold. We also careened our ship and cleaned the side.
Foggy weather with drizzling rain and calm.
21
In the morning we took more water on board and had a
travado from the SW with much rain. The sea began to run
high. The rain lasted till the afternoon. A small English vessel
drifted from shore and the English on board had neither
anchors nor cables so that it was carried far out to sea. The
frigate went out and caught it again. In the evening we took
some more water on board.
22
We took our last load of water on board and stored it away.
We cleaned the other side of our ship and got ready to set
sail. The wind was SE.
23
At two o’clock in the night we set sail again in God’s name.
May He bring us to the place of our destination. The wind
was variable but mostly calm. . . .
2 November
We were in latitude 25 deg. 44 min. Distance sailed 18
leagues. Wind mostly SE with a light breeze. During the night
we had a travado from the ENE. We reefed all our sails.
The wind went around the entire compass . It was the
hardest travado we had had. It blew very hard with much
thunder and lightning and hard pelting rain.
3
At half past two o’clock in the night the wife of Govert
Loockemans gave birth to a daughter. [Marritje, daughter
of Govert Loockermans and Ariaentje Jans, baptized 1
Dec 1641, NY Reformed Dutch Church] Thus was our
number increased; God be praised. In the morning after
breakfast we set our sails again after having had very rough
weather during the night. The wind was west; thereafter E
by N. The sea began to run high from the north. No latitude
was taken at noon. We reckoned that we had sailed 14
leagues NNW.
4
In the morning after the dogwatch we took in the foresail and
let ourselves drift with the aftersails. It began to blow very
hard and to look ugly. At daybreak we took off the foresail
bonnet and stood on with the courses. The wind was ENE.
We were not able to take the latitude at noon. The distance
sailed was 16 leagues NW by N. Wind as above. Rough
weather, high seas and fog on the horizon. In the evening the
wind began to turn southerly. . . .
15
In the morning a stiff NE breeze sprang up. Drizzling rain and
dark weather. We got no observation at noon. We reckoned
that we had sailed 11 leagues NW. By reckoning were in
latitude 38 deg. 38 min. At noon we sounded and found no
bottom. We shaped our course NW by W to reach the coast.
It was very dark foggy weather with a stiff breeze and high
seas. Wind NE. At four bells in the afternoon we took in our
topsails and spritsail. We hove the lead again and found bottom
at 38 fathoms. It was coarse sand with black specks and small
broken shells. A storm came up so that we took in the foresail
and let ourselves drift with the mainsail and spanker. The wind
was ENE with dark weather and drizzling rain. In the evening
after the watch was set we sounded and found 35 fathoms,
sand as above. In the first watch we took soundings again at
25 fathoms, very fine sand, ash-gray with black specks. We
put the ship’s head to the north to get near the coast as with
that wind we could stand off and on. After the dogwatch we
found ourselves in 23 fathoms, sand as before.
16
At daybreak after having had stormy weather we hove the
lead and found 22 fathoms. We were afraid of a SE wind and
therefore turned to the east to get somewhat further off shore
as it blew very hard with dark weather, drizzling rain and high
seas. At noon we reckoned that since noon of the day before
we had sailed and drifted 10 leagues about WNW and that
we were in latitude 38 deg. 54 min. We found soundings of
25 and in the evening of 32 fathoms. We were then driven
eastward from shore. We would have landed about between
the suijtbaaij [South Bay or Delaware Bay] and the Hoofden
[the headlands at either side of the Narrows]. But it did not
please the Lord that time to grant us the relief to which we
had looked forward so long. The hard storm obliged us to
stand out to sea again and we had no sight of land.
17
The storm continued with dark rainy weather and very high
seas. We could hardly carry a reefed mainsail. The wind was
NE and NE by N. At noon we got no observation. We
reckoned that we had been driven 12 leagues SE by S. We
were obliged to stand out to sea as we did not dare touch a
sail and did not know how the wind might turn. Toward
evening we took in our mainsail and hauled to the wind, with
a reefed spanker. The storm continued. Wind became N
and we were driven S. . . .
27
At daybreak we made sail agian. The weather became very
foggy with drizzling rain so that we could not see a ship’s
length. We anchored therefore in 13 fathoms. Meanwhile
we caught a large quanitity of codfish smaller than those in
Holland but very white. Toward noon it cleared up. The
wind was NW by W with a topsail breeze. We saw the whole
coast and found ourselves between Barnegat and de Sael
[The Saddle]. We therefore set sail. Toward evening we
saw Renselaers hoeck [Sandy Hook? Highlands? ] N by W
of us about two and a half leagues and there we anchored.
Wind northerly.
28
In the morning there came a stiff breeze from the NNW.
Toward noon we weighed anchor to see whether we could
get a little further by tacking. While under sail we were
becalmed. No latitude at noon. We reckoned that from noon
of the day before till the time we anchored we had sailed six
leagues NNE. In the evening we dropped anchor again as there
was still a dead calm. At night a light breeze sprang up from
the SE and we made sail. We came close to the hooge hoeck
[Highlands of Nayesink] and let ourselves drift while waiting
for the day.
29
At daybreak we ran to the Sandpunt [Sandy Hook] and as
we rounded it too close we got aground on a reef which had
formed there within a year. After two hours we got afloat again.
God be praised, we suffered no damage and with good speed
passed between the Hooffden [the headlands at either side of
the Narrows] and in the afternoon came to anchor at the
Manhatans in front of the Smits Vaeij [the Smits Vly on the
East River] in four fathoms. At anchor there we found a flute,
called the de witte Valck [The White Falcon], laden with salt
and sugar. Thus the Lord delivered us at last after much
adversity, for which be He praised forever. Amen . The next
day a dead horse overboard.

Image of 17-year-old Scott Santana to be viewed by parents of 17-year-old Scott Santana say what set him apart was his uncanny gift of bringing sunshine to everyone on even their darkest days. He was generous, and in fact, following a trip to Australia, Scott’s one desire was to make a difference in the world — a world which he suddenly realized was much larger than his small town.
On May 17, 2011, following a fatal car accident, Scott Santana did make a difference in the world and bring the light of hope to six people, when he became an organ donor.
As a registered donor, he also brought the gift of sight to two people and improved the lives of countless others as a tissue donor.
“On the day we received the worst news of our lives, six other families were getting the best news of their lives,” said Scott’s father, Rich Santana.
On New Year’s Day, the positive difference Scott made in the lives others will be honored when his “floragraph” picture is displayed on the 2013 Donate Life Rose Parade Float for millions around the world to see.
Prior to that, on Monday, Dec. 10 at 10:30 a.m., Scott’s mother, father, sister and friends will come together at Sierra Donor Services, 1760 Creekside Oaks Drive, Suite 220, in Sacramento, to put the finishing touches on Scott’s floragraph — a memorial portrait created with organic materials.
Scott’s floragraph will be one of 72 memorial floragraph portraits placed on the float, depicting loved ones whose donations of organs, eyes and/or tissue saved and healed those in need.
“Our son will forever live on — not only in the memories of the people he knew, but in the lives he touched through his donation,” said his mother, Deanna Santana.
She, too, was forever changed by his decision to give life as a registered donor, and now serves on the staff at Sierra Donor Services, the organ and tissue recovery agency.
Deanna said her son Scott was an exceptional young man who lived every moment to the fullest. She said he was adored by his friends and family because he was genuinely funny and kind.
“Scott saw no boundaries in his friendships and he had friends in every group,” said Deanna. “In the days following his accident hundreds of stories were told to us of his ability to make others smile. There were many people — friends, family and teachers — who looked forward to a ‘Scott sighting’ just to make their day complete and all who knew Scott still miss that smile today.”
Fittingly, the Donate Life float in the 124nd Rose Parade is entitled “Journeys of the Heart,” keeping with the parade theme of “Oh the Places You’ll Go!” derived from Dr. Seuss’s book.
Donate Life urges viewers to follow Scott Santana’s lead and take their own “Journey of the Heart,” by joining America’s 105 million registered donors so everyone whose life depends on a transplant can have one.

So the moral of the story is "Don't just look for activity, look for a job for your pieces and only then pick the most active option for them", right?

Great video cetainly makes me think how many times i play with an empty bishop !! Thanks
Yes, but please, do not forget that chess is not only a game of rules, but of exceptions, too. Good luck!
WilsonYiuWahWong
I enjoyed this lecture a great deal! I've noticed in some of my games, my opponents would stick their bishops (and knights) deep in enemy territory for activity sake but I'll just play around the piece thus rendering that piece worthless. In some openings, I see the bishop thrown out there to probe some weaknesses but I'll just ignore it and do fine.

wow. i never thought about this.

In the second pposition, you said Black resigned. Didn't you mean that White resigned?
Hello Alex, thanks for your remark. There is no move e4 in the fragment that I am showing, probably, it was played in a later stage of the game? At those times the defenseive skills of the opponents were significanly lower than nowadays, and I guess that you statement is correct, especially if a respected autor like GM Yermolinsky had pointed it out in his book.

In the final position showed, Yanovsky-Capablanca, where Mr.Bojkov said black is much better, I have a question, to me it seems like white can play f4 and shut all of white's play in the center down instead of e4 what was played, after which both bishops got active. I think it was mentioned in Yermolinsky's "Road to Chess Improvement. Bd7 is still a great very instructive move however! :)

Interesting topic..well done.
by GM Dejan Bojkov
GM Bojkov continues his excellent description of each piece, expounding upon their merit and faults in a brilliant systematic manner. Today we see several highly instructive examples of the "false prophet" that is an Empty Bishop! Despite its open-square control and seemingly multiple options, we learn that without targets or a "purpose" the bishop can become irrelevant in the critical moments. Watch as greats such as Petrosian help Dejan to illustrate these points!

Posted By: chief chickenActually, can I refine Diane's curse to make it even more frightening?You know you just called your mother a b**ch, right?
'When you return home, may MY mother come out from under the porch and give you a piece of her mind...'
1 to 13 of 13YESTERDAY we posted Discovery Institute: Thrilled About ClimateGate, in which we showed that the neo-theocrats at the Discovery Institute’s Center for Science and Culture (a/k/a the Discoveroids) were gearing up to use the still-unfolding global warming email imbroglio as “proof” that brave dissenters from science orthodoxy have been suppressed by ideological conspirators.
Although not specifically expressed in the Discoveroid article we wrote about, the implication was that because the legitimate views of global warming skeptics had been suppressed, this means that all science dissent is similarly worthy, and therefore the irrational science-denial of creationists is somehow now respectable. We’re calling this interpretation of ClimateGate the “vindication of all kooks” doctrine.
Following that initial salvo, the Discoveroids have now posted a far stronger article at their blog. We’ve always told you what the Discoveroids were up to. Back when we started our humble blog we posted Discovery Institute: Enemies of the Enlightenment. But it’s no longer necessary to read between the lines. The Discoveroids are now out of the closet.
We present to you, dear reader, some excerpts from Climategate: a Word of Advice to the Scientists. The bold font was added by us:
[T]here will be an accounting for this [global warming].
Ah, “this is war.” Let’s read on:.
There it is, right out in the open. We added color so you couldn’t miss it. The presumed vindication of global warming skeptics means the vindication of creationists too. Note that they persist with the goofy propaganda line that the “Darwinists” are all pushing a “toxic leftist-atheist ideology.” We continue:
Science surely provides much benefit to mankind, but we may need to pursue scientific truth with a different set of scientists than the ones we have now.
Right! Bring in the kooks who have been wrongfully “expelled.” Let’s make Ben Stein the new science czar. Here’s more:.
Those are the same institutions that scoff at creationism — for good reason — and the Discoveroids have long nurtured a deep hatred of them. You’ll see as the article continues:.
Perhaps so regarding global warming. We don’t really know yet. But we do know about the ethics of creationists. It’s certainly odd to see Discoveroids claiming to be the good guys, but that’s how they present themselves. Moving along:
What can we do? Criminal prosecution of scientists who manipulate data would be a good start. Scientists who fake data and manipulate peer review to advance their agenda are no different than corporate executives who manipulate stock prices or lawyers who tamper with juries.
Be careful, Discoveroids. That’s a two-edged sword. Remember that one of your own “senior fellows” was involved in the infamous peer review scandal. Well, that won’t be a problem when the Discoveroids take over. It was obviously the science fraudsters who kept that brilliant Discoveroid article from achieving legitimate status. Yes, that’s how they’ll handle it.
Here’s another excerpt:
Ultimately, perhaps massive defunding of organized science, and a new system of support for research that demands utter transparency and maximal accommodation of debate, may be the only way to defend ourselves from an utterly corrupt scientific elite.
Yes! Defund all of science! Verily, a new day is dawning, or so the Discoveroids hope. And now we come to the end of their revealing article:
It may well be that the public will be forced to protect itself from organized science, as we now protect ourselves from organized crime.
That’s the Discoveroid fantasy — scientists treated like Mafia dons, subjected to congressional hearings, courtroom inquisitions, expulsions from universities, purges from the peer-reviewed journals — it’s their sick dream of a Dark Ages restoration. Bring on the theocracy! Burn the witches!
Do you still have doubts about the goals of the Discoveroids? They’re going to ride the unexpected gift of ClimateGate as far as they can. What they couldn’t accomplish with their own nonsensical “science,” they now hope to achieve by exploiting the global warming scandal.
Please keep this in mind: It may be true that global warming is largely a scam, although it’s still early days and we really don’t know yet. Whatever we learn, whatever misdeeds are uncovered, if any, it shouldn’t affect the rest of science. And most assuredly it shouldn’t give any credibility to creationism — or to its stealth version, intelligent design.
Junk science should be treated as junk, whether it’s creationism or perhaps global warming. We already know that creationism is junk. Nothing we learn about global warming will change that.

O. M. G. I am flabbergasted. Andrew Bolt is out of his mind. Defund science? Is he friggin serious? Well, I guess all those new medicines that work based on evolutionary principles just won’t get developed. What is he going to do when it is his wife or kid that could have been saved from such an advance? I guess he’ll just have to chalk it up to the “Intelligent Designer’s” not-so-intelligent design of genetic diseases, but rather his “will” for his family member to die.
:(
Sounds like it could have been written by Pol Pot or Mullah Allah.
“Organized science”??? Of COURSE it’s organized, you twit of a Discoveroid! What do you want, DISorganized science??
LRA says: “O. M. G. I am flabbergasted.”
That’s the Discoveroids. Just a great bunch of folks.
retiredsciguy says: “Sounds like it could have been written by Pol Pot or Mullah Allah.”
Right. And the few other science blogs I look at are all so busy defending the global warming guys that they’re completely missing what’s going on here. Well, I’ve been out on a limb before, so I know the territory.
It is NOT a scam. Are you becoming a birther now?
Europe and many other countries are working on solving the problem while dufuses in this country don’t have a clue.
Perhaps you could explain how we can continue anyway using finite fuel resources?
Our friends at Little Green Footballs have a link to this post. Welcome, green ones.
Read it again, Chris P.
You wrote “We really don’t know yet”
Yes we do. Please stop denying the reality.
Members of the Royal Academy? They presumably provide the artwork for the propaganda.
Chris P “Europe and many other countries are working on solving the problem while dufuses in this country don’t have a clue.”
Europe is not working to solve the problem, they just dancing around the edges. Only France has a realistic chance of making the Kyoto protocols, and thats because. 1. they never had a problem building nuclear power stations most countries have. 2. The Russians playing games with the natural gas pipelines one winter decided them on replacing more of their natural gas fire power stations, and not much to do with global warming.
Britain is no where close to making the targets, and even if they do China and India will make up the difference in output in less than 2 days.
Ah, well, Flakey, Europe hasn’t solved the problem, so we should just give up? The point is that the US is almost unique among deveolped countries in having public policy influenced (if not dictated) by finge denialists. Witness endless attempts to foist creationism on school children, and the AGW debate. The science is by and large settled, but we must all wait while anti-science demagogues rant.
This is not to say there are not scientific debates going on. The difference is that science uses data, while denialism uses distortion, spin and lies.
What fraud and what misdeeds are they talking about, the obvious quote mining, the purposeful misinterpretation or perhaps the inability to differentiate fact from fiction of the denialsphere?
PZ Myers has linked to our thread. Nice jump in traffic.
For the record, we’ve never been AGW science deniers. The science is what it is. Our skepticism, if that’s what it should be called, is limited to the politics of the proposed solutions.
I must say that, whether you meant it to sound like that, or not, you do sound like you have bought in to at least some of the nonsense that is coming out of the denialosphere.
No, climate science is not a scam, and nothing in those emails reveals any kind of fraud, if you first understand the context and the real meaning of what was said.
Sure, it could be argued that some of the emails were unethical — although, nobody has been able to show that any of the suggestions to delete emails were anything other than in jest, or as a result of frustration at being harassed — but there is absolutely no evidence of any kind of fraud, or that any of the major conclusions in climate science are wrong.
Your main point (that even if it was, it wouldn’t affect the other sciences), of course, is still sound, but this isn’t the time — and nor would it be ethical — to throw perfectly innocent people under the bus in an effort to placate those who won’t stop until they have thrown every last one of is under it, as well.
Damian says:
That’s just my reaction to anything promoted by Al Gore.
“2. The Russians playing games with the natural gas pipelines”
Wrong, it is Ukraine that plays the games – the pipleline goes through it and they siphon off gas They don’t like free market prices.
“No, climate science is not a scam, and nothing in those emails reveals any kind of fraud, if you first understand the context and the real meaning of what was said. ENDCAPS>”
“It may be true that global warming is largely a scam, although it’s still early days and we really don’t know yet.”
Ah, no it is emphatically not the early days. It is in fact the late days. The science is already settled, we are warming the planet. This has been a well established scientific fact for two decades, and getting stronger all the time.
The fact that the denialist camp isn’t doing it’s own research, isn’t advancing its own theories, but is instead crowing about out-of-context quotes that were stolen by criminals should tell you something of their character and the quality of their evidence.
This who email theft reminds me of the often heard creationist trope of Piltdown man. The idea that because one fraud was discovered out of millions of pieces of evidence, that the rest are automatically suspect or discredited. That’s nonsense when applied to evolution and its nonsense when applied to AGW.
Scientists are people, they are often passionate. They get frustrated and angry, and sometimes one will get greedy and lie. But this predictable human failing isn’t reason to ignore the weight of evidence provided by the rest of the community.
And the denialists shouldn’t be so quick to decry a single act of manipulation, for manipulation is the only this they have going for them.
This is ridiculous. Defund science? I’ll shove my rather well spiked scientific boot up their ignorant a***s before they are allowed to do that. F*** these ignorant, anti-intellectual s**tbags that think that their religion automatically trumps thousands of years of human scientific advancement.
/Fark is here. You all should probably be afraid.
Ugh. The IDiots never cease to disappoint. They’ll cling to whatever dingleberries are dangled in front of them.
As for the AGW denialism tone, I agree; the way this post was written came off in the vein of Glenn Beck’s “I’m not saying such-and-such, I’m just asking questions”. There wasn’t much discussion of the politics of global warming solutions, especially not in phrases like “It may be true that global warming is largely a scam”.
The consensus on AGW is every bit as strong as the consensus on evolution among experts in their respective fields, even if the popular consensuses are quite different.
A cautious “We don’t know yet” with respect to one, weakens your certainty with respect to the other, in my view, because you seem to change criteria midstream. I’m pretty sure Al Gore is not a creationist.
MikeTheInfidel says:
Come on, it wasn’t that bad.
This would be laughable were it not that some people will take this seriously.
Power and money?!? These are not words that come to mind when I think of scientists. In fact, these are perfect antonyms for describing your friendly neighbourhood scientist, who toils in near-complete anonymity, trying to pay back tens of thousands of dollars in student loans, all for the sheer love of doing research.
What exactly do these leaked emails contain that is ammunition for the deranged conspiracy-theory folks? Give me a quote here. All they reveal is that scientists are regular people too: in private emails they will use foul language. Big deal!
While it is true that some of the larger laboratories receive very large grants, does anyone really believe that they are pocketing the cash?!?
Nekulor the Black says: “Fark is here. You all should probably be afraid.”
Yup, terrified. Sorry about the delay and the clean-up. Your comment sent the filters into shock.
If I follow you , then, you cautiously accept that AGW may be real (at least you are not a denier.) You object to the political solutions (specifically you hate Al Gore.) In previous posts you have said: “if the free market can’t fix it we’re toast.”
I would contend that the primitive, call it “fundamentalist” notion of the free market cannot address problems of this nature, because all of the societal costs are externalized, and hence the rational self interest of the individual is to ignore them. This is the well known “Tragedy of the Commons” (see G. Hardin , ‘The Tragedy of the Commons’, Science, 1968.)
The political solution, cap and trade, is an attempt to internalize these costs, in the hope that the free market mechanisms will indeed evolve towards solutions. Undeniably, it has problems, but it is a proactive policy, with the intent of using the powers of the free market, not thwarting them.
IDers are fond of pointing out flaws in evolutionary theory, but are short on actual research or testable theories of their own. I suggest that free market curmudgeons, so quick to point out flaws, and imagine global conspiracies, and whose main solution to any difficult problem is the “free market” (“God did it” ala the IDers), might want to stop being part of the problem and step up with workable solutions of their own. Where are they? Saying the “free market will fix it” is no more than a religious mantra.
Jim Swetnam says:
You follow me just fine.
Well, I’m glad to put the fear of God into the filters. They often slack on the job anyway.
As for the “Science is evil” crowd that Beck and Palin stir up, what can be done to actually get them to think for themselves rather than parrot those idiotic talking heads and their ilk.
Nekulor the Black of Fark asks:
Nothing. Nothing at all. Although it may upset some of my readers, permit me to quote from Atlas Shrugged, where Dr. Ferris said to Dr. Stadler:
Who seriously gives a flying f*** about the Disco Institute’s views on the Hadly leaks? The basic fact is that none of the cherry-picked emails from the 13 year period dispute the science. I personally think it’s more than overdue for the “skeptics”, contrarians and creo fundies to hear how the real scientists of the world think about them. They’re like the GOP, all “no” and no substance, then cry when no-one takes them seriously. Ha f**king ha d***heads, this is the best shot you ever had at casting doubt on climate science and you didn’t come close. Eat it.
the problem is that science is based on facts but driven by emotions. what we don’t understand we try to explain, and we are all subject to making our version of a perceived truth fit our own comfort zone. i don’t think the id-darwin debate has anything to do with science really. it’s not about evolution, it’s about the origin of life. seems to me that it takes just as much faith (yeah i said it) to believe (yeah, i said that too) in an id origin or a complete random series of events —
[That’s enough.]
Although I thoroughly distrust anything Al Gore suggests about global warming or anything else, I must point out that one shouldn’t blindly trust every free-enterprise solution that comes along. Charles Johnson over at Little Green Footballs provided this Amazon link to Doubt is Their Product: How Industry’s Assault on Science Threatens Your Health, indicating that — gasp! — big corporations have been known to fool around when presenting science.
I can’t deny it — the big tobacco companies tried to downplay the cancer risk in using their product. But nobody expected them to be disinterested. Nevertheless, now that tobacco companies have been such a Niagara of tax revenue for government, all seems to be forgiven — especially since their customers may die early and not burden the Social Security system too much. Strange, how these things work out.
Anyway, it’s true that the free enterprise system has its faults. Still, corporations need the consent of their customers, and they’ve got competition too. Governments don’t have to worry about those things. So it seems like an easy choice. We’ll go with free enterprise, every time — especially when the alternative is Al Gore.
This is a good example of why scientists need to scrupulously police themselves against any hint of unethical behavior or fraud among their own: it gives the kooks like the IDers ammo.
And that’s why the revelations from the UEA CRU Data Liberation caper, along with other recent revelations as well as long term practices like not releasing data and data processing code, are so disturbing.
Unlike the case of Evolution vs. Creationism, the conclusions of climatic warming research, most especially the CGM model predictions of dire warming, are NOT settled science for all scientists.
Some examples that will no doubt provoke a few of the Curmudgeon’s gentle readers:

Their author is a real scientist, is not a crank, who accepts Darwinian Evolution, and doesn’t not subscribe to 9-11 Truther hogwash, or think we faked the lunar landings. And he is not alone in his sentiments.
The lesson in this Climate Imbroglio is clear: there is way too much at stake to allow a small group of scientists to turn science into a PR campaign to further an activist agenda — every kook on the planet will seize the opportunity to destroy the public’s faith in science as a means to advance their pet crank theory.
This is the reason why the Climate researchers should have never been allowed to get away with withholding data, and meddling in the peer review process, and threatening to ouster editors at peer-reviewed science journals who dared to publish papers by those who didn’t share the alarmist’s conclusions. It encourages the Creationoids and other kooks to proclaim all of science is perverted and should be ignored in preference for their crank theories du jour.

You actually believe we landed on the moon? BWAHAHAHAHA!
(For all our new visitors today, that’s a bit of Curmudgeonly humor.)
Curmudegeon said:
“corporations need the consent of their customers, and they’ve got competition too. Governments don’t have to worry about those things.”
Even debased republics like ours require the consent of the governed. One hopes that that is informed consent. Where information about risks is not forthcoming, either from corporations or government, then that is the role of science and free inquiry.
All of the human experience cannot be reduced to free enterprise, just as not all of evolution can be reduced to brute individual competition..)
Go to Realcimate.org and track down the original literature yourselves. Contrary to popular misinformation, you can find all of the original data and code there or in the links, if you’re not to lazy to look.

Jim, it would appear from your post you didn’t bother to read the second link.
Oh, well, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it thirsty.
Longshadow:
Read it, have seen it before, it’s refuted. Again see RealClimate.org.
Ahh, Jim; it was first posted 29 Nov 2009 13:10 (EST) on DarwinCentral™. How could it possibly be refuted at RealClimate or anywhere else yet?
Grand arm-waving gestures are not a reasoned rebuttal, nor do they refute the professor’s opinion on climate science.
Longshadow:
I owe you a better response than that. In your second link, within the forest of blog comments, I only saw one figure, which I assumed was your scientific evidence, and that was Steve Mcintyre’s graph.
This graph, which I have seen before referes to a recognized problem with some of the tree ring data (i.e. some species, in some locations). After circa 1960 some of the tree ring data stops tracking the instrumental temperature records. This is known as the “divergence problem.” It is well known among climate researchers, and has been under debate and investigation for more than a decade. All of the other proxies, such as ice cores, coral reefs, etc, do not show this divergence. It’s a problem because these other proxies can only resolve variance at decadal scales, whereas tree rings can resolve inter-decadal variance. That’s why tree rings are neat. But tree rings are not the big picture. ALL of the other data shows Hockey Stick, not to mention large scale current observations.
So what causes the divergence? It’s a subject of active investigation. Some suggestions are that those cold climate adapted trees, which are the one that show divergence, may be growth spurred up to some threshold value which has been reached, then growth limited thereafter.
Maybe. Then maybe it’s something else. The point is, contrary to Steve McIntyre, et. al., this has been a topic of active, open discussion in the literature, and in the emails for quite some time. There is no conspiracy of cover up.
I doubt anyone here is interested in a professor’s opinion, but instead the facts on which it is based.
So what are his facts, and why do the stunning majority of climate scientists disagree with his interpretation of them?
I’m the scientist Longshadow has been quoting.
I understand the divergence problem. The fact that it is unsolved is a real issue for tree-ring proxies. If the method you use doesn’t work for the time period over which you have the most reliable corroborative data, you surely have to worry about it over a much long time period when you have almost no corroboration at all. remember, there is no a priori reason to expect it to work.
My own strong preference vis a vis presenting the data would be to display all the data and acknowledge in the paper that results subsequent to 1960 are divergent. A far less preferable alternative is to omit the data post 1960. What is downright fraudulent is to graft the instrumental record post-1960 onto the proxy record pre-1960, particularly when you then unambiguously deny this has been done. This procedure was discussed in the emails, and it appears clear that it was in fact implemented in various papers.
If I caught a student doing this, he or she would be warned once, and fired the second time. I find it incomprehensible it have been done several times in the literature.
“stunning majority of climate scientists”: please document.
Ronald Bailey, science writer at Reason Magazine, is another one that the DI wants its cheerleaders to think is “silent” on this issue (he’s not). Bailey a few years ago reluctantly went from AGW denier to cautious AGW accepter, and like you and I, has no problem returning to denier if need be.
As far back as 1997 Bailey was on to the DI’s antics. He practically predicted the Wedge document 2 years before it was leaked!
RWP, your comments are well founded, if that indeed happened. It’s too early on for me to judge.
Who are you, really? Surely you don’t sign your papers RWP?
That’s NOT the post I was referring to (it seems the linking function doesn’t provide resolution to the individual post ). Here’s a brief excerpt of the text in the post to which I referred in that same thread.
The author is scientist. He’s appalled at what he sees in the CRU data/e-mail dump. And, he’s not sold on the dire predictions of climatic gloom & doom their CGMs predict.
And on a final note, I just remind everyone that scientific theories are never proven — at best, they are held to be provisionally true pending a falsifying observation. Even the CRU e-mails show the climate scientists admitting that the past several years have not warmed as their models predicted it should, and they have no explanation for it. At the very least, their CGM models are defective, and should not be used for the purpose of determining public policy, especially when someone like AlGore peddles it.
As another scientist on that same thread, albeit earlier, said:
[emphasis added]
By the way, a big hello to the Curmudgeon, an old ally (not to say leader) in fighting for evolution and against creationism among conservatives.
Ah, I see RWP is here in person, so no need for me to speak on his behalf, he being far abler than I am to defend his position.
My name’s on my blog. I post under RWP just because I want to cut down on the google footprint, not because I’m anonymous. However, I just realized I’ve been entering my email address twice on the reply form, instead of the blog link. It’s now fixed. Click on the RWP heading this post, but not the previous ones, and you’ll get to it.
Atheist, libertarian, physical chemist, birder…that’s about it.
RWP. If you have such strong reservations about the proxy data (all of it!?), then, as a scientist it is your moral and professional responsibility to publish your critique. Or are you sincerely afraid of the “global climate conspiracy?”
Andrew Bolt is an Australian journalist and climate sceptic. He writes for a tabloid audience and probably exaggerates his own opinions for the sake of sensationalism. He is a climate sceptic but is certainly not a conservative religious wingnut. The Discovery Institute must have picked up his blog entry and run with it.
Jim:
I come across crap in the literature every day. I publish occasionally in a field where a large fraction of the publications are (IMHO) crap. What makes you think I have time on my hands for what you propose, particularly when Steve McIntyre seems to be doing so nicely on his own?
FWIW, I have less of a problem with isotope proxies (I publish in the area of thermodynamic isotope effects). There are actual a priori reasons to expect them to work.
Gerry
Dr. Harbison
I understand. Not all of us, though, have the luxury of working in fields where all of the data can be specified to 10 decimal points. Ecology and climate are stochaistic and chaotic. We must rely on inference and indirect, or proxy data. Imperfect yes. but far from crap.
Do not dismiss all of the good data just because some of it may be ambiguous.
RWP says: “I’m the scientist Longshadow has been quoting.”
M’god! RWP is here. My cup runneth over.
RWP says: “By the way, a big hello to the Curmudgeon …”
It’s about time you dragged your sorry self over here. I’ve missed your grumpy ways.
“’stunning majority of climate scientists': please document.”
I don’t think at this stage of the game the statement that the majority of climatologists supports AGW theory really requires documentation. It is common knowledge.
However, if you really aren’t aware of this state of affairs, I will be happy to provide it to you.
We can start with any number of IPCC reports of the last eight years, the bulk of the peer reviewed literature spanning two decades, and a recent CNN polling of polar bears about their living conditions, although polar bears are prone to exageration.
There is an argument that is quite current in the AGW debate: We cannot base such vital econonic policy decisions on science that relies on such inferencial and controversial data.
The ironically wrong assumptions here are manifold:
1. That policy is more influenced by data than politics or special interest.
2. That economics itself is any less stochastic and chaotic than climate research. Really, at worst economists, in terms of predictions, might as well be playing roulette. At best they’re just counting cards in blackjack.
3. The notion that the ego capital scientists accrue in their research is in some way a more powerful threat to life and liberty than simple greed and lust for power.
4. That a global depression would be much worse than a global ecological catastrophe.
5. That global science conspiracies are even possible.
WOW! I go away for a day and come back to the longest thread of comments I’ve ever seen here. Amazing what the work of one unknown hacker can do. Just goes to show the power of anonymity on the internet. Anyone can say anything and it will be believed by many others.
I liked the response that PZ Myers linked to at
What would the anonymous hacker find if he broke into the the Discovery Institute’s emails?
The one thing about science is, no matter what fraud or misrepresentation there is, it is eventually discovered and revealed. Can the Discoveroids say the same thimg?
Best comment goes to these guys:
Goodness… A lot of AGW and not much on the blatant idiocy of DI. Poor Curmy, being yelled at for being a climate skeptic when he’s just not thrilled by the company that surrounds it. And to be honest, even those who are convinced and want to do something about it are a little alarmed by the politicizing on the “left” of the “debate.” And apparently with some good reason considering some of these emails.
Albanaeon says:
It’s a cruel world. Not intelligently designed at all.
Albanaeon (what does that mean?)
And what do you mean? I am a simpleton, and this is just too ephemeral for me.
What are you talking about, Curmy? Everything makes PERFECT sense when viewed from the perspective of talking snakes, evil apples, and really big wooden boats.
Albanaeon
OK, I got it.
Thanks
Still don’t know about Albanaeon. I guess I’ll just have to check Wikipedia
Jim Sweetman, first my name is just a pseudonym, like “Mark Twain,” just without any real cultural reference. Second, I think you’re talking about the “politicizing” of AGW within the “left.” I’ll just say that some of the rhetoric towards “defending the planet” goes over the line towards denying human rights, particularly when economic growth and the freedoms it can grant would improve peoples lives and grant this poor abused world the stability it needs to really address its problems.
Hey Jim, don’t take any of my comments as snark. Its been a long day…
Albanaeon
I detected no snark at all.
As for human rights, I tend towards the pessimistic. We are facing multiple catastrophes, in order of magnitude: climatic, ecological, economical, political, social.
It does not even matter who is right about AGW, that’s rhetorical. Human rights will go to the savage.
Personally, I think Homo sapiens will survive, we are adaptable. The planet itself will regard this as no more than a blip, nothing like the Permian extinction. Whether civilization will survive is another story. I will personally miss modern dentistry.
Jim Swetman (I do apologize for the complete mis-reading of your name. Critical read fail #2…)
Just wanted to be sure. And I’ll agree that things will change, humanity will go on but a bit different, and I’ll probably miss a lot of animals, but I definitely won’t miss modern dentistry from the sheer number of horror stories I could tell you…
Albanaeon
When I was a grade school child in northern New Mexico I had my teeth drilled without anesthetic using a foot powered drill. I once had an extracation of a premolar without anaesthtic. That’s not modern dentistry. These days I listen to soothing music and go into a blissful zen-like state (comparatively speaking), while a true artisan sculpts my fragmenting 60 year old teeth into something functional again.
I think of the female pharoh Hapshepsut, whose mummy showed terrible abcesses in her jaw due to bad dental care. She died in horrible agony, and all of the wealth and power in the world could not save her fom that.
This is why I always thank my dentist for his skills after every session. He deserves it. So does civilization.
“Atheist, libertarian, physical chemist, birder…that’s about it.”
So, not climatologist then. However, perceptive your opinions, they do not affect the question of how settled the issue is among experts, contrary to the claim introducing your ideas.
Yeah, I know. I would say my complaints may be more against some of the “modern dentists” rather than dentistry itself. Like the one who so ineptly gave me Novocaine that when he started drilling the non-numbed area it was actually less painful than the injections. Or not notice a cracked tooth and removing a perfectly good filling instead. Or a friend having all feeling removed from his right jaw during a wisdom tooth removal. All these were done by military dentists so that would probably have an effect. I do, however, appreciate greatly my rebuilt teeth so I can only complain so much.
To the people who say nobody in Europe is working on the problem – bulls****.
Companies, engineers and governments ARE working on the problem. It is supported by the science and engineering communities and publications.
In the USA the engineering communities largely work against it.
Hey, Curmy,
Now I understand why you have chosen to stay clear of the AGW debate. A few of the AWG crowd seem to be VERY impassioned; much like the so-called “activists” who riot in the streets whenever there is a world trade summit.
At any rate, we would definitely be putting less carbon into the atmosphere if we replaced coal-fired power plants with nuclear. I’ll throw the question out there for debate — what’s the problem? It seems as though those who object to nuclear do so because they want the economy to fail.
Most of what the global warming sceptics hace done from the beginning is lie and suppress research. It is sad if there has been even a hint of of such behavior on the part of the folks who are otherwise practicing legitimate science. I learned about the well orchestrated attempts to cover up the truth about global warming by sincerely checking into it. I got suspicious when I could only find the same handful of sceptical “scientists” cited as being against anthropogenic global warming. more suspicious as I checked their credentials. Then I found the Hudson Institute, which listed hundreds of scientists that had “written papers” showing global warming was a fraud. Well, I wrote to about the first 30 or so on their list to get the lowdown. I got responses back from almost all of them and all but 1 specifically said that anthropogenic global warming is the only theory that can currently account for what is happening. The one person who did not respond in this way differed only in somewhat downplaying humanity’s role, but even he said we were part of the problem. Many of the scientists were outraged at the Hudson Institute’s mischaracterization of their position. One surmised that the institute might try to say that some of their papers, written some years ago when everyone was writing about things like Solar variability, counted against the newer views… but he said that none of those theories could account for current data and anthropogenic global warming can. Frankly, I’d suspect “climategate” is another scam on the part of the so-called sceptics (oil company stooges?). But if it isn’t, it is sad that a few misguided scientists have sunk to the level of the “sceptics”.
retiredsciguy.
Beware of stereotyping, sir, it’s seldom helpful in a debate.
For myself, I think nuclear might well be a viable option, but I wouldn’t put all my eggs there either.
The problems with nuclear are past the NIMBY syndrome. I can agree, for the sake of argument, that nuclear plants can be designed to be safe and reliable. For the sake of argument, I’ll even concede that we might be able to safely store the waste in geologically stable formations, and that he transportation of said wastes can be accomplished securely. Would you grant that I have been reasonable so far?
Well then, the real scary part, as I see it, is creating and securing all of the vast amounts of new fissionables that we would have to produce to power these things. My goodness, some of the people in the right-wing camp that champion nuclear power are also so terrified of terrorism that they don’t wan’t to try terrorists on US soil, yet they would allow vast amounts of fissionable material to be made and transported. I have read intelligence reports (unclassified, and second hand, to be sure) that claim that nuclear materials have been stolen here and abroad not once, but many times. All of the other problems are just engineering, and hence amenable to good solutions. Engineering against human error and venality is something that has never been completely solved.
Unfortunately, longshadow is committing the exact same fallacy as the creationists. Gerald Harbison is a scientist, so therefore he knows what he is talking about. Well, Dr Egnor is a scientist of sorts (he’s actually a surgeon), and so too are Michael Behe and many other “skeptics” of well established science.
Dr Harbison is actually a chemist, so why would anyone expect him to understand climate science, I have to ask?
But I need to be clear. It doesn’t actually matter whether you are a chemist, a climate scientist, or you work at McDonald’s, that doesn’t automatically mean that your ideas deserve either respect or disrespect. It matters whether your ideas map well to reality, to the known data, and to that which is already in the literature.
Now, I admit that it can become complicated: I mean, who on earth do we trust, if anyone?
Well, first and foremost, if you are a layperson (or even a scientist in another field), unless you understand what you are talking about; that is, unless you have taken the time to do the requisite research; you are, in my opinion, morally required to, at the very least, trust the consensus in a particular field more so than anything else. That is, as I’ve said, unless you have a particularly good reason not to.
But it doesn’t end there. If you are a scientist, and you harbor doubts about a particular field of research, and as Jim Swetman has said, you are in a unique position to be able to publish your doubts and conclusions.
However, that comes with some extra responsibility. If, after several years, I or anyone else, see that you haven’t really bothered to do so, and that you generally spend your time on the internet telling non-scientists about your concerns, I am perfectly within my rights to conclude that your concerns are either not really that well informed, or that there is some other, perhaps ideological, reason that you haven’t bothered to take them any further.
And that is effectively the position that we are in, regardless of a scientists qualifications in another field, and in most of the sciences that attract attention in this regard: be that climate science, evolutionary biology, HIV research, you name it.
If, as is actually the case, in my opinion, all of the so called concerns have been adequately answered (i.e. they haven’t persuaded the majority of climate scientists), then I am once again morally required to trust the consensus, unless I am prepared to do more than simply pick at the margins, by pointing to a few things that often have little relevance to said consensus.
If anyone knows of a better system, let’s hear about it.
“If anyone knows of a better system, let’s hear about it.”
Trust in Jaysus. It’s so much simpler than all that heavy thinking.
Understand implicitly that human beings are far too small to effect something as huge and complex as the big old Earth, and even if we did it’s too intricate for us to understand anyway, and therefore you don’t have to feel the least responsibility to alter your consumptive lifestyle to address the issue.

Now on its 15th year, the NCPW 2009 is scheduled on September 1-7 and focuses on the involvement of the family in crime prevention, hence its theme “Labanan ang Krimen, Pamilya Patatagin”.
The celebration is pursuant to Presidential Proclamation No. 461 dated August 31, 1994 declaring the first week of September of every year as the National Crime Prevention Week.
According to the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) NCPW Technical Working Committee, the focal point of this year’s celebration is on the importance of “the role of the family not just in assisting in the area to enforce the law but also in the endeavor to shape the values and attitudes of its members towards an effectively functioning justice system, promoting crime prevention strategies, and campaigning for home and community safety.”
PRO1 head PCSupt. Ramon V. Gatan, in his welcome address during the flag-raising rites at San Fernando City Hall this morning (September 1) as part of the nationwide simultaneous kick-off ceremony for the NCPW, stressed that crime prevention is everybody’s concern and should involve the active participation of all sectors of the community.
“As head of the Police Regional Office 1, the agency principally tasked to prevent and control crimes in the region, I know firsthand the necessity of active citizen participation in the success of our anti-criminality campaign. In fact, it has long been PRO1’s guiding principle to involve all sectors of the community in our fight against crime and other forms of lawlessness,” Gatan said.
The NCPW kick-off program at the San Fernando City Hall was followed by a motorcade around the city and a press conference at the Masigasig Center here.
Various NCPW activities are lined up for the rest of the week which include a seminar on Student-Based Anti-Crime and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control at the La Union National High School Quadrangle on September 2; a blood-letting activity dubbed “Sagut a Biag” at CSI, Biday, San Fernando City on September 3; and jail visitation and gift-giving at San Fernando City Jail, La Union Provincial Jail and the youthful offenders facility at Urayong, Bauang, La Union on September 4.
In a memorandum, DILG Secretary Ronaldo V. Puno, enjoined all provincial, city and municipal Peace and Order Councils (POCs) to actively support the projects and activities related to the celebration of the National Crime Prevention Week. pnppro1By admin • Jan 14, 2014 • Selected Work

Why? Well, the black-and-white image showed the Hannah Montana star shirtless and in bed and beside the "Whip My Hair" singer. Given the massive age difference between the pair, many believe the image is inappropriate and sends the wrong message.
Now, Willow's parents Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's hands-off parenting approach has once again been called into question. So, what does Jada think of the photo that many deem to be sexual?
TMZ caught up with her on Wednesday after she arrived at LAX for a trip to New York City, New York, and she was not impressed by having to answer questions about her 13-year-old daughter. In fact, she strongly denied there was anything sexual about the picture and told reporters they "were projecting their trash onto it and acting like covert pedophiles."
So, that's the end of the story, and there will be no further action taken by Willow's parents.

The Milwaukee Brewers have a glaring weakness at first base. As of right now, their best bet is Juan Francisco, which means something must be changed immediately. Yesterday, I mentioned the Brewers should trade for slugger Adam Dunn. As great as that would be, he’s owed $15 million in 2014, which is a tad expensive. For that reason, the better bet might be to sign free agent first baseman Michael Young.
Milwaukee is reportedly interested in Young, and at this point, I would be shocked if they didn’t sign the veteran. The Brewers must do something to inject some excitement into the fan base with a talented player who will bring a spark to the offense.
Dunn is someone who would have a field day at Miller Park as far as home runs are concerned, but he wouldn’t do much else. Young, on the other hand, has seen his power diminish over the years. However, he still is capable of being a big-time run producer, which is something Milwaukee needs. He also is a solid defensive first baseman, something the Brewers don’t have at the moment. In fact, he has plenty of experience of suiting up at all four infield positions.
There’s some speculation that Milwaukee is making it publicly known that they have interest in Young because they want to gain leverage over the New York Mets in a trade for Ike Davis. However, I don’t believe that to be the case. I think the Brewers are truly interested in the acquisition of Young because of his presence on and off the field.

Most studies about the effects of producers' services on manufacturing agglomeration focus on the effects themselves while neglecting the mechanism that such effects spread. By stressing the key role of trade costs in the process of manufacturing agglomeration, this paper identifies a chain of effects from producers' service improvements to manufacturing agglomeration via changing trade costs and builds a simple model to enable empirical analysis. Both in the mechanism used to assess this chain of effects and in the empirical model, trade costs are dealt with as a mediator variable. Empirical tests using firm-level data from China support the hypothesis that producers' services affect manufacturing agglomeration via changing trade costs. Further tests at the two-digit sector level show that these types of mediator effects vary in accordance with differences in sector factor intensiveness. Specifically, the mediator effects are more significant in the technology-intensive manufacturing industries than they are in the labor- or capital-intensive manufacturing industries. The policy implication of this finding is that encouraging the development and regional concentration of producers' services would not only promote manufacturing agglomeration but also stimulate technology progress in related.Camden Food Delivery and Takeaway NSW

A.D. Falcone (Penn State University), Swift Team
Observations of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) with Swift produced the initially surprising result that many bursts have large X-ray flares on top of the decaying afterglow light curves. These flares were sometimes intense (factor of nearly 1000 times underlying afterglow emission in one case), relatively rapid, and they occurred well after the nominal prompt phase of the GRB. The most intense of these X-ray flares (from GRB 050502b) was observed by XRT several minutes after the cessation of the prompt emission detected by BAT. This burst continued to surprise observers by flaring again after > 10000 sec. Although the intense flare was initially surprising, it can be most easily understood within the context of the standard fireball model, if the internal engine that powers the prompt GRB emission is still active at times in excess of 1000 s. After ~ 1 year of Swift observations, it is apparent that these X-ray flares are frequent (~ 1/3 of XRT detected afterglows show evidence of flares). It is also evident that they have varying characteristics, which can be classified and studied. By studying the properties of these flares (such as rise/fall time, onset time, spectral variability, NH,…) and relating them to the overall burst properties, the models for the flare production and the characteristics of the GRB internal engine can be constrained.

BOTTOM LINE: An excellent story in a well-imagined future.
Ah, life. Something to be treasured. Live for every moment and make all moments count. You don’t get a second chance.
Wait. Scratch that. That’s ancient history.
In the fascinatingly well-imagined future of Altered Carbon, a person’s memories and personalities are able to be recorded, transmitted to any of the three dozen human-inhabited worlds across the universe and downloaded into new bodies (called “sleeves”). In short, life is cheap. Just copy the memories from your cortical stack to digital storage and load it into a new stack. It’s nice to know that if you are killed, you can just be re-sleeved and get on with things.
In Richard K. Morgan’s debut novel, Takeshi Kovacs, an Envoy operative, is killed but his stored memories are re-sleeved into a new body courtesy of Laurens Bancroft, a rich man who is accused of committing suicide. But Bancroft, having been subsequently re-sleeved himself, wants Kovacs to prove that he was murdered. What follows this opening premise is a whirlwind made up of equal parts post-modern cyberpunk and mystery.
During the first part of the book, I was held captive by the cool idea of DHS (Digital Human Storage) and the mechanics and issues surrounding it. For instance, there is the automatic backing up of one’s memories. In case something goes wrong with your current body like, say, it is violently torched or otherwise blown to Kingdom Come, just download your last saved copy into a new body. Also, “double” and “multi-sleeving”, downloading memories into two or more bodies simultaneously, is illegal in this dark future.
The middle part of the book concentrated on the mystery surrounding Bancroft’s death. Kovacs uncovers a web of increasingly shady and seedy activities. Although the story thankfully made the science integral to the mystery, this part of the book was weaker than the rest. In it, Kovacs was mostly in the dark and being tossed around. Now might be a good time to mention the graphic violence peppered throughout the story. There are some pretty descriptive action/torture scenes. And, as if in some sort of twisted shock contest, the sex scenes were pretty graphic as well. Actually, they would easily qualify as pornography. (I had to read one particularly lengthy sex scene six or seven times just to make sure my last statement is valid. It is. :))
The last part of the story was when Kovacs kicked it into high gear. For me, that’s when the book really shined and became more of a page-turner.
The terse narrative is quickly paced and the first-person perspective lends much to the novel’s noir feel. The story weaves together a handful of interesting themes like Cyberpunk, Religion (Catholics don’t like DHS), cloning and immortality (Bancroft is a “Meth”, named after Methuselah because he is hundreds of years old).
The characters, in general, were well-written. Kovacs had an attitude that just wouldn’t quit making him likable even when he was being a schmuck. Other characters were not really as memorable except for maybe Ortega as the reluctant cop and Miriam Bancroft as the stoic wife.
Overall, Altered Carbon is an excellent novel and is both a Locus Award winner for first novel and a finalist for the 2004 Philip K. Dick Award. And, according to the book’s description of the author, it has already been optioned by Hollywood. But wait, there’s more! Turns out this is the first in a series. (Is any sf a stand-alone novel these days?) The sequel, Broken Angels, will be avialable in a few weeks. I’ll be adding it to my enormously long book list.
I too will give Altered Carbon 4 out 5 stars. I really liked the meshing of a noir-style hard-edged detective story with a well thought-out SF world. Very well done, especially the tech aspects.
I took off because, as John said, the story seemed to meander in the middle, and, for me, the reason for Bancroft’s death just didn’t live up to the hype. Otherwise, I recommend it for your reading list.
Looks like Science Fiction Weekly gave the sequel, Broken Angels, a good review.Choose Download Location

One person was transported to the Washington Burn Center for non-life threatening injuries.
The family has been displaced.Is quality of life having a mall and a Starbucks to drive to like in the uber congested and bizarre UTC area or is it being able to take your kids for a bike ride down Encinitas Blvd. without fear of them getting rundown by traffic?
Density has been a bit of a dirty word in this town over the years but I have always seen it a little bit differently. To me, "good" density is when small towns have multi-level apartments and live work lofts and mixed use buildings. A town with density creates a lively walking vibe with people on the sidewalks and small markets and bakeries and other shops. The town should be surrounded by open space that you can escape to when you and your sweetie need a little elbow room.
Unfortunately, there is little to no open space left surrounding Encinitas (the beach is still the best place to go if you can get a parking spot). "New" Encinitas" is sprawl, which means all those beautiful rolling hills are now ugly tract stucco houses and those people needs cars to get around full time. (I'm not a freaky anti-car hippie but I like to stretch my legs and walk whenever I can).
UTC and even "New" Encinitas was not built to ever evolve and change overtime. It is set up to be a stagnant environment forever. Density needs to be formed as an infrastructure that will serve future needs and growth over time. It must be allowed to evolve organically.
Carlsbad has sprawled to our boarders and the once lovely coast highway cruise isn't quite the same as it once was. El Camino Real I avoid at all cost.
UTC is the worst case scenario for Encinitas. Sprawl meets poorly planned density. Unfortunately, I fear that the myopic grumps in charge consider UTC as a model of success.
Blah.
That aerial photograph of utc gave me a new perspective. Are there any such pictures of Encinitas we can look at?
I suspect most people think it is nuts to believe that Encinitas will become as dense as the golden triangle. Hey we are at buildout! Noone in Encinitas would rather live there... but we have a Council that is ultra-prodeveloper and anti-law abiding.
Build-out? This Council recently added three permanent planners to the staff. This was against the objectives of the always knowledgable Donna Westbrook on grounds that it was a dumb financial move and the questioning of the thin diversionary justification for the additional planners by Kevin Cummins. Council avoided exploring the justification, ignoring Cummins, and Stocks attempted to belittle Westbrook's comments (twee). There was no convincing arguements for spending all that extra money on staffing.
Shouldn't they clearly justify why they are spending our money? Is the real reason too objectionable to speak in public?
When there was still open space 40 or 50 years ago, sprawl wasn't such a bad word. The tract homes provided backyards and more space than living in apartments. UTC is sprawl, but it is upward. It meets the definition of smart growth - high density. The phrase "rat race" applies to high density housing. The question is how many people can be crammed into a city block. Will UTC eventually become as crowded as New York or Hong Kong? Smart growth isn't smart, but it is growth.
I disagree. I don't consider UTC smart growth at all. Places like UTC and Mission Valley are created by developers, not designers.
The devil is in the details like Mayor Dalagher likes to say. Just because a building is "mixed use" doesn't mean it's good.
My wife and I took a driving tour of San Elijo Hills yesterday. It's like a town out of the films The Truman Show and Pleasantville rolled into one. The big goofy homes with their faux shutters and castle turrents have very small or no backyards. The bizarre thing is that they are gated off from each other. Paranoia?
There is one road in and out. It's classic sprawl. They start at $800,000 and the new residents will be heading straight for the Leucadia Blvd/coast highway intersection. It's going to be chaos, ha-ha!
The beauty of the phrases "smart growth" and "mixed use" is that each person had their idea of the vision. Developers and government use those different views to their advantage. Look at all the mixed use and higher density in Little Italy. Buildings out to the sidewalk and more floors than the older buildings. The buildings will be destined for demotion in 20 or 30 years when the next round of developers appear.
It used to be called selling someone a bill of goods, and now it's called smart growth and mixed use.
Don't you think you sound like a bunch of NIMBYs?
Funny thing about JP's observation about Mayor Dalager always saying the devil is in the details is that Dalager either doesn't or can't analyse the details.
Is the NIMBY comment from a developer or cohort of a developer?
I'm not a NIMBY, you can build a house or a business next door to me(as long as you acquired the land fair and square). I am for good design, good architecture and a sustainable infrastructure. The irony is that I am looking out for your best interest. I don't want you to sit in traffic for 3 hours a day(time you should spend with your family) and I don't want your kids to have to grow up in a generic sprawl neighborhood behind bars without soul or class. I got your back man.
hmm, this sounds like time for a new topic...Total Units

Drew University calls "Batter Up" for a free symposium on Race, Faith and Baseball that is open to the public this Friday, April 12. Sixty-five years ago, Jackie Robinson became the first African-American in the modern era to play Major League Baseball. His breaking of the color barrier in American sports became a watershed event in the struggle for equal rights. But, few people know that Robinson’s efforts to challenge racism and prejudice extended beyond the baseball field and continued after his playing career ended.
In 2009, a rare copy of a television program hosted by Robinson on the subject of faith, race and business ethics surfaced at Drew University in the collections of the United Methodist Archives and History Center. As a part of the annual Arts of Respect Festival, a program titled The Sports of Respect: Race, Faith and Baseball will be hosted by the Methodist Archives, Drew Athletics and the Center on Religion, Culture and Conflict. Jonathan Golden Assoc. Director of the Center on Religion, Culture and Conflict says, "The focus of this conference reflects the commitment of the Center on Religion, Culture and Conflict at Drew to understanding conflict involving faith and race anywhere. The story of Jackie Robinson is an American baseball story. At the same time, it carries the universal themes that are critical to the work of the Center on Religion Culture and Conflict."
This one-day conference is open to the public at no charge. The program will begin at 10:00 a.m. on April 12, with registration beginning at 9:30 a.m. Conference events will held in Drew’s Ehinger Center in Crawford Hall. For more information, please contact Anderson at cjanders@drew.edu or visit.

I think this is the one you mean:
The average citizen regards himself as healthy so long as the little discomforts he shrugs off as "inevitable" do not incapacitate him for work or for enjoying a televised fight. Public acceptance of well-being means suffering with no more than a touch of sinus, bursitis, neuritis, indigestion, heartburn gas, constipation, athlete's foot, poor eyesight, dry hair, brittle finger nails, fatigue, frequent colds, corns, assorted allergies, decayed teeth, blotchy skin, obesity, irritation, and occasional insomnia.

We're not sure if Progress Energy Florida chief Jeff Lyash, above, can quote the starting lineup of the much improved Tampa Bay Rays, but it is no fluke that he was named last week as the head of a group of community, city and county leaders whose charge is to search for a new site for a Major League Baseball stadium. If this smacks of deja vu, it should. It was Jack Critchfield, left —"Dr. Jack," as he preferred to be called for his doctorate in education — who as a baseball fanatic and chairman of St. Petersburg's Florida Progress Corp. was a key leader in wooing a baseball franchise to Tampa Bay in the mid 1990s. The power company even bought a modest stake in the team, which was later divested. "When I was a kid, I dreamed of playing Major League Baseball," Critchfield, then 65, told the St. Petersburg Times in 1998. Now Critchfield is a TV star, of sorts, on most Rays televised home games since he can be seen often in his seat in the front row directly behind home plate. Last week's choice of Lyash to head the new search committee is part legacy and part economic reality. Progress Energy Florida is still one Big Kahuna in St. Petersburg and the bay area.
Tough time for Banker of Year
It's tough for a banker to feel like celebrating these days, even one just named Florida's Banker of the Year. "Everybody's struggling," said Kenneth Cherven, who was recognized this month by the Florida Bankers Association. "You don't feel like 'banker of the year' in these kind of times. You feel like you ought to be doing a lot more."
Cherven, CEO of First Community Bank Corp. of America in Pinellas Park, said he was shocked to receive the honor, although his friends and employees had been in on the secret for months. The association recognized him for years of contributions to the industry, including launching a four-year banking degree at St. Petersburg College and serving as national president of the American Institute of Banking.
Yes, Lightning brass live here
Amid the hoopla of new ownership of the Tampa Bay Lightning, the fact that two members of the ownership team are prominent area businessmen got little attention. Craig Sher of the Sembler real estate development group and Kane's Furniture chief Irwin Novack, both of St. Petersburg, are local representatives in an otherwise geographically distant group of owners.
Cautionary tale for cities
Mayor Pam Iorio gets top billing in a recent Business Week story that is, alas, a cautionary tale for cities trying to revitalize their downtowns during the troubled economy. Tampa's 2003 initiative aimed for 11,000 condos, a 19-story office building and a downtown population goal of growing from 2,000 to 20,000. Then came the economic brakes. "Now only about 3,500 of the planned condo units have either been built or are under construction... and many remain vacant."
Times StaffTwo people are dead and up to 150 prisoners and guards are injured after a gas explosion at a Florida jail.
A search-and-rescue operation is under way after the explosion about 11pm, a county spokeswoman said. Between 100 and 150 inmates and corrective officers have been hurt.
The explosion in Escambia County jail's booking facility caused the building to partially collapse, the county's public information manager, Kathleen Castro, said. About 600 inmates were in the building at the time, she said.
Ms Castro didn't know if flooding in the area was a factor but said the jail was flooded during heavy rains that drenched the region on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The injured were brought to hospitals and the uninjured inmates were brought to jails in neighbouring counties, Ms Castro said.

Day late dollar short for Apple.
Android is unstoppable at this point, it will only get bigger and better, and they are probably just now thinking.. “hmm maybe we should have gone with more carriers, and more devices..”
Too late- Android is a monster virus.
Apple is pretty much pwned, and the only thing they have in their corner is their (dwindling) marketshare and the fact that their apps are currently better due to having more memory onboard.
That will change too, and all the devs will quickly port their apps over to Android and then there wont really be a comparison..
The great thing is that Android is backed by a financial juggernaut like Google and won’t be pushed around easily by Apples goon lawyers
Android’s main goal right now should be getting devices to market that can handle apps the size of iPhones w/o dragging the phone down in speed.. (easily rectified by figuring out an sd card solution)
that would be the final nail
I’m loving it. Apple is picking a battle with the wrong corporate giant, and they know it! In order for Apple to be targeting HTC like this (indirectly targeting Google) you know they must be worried. I’m sick of Apple with their shady marketing and shoving DRM up people’s asses while making a phone that STILL CAN’T MULTITASK.
These damn patents are getting pretty rediculous. I understand one needs to protect their investment, but I feel these patents are going to impede technology. Why have it so only one company can produce something when others can improve on it for the benefit of the end user?
In my opinion, the market is better served when there are fewer “toll roads” and economic landmines blocking innovation and competition. US patent office wants to hand out patents like candy doesn’t mean the rest of us should really care. If you can’t compete, you sue.
Holy Cow are you people deluded. This is like picking a fight with a retard.
“Android is a monster virus.”
- yep. and I don’t know anyone who wants to get a virus. That’s why they stick with Apple. NO VIRUSES on OS X or iPhone OS.
“The great thing is that Android is backed by a financial juggernaut like Google and won’t be pushed around easily by Apples goon lawyers”
- It’s the justice department and legal system that will crush Android/Google. Lawyers don’t make or enforce laws. When you blatantly steal IP by sitting on a company’s board until you have all of the info you need – you’ve pretty much screwed yourself. And as of this morning Apple was worth $60 BILLION more than Google with over $20 BILLION more CASH on hand.
“I’m sick of Apple with their shady marketing and shoving DRM up people’s asses while making a phone that STILL CAN’T MULTITASK.”
-Shady marketing? More like “the truth hurts”.
-As for DRM, it was the record labels that required DRM as a condition of selling Digital Tracks. You ignorant pin-heads can thank Apple for making digital downloads legal. You can then thank Apple for making the record labels unbundle albums. You can then thank Apple for pressuring the record labels to stop requiring DRM. Do your homework little boy.
-The iPhone is perfectly capable of multitasking.
It’s amazing how you liberal ‘tards want to just let companies like Apple work hard and produce the greatest products in the world and then steal it all and cry “Open source!, Open source!”
I cry for your stupidity.
Above post is an epic fail.
And my down rank just made it go away… at least out of sight until you click.
“Above post is an epic fail.”
-nice opinion. care to elaborate? I know. you can’t.
retard.
“And my down rank just made it go away”
That’s right, put your head in the sand when you can’t refute facts.
nobody’s gonna waste their time explaining things to a retard like you

Sometimes I wonder about you people….apple fanboys and their iArrogance.
Like I said, just like picking a fight with retards.
????”
- WOW a VOIP App 4 years after Skype. That’s REAL innovation. And how DARE Apple keep it off of their App Store just because it violated the terms of the agreements in place. Blame Apple, not the developer who failed to follows the guidelines. Think a little bit. Not all censorship is bad, either. If you can’t think of an example of good censorship, then you are proving my point about being mentally challenged.
I think Apple is skerd. These patents are so vague they need to be either refined/defined or thrown out.
wee i have allways been a htc rebel love the tech and it has gotten better, but apple wants u to pay al that money without insuring the phones money money money apple apple apple. everybody cant afford a phone that cant b ins.
Wow…sounds like someone has a hard-on for Steve Jobs… Dude sounds like one of the sheep…
Haha I would have to agree xD
SCREW APPLE…. they make me sick, I was so pissed when I found out they were gonna get the palm pre considering how no other service carrier has the iphone, now they wanna attack the one company that come close to giving them a run for their money. F em, and if they win the suit and it affects android and htc users please believe apple will lose a lot of their consumers. Some of my associates used htc phones but have apple ibooks they really like both companies but apple need to check themselves before they cause more damage to themselves
I have no love for Apple, I have an Android phone for a reason. I would not nor never will have a product from a company that says what i can and can not do with a product that I have purchased. If we were just leasing the phones then I could understand, but we don’t lease them, we buy them. Apple is scared now that they see what Android can do.
I think HTC here is going to have to follow the same legal approach Microsoft took against Apple in the 80s/early 90s. Apple’s lawsuit against Microsoft (over “copying Apple’s UI) was thrown out because Microsoft showed that Apple had ripped off Xerox.
It is true that Apple received an extremely broad patent covering multitouch, but that does not necessarily mean that the patent can withstand scrutiny in a court of law. The U.S. Patent Office has about 6,000 researchers for patent applications, and as you can imagine, they have a tough time recruiting talent to handle the increasingly technical applications that are flying into their inbox. The U.S. Patent Office currently has a backlog of over 1.2 million patent applications. In other words, they have yet to research or examine the voracity or claims of over 1.2 million patent applications. With only 6,000 or so researchers, the U.S. Patent Office basically employs the honor system and more-often-than-not assumes that the claims made in applications or true.
Apple may have a multitouch patent, but there are numerous multitouch patents and applications that predate Apple’s patent (;post-2411). In addition, there are currently lawsuits against Apple for patent infringement. “Over what issue?” you might ask. Multitouch.
Read about those here:
My personal favorite, however, is “Time-based, non-constant translation of user interface objects between states” (Patent Number 7362331). It describes the way in which a row of icons automatically rearranges when icons are added or removed. I’m pretty sure Windows computers have been doing this for years. In fact, I remember my Compaq iPAQ from 2000 doing the same thing as well.
The motive in going after HTC first is simple. It’s a scare-tactic. It is my guess that Apple is looking to scare HTC and Android developers because of Android’s quickly increasing market share. Apple definitely sees Android as a threat. As many have noted before, this really is not about HTC. They are a proxy. Google/Android is the real target.
I feel Apple is acting like 3 year kid, and this kids makes/ draws some figures,sketechs,tilt the paper, And these will be considered as ideas, it will be submitted to Patent office by his Good and great Father.
I ashamed myself (Bcos I love Apple) Apple for submitting OOP operating system as a patent, as I studied it in 1980′s. These people should give back money to inventor of C/C++ Language(+Linux).Apple should pay entire money to US Army/N/A for inventing Internet.
One more thing, Apple should give money to China. As they invented Scripts.
O! Apple should give money to India, as they invented “o”s.
Last but not the least; Apple should give money to AT&T, as they invented Phones
(Forget about Patent expiry period)
Ok why is everyone saying the HTC Desire is going to AT&T did i miss something???? I really hope to god AT&T DOES NOT get the Desire that would be the worst descion HTC could ever make
Why would you not want the Desire to come to AT&T? It’s an amazing and powerful phone.

2bed/2bath house, Sneem, County Kerry, Ireland
2004, 1 week
Location is a quite remote location on the ring of Kerry. The views are brilliant. So close to the water, we just fell in love with the place. The shower is amazing and it has cool underfloor heating from a geothermal heating system. A very peaceful place.
Drive to groceries in Sneem which is a lovely little village .. a real Irish town. Some brilliant restaurants nearby.
The house was recently built and is well finished. Some amazing art work. It located on some very rural townland away from it all.
Very private outside with an area to the side for sitting out in the evening and having a pint of Guinness.
All furniture and facilities where tip top. Seemed like they where all new. Very relaxed and clean place. Sheets and bed all perfect ... a big King size bed with views of the sea!
Nice beds. The other room had two singles which could be zipped together.
Loads of stuff. Good quality as well. The views from the kitchen are brilliant. We had the music on and used the gas cooker (5 rings if I remember). They also had DVD and Video player and a large selection of books.
I wish I could buy the place.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Walking, swiming, fishing, hitchiking touring, golf etc.All are welcome to join the fun.

Two dairy operations west of Albany, N.Y., were completely devastated by flash flood as Hurricane Irene dumped a foot of water on portions of New York and New England. One herd of 121 cows was completely swept away by the raging waters. A second herd was moved to higher ground before flash flooding destroyed the dairy buildings, says Doug DiMento with Cabot Cheese. Central, southern and western Vermont bore the brunt of the flooding, with many roads and bridges washed out, adds Bob Stoddard with Agri-Mark. “Some farms will be hard to get to individually for milk pick up,” he says. “Others will simply take longer to reach as trucks are re-routed to avoid road closures and bridge washouts.” In reality, reports of damage are still coming in so the full extent of the damage is not yet known, both Dimento and Stoddard say. Loss of power is also an issue in the region. But many dairies have on-farm generators, purchased after ice storms over the past few winters knocked out power. These dairies will be able to milk cows, but milk pickups will likely be delayed and some dumping will likely occur as bulk tanks reach capacity. “We were without power for 36 hours and just got it back up about an hour ago,” says Charlie Patterson of Chestertown, Md. He and his wife, Sherry, milk 300 cows on their dairy on the state’s eastern shore. The Pattersons relied on their generator to get them through the storm and its aftermath. They had no loss of livestock and minimal disruption to their operations. ‘We had some corn laid down that hasn’t been chopped yet,” Patterson says. “I’m a little worried about that.” The hurricane also downed numerous trees and caused creeks to flood. “I’ve got a couple of sheets of tin to get tacked down, and some shingles on my house, but the storm wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be,” he adds. For the most part, dairy processing facilities escaped unscathed and are operating normally. “We were pretty fortunate in our area,” says Amber DuMont, spokeswoman for Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Association. “Although many dairies are without power, most are doing pretty well. We haven’t heard of any instances where haulers haven’t been able to pick up milk.” Dumont said the co-op’s Maola Milk and Ice Cream Co. plant in New Bern, N.C., and its Marva Maid plant in Newport News, Va., sustained minor damage from the hurricane. The Maola plant lost power over the weekend, but had resumed operations on Sunday. “In anticipation of Hurricane Irene, our processing plants loaded up heavy on milk, and are ramping up production to get product to customers,” Dumont says. The Holstein Association (HA) offices in Brattleboro, Vt., also escaped damage. News video showed a torrent of flash flooding down through the central part of that city, but luckily HA offices were not in its path. A number of employees were unable to get into work this morning, but business operations are continuing.

- Broadband Connectivity: LTE everywhere - Saudi Arabia, Poland, Uzbekistan, Portugal
- Strategy & Finance: Verizon buys out cablecos’ 2.5GHz, Sprint pays Clearwire
- Technology & Devices: Nokia’s dual-SIM smartphones, WiMAX exit, NSN re-org
- Chart of the Week: Android: is it fragmentation or is it diversity?
- Net Neutrality: Do bandwidth hogs exist?
[Ed. Last week’s Telco 2.0 ‘Away Team’ are just back from the excellent APAC Brainstorm in Singapore, albeit a bit jet-lagged, and will be bringing you analysis from it soon. In the meantime, the dates for the next Brainstorms are out: Americas, 27-28 March 2012, Marriott Union Square, San Francisco, and EMEA, 12-13 June 2012, Grange St Pauls Hotel, London.]
Saudi Arabia’s STC deploys LTE to 11 cities. Poland’s Polkomtel launches LTE with 22% population coverage. Uzbek LTE. Yota seeks regulatory clearance to launch LTE early, after it gave up on WiMAX. They’ve also signed up a wholesale roaming agreement with MegaFon. Meanwhile, Portugal has auctioned its LTE spectrum - PT, TMN, and Vodafone have unsurprisingly secured chunks. Interestingly, Vodafone has also obtained some additional 900MHz spectrum to refarm.
After a few weeks’ brinksmanship, Sprint and Clearwire have come to their inevitable agreement. Sprint extends its wholesale agreement for WiMAX service until 2013, and undertakes to keep selling devices through 2012 and supporting them up to the end of the maximum 2-year contract. This brings in $926 million for Clearwire, which for its part agrees to deploy LTE. If it hits targets set by Sprint, another $300 million is payable. With this deal signed and sealed, Clearwire now intends to pay the $237 million debt instalment it’s been blowing hot and cold about.
In other WiMAX exit news, NSN has sold its WiMAX business, which it acquired from Motorola originally, to NewNet Communications.
Way back when the Sprint-Clearwire WiMAX rollout began, a big part of the whole scheme was the idea that the cable operators would be an anchor tenant, bringing in large numbers of quad-play customers via MVNO agreements. As a result, the cablecos were surprisingly big spenders on 2.5GHz spectrum. This week, Verizon Wireless bought out the cablecos for some $3.6bn, getting in return a commitment to resell VZW mobile service to their customers.
This means the end of the cable-Clearwire WiMAX adventure, and a new and rather unlikely collaboration between the cablecos and their great rival in rolling out high speed broadband. This Forbes blog post is overexcited, but does contain the good point that only 14% of Verizon’s FiOS service area overlaps with the cable operators.
The cable guys can look back on a great deal - the price agreed gives them a tasty 60% capital gain over the fees they paid back in 2006, and they get to offer VZW’s LTE service as a quad-play. Verizon gets to lock up a major chunk of spectrum, and a potentially major source of subscribers.
AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile quite clearly lose out, especially as the AT&T-T-Mobile deal has been blocked. In the fallout, AT&T accuses the FCC of bias, and tries to salvage the deal as an EverythingEverywhere-style joint venture, but the German Government, the biggest shareholder in DTAG doesn’t believe it.
Speaking of EE, at least the technical aspects of their joint trial with BT of rural LTE in Cornwall seem to work.

However, WMPowerUser reckons that a spurt of new WP7 devices registering on Facebook implies sales are going rather well.
Teresa Cottam’s Voice of Broadband analyses the reorganisation of NSN, meanwhile, and concludes that the infrastructure joint venture has never really been an innovator and the Nokia half of it was too dependent on the handsets.
ReadWriteWeb points out that Apple iPhones make up a huge 10% of mobile subscribers in the US (Samsung is the market leader with 25.5%) and 28.% of smartphones. Android has 46%!
This week’s Chart of the Week, from the 3G & 4G Wireless Blog gives you some idea of the diversity of Android devices. Or do we mean the fragmentation?
Samsung got a win in the patent wars this week, after Apple’s effort to ban their Galaxy devices in the US was thrown out by a court. It also turned out that another smartphone patent of Apple’s was licensed to both Nokia and IBM but pointedly not Samsung.
The first Android 4.0 updates began rolling out to Google employees this week, while the first Android store made its appearance in Sydney. To be strictly accurate, it’s not an Android store as such, but a Telstra outlet made over with Android branding.
Google + Hangouts have grown some voice features.
The big row this week was of course CarrierIQ, the monitoring software that many vendors and carriers impose on smartphones and which keeps vast quantities of user data in a plaintext file that any other application could read or edit. (Telco 2.0 covered this several weeks ago, but it’s now gone viral.) The makers vigorously deny that it’s a problem and blame the carriers. Apple says it’s got rid of it in iOS 5 and future OTA updates. John Graham-Cumming suggests you calm down.

In the cloud, Amazon Web Services claims to have more customers for Cloudfront than any other CDN, but Dan Rayburn fisks the claim and argues that it’s meaningless as CDNing is a business defined by volumes and long-term commits rather than headcounts of subscribers. He reckons that most of the customers are either small, or else one-off quick hit projects, and that Amazon’s revenue from CDN is about $75m. However, with 900 engineering jobs open at AWS, how long will it stay that way?
A major project at Amazon matured this week - standardised symbols for your network diagrams!
Benoit Felten has a must-read post on bandwidth hogs and why they don’t exist. In fact, it’s more like the way people sit in cars and complain about the traffic - the thing about traffic jams is that you are the traffic. In the crucial 95th percentile peaks, it turns out, the heaviest users don’t make up a big percentage of the traffic, precisely because they are a small minority. And, of course, it doesn’t matter what they do while the network is below the 95th percentile utilisation because that’s what governs wholesale pricing.
While 83% of Very Heavy data consumers are amongst the top 1% of bandwidth users during at least one five minute time window at peak hours, they only represent 14.3% of said Top 1% of users at those times.
We have met the enemy, and he is us…meanwhile, Benoit also links to this handsome chart showing how the US telecoms market worked its way from divestment back to oligopoly.

Microsoft is about to disrupt the online video ecosystem by pushing out a new software update to the Xbox, which integrates a wide range of new sources of content into the games console’s TV functionality. Notably, Verizon and Comcast’s IPTV offerings and HBO’s streaming service are all coming aboard. You’ll have to be a subscriber, but it’s an interesting pointer to the future of online video, and another example of how the Xbox is Microsoft’s most interesting product, even including Skype.
AllThingsD reports on a very important aspect of the update - the integration of the Kinect controller, Bing search engine, and Siri-like voice commands into the Xbox and its content partners’ systems. A key theme at the recent Digital Entertainment 2.0 event was the primacy of the clientside user experience in the online video market - this is why people pay for Netflix rather than using cable operators’ VoD services they’ve already paid for.
Dan Rayburn points out that Netflix is very dependent on this advantage and that it’s overcommitted to paying for very expensive content.
Some more HD streaming video may yet creep into the BBC Freeview service. And did you know US TV stations must by law archive all public comment they receive and make it available on request?

We propose high-speed spectral domain polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (SD-PS-OCT) using a single camera and a 1×2 optical switch at the 1.3-μm region. The PS-low coherence interferometer used in the system is constructed using free-space optics. The reflected horizontal and vertical polarization light rays are delivered via an optical switch to a single spectrometer by turns. Therefore, our system costs less to build than those that use dual spectrometers, and the processes of timing and triggering are simpler from the viewpoints of both hardware and software. Our SD-PS-OCT has a sensitivity of 101.5dB, an axial resolution of 8.2μm, and an acquisition speed of 23,496 A-scans per second. We obtain the intensity, phase retardation, and fast axis orientation images of a rat tail tendon ex vivo.
Polarization- 4 A number of medical applications using PS-OCT have been reported, such as dermatology, ophthalmology, and gynecology.5- 7
Recent developments in PS-OCT have focused on frequency domain implementations using either a spectrometer [spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT)] or a frequency-swept laser source [swept-source OCT (SS-OCT)] because of the sensitivity and imaging speed advantages over conventional time-domain OCT 800-nm region.12- 14 Baumann et al. 12 and Cense et al. 13 demonstrated that two orthogonal states of light could be detected, side by side, using a single camera with 2048pixels, et al. 1.3-μm region using a single line-scan InGaAs camera with 1024pixels 1310nm (DenseLight Semiconductors Incorporated, Singapore) with a full-width-half-maximum (Δλ) of 170nm, which corresponds to a theoretical axial resolution of 4.4μm in air, and a power of 25mW, 22.5deg with respect to the horizontal axis, so that after double pass, the reflected light from the stationary mirror is in a 45deg linear polarized state. In the sample arm, after passing through the QWP2 oriented at 45deg to the horizontal plane, the light is circularly polarized when incident on the sample. The circularly polarized light reflected from the 2-D galvanometer passes through the telescope constructed with two convex lenses and an objective lens (NA=0.26, Mitutoyo, Japan) with a long working distance of 30.5mm, as shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 1. This telescope is used to maintain a flat image plane while scanning. The lateral resolution of our system is approximately 14μm. Recombined light from the reference and sample arms is split into two orthogonally polarized states by PBS2. The horizontal and vertical polarization light rays are then delivered to the 2×1 (<1MHz). The spectrometer is composed of a transmission diffraction grating (1145lines∕mm, Wasatch Photonics, Logan, Utah), achromatic doublet lens (f=70mm, Thorlabs Incorporated, Newton, New Jersey), and InGaAs line-scan camera (Goodrich Corporation). The camera has 1024pixels, a resolution of 14bits, and a maximum line rate of 46.992klines∕s.
(a) Schematic of our PS-OCT system using a single spectrometer and a 1×2 46.992kHz (red) is required for line trigger of the camera, and 2. a TTL signal of 23.496kHz (blue) is needed to drive the optical switch. When the channel for the optical switch generates 5V, the vertically polarized light is transmitted to the spectrometer. On the other hand, when the channel for the optical switch generates 0V, (k). Figure 2 shows the raw spectra of the vertically polarized light (black) and the horizontally polarized light (red) after resampling into the
The vertical (black) and horizontal (red) plane spectra after being resampled into the (λfull) detected by the spectrometer should be defined by λfull⩾π⋅Δλ∕(2⋅In2).15 Using our SLD, λfull has to be as broad as 385nm to achieve the theoretical axial resolution. However, a broader λfull results in a low depth range, because a 1024-pixel camera is a state of the art product. Instead, we chose a λfull value of 214nm, because a depth range of at least 2.0mm is needed in most biological tissues. The axial resolution was measured to be 8.2μm in air. The interval value between image pixels in the axial direction was 3.9μm. 101.5dB for an optical path difference of close to zero when the exposure time was 16.96μs. We could observe a decrease of approximately 10dB within a depth range of 1.5mm because of the depth-dependent sensitivity roll-off.10
To test the accuracy of the SD-PS-OCT system, we inserted a QWP into the sample arm between the objective lens and the sample mirror. When we rotated the QWP in steps of 10deg, from 0to180deg, we were able to measure the retardation with a constant value of 86.65±1.04deg, 5μm in the lateral direction. We reconstructed 3-D volume images (1 and 2) from the intensity and phase retardation datasets using Amira 4.1 (Mercury Computer Systems, Chelmsford, MA).

In conclusion, we have developed a new PS-OCT system based on the spectral domain method at the 1.3-μm (23.496klines∕s) of the line-scan camera. The axial resolution, depth range, and sensitivity of our system are 8.2μm, 2.0mm, and 101.5dB, respectively. To demonstrate the system’s performance in biological tissue, we obtained the intensity, phase retardation, and fast axis orientation images of a rat tail tendon..

The Panthers lost their first game of the day to Western New England College, 4-1.
MacFarland scattered eight hits and two walks en route to the victory, her third of the season against no losses. She was helped by strong defense, including a pair of Panther double plays.
The Panthers scored one run in the first inning and added an insurance marker in the fourth. Junior Shauna Isham (Auburn, NH/Manchester Memorial) and freshman Jenna George (Cumberland, R.I.) did the damage for PSU at the plate, collecting two hits apiece.
Senior Steph Ganser (Fairfield, Conn.) smacked a three-run home run for WNEC to break open what was a 1-1 contest in the bottom of the fifth inning of the first game. Freshman Kat Roland (Norton, Mass./Fontbonne Academy) pitched well for PSU into the fifth before getting tagged for the loss. George went 3-for-3 at the plate and freshman Kay LaBrie (Somersworth, N.H.) added a pair of hits.
PSU, 3-4 on the Florida trip, has Wednesday off before resuming action with a pair of games Thursday, meeting Trinity College at 9:00 a.m. and Thomas College at 1:00 p.m.

It is a riches-to-riches story that proves you can overcome all kinds of obstacles – lack of talent, wilful ignorance, casual bigotry – and still win the game of late capitalism so resoundingly that adorable little people from emerging markets want to buy your handbags. I find it helps to think of Paris as the anti-Willy Loman, so we'll call the following tale Birth of A Saleswoman.
We'll begin by addressing the "oh, is she still going?" argument. It's a fair point. There is every chance you would assume Paris was now hopelessly passe, having been eclipsed by second-generation reality succubi such as the Kardashians. Though she was never exactly going to end up broke, you might have assumed Paris's career was in foreclosure, and that she was holed up in a mansion on Sunset Boulevard spitting that it was the sex tapes that got small.
But the encouraging news is that we will always have Paris, much in the same way the herpes virus sticks around in perpetuity. In fact, if anything, the strain has mutated into something altogether less containable. For although you can still view the latest iteration of madam's fly-on-the-wall show on America's appropriately named Oxygen channel, it is clear that Paris has long since outgrown the role of mere unscripted programming personality. As she puts it: "I'm an author, a recording artist, an actress …" She left out humanitarian, but you get the point.
And so to the list of Hilton products, which at its current rate of growth will soon make the list of America's most apocalypse-goading exports, shortly behind toxic debt and dysfunctional wars. There are the aforementioned fragrances and shoes and handbags, of course, and any number of will-this-do clothing lines. According to Hilton's manager, he turns down anywhere between 12 and 20 pitches for brand endorsements per day. Products that have recently failed to secure the Hilton imprimatur include canned beans.
Want more? Well, the first of a planned chain of Paris Hilton beach clubs is about to open in the Philippines. There are dedicated Paris Hilton stores in more than 30 countries, and milady has a MotoGP racing team that operates out of Barcelona. Across Europe, Paris Hilton eyelashes and nails are already being rolled out, with the expectation that they'll be going east shortly, while a few months ago Paris inked a deal with an optical firm to launch a range of coloured contact lenses for the Asian market. Oh, and there'll be several sunglasses ranges, including one sold exclusively to China.
The latter is particularly impressive, given that the US trade deficit with China currently stands at $28.1bn, and must be seen as a heroic attempt by the celebutante to singlehandedly address the shortfall. Unfortunately, I don't have my pink Swarovski-encrusted Paris Hilton™ Abacus to hand, so I haven't worked out precisely how many Chinese teens will have to purchase oversized white plastic shades before America is great once more. But I do know that if anyone can pull off this totes amaze feat of payment-balancing, it's Paris.
In fact, do let's hope that we're witnessing nothing less than the Hiltonisation of the world, and that Paris's great-grandfather Conrad Hilton was merely the John the Baptist figure to the real mogul messiah. After all, Conrad's dream of siting one of his hotels in every capital city and beyond may have been ambitious by mid- 20th-century standards, but it was merely the precursor to his great-granddaughter's altogether more chilling programme of expansion. It is fast becoming clear that Paris means nothing less than to establish clone armies of her personage everywhere from Mexico City to Manila, tossing their ratty hair extensions and muttering "that's hot!" even as their political leaders make ever more futile denunciations of The Great Satan.
It's a sort of remotely effected colonialism. Indeed, a rudimentary cost-benefit analysis suggests that Paris Hilton Enterprises is a far more effective way of spreading US ideals than the military formats that have produced such indifferent results in recent years. Following the mixed reviews of their work in Afghanistan and Iraq, it seems entirely reasonable to imagine that Washington's geopolitical strategists have recently effected a major change in strategy, and are now using Paris Hilton as an ideological weapon whose reach is far more effective than a massive troop deployment and the serial ingratitude of the occupied nations.
Whether this means that Paris is technically a puppet mogul is a debate for another day. You would, however, be insane not to take investment advice from Lost in Showbiz, which hereby forecasts that Paris Hilton will soon be regarded as a safer bet than US government bonds.

- Suggested Walkthrough
Activity Overview:
While this is a fundraiser, it is also a social event (a fun-raiser!), one that should include a lot of non-members. This is an ideal way to introduce interested outsiders to your group, as well as to increase your profile on campus.
The way you plan this event will depend largely on whether you make the food yourself, or whether you purchase it. While we suggest the latter, both are perfectly doable. Whichever path you take, the number of people you host will depend on the amount of food available; ideally, you should have between twenty-five to one hundred paying attendees.
Planning timeframe:
Actually making or buying the food can be done a few days before the event - it can be helpful if you cook the food beforehand, and warm it before serving. However, in order to reserve space, advertise, and be sure what you're doing is legal, you'll want to start planning eight to twelve weeks in advance.
Coordinating:
The main tasks for planning the event are securing the venue, working with the university on health requirements, advertising, cooking, and taking in money; this will probably require three to six coordinators, and more for really large events. You will need volunteers to advertise and make and serve food, which will probably require four to sevem volunteers - coordinators who have concentrated on pre-event planning should double as event volunteers, of course.
Set a goal for how much money you'd like to make for your group or for a charity. Consider how much tickets will have to cost for you to make that much after the cost of the food and party favors.
Material requirements:
A critical limiting factor on this event is finding a venue, one with both kitchen access AND tables to eat at. Dorm cafeterias might work, but they might also not let students "behind the counter." Churches often have setups like this, and sometimes Moose Lodges or Rotary Clubs might as well.
Check the Student Union for space you can rent out. Look around your community and find an appropriate venue - this is a little trickier than bringing someone's microwave to a meeting room.
As mentioned, you can either make or buy food. A rule of thumb is to assume two to three people per lb. of dry spaghetti, and three to four people per lb. of sauce. You may want to substitute or supplement this with sauces prepared by your members. This can yield greater variety, and allows you to have a sauce competition! (This can be a great draw for off-campus people). However, unless many members can contribute a lot of homemade sauce, you'll want to buy some. Make sure that you don't just have meat sauce!
Besides food, you'll need tables on which to serve the food, and a cashbox to collect money. Paper plates are too weak to (reliably) hold spaghetti. Look for durable disposable plates (Chinet, for instance), and plastic forks. If there is space to wash dishes, use regular dishes to cut down on waste. If you're serving drinks, get cups as well. If the venue doesn't have them already, make sure that there are tables and chairs for people to eat at.
Some venues and most catering companies will provide all of the serving equipment necessary.
Consider having other fun materials, like eye patches and "Pin the Noodle on the FSM" as pictured below. Any kind of FSM related decor will help set the mood.
Cooperating Organizations: You can run this as a fundraiser for your group alone, or to support a charity (such as a vaccination drive).
Promotion:
Promoting your event is the key to making it successful. In-group promotion will involve announcing it at meetings, in your group emails, and on your social media. For promotion to the general campus, you'll want to do flyers, chalking, put the event details on online event calendars, do awareness tabling, and send out a press release. For additional promotion ideas, see the Group Promotion and Media Relations guide.
- Determine within your group who will coordinate the event, solicit volunteers, and select a beneficiary of the fundraiser (your group or a charitable organization). Find a place on campus where you can reheat and serve food; if the dinner is connected to another event (e.g. soul auction), make sure the venue can accommodate everything.
- Before going ahead, designate someone to check with the university that this dinner is in accordance with university and local guidelines, especially health codes. If they have any concerns, you should address them first - they will not hesitate to shut you down!
- Eating usually requires cleanup afterwards, so discuss charges for custodial services with the university.
- In some states, there is a "church potluck" exemption which covers these types of events. Ironic as it may be, this may get you out of stringent health requirements.
- Assuming all issues are worked out with the university, determine where and how you will get food (see above). Although prices can change, having a rough idea of the costs gives you a place to start. Look for discounts, and negotiate when possible.
- Promoting the event is crucial, since the number of people who come will make the difference between making and losing money. In particular, you'll want to send a press release (more info here) to campus and local media well ahead of time. The Group Promotion Guide will help you with advertising ideas.
- A ton of FSM art and media is available at the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster here, including a wide variety of pareidolia vaguely resembling Him.
- Depending on whether you make your own food, or get it elsewhere:
- A day or two before your event, make the food. Coordinate transportation from kitchens to the venue - nobody should have to walk across campus with a big pot of sauce.
- If you don't want to make the food yourself, you should place your order at least one or two weeks in advance. Local Italian eateries are an option; also talk to your school's food service department, which may be able to help cater.
- Before the event, set up your tables and eating accoutrements. If you're setting up chairs/tables for people to sit at, do so now.
- Since the Flying Spaghetti Monster's chosen outfit is full pirate regalia, feel free to decorate the venue with a pirate theme. A wide range of materials is available at the Church of the FSM's website. Volunteers can also wear pirate clothing, although this may be problematic for people serving food.
- Make sure that there are trash cans and recycling bins available!
- At the event, you'll want one person heating the food, one person bringing food to the tables, two or three people serving, and one or two people overlooking - they are there to make sure things are running smoothly, and able to jump in if someone needs a break. These numbers, particularly the servers, are adjustable, especially depending on the size of the crowd and the variety of pasta and sauce being served. You'll also need one trustworthy person at the cashbox.
- Minnesota Atheists charges $6.66 for their FSM dinners - which, besides fitting in with the theme, encourages many people to pay $10 and donate the change.
- August Berkshire of Minnesota Atheists writes, "We precook the spaghetti the day before, then reheat it briefly at the event in pots of boiling water. You can use the same water to reheat multiple batches of spaghetti. Otherwise in would take too long to keep bringing new pots of water to a boil for each batch of spaghetti. Of course, from time to time you will want to use fresh water, but not every time."
- After the event is over, clean up and pack up your stuff. Even if you're being charged for custodial services, you should clean up!
- Extra food can be given to group members, if they want it. You may be able to donate it to a local food bank - check beforehand to see if and how this can be done.
- Make sure all outstanding bills have been paid. You should now have money for other activities!
- Be sure to thank all of your coordinators, volunteers, and your dinner attendees!!The album includes ten of Thalía's greatest hits in banda style, plus two new banda tracks "La Revancha" and "Cuco Peña" and two bonus remixes of "Piel Morena" and "Amor a la Mexicana."

"Soon Sweetie." She laid her head on his lap, her bouncy dark curls flowing smoothly on his legs. She closed her bright blue eyes and drifted to a soundless sleep. Seeley looked at the little girl he had taken in after his brother and sister in law had passed away. Jared and Marie had been in a bus crash a year earlier and they had left Eva to Seeley. He had cared for her to the best of his ability and loved her more than he thought possible.
"G64 at window 18." That was his number. He picked Eva up and walked to the window. He handed the lady the filled out papers to renew his driver's license. She calculated the price and after he paid he went to stand in the photo line. When his turn to take the picture was almost up he wasn't quite sure what to do. He had forgotten that you can't take a picture holding a six year old child. He looked around looking for a place to maybe set her but he saw nothing. Just the cold metal chairs they had sat on. But, there was a woman standing behind them. He hadn't realized her but now that he had he noticed her true beauty. Her hair was the most beautiful shade of brown and it really brought out the warm blue color of her eyes.
"Hello, I'm Seeley Booth." She smiled. That was a good sign.
"I'm Temperance. Temperance Brennan." Seeley couldn't contain his smile. This was the most beautiful girl he'd talked to in a long time. Well, besides Eva. When the beautiful woman, Temperance, noticed Seeley's distress when the woman called to get his picture taken, "Do you want me to hold your daughter?" She asked plainly. Seeley didn't even respond before she began to take her. He was in a rush so he didn't even bother to explain. He took the picture and took Eva. He wanted to thank the woman so he waited.
"Thank you." He said shaking her hand.
"Your welcome. Your daughter is so adorable." She mused. Seeley blushed.
"Actually she isn't my daughter. She's my brother's. He died a little over a year ago." He had gotten used to telling people the story because he got tired of people asking a lot of question.
"Oh I'm so sorry! I have a brother too and I don't think I'd be able to handle losing him." This wasn't the direction he wanted this conversation to lead.
"Yeah, it was pretty hard. Well, enough about that. What do you say to lunch tomorrow?" He hadn't known what she would say. It was a little sudden but he felt the need to see this woman again but he wasn't sure why. She looked deep in thought for a few seconds then gave an answer.
"Yeah, I don't have anything planned." He couldn't contain his joy and it was evident on his face.
"Alright. Well do you want to give me your number so I can call you?" She nodded and handed her a paper with her number on it, "Well I'll be sure to call you tonight and give you the plans."
"Alright." They walked out together and he walked her to her car where they stood talking."
"Well it's getting late. I should probably get her home." They said their goodbyes and Seeley was off to get home. He placed Eva in her pink floral pattern bed and went to bed himself, thinking of Temperance until he drifted away.
Temperance
I couldn't believe what had just happened to me. He was so handsome and he wanted to go out with me. Maybe he was just a player, no he didn't seem the type. I almost called my mom but decided she was probably already asleep and I was going to call Angela but decided I didn't want everyone knowing so I simply went to bed. It was only nine but I just wanted lunch to come. When I finally crawled into bed I couldn't sleep. I didn't know what it was about this guy but I just couldn't get him out of my head. It was like he had taken full residence right there in my head. I turned on my bedside lamp, right on my nightstand was a picture of my family when a year after I graduated college. My Parents were holding each others waists and Russ and I were standing on each side of them. Me by Mom and him by Dad. As I looked at my family I drifted slowly into sleep with my light still on.
Seeley
"Hey, Uncle Seeley...Wake up! I've got to go to school." Eva was on the end of my bed in her pink pajamas.
"Alright, Alright. I'm getting up. Go get in the bath." With that she ran to the bathroom and turned the water on. As she bathed I cooked breakfast and set her clothes out for her to get ready. I brushed her hair into long straight layers that I knew would bounce up as it started to dry. We sat at the table to eat and said blessing.
"Uncle Seeley?"
"Yeah?"
"Can I call you Daddy?" I wasn't really sure what to say. I thought this day might come. This usually happened in cases like ours.
"Well."
"Please. I don't have a daddy and all the kids at school have daddys cept me. You're like a daddy. You feed me, love me, and bring me places so why can't you be my daddy?"
"You have a daddy but he's in heaven with your mommy. You will see them again but I can be your daddy here." She smiled one of the biggest ones I've seen since the accident.
"Thank you. Daddy here." She came over and sat on my lap and squeezed my sides.Has Demand for Crime Increased? the Prevalence of Personal Media Devices and the Robbery Spike in 2005 and 2006
Chalfin, Aaron
Personal Media Players--Cases
Article excerpt
ABSTRACT
Seminal work by Becker (1968), Erlich (1973, 1981), Vandaele (1978), Cook (1986) Cameron (1988), Van Dijk (1994) and Garoupa (1997) posits that the supply of criminal offending is a function of four factors: (1) the probability (risk) of capture, (2) the severity of the sanction if captured, (3) the expected profit from a criminal transaction and (4) the opportunity cost of a criminal transaction. In this rational offender framework, a potential offender commits crimes when the expected benefits of offending outweigh the expected costs. Changes in any one of these variables will affect the crime rate. Public policies designed to reduce externalities associated with criminal offending typically seek to increase the probability an offender is captured and the severity of the sanction. Thus, relatively little scholarly attention has focused on the effects of changes in the opportunity cost and profit for potential offenders. We posit that increases in crime--particularly robbery--in the United States in 2005 and 2006 were caused by an exogenous shock to the crime market that increased the expected profit of a criminal transaction, concurrently decreasing the degree to which potential victims engage in private precautions. We present evidence that increases in violent offending in the United States in 2005 and 2006 are consistent with a secular change in the behavior of potential victims, specifically in the increased propensity of potential victims to carry valuable iPods and other personal media devices. In such cases, standard policy instruments used to effect a reduction in crime may be insufficient or less than optimally efficient.
INTRODUCTION
Neoclassical economic theory posits that there is a market for crime that behaves much like any other market. (1) Crime markets experience periods of substantial growth, such as was the case in the US in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and periods of substantial decline, as was experienced between 1992 and 2004. The primary mechanisms used by society to regulate this market are the police and prisons, which are expected to deter and incapacitate potential criminals. An increase in the number of police is expected to increase the expected probability an offender will be arrested for a crime, and an increase in prison populations increases the expected severity of the sanction. (2) Most policy discussions about interventions into the crime market focus on these two policy mechanisms. As a result, when crime rates change, speculation about the cause first turns to deterrence and incapacitation mechanisms. (3) To those unsatisfied by deterrence and incapacitation explanations, exogenous shocks to the crime market--specifically shocks that affect the supply of crime such as changes in economic conditions, demographics and cultural norms--are generally the only alternative explanation. (4) Often overlooked is the degree to which changes in the expected profits of a criminal transaction and changes in private precautions can affect on crime rates.
Since private precautions are known to be produced sub-optimally in the presence of a quasi-public good such as police, private precautions are considered to be a relatively inefficient means of addressing crime. (5) However, while changes in private precautions devoted to crime protection may be a relatively inefficient means of altering the amount of crime in the long-run, in the short-run large-scale changes in private precaution brought on by an exogenous shock may nevertheless be expected to have a meaningful effect. Likewise, abrupt changes in consumer behavior, such as a secular increase in the value of items individual's carry in public increases the expected profit of a criminal transaction. This signals suppliers of crime to rapidly increase their crime production.
In 2005 and 2006, tens of millions of personal media devices, particularly iPods, (6) were sold to US consumers. These expensive devices were displayed openly in public reducing search costs for potential offenders. …Penn State collects 83-71 win over Penn

I wouldn't have dyed it green.'You can almost smell the tang of the fir and spruce trees in the air of Prince Edward Island as you read Anne of Green Gables. I do like novels which give a strong sense of place and time. There were lots of regional expressions in this book which interested me. I didn't know that a Christmas where it doesn't snow is known as a 'green Christmas' or that there is a dress fabric called 'glory' and I loved the fact that at Anne's school they kept their milk cold by standing it in a stream all morning!
The juxtaposition of Anne's imaginative flights of fancy and Marilla's dour put-downs make this a delightful read. Some of Anne's escapades, such as putting liniment instead of vanilla into a sponge cake and accepting a dare from arch-rival Josie Pye to walk across the gable roof reminded me of Little Women and What Katy Did. I'd love to find a copy of The Blue Castle an adult novel by Montgomery which is now out of print.

What a fantastic cover illustration! I didn't know Lucy Maud Montgomery wrote an adult novel. Must keep an eye out for that. In the meantime, feeling very inspired to re-read Anne! K x
I re-read all the Anne books every now and then. It's the place and the people that make the books for me as Anne gets less appealing as she grows older.
I do have a copy of The Blue Castle. Many people rate it their favourite L M Montgomery but I'm not one of them. There are paperbacks on Amazon.
What a horrible cover that is! All girls' book covers seem to have to be either Clarice Bean-like or a pukey pink these days.
It's a great book, though, and Anne's one of my favourite fictional characters.
I love these editions of these classic children's books. You know, I have a copy of The Blue Castle - which I haven't read. If you were closer I'd lend it to you!
Oh! Please don't put down your book like that: use a book mark. Modern books are not made very well and the pages soon come loose if you are not careful.
Sorry! Don't mean to be critical.
Kristina, I love the cover, too although I can see Liz's point that Lauren Child is getting a little too prolific.
callmemadam, I thought Anne was slightly manipulative actually. I wondered if the potrayal of her mood swings were possibly autobiographical as Montgomery suffered from depression I believe. I was very fond of Rachel Lynde and Ruby Gillis!
Tara, I've managed to order a copy of The Blue Castle. I'd like to know your thoughts if you read it.
Jennifer, point taken. I will not abuse any more books!!

The Blue Castle is one of my favourite LMM adult books, I read it every year straight through and love it every time.
May I also recommend jane of Lantern Hill? This is not an adult book as such but a non Anne/Emily book and tells the story of a child caught between her separted parents. Beautifully done.
Elaine, thanks for the recommendation, I'll look out for Jane of Lantern Hill. I've wondered why Persephone don't publish The Blue Castle it sounds the ideal book them.Miners' strike could double copper prices

Corona calculates a transform matrix for a display object by applying the properties in a specific order.
Transforms are always relative to the parent, so the final transform includes the transforms of the object's parents (and ancestors). See Transforms in the Groups Guide.
The origin is the position of a display object. It is controlled by the object.x and object.y properties. This is the point about which rotation and scale are applied.
The anchors of an object control how geometry is positioned relative to the object's origin. These are specified via the object.anchorX and object.anchorY properties.
Anchors range from
0.0 to
1.0. When you change an anchor value, the object's origin does not change. Instead the geometry moves relative to the origin.
By default, the anchor is set to
(0.5, 0.5) which centers the geometry about the origin. An anchor pair of
(0,0) makes the top-left of the geometry's bounds the origin, while an anchor pair of
(1,1) makes it the bottom-right of the geometry's bounds.
You can change the default via display.setDefault().
The following diagram illustrates how changing the anchor affects objects. The dotted square is rotated to illustrate how geometry is rotated about the origin depending on the anchor.
By default, objects like shapes have anchors. Groups however do not honor anchors by default. You must set the
anchorChildren property. See Aligning Children in the Groups Guide.THE HUNGRY sea has been gnawing away again at Pagham beach and trying to fight its way over the seawalls into farmland at Fishbourne in Chichester Harbour.
One of the highest tides of the year during the new moon in mid January was within a foot of the top of a new seawall there. The whole of that bank has been strengthened by infill and grading, with the concrete facing repaired continually by the wildfowlers who have the shooting on the seaward side.
On that particular weekend I was doing a waterfowl count for WEBS, Wetland Bird Counts, that is. Now, there is a public footpath through the reed beds with a couple of handrail bridges over the fresh inflows so that you can walk from Fishbourne to Bosham as a pleasant wander by the sea and through the fields.
The tide was high at about noon so I thought I would have plenty of time if I got to the footbridges an hour before. Normally you are just about alright 40 minutes before unless there is a sou’west gale that pushes the tide up in the Solent and holds it there for an hour.
Imagine my annoyance to find the path between the bridges flooded to a depth of three feet an hour and twenty minutes before the top.
Even more annoying was to find that one Wellington had sprung a leak, the rubber perishing and splitting on the heel.
So I just about got to the first bridge, emptied the boot, stood wondering what to do, and was quickly marooned.
It takes almost two hours for the water to fall back. Well, thought I, if I am to be standing here for nearly two hours with the reeds sighing all around the water swirling as grey as the clouds lowering with snow from the north, I shall spend that time usefully listening out for any indication of a water rail.
The small sky denizens of the reed beds only give themselves away by their occasional squeaks, grunts, groans, and pig-like screams. In nearly two hours I had but one brief contact, a pig-like grunt.
When I eventually got home I read that WEBS counters elsewhere are experimenting with a taped play-back of the water rails’ voice to make counting easier.
At one nature reserve, visuals had given at most four birds on the marsh. By playing the tape for 60 seconds, waiting a further minute for interested birds to focus, and then giving another 30 second recorded voice, it was found that the reed bed in fact held 20 birds, a result which amazed the seasoned birders. It seems this rare rail which is never seen is in fact much less rare than we thought.
What fun I could have had. Even my frozen foot would have been forgotten on that freezing January afternoon in the reed beds.

University of Pittsburgh researchers conducted four focus groups with 36 women whose ages ranged from 18 to 45. Of the 21 women taking medication for chronic conditions, some reported that their care providers directly addressed the concern that the medication could cause birth defects. However, many said their providers skirted the issue by advising them to use a backup method of birth control or by not addressing the risk at all.Study participants all said they wanted to receive information from their care providers on the risk their medications posed to an unborn child, regardless of whether they intended to become pregnant. However, many said they often learned of the risk by reading material their pharmacies provided, researching the medication on the Internet, or discussing the medication with friends and family members.The authors suggest that because women want their care providers to be a primary source of medical information, care providers need to provide counseling whenever they prescribe a medication that could cause birth defects. Clinicians who want to discuss these risks with patients may find the hotline operated by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists or Web-based resources, such as ReproTox or Toxnet, useful sources of up-to-date information. This study was funded in part by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (HS17093).See "Women's perspectives on counseling about risks for medication-induced birth defects," by Aimee K.

December 12th, 2012
in econ_news, syndication
Econintersect: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) pays out to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled with the moneys coming out of the USA general funds (and not the Social Security Trust Fund). Total SSI Payments have generally grew at the same rate as GDP since 1990, but is now projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to begin growing slower than GDP.
Follow up:
A summary Statement from the CBO:
In fiscal year 2013, more than 8 million people will receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments at a federal cost of about $53 billion, CBO estimates.
Today’s CBO report, Supplemental Security Income: An Overview, discusses how the program works, who receives SSI payments, the program’s spending and its interaction with other government programs, the extent to which SSI affects people’s work and saving, and possible approaches to changing the program.
- The federal government established the SSI program in 1974 to provide cash assistance to people who are disabled, aged, or both and who have low income and few assets.
- Currently, about 60 percent of SSI recipients are disabled adults (ages 18 to 64), about 15 percent are disabled children (under age 18), and about 25 percent are aged adults (age 65 or over) with or without disabilities. Over the past two decades, participation among disabled adults has increased substantially, partly because of the relaxing of eligibility rules. In contrast, the share of the aged who participate in SSI has declined steadily, in part because average Social Security benefits have increased, leaving fewer aged people poor enough to qualify for SSI.
- CBO projects that the number of SSI beneficiaries will decline slightly as a share of the population as the economy improves and as average Social Security benefits continue to increase. In addition, SSI payments per beneficiary are linked to prices, which tend to rise more slowly than gross domestic product per person. Therefore, CBO projects that SSI outlays will decline as a share of gross domestic product by about one-fifth during the coming decade.
- Most SSI recipients probably could not earn or save significant amounts. SSI recipients who are disabled adults have been judged, through the disability determination process, to be unable to perform substantial work; and SSI payment amounts and asset limits are low.
- Some potential changes would expand the program and others would shrink it. Those proposals would adjust the parameters of the program, such as payment amounts or income or asset thresholds; change certain eligibility criteria; establish more frequent reviews of recipients’ continuing eligibility; and change the program more fundamentally, for example by transferring control of the program to the states.

I made a mention about how Smith and Wesson was making an AR in 5.45 caliber, and he didn't even know what I was talking about. There are plenty of mostly AK's out there on the market chambered for the 5.45mm, so it is pretty well known. There was a time this wasn't so.
Back in the late 1970's there was a rumor here and there about the Soviets doing an upgrade to their AK weapon's system. Then the ill-fated Soviet invasion of Afghanistan took place and the rumors were everywhere. Reports came back from Afghani doctors about dreadful wounds on patients who were lucky enough (or maybe unlucky enough) to be brought in for treatment of gunshop wounds. Gunshot wounds in the tribal areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan are common enough that the doctors generally knew what to expect. These were different, however. Shattered joints, extreme trauma, all were signs of high velocity at work.
Rumors became an uproar that the Soviet forces were using a different and as yet unseen weapon. Ultra high velocity, hollow-point bullets, explosive bullets, flechettes, even poison bullets. 4000fps velocities, a breakthrough in powder technology. All these were speculated about, but nobody really knew. Not even the CIA, supposedly.
Galen Geer who was a writer for Soldier of Fortune Magazine decided to take a trip into the charming Afghan hill-country to find out just what was what. An arms dealer had agreed to bankroll his payment for a sample rifle, if indeed there was any such thing. So Geer started out in the snake-pit of Peshawar and asked around about any news. There was a rumor there of a 22 sized cartride of enormous power. The Soviets had used for years a 22 cartridge similar in size to a necked down 7.62X39 in competition. Lapua sold brass for what was called the 220 Russian. The cartridge was little known here, and still is little known, except as the base cartridge for Pindell and Palmisano's wildcat benchrest cartridges. The 22PPC and 6mmPPC. Could the mystery cartridge be the plain-old 220 Russian?
Geer took photos of a captured rifle and brought some cartridges back out of Afghanistan. In the meantime, the arms dealer backed down on his plan to pay for a rifle. Things broke down and Geer came back to the USA via South Korea. He was thoroughly shaken down at the Customs booth, and all his cartridges were confiscated. The photos mysteriously disappeared, but Geer managed to do an end run around the authorities and slipped some cartridges in by another route. Later, Robert Brown from SOF managed to handle one of the new rifles and brought back more ammo.
The NRA was supplied with ammo in a quantity sufficient for testing. The NRA approached JGS Tool in Coos Bay, Oregon to make reamers for the cartridge. RCBS made reloading dies to specs that the NRA had someone draw up, and Boots Obermeyer made two cut-rifled test barrels. One was for a Universal receiver, the other for a 788 Remington. Due to a Soviet oversight, the velocity of the new ammo had already been calculated.
A Soviet publication had come to light which listed the amount which a moving target would have to be led with both 7.62 and the new round. A little mathematics did the rest. Muzzle velocity should be about 2950fps.
I won't bore you with the specs for the Russian 5.45X40 round. It is easily looked up if you are interested online or in Cartridges of the World. Except for the bore size, the cartridge looks a lot like a necked down 7.52X39 (which it really isn't), and performs about like a 222 Rem.
The idea that the Russians were going to convert all the old 30 caliber AK's to the new round proved to be false. They built all new rifles from the ground up, evidently. Most of their satellite allies picked up the round before the fall of the USSR and all of the others.
Now instead of going on some hajj to the middle east to find a single cartridge, you can buy Polish ammo by the case. Far as that goes, you can buy the rifle that shoots it too. Strange how things work out.

BEMIDJI – Local elementary schools are the first in the state to be deemed Gold Award recipients through a national program aiming to foster healthier school environments through the promotion of nutrition and physical activity.
BEMIDJI – Local elementary schools are the first in the state to be deemed Gold Award recipients through a national program aiming to foster healthier school environments through the promotion of nutrition and physical activity.
Six elementary schools – Central, Horace May, J.W. Smith, Lincoln, Northern and Solway – were honored Monday night as they received the Gold Award of Distinction through the HealthierUS School Challenge.
“This is the highest honor you can achieve in this national program,” said Kara Mitterholzer, team nutrition coordinator through the Minnesota Department of Education.
Mitterholzer awarded plaques to each of the award-winning elementary schools, including Paul Bunyan Elementary, which obtained the Silver Award, during the Bemidji school board meeting. Each Gold recipient also received $2,000.
She also praised Marlene Webb, the district’s food service coordinator, for her work.
“There have been many times that myself and others in our section have called upon Marlene Webb to basically work with other districts in helping them come to the level that you guys are at,” Mitterholzer said.
Superintendent Jim Hess said he often asks Webb to bake a cake for special recognition ceremonies.
“I probably should have been baking the cake for you,” he quipped. “This is pretty special.”
With the food-service staff from each school represented in the audience, Webb commended their work.
“They come each and every day ready to prepare the best food with a lot of energy and a whole lot of humor,” she said. “They have a passion to be there.”
School board chairman John Pugleasa agreed, saying food-service staff does a great job of building relationships while also providing nutritious foods to students.
“I appreciate that as a parent, and I hope our community appreciates what is done as well,” he said. “You guys are awesome.”Scosche makes several Charge and Sync Cables and Adaptors for iPod, iPhone, iPad, Android devices, Smartphones, Tablets, GPS devices, Digital Cameras and more.

Take a seat on the balcony and sip an ‘aperitivo’ before dinner watching the sun set on the Grigne mountains. There are 3 restaurants/ pizzerias within easy walking distance. Self-catering is no problem as the kitchen is perfectly equipped and there is a well-stocked grocery a few steps away. Enjoy breakfast Italian style with tempting pastries and brioches from the bakery on the piazza and an espresso from your own coffee machine - or maybe pop over to the local café for a cappuccino.
A car gives you access to restaurants in the mountains behind Bellagio where cuisine is very authentic and the prices lower. There are many walking trails in the hills and countryside away from the lake. Milan can be reached by train from Varenna or Lecco for a day of culture and shopping.
Lecco and Como are both worth visiting for slightly larger towns. Lenno has a weekly market and is accessible by ferry as are all the villages around the lake.
Magnificent gardens are available in Bellagio (Villa Melzi) and nearby Tremezzo (Villa Carlotta). Villa Balbianello at Lenno has been used in recent movies (Star Wars and Casino Royale). There is a wide range of guide books and local information provided in the apartment.

Guest Access
You have full and private use of the apartment.
The village car park is free and just a few steps away.
Interaction with Guests
Full directions are provided for driving. I help you work out how to best arrive by public transport and can arrange taxi service from the local ferry if needed. Once your booking is in place there is no need to worry about the details or logistics. I will happily help you work out the details.
The Neighborhood
It would be hard not to fall in love with Bellagio. It is easy to see why the town is known as the 'pearl of Lake Como'. It has a charm and an atmosphere all of its own: from its cobbled streets with beautiful shops to its gardens and breathtaking vistas. Photographer's paradise, writer's retreat, traveller's oasis...Bellagio will seduce you!
Getting Around
Slow boats, fast hydrofoils and car ferries all operate regularly on the lake taking you to any of the other towns or villages around the lake. The rail service goes to Como town, Lecco or Varenna from where you can take either a boat or bus. There is a local bus service between Visgnola (where the apartment is) and Bellagio. I can arrange taxis for you as well. Once you are here I recommend walking to explore all the little streets that are a part of Bellagio's charm.
Other Things to Note
If at first you are hesitant that the apartment is not in Bellagio itself let me assure you that my guests love the authentic village location. This way you get the best of both worlds : world famous Bellagio and the almost rustic charm of Visgnola. You're bound to meet some of the friendly villagers too - join them for coffee or an aperitivo at the local bar.
My aim is that you should find this a 'home away from home' therefore I only ask that you treat it with the respect you would your own home. Smoking is permitted on the balcony but not inside the apartment. Please note that check out time is actually 10.30 and check in time is 2.30 pm. I couldn't put these times into the system here. I stay as flexible as possible as long as I have no guests arriving as you leave.

we didn't see Sally during our stay, but She is an organized person, everything is prepared in order. we really like her home, and she provided you everything like you stay at home.
Sally is very responsive. Her apartment is very cosy and well equipped. The neighbor is quite and closed to Bellagio which is a nice small town. We enjoy our stay at Sally's place.
Sally responded quick to our last minute request and when we arrived at the apartment, everything was in order. Clean, spacious, basic but comfortable and located at a piazza with a nice little bakery and local pub with good coffee and a nice selection of beers (both open Sunday morning). The walk down to the center is about 15 minutes, however quite difficult with a stroller due to the steps and steep cobble path down. We took a taxi back for 10 euros which was perfect. Overall we would definitely recommend Sally's place for guests visiting Bellagio. We have two young children (3,5 and 0,5) and this worked perfectly.
Quaint and homey. Perfect for a stay in Bellagio. The instructions Sally left were very meticulous and answered all our questions. Communication with Sally was extremely easy and made our stay much easier and comforting.
Sally is quick and professional with responses! Renting was easy and she provides lots of additional details about the area.
You're up the hill away from traffic but there are two nice Italian restaurants and a bus stop less than 5 minutes away.

Also: are we on the verge of $75
Last year, newish CEO Doug Suttles announced that Encana (TSE:ECA) would be refocusing its efforts on five core areas. And earlier this week, he made an important step in that direction, selling off the company’s Jonah assets – not one of those five core areas – for US$1.8 billion. Meanwhile, it’s also in the process of trying to find a buyer for its Bighorn assets, which FirstEnergy thinks could be worth an additional $2 billion. That’s potentially $4 billion in dry powder for the company.
What will it do with the windfall? According to FirstEnergy, the company discussed five options at its East Coast Energy conference in New York a few weeks ago. First, it could retire some of its debt, which stood at US$7.1 billion at year’s end. It could buy back more shares, and given that its current market cap sits at around US$16 billion “the potential size of a share buyback program could be enormous,” FirstEnergy said. Third, it could make some bolt-on acquisitions near its five core areas. Fourth, it could identify a sixth key area and expand accordingly, although that seems unlikely given the direction the company is moving under Suttles’s leadership. And finally, it could increase its capex spending, although FirstEnergy thinks that’s even more unlikely. “Encana would not look to deviate from its current plans to keep capex in line with expected cash flows,” it said.
Meanwhile, investors (and, presumably, oil company executives) are talking about the recent cover story for Barron’s, which heralded the imminent arrival of $75 oil. “Citigroup’s head of global commodity research, Edward Morse, believes the combination of flattening consumption and rising production should mean that ‘the $90-a-barrel floor on the world oil price over the past few years will become a $90 ceiling,’” the authors of the Barron’s story write. “Within a new trading range with a $90 ceiling, Morse sees an average of $75 as plausible.”
Why? Demand substitution, mostly. Their thesis is based on two assumptions: that the supply of oil will continue to rise due to the ongoing exploitation of shale, offshore and other unconventional sources, while the demand for it may start to erode more quickly as the traditional pricing relationship between natural gas and oil remains broken. “Transportation accounts for nearly half of the oil the world consumes each year, and trucks alone use nearly one of every nine barrels consumed,” they write. .” Given that most energy companies in Alberta are pricing in substantially higher expected oil prices, they may be in for a nasty surprise. That is, of course, if Morse is actually right.Relevant offers

OPINION: 'It's a free country." Ask someone if it's OK to sit down, make a coffee, or take a squiz at the paper, and chances are you'll receive this stock response. But just because a phrase is oft repeated doesn't make it untrue.
Ours is a free, open and democratic society, where all that isn't expressly forbidden is permitted.
Isn't it?
Just a few days ago, I was chatting with a group of young New Zealanders and the conversation turned to blogs and blogging. My companions were all intelligent, well-educated and gainfully employed Kiwis, yet I was staggered to learn that none of them was baby-boomers who just don't have a clue what life is like for people who didn't grow up in the 1960s and 1970, December 10 - just a few days earlier.
Todd Rippon, a Lord of the Rings tour guide employed by Wellington-based Rover Tours Ltd, was fighting to keep his job after the communication of negative "feedback" to his employer, Scott Courtney, by the staff of Absolutely Positively Wellington Tourism. Rippon's offence? To have spoken in less than glowing terms about Sir Peter Jackson - a charge which Rippon emphatically denies.
Listening to the recording, however, it soon became clear that the offence Rippon's boss objected to most strenuously was his employee's active participation in the Actors' Equity union.
"You're involved with an organisation that is completely at odds with what I do", Courtney told his employee, even though Rippon's work as a tour guide was quite separate from his career as a professional actor and his role as the vice- president of his union.
Also clear was that Tourism New Zealand - a body with which Courtney's firm works very closely - harboured similar misgivings concerning Rippon's associations.
When Rippon asked his boss: "And what about the pressure from Tourism New Zealand? Do you think that it's harming you that I'm working for you?" Courtney replied: "Yes, I do."
"Because Tourism New Zealand disapproves?"
"It will be something that is always at the back of their mind."
This admission by Courtney is deeply troubling. Tourism New Zealand has no legitimate interest whatsoever in the groups with whom Rippon chooses to exercise his statutory right to freedom of association.
It got worse.
The industrial dispute between Actors' Equity and Sir Peter Jackson over the filming of The Hobbit had appalled Rippon objects: "You can't set me aside because I belong to that." Courtney replies: "But I can! You see, this is the point."
"You can't do that!" protests Rippon. "It's a basic human right to be a member of a union!"
"No, no, no!" Courtney snaps back. "It's not!"
It is difficult to imagine a better demonstration of the gulf which now exists between the theory and practice of democratic citizenship in contemporary New Zealand.
A free country? IfA decision on whether eight of Samsung's smartphones will be permanently blocked from sale in the US has been pushed back until December 6, after the judge decided Apple's demands would spark a flurry of motions and counter-motions. Apple had asked the San Jose court to bar handsets including the Galaxy S II and the Droid Charge, after Samsung was found by a jury to have infringed on the Cupertino firm's patent design and UI technology. However, the Register reports, it seems that ban won't be coming any time soon.
The tentative date for the injunction hearing had been penciled in for September 20, giving Apple and Samsung the chance to file post-trial motions. Now, though, Judge Koh suggests that it would be better to hear all of the post-trial motions in one go, rather than deal with them piecemeal.
" Justice Lucy Koh
As for Samsung's request that the preliminary injunction against the Galaxy Tab 10.1 be overturned, after the jury deemed it not to infringe on Apple's patents, that will be heard on September 20 Koh confirmed. That could also see Samsung dip into the $2.6m bond Apple was required to post in order to enact the injunction, claiming it missed out on sales revenue.
All eight of the devices Apple has asked to have blocked from sale are reasonably old, and delaying the hearing means Samsung sales are less likely to be affected overall. Apple has asked for a preliminary injunction on the devices while a permanent ban is decided, while Samsung is likely to counter that it should be allowed to make all possible attempts to challenge the ruling before that happens.This Palmer/Seary design is ranked 10th in America's 75 Best Resort Courses.

Guy Fieri spices up campus dining
Hundreds).
“I’m totally psyched about Guy Fieri on Campus, especially since I was personally involved in developing these recipes,” Fieri said during his October visit to the University. “I’m serving the stuff I love to eat and cook, and I’m sure there isn’t anything else quite like it.”
The stuff Fieri loves to cook has gained him a loyal following on his Food Network shows Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and Tailgate Warriors where he doesn’t mind having fun with food and fans.

I hope it did accept my savepoint between fighting daddy and the jump sequence with the stupid camera angle... I was just too annoyed at the time to try and get through that, after that overly lengthy power-plate sequence I had to endure before fighting daddy, and now a stupid coloring and camera angle...
Daddy is one of the manageable bosses at least, so that wasn't much of an annoyance -- he doesn't do a lot of "use your gauntlet" transforms, his attacks can be blocked, and he doesn't throw quicktime events at you all the time.
See I had the opposite. Daddy threw lots of quicktime events my way. 90% of them I failed. ^^; lol. Don't get your hopes up on fighting Arhiman. You don't get to fight him. Which is rather disappointing. You have to travel around the inside of the temple to heal 4 fertile grounds while avoiding pool of corruption that is rising and Arhiman's gigantic corruption hands. A very disappointing boss battle.
You mean you actually enjoyed the combat more than the acrobatics? Weird. The combat was the least fun part to me, so the end boss was alright with me.
I enjoyed both parts of it. What I meant was that I found the boss battle was anti-climatic.
Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to go through yet another lengthy ordeal to actually fight Arihman. I guess gods are more like CEOs or politicians -- they can't do anything by themselves, and once you are past their minions they are just quivering weaklings.
I never quite got the combat working, so not having to use that again was ok :-)In The K/Now - Mortgage Mess

Latest Fashion, Shopping & StyleWhich States Have the Highest Solar PV Generation Potential
Today, the states with the highest solar photovoltaic (PV) generation potential are the ones that provide the best business environments for companies that design, manufacture, install or lease PV systems. The subject of PV generation potential is too often associated only with the amount of sunlight each state receives instead of their policy and investment climates. Germany, for example, has yearly sunlight similar to Anchorage, Alaska, but has more than ten times the installed solar PV capacity of the entire American desert southwest.
Why?
It is because Germany made the use of PV a top priority in its national energy policy years ago, giving generous government incentives for individuals and businesses to install and use their own systems. Since the United States federal government has yet to implement a comprehensive national policy that provides long-term market signals for solar and other renewables, as it did for oil, coal and gas this past century, the solar industry’s growth today tends to concentrate in states whose legislatures have enacted policies and programs that attract solar investment.
In return, these states have received the majority of solar jobs. The Solar Foundation’s recent “Solar Jobs Census” shows that as of August 2010, the U.S. solar industry employed 93,000 workers, with 50 percent of employers expected to add jobs in the next 12 months. Of those employers, more than half are located in the Western United States, with places like California, New Mexico and Colorado leading the way with smart, effective solar incentives. The solar industry is growing in the eastern U.S. as well. New Jersey, for instance, is the second largest solar market in the country behind California. States like Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are also moving up the ladder, too, with new policies in recent years that are fostering vibrant solar markets.
Though solar companies in any state have access to short-term federal incentives, such as the solar Investment Tax Credit, most are attracted to jurisdictions that have additional incentives that compliment federal supports. For example, the Garden State, New Jersey, has less sunlight than other places in the United States (NM, AZ, CO), but it offers solar energy incentives for residential systems that can pay for themselves in as little as three years. As previously mentioned, the state is second only to California in the amount of solar installed. Recently, the state drew so many applicants for its rebate program that the Board of Public Utilities temporarily suspended the new applications. Due to state and federal incentives, New Jersey has a strong consumer base that has created, and attracted, solar PV manufacturers, installers and leasers that provide low prices, quality jobs and increasing investment opportunities for communities in the state.
Many of the workers and companies are happy the country as a whole is moving forward, but are more impressed by the work of local residents and public officials to get solar on its feet in their states and municipalities. As Bryan Butler, a CEO of a solar company in Solana Beach, CA, explains, “Our company is employing our neighbors to provide energy and jobs to our community. Our success depends on people wanting solar, and we are winning slowly. The country is starting to get the notion that the consequences of not using solar are real.
PV solar works in all 50 states, though without the necessary public and private support in place, like our fossil fuel competitors have enjoyed for decades, a state’s solar industry will have only incremental growth. Today, the solar industry is working tirelessly to build local and national policy support structures that will ensure our success in every state, which will boost PV generation nationwide and help the United States regain its leadership in a technology it first invented. At some point soon, we hope that solar is cost-competitive in every state, offering families and business owners more choice in where and how their energy is generated.

Information Network (BIN21) electronic on-line workshop in Brasil
in June 1992.
Varying reports have been produced in Australia since the early 1970s
calling for action on endangered species and promoting a regional network
of botanic gardens to concentrate on the flora of their local region.
While many of these reports have recognised the role that botanic gardens
and arboreta can play in conservation activities, there was a significant
number of other groups and people involved that were overlooked. This in
particular includes the so-called 'non-professionals'.
In 1987, the Australian
National Botanic Gardens was contracted by the
Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) to conduct a
survey of the major botanic gardens in Australia to determine their
holdings of rare and threatened Australian plants. The published report
included the following recommendations:
These recommendations recognised the largely unco-ordinated approach to ex situ conservation in Australia.
In 1991 the ANBG acted to co-ordinate the ex situ conservation of rare
and threatened plants by organising the conference "Protective Custody? -
Ex Situ Plant Conservation in Australasia". The conference had among its
goals the intention to:
Encouragingly, it was generally agreed by conference delegates that there
is a need for informal networking so that the diverse range of groups
involved can be made aware of the situation that exists. Out of this
common acceptance of the situation came a proposal for the establishment
of the Australian Network for Plant Conservation
The aims of the Network are to:
The structure of the ANPC is as follows.
Role. The Advisory Committee will:
Membership. The membership of the Advisory Committee is be drawn from
botanic gardens, zoological gardens, non-government institutions, the
media, tertiary institutions, national parks and wildlife services
(including the ANPWS), industry and the CSIRO.
A special attempt has been made to include representation from land
management organisations.
The Advisory Committee will appoint these sub-committees as required to
advise it on matters such as funding, research plant re-introduction,
ecological restoration and germplasm storage.
The Co-ordinating Office will:
Staff employed specifically for the ANPC will be employed (though not
necessarily funded) through the Australian National Parks and Wildlife
Service.
Delegates at the Conference agreed that establishing the
ANPC in Canberra would be advantageous given the importance of the ANPC
having close contacts with such organisations as the CSIRO and the ANPWS
through the Endangered Species Program.
The Co-ordinating Office for the ANPC is located in Canberra in space
provided by the Australian National Botanic Gardens.
This group represents all paid up members of the Australian Network for
Plant Conservation.
The activities of ANPC Co-ordinating Office during first year have been:
A fundamental activity of any national organization is the creation and
maintenance of a database to serve the overall needs. The ANPC database
will focus on the collections of conservation-worthy plants in Australian
botanic gardens as well as those grown by kindred organizations and
interested individuals. This database will be established on standard,
commercially available computer hardware, using software to allow
straightforward communications with other national and international
databases. The day to day management of the database and data inputting
will be undertaken by the staff of the organization but database
structural development is being carried out by contract during the first
and subsequent years of operation of the organization, for which separate
funding will be sought. Initial computer hardware acquisitions have been
made during the first year of operation of the organization.
At its core the database will contain a list of rare and endangered
Australian plants, made available by the CSIRO and updated as revisions
are published. It will also include relevant fields on distribution,
ROTAP conservation category, life forms, etc. of each of the species
listed.
Based upon this central reference list of plants the organization will
gather the following data:
The ANPC will support and encourage educational programs to increase
awareness of the problems of plant conservation and biodiversity and the
importance of integrated programs to address conservation issues.
Currently there is little if any training done by botanic gardens and
kindred organisations in relation to the conservation of Australia's
flora. Such training will include courses on collecting, propagating and
cultivating threatened plants; species re-introduction; database
development and management, and land management. It may include tertiary
courses that already exist. A great deal is also likely to be gained by
the exchange of staff between different organisations involved in both in
situ and ex situ conservation.
Training is primarily the responsibility of individual organisations both
in terms of organisation and funding as any training must be tailored to
the conservation programs that those organisations have developed.
However, the role of the Co-ordinating Office will be to identify and
distribute information concerning any conservation training that is
already available and provide contacts for organisations wishing to
exchange staff.
The Co-ordinating Office will also, in the longer term, make suggestions
on what types of training would be valuable for organisations to
undertake if they are interested in conducting conservation work. This
may include arranging with particular organisations to carry out part of
the training program.
Exchange of staff should be considered not only within Australia but also
between countries in the South-West Pacific and with other nations world-
wide where national integrated conservation programs are under
consideration.
As part of the commitment from each of the ANPC members there is an
annual subscription. The fee structure that has been decided upon (as at 1992) is:
Federal, State or Local Government Agencies,
Corporations or Industry Associations $ 200
Other Non-profit Organisations $ 50
Interested Individual $ 30
The membership of the ANPC at
1 July 1992 is 87.

Baker, Raymond William, Arab Studies Quarterly (ASQ)
ONLY THE HEADLINES AND DETAILS varied in the coverage of 11 September and the subsequent suicide bombings in Israel. The underlying story in the mainstream Western media remained the same. Arab-Muslim terrorists were precipitating a civilizational conflict on a global scale. Thomas Friedman, from his watchtower in the New York Times, sounded the alarm: "A terrible disaster is in the making in the Middle East. What Osama bin Laden failed to achieve on 11 September is now being unleashed by the Israeli-Palestinian war in the West Bank: a clash of civilizations." Lest there be any confusion about who fired first, Friedman hastened to explain that "in the wake of repeated suicide bombings, it is no surprise that the Israeli Army has gone on the offensive in the West Bank. Any other nation would have done the same." (1)
The West, wounded first in New York and then in Israel, cast itself as the avenging victim, struggling to understand and respond to the Islam that launched these unprovoked terrorist attacks. The American reaction to 11 September defined the rules of engagement by launching an unconstrained "war on terrorism." President George W. Bush set an emphatically American agenda, defined by U.S. interests, projected by the Western media, and enforced by American power. The same American security apparatus that had not had sufficient evidence to prevent the attack unhesitatingly pronounced Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network of Islamist terrorists guilty of the horrific assault on the Twin Towers. The President spoke in terms shorn of the usual diplomacy. He announced that the perpetrators of 11 September and those like the Taliban who shielded them were "wanted dead or alive." The war on terrorism in Islam's name was to be an American jihad and the world was asked to believe and to join the "crusade." If you are not with us, you are against us, intoned the American President. He vowed to "smoke out" the terrorists wherever they sought refuge and to punish those who harbored them. Osama bin Laden became the evil outlaw with a price on his head and the forces of good in hot pursuit.
The U.S. government would not hear arguments that the undoubted "crime against humanity" of 11 September should be denounced as such and responded to by international law. The voices that asked what would come next in Afghanistan, once the Taliban had been deposed by the military assault, were reduced to an ineffectual whisper. The public announcement of a U.S. right to topple regimes and wage war on any continent at any time would represent the only change in American policies. The United States had been attacked for its goodness, its freedoms, and its prosperity, the President explained. No changes in its fundamental foreign policies, including those in the Middle East, were warranted.
Was the United States really surprised when the Israelis, along with the Russians and the Indians, moved to appropriate this stance for their own ends? In the wake of a wave of suicide bombings that targeted civilians in the heart of Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon pronounced Arafat the "arch terrorist" in the bin Laden mold. On 29 March 2002 Israel launched its own war against terrorism, devastating West Bank cities in its own effort to "root out the terrorist infrastructure." Terrorists had attacked Israelis, like Americans, for who they were and not what they did. The thirty-five year old occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the extensive colonization effort it enabled had no relevance. The Israeli government directed the focus elsewhere. In a frenzy of hatred with its roots in Islam, the irrational and homicidal bombers of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, alongside the al-Aqsa Brigades, aimed to destroy the Jewish state that served as an outpost of Western civilization in the Arab Islamic world.
Islam suddenly became news and today, more than ever, news matters. The media constitutes what Manuel Castells has called "the privileged space of politics," as true in the global as In the national arena. …The Box

- Designer: Akira Kobayashi
- Design foundry: Linotype
- Source: Linotype
Since its initial release, Trade Gothic has been a stable part of American graphic design work, and has been used internationally as well. Now with more weights and more options, Linotype brings us Trade Gothic Next.
Trade Gothic Next History
From 1948 through 1963, Jackson Burke was the Director of Typographic Development at Mergenthaler Linotype Co. in the USA. Linotype released the original weights of the Trade Gothic typeface in 1948. Over the next 12 years, Burke continued to expand the family, designing additional weights and styles.
There is a genre of sans serif typefaces often referred to as the “American Gothics,” in large part because they all have the word “ Gothic” in their names. In this case, “Gothic” does not refer to the Middle Ages or to blackletter, but is just another way of denoting sans serif typefaces. The first 20th century master of the American Gothic style is Morris Fuller Benton, who designed typefaces like Lightline Gothic, News Gothic, and Franklin Gothic. Jackson Burke and Trade Gothic follow nobly in these footsteps.
For a time, it was even seen a competitor to Helvetica. Today Trade Gothic is often seen in advertising and multimedia in combination with serif text fonts, and the condensed versions are popular in the newspaper industry for headlines. For all its success, Trade Gothic does not display as a coherent unifying structure across all members of its family, although this dissonance does adds a bit of earthy naturalism to its appeal.
Akira Kobayashi has been Linotype’s Type Director since 2001. In many ways, he could be seen as a distant successor to Burke. Linotype’s Trade Gothic Next is Kobayashi's revision of Trade Gothic. He refined many of the typeface’s details, such as the terminals, stroke endings, the spacing, and the kerning.
Additional elements that make Trade Gothic Next stand apart from the original Trade Gothic are the newly added compressed widths and heavier weights. The typeface’s Regular weight has been beefed up to make it appear stronger and more robust in text-seized setting. Trade Gothic is a staple of the advertising and newspaper industries, and now Trade Gothic Next brings more features and better quality for today's astute typographers.

Richard; Mitchell/Giurgola Architects with Richard Glaser and Harriet Pattison, landscape architects Fleischner (1944-)
- Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue
- Plaza of granite and brick paving, plane trees, turf, and granite sculpture
Lot approximately 170′ by 180′; portal
- Structure 46′ x 80′
- Initiated by Temple University
- Owned by Temple University and Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
Every weekday thousands of Temple University students commute to the campus via the Broad Street subway. By the late 1960s the university recognized that the station at Columbia Avenue (now Cecil B. Moore Avenue) functioned as a major entrance to the campus, and student, community, and government representatives began to propose ways to make the area safer and more attractive. Eventually these ideas resulted in an ambitious joint project in which the City remodeled the subway station while the university built an adjacent plaza.
The architectural firm for both segments of the project was Mitchell/Giurgola, a local firm with an international reputation. Joining the architects on the plaza design team were artist Richard Fleischner and landscape architects Harriet Pattison and Richard Glaser. The university’s campus improvement program was supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the William Penn Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
For the station itself, Mitchell/Giurgola designed a large head house with a glass roof that allowed daylight to penetrate to the train platform, transforming the subway exit into a campus entrance. Fleischner, responding to the symmetricality of the station’s converging staircases, created a portal-like structure of granite blocks installed on a grassy plot at street level, to act as a symbolic entrance and focal point for the plaza. On each side of this structure, two smaller granite blocks rise from the grass and two from a raised portion of the granite wall. The sculpture in turn influenced the final design of the head house and the landscaping of the sunken plaza, where Pattison and Glaser planted a formal rectangular grid of twenty London plane trees.

Columbia Subway PlazaToday's 10 for Tuesday is about music, specifically music that puts you into a good mood. Now, I mostly listen to vrock (jpop), metal/industrial, and musicals. I haven't picked up new music to listen to in years that wasn't part of a musical, because I'm boring. I picked up a lot more music when I was still working at Sasuga back in the day, because I could get all the Japanese imports.
So, my music selection is a bit weird...Heck, most of my favorite music is definitely the Angry Girl Rock genre.
1. Misunderstood. Dream Theater might be my favorite band. Definitely in the top 10. This is their song I've been listening to most lately, though I also have a love for Space-Dye Vest.
2. Hey You by Pink Floyd. This was the first song I tried to learn with finger picking. It is always a favorite and I finally bought it for my iPod last weekend. I've only been wanting to get it since I lost my tape copy years ago. It shouldn't be a surprise to people who know me that the first music I remember listening to included the Wall.
3. Katamari Damacy. Hey, it is a lot of la! There are just enough versions of this song (both in Japanese and English) that is hard to find the one I like best.
4. The Prelude from Sweeney Todd. I was in this musical and all of the big chord numbers make me so happy! I also have a deep abiding love for A Little Priest, because I am wrong.
5. Dear God by XTC. It's part of my Angry Rock. I love a lot of political and quasi-political songs.
6. Like Dear Mr. President. This is the only Pink song I own and I love it to pieces.
7. Engel. Rammstein is usually much harder than this song, which is by far their most accessible for larger more mainstream audiences. The video is an anime music video from Evangelion. The main "vocalist" in the video is Asuka, who grew up in Germany.
8. Sweet Dreams. I love the original song, but it works even better as done by Marilyn Manson. I hope you weren't looking for happy songs. Most of the ones that make me happy are not perky.
9. With Cat Like Tread. It is iconic. I mean, when you think of Pirates of Penzance what songs come to mind? While I love Hail Poetry, I know that isn't by far the most popular song from the musical.
10. Iolanthe Act 1 Finale (part 1 and part 2 and part 3 (Into Parliament)). The first musical I did with MIT G&S was Ruddigore, which I thought sounded hilarious with the chorus of professional bridesmaids. However, those songs were fairly insipid even by G&S standards. Iolanthe is the only musical so far that I've done twice. Being a fairy is awesome, and this is why!
Of course, this doesn't include Schadenfreude or any of the songs from Avenue Q, Wicked, Aida, L'Arc~en~ciel, Lunasea, Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog or even the silly songs from Sailor Moon. It's just these were the ones that came to mind first.UC Davis Childrens Hospital
Physicians conducted this research project in order to enhance the results obtained in the first study described above. This time, doctors wanted to see the effects of using perioperative steroids (i.e., steroids used before and after surgery) in children having palatoplasty (repair of a cleft palate).
This research project compared the use of the Furlow Palatoplasty technique and a UC Davis modification of this procedure with traditional palatoplasty methods. The Furlow Palatoplasty technique potentially improves soft palate function over traditional surgical techniques.
In this study, doctors were interested in seeing the effects of perioperative steroids (i.e., steroids used before and after surgery) for patients with VPI (hypernasal speech caused by talking through the nose).
Physicians conducted this research project to compare lenient vs. traditional criteria used in determining when patients should be discharged from the hospital after surgery.

Currently, acute kidney injury is diagnosed by increased serum creatinine. However, creatinine is not a reliable marker for acute changes in renal function.
The biology of the renal graft is influenced by chemokines from reperfusion and throughout its course with the development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy ubiquitously present in grafts of long-term survival. Moreover, the evaluation of changes in urinary cytokines may predict renal function and acute rejection episodes and their response to treatment.
Today there are several studies comparing the relative immunosuppression of renal function, but few noticed its relationship with cytokines and chemokines. Thus, we propose to study the inflammatory consequences on blood and urine with the early withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors (ICN), with renal biopsy in renal transplant patients before the change of immunosuppression and 9 months after.
- Evaluation of cytokines after calcineurin inhibitors withdrawn [ Time Frame: 2 years ] [ Designated as safety issue: Yes ]MCP-1/CCL2, sTNFR2, IL-1Ra, MIP-δ, OPG, TGF-β, and IP-10/CXCL10 MIG/CXCL9 in urine and blood for measurement before and after conversion to tacrolimus everolimus, and evaluation of cytokines even among patients with and without conversion.
- Evaluation of renal function [ Time Frame: 2 years ] [ Designated as safety issue: Yes ]Evaluation of renal function (serum creatinine, GFR, Cockcroft-Gault, Cr-1 slope) before and after conversion. Correlation of renal function with measurements of cytokines. Correlation of cytokine levels with the biopsy results.
Detailed Description:
Research objectives
OBJECTIVES
Main Objectives:
• Evaluate the chemokines blood and urine in kidney transplant patients taking prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium compared to those in use prednisone, mycophenolate sodium and everolimus as maintenance immunosuppression.
Secondary Objectives:
• Assess renal function (serum creatinine and its clearance estimated by the Cockroft-Gault) and a composite outcome (acute rejection, graft loss, death and abandonment of the study) in patients taking prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium compared to those taking prednisone, mycophenolate sodium and everolimus as maintenance immunosuppression.
- Scientific background, relevance and justification of the research
In current clinical practice, acute kidney injury is typically diagnosed by measuring serum creatinine. Unfortunately, creatinine is an unreliable indicator during acute changes in kidney function (1). First, serum creatinine concentrations may not change until about 50% of kidney function has already been lost. Second, serum creatinine does not accurately depict kidney function until a steady state has been reached, which may require several days. According to Hu and Knechtle (2), chemokines can influence at least three aspects of the biology of the renal graft: 1 - the restoration of blood flow in the graft can lead to injury type ischemia / reperfusion in which chemokines recruit leukocytes; 2 - receptor responses to infection during immune suppression involve chemokines and 3 - the inflammatory components in the RA and IF/TA are controlled by chemokines.
Current data have showed urinary cytokines predicting renal function by months in renal transplanted patients. In the evaluation of urinary cytokines and chemokines in the presence of acute rejection, taken together the studies reported elevations of urinary levels of MIP-3α/CCL20, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-6, TNF, IL10, IFN, MCP-1 / CCL2, IP10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9, I-TAC/CXCL11, RANTES/CCL5 (2, 3, 4,5-10,11-13,14,15). Only MIP-1β/CCL4 (4) urine was not increased, while EGF decreased (5). As predictors of complications and future changes in renal function, levels of TGF-β and IP-10/CXCL10 were associated with renal function 6 months and 4 years after transplantation (16,17). IP-10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9, CXCR3, RANTES/CCL5 and the percentage of binding of IL-2 were associated with the occurrence of RA (6,13,18). IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9 were also considered useful as predictors of response to treatment of RA (2,11,13). Nankivell et al reported that after 1year of renal transplant, 94% of patients present with chronic rejection grade I (BANFF) and 76% present with calcineurin nephrotoxicity, although there is insufficient data about urinary cytokines at these situations (19). In a recent study, Hu et al reported urinary MIP-δ, OPG, IP-10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9 as good biomarkers for acute renal rejection and IF/TA (20).
Nowadays there is a lot of studies comparing immunosuppression in relation to renal function but not so much in relation to chemokines and cytokines, which are more representative of allograft inflammation and fibrosis.
So, we suppose to study the inflammatory consequences of early CNI withdrawn in renal transplant patients together with renal biopsy before the immunosuppression modification and 9 months after.

But Hong Kong billionaire Cecil Chao still refuses to welcome his daughter's partner into the family
THE Hong Kong billionaire who offered £78m to any man who could seduce and marry his lesbian daughter has called off the deal – but still refuses to accept her girlfriend.
Cecil Chao, a 77-year-old property tycoon, told CNN that he was retracting the offer to find his daughter Gigi a husband.
"Her private life is hers," he said, but added that he would never accept her partner of nine years, Sean Eav.
"If this is the way she wants to be, for the time being it's all over," he said. Asked what he meant by "for the time being", Chao explained: "Because she is only 33. Life changes. I mean I changed a lot [from] when I was 33 to now."
He insisted he was not trying to use money to buy her happiness. "She has to choose her own happiness," he said, "but I can use my money to let her have choice – whatever she chooses to be the best for her."
When asked if he welcomed her partner into the family, Chao replied: "No."
Chao said he sees his daughter every day but she never told him in person that she was a lesbian and that he found out in a newspaper.
His decision to call off the deal comes after Gigi published an open letter to her father, widely circulated among Hong Kong media, which urged him to accept her partner.
She told her father that she has had relationships with men before but they were "always short-lived", as she "lost patience" and "felt an indescribable discomfort" in their presence.
"As your daughter, I would want nothing more than to make you happy," she wrote. "But in terms of relationships, your expectations of me and the reality of who I am are not coherent."
Chao's payment – originally set at £40m – horrified gay and lesbian organisations in Asia, but he upped the bounty earlier this month, insisting his daughter's "thinking will change in the future".

Well, she doesn't looks as lesbian. I think that whole affair is some sort of publicity stunt.
And what exactly does a lesbian look like? He is sad, but you who should know better is sadder.
Well, this kind of women often have specific appearance... short hair, men's clothing, no makeup and so on.
Well, this kind of women often have very specific appearance... short hair, men's clothing, no makeup and so on. She definitely not a lesbian.- freely available

Twenty-seven players have been charged, with some of them receiving multiple arrests for multiple offenses.
Is the league too lenient with their penalties when it comes to player arrests? They must be, because if they weren’t, these incidents likely wouldn’t occur as frequently as they have been.
Whether a player is being arrested for child abuse, drug possession, street racing, soliciting prostitution or even charged with murder, this all needs to come to an end. And it needs to end fast.
A player has been handed a one or two game suspension for a violent tackle/hit in a game. James Harrison of the Cincinnati Bengals received the penalty in 2011 for a hit on Cleveland Browns quarterback Colt McCoy. Joe Mays of the Denver Broncos received the same penalty for his hit on Houston Texans quarterback Matt Schaub. Ndamukong Suh of the Lions was hit with a two game suspension in 2011 for a nasty stomp on Packers lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith.
With all the crime that has been going on off the field, the only players to be hit with suspensions for their respective crimes (aside from the Saints Bounty Scandal) since 2011 are Cedric Benson (three games), Aaron Berry (three games), and Kenny Britt (one game).
Why is it that players are only getting fined, or receiving a similar punishments, for committing a federal offense? It doesn’t make any sense. If the league wants their players to stop committing crimes, they need to start hitting players with harsher penalties on their first offense.
Any arrest should result in a year suspension minimum for what we have seen since February 3. It is practically the only way the league has any chance to stop, if not reduce, the number of arrests happening off the field.
Driving your car under the influence of alcohol is far more dangerous than an illegal hit. Not to lessen the harmful effects of an illegal hit, because it’s extremely dangerous. But when you’re out on the road intoxicated, you’re putting everyone else on the road at risk. The same thing applies to street racing and drug possession.
Being charged with murder is a whole different issue. That person obviously shouldn’t be allowed to play professionally ever again if they are lucky enough to make it out of prison. That is, if they are guilty.
What can a parent possibly say to their young children who idolize these athletes when one of their favorite players is convicted of a crime? How do you tell your kid that they can’t wear their No. 81 Aaron Hernandez New England Patriots jersey anymore when they can hardly grasp the concept of being charged with murder?
The answers to these questions are far too complicated. All I know is that in a perfect world, a parent should never have to be faced with any of these tough tasks. Unfortunately, the world we live in isn’t always rainbows and butterflies.
It’s simply an honor to have the young look up to you. It’s completely out of whack that these athletes are committing crimes that can be avoided.
In the case of Hernandez and his murder charge, it’s a completely different story from the other arrests and should be the icing on the cake for Roger Goodell and his troops to hand down more severe punishments for crime in the NFL.
If Hernandez is guilty of murder, he will likely spend the rest of his days behind bars and never set foot on the field again. Following his release from the Patriots, Hernandez is still guaranteed upwards of $5 million from New England.
Is it just me, or does it sound ridiculous to give someone charged with murder more than $5 million dollars?
Well, the Patriots certainly think so, and according to ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio, the organization will try to fight having to pay Hernandez the remaining guaranteed money from the contract he signed last August.
“The two-front battle relates to the final $3.25 million installment of his $12.5 million signing bonus and guaranteed base salaries for 2013 and 2014. The guaranteed base salaries total $2.5 million.
.”
So, lucky enough for the Patriots, it seems like they will be let off the hook. It’s only fair.

At the rate players are currently going, there could be over 50 arrests by the time of next season’s opening kick-off on September 5, 2013.
Something needs to change. These athletes are far too gifted to be throwing their lives away by getting into unnecessary trouble.
It is the dream of many young children to play in the NFL when they grow up. To be born with the God-given talent to actually play in the pros is a true blessing. So why is it that so many athletes are throwing it away?

Today, the House voted to pass H.R. 9, the “Small Business Tax Cut Act,” by a vote of 235-173. This legislation would provide a 20-percent tax cut to companies employing 499 or fewer employees during either calendar year 2010 or 2011. The way this works is that any business – without regard to revenues – would be given a tax deduction equal to 20 percent of that business’ net income. For example, a business having 400 employees in 2011 with a net income of $20 million would get a deduction of $4 million; a business having 5 employees in 2011 with a net income of $10,000 would get a deduction of $2,000.
Some have criticized this House tax cut approach which employs only one “trigger” to activate the tax cut, the number of employees, i.e., 499 or less. For example, law firms and medical practices with high net incomes would be lumped together with tech startups and “mom and pop” retail, which might have minimal or no net income; all would receive the 20-percent deduction. Because this bill passed largely along party lines, there is little hope that the Senate will take up this legislation; also, the White House has threatened a veto.
Compare this House legislation to S. 2230 “Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012.” This Senate bill received a partisan Democrat majority of 51-45 earlier this week – failing the 60-vote threshold required to avoid a filibuster. S. 2230 would have placed a minimum 30-percent federal tax rate on taxpayers with incomes greater than $1 million. This Senate bill, like the House “Small Business Tax Cut Act”, was largely partisan – having little chance of passing in the House.
While neither of these bills was ever considered to be ultimately viable, each chamber pushed through a vote to underscore their partisan agendas as part of their broader messaging around this week’s tax filing date. Passing legislation that is destined to fail misses the point. Instead, we call on Congress to work together to craft legitimate tax reform and tax simplification for our small businesses. Our tax code is too complicated and costly for many small businesses, and everyone knows this.

Whoops
I'm so embarrassed! It was my 1 year blogiversary on Wednesday. I wasn't planning on doing anything huge about it but I thought I'd at least announce it! Ah well. So here it is, two days late, a few words about my last year blogging.
My IRL friend Suey was always trying to get me to blog and though I thought it would be fun I kept putting it off. Why? Well, because I've seen quite a few blogs start up and months or even weeks later die off. So I took starting a blog very seriously. I wanted to be sure I was sure and commit. Make sense? Anywho, after much hemming and hawing I started up a blog and thus began my foray into this crazy world of book blogging.
It's been a fun year and my favorite thing, of course, is all the awesome friends I've made. I wasn't expecting the fun relationships I'd make but I'm glad they're made. It's so awesome having friends all over the world. If you guys are ever in my neck of the woods and need a place to crash, you're welcome to crash on my couch. You'll just have to ignore all the cat hair. ;)
You'd think after a year I'd be all settled in and comfortable with this blogging thing but I'm always learning new things every day and rethinking the way I do stuff. I'm happy you've all stuck with me and I hope you continue to do so.
Here's to another great year!

Congrats, Jenny! My 1 Year is coming up soon, too. I think I feel like you. You always have to rethink how you do everything when you run a blog, no matter long it runs for.
Yes, I think change, as long as it's improvement, is always a good thing.
Happy happy blogoversary! I can't believe it's been a year! Craziness. I love coming here and reading what you have to say. :)
Thanks, Jessica! I'm shocked it's been a year too. It's been fun!
Wow has it been a year already? It's incredible how time flies when you count by blogging weeks. So glad you lasted past the first few months and decided to stick with it. Here's to many more!
I know! Time flies in blogging time. ;)
Happy Blogthday!
Thanks!
Congrats! I'm glad to have met you. :)
Thanks!

Yeah! One year down! :) So glad you decided to finally do it. Hopefully you'll keep the love for it awhile. Even during the slumps like you've mentioned in recent weeks. :)
Ugh, yeah that slumps still going on. Too bad it happened during my Blogoversary.
Congrats on your blogoversary! It's been fun to get to know you through your posts and comments. Hopefully, we'll get to meet IRL sometime in the near future.
It's fun getting to know bloggers, isn't it? I've enjoyed getting to know you too.
Wow! A year goes by quickly. Congrats on your One Year blogoversary! Glad you are around!!
I know! Crazy fast!
Congrats on your one year! Such an accomplishment! Let's hope you are still typing away by this time next year! :)
Yeah, with the way I've been feeling...who knows. :(
Congrats! I am so glad that you have stuck with it, I love reading your blog (yes even the eye candy soccer posts haha). Can't wait to see what comes next!
Aw, thanks, Ang. I love writing those soccer posts. ;)

Autodesk Navisworks® 2014 has many major enhancements that extend the use of models among Autodesk products. These features include the use of Ray Trace, the Quantification tool, Measurement tool upgrades, Clash Detective upgrades, and the introduction of ReCap.
Ray Trace Has Arrived
An important enhancement to the Autodesk line of products is the introduction of Ray Trace to Navisworks. Completing the cycle, Navisworks will now render the Autodesk library of materials. This improvement is a remarkable step forward as it furthers collaboration among products. Any Autodesk materials applied to a model will persist in Navisworks. The look and feel of the model will be consistent from Autodesk product to Autodesk product. Using the Ray Trace rendering engine, you can easily produce photorealistic images as though they were created in Autodesk® Revit®.
Figure 1: Revit model rendered in Navisworks with Ray Trace
Furthering the rendering engine is the ability to create and apply Autodesk materials to the Navisworks model. Navisworks 2014 introduces the Autodesk Rendering palette where you can select any Autodesk material and apply it to the Navisworks model. Just as in other Autodesk software, you can edit a material and save the modified version.
The palette is broken out into two main panes. The top pane shows all the materials in the current document while the bottom pane shows all the materials in the selected library. In figure one below, the Autodesk Library is selected.
The Autodesk library is broken up in the selection tree by category with multiple materials in each category. You can quickly navigate the selection tree and find the material you are searching for to modify or apply to your model.
Figure 2: Autodesk Rendering
With Autodesk rendering you can also create and modify lights and environments. The Lighting and Environment tabs allow access to the tools necessary to customize these settings. You can add point lights, spot lights, distant lights, and web lights. This is very beneficial as you can add lighting depth to the project. The Autodesk light controls are very similar to the Presenter light tools. Figure 3 shows a spot light configuration. Any point can be modified by using the gizmo. The light cone, angle of the light, and location of the light can be modified. This ensures that the lights are positioned correctly in your model to provide a photorealistic view when rendered.
Another enhancement that Autodesk Rendering brings to Navisworks is the ability to navigate the model with Ray Trace active. This experience is heavy on the graphics and is only effective if you have the hardware to keep up with the rendering process.
Figure 3: Autodesk Spot Light with Gizmo
When you wish to produce an image or video that is rendered, simply click the Output tab on the ribbon > Rendered Image. Make sure you have Autodesk Rendering selected for your rendering image, and save the file.
Constructing Quantification Catalogs
A great enhancement to Navisworks is the ability to quantify the model. The Quantification tool in Navisworks lets you associate model geometry to a catalog. All constructed catalog items are displayed in the Quantification tool selection Tree pane. The workbook selection tree is a construction of two other catalogs: the Item Catalog and the Resource Catalog.
Figure 4: Quantification tool
The Item Catalog is required to associate any quantities to the selection tree. These items are used to name the summary level information of calculated quantities. An example of an item is a 4” concrete slab.
The Resource catalog is used to create detailed information that can be used to construct assemblies in the Item Catalog. Examples of common resources for a wall are: wall board, coverings, studs, insulation, and so on. In our example with concrete, let’s add the resource concrete and the resource 4” Rebar 18” OC.
Once resources are created in the Resource Catalog, you can associate them with an item in the Item Catalog. To associate the catalogs together, select the Item in the Item Catalog, then select the resources in the Resource Catalog, right-click the resources, and select Add to Selected Item.
When you take off model objects, all resources will also be taken off. If you add a resource to an item after you have already associated model objects to the item, these objects will automatically have the additional resource calculated.
Figure 5: Item and Resource Catalogs
Dynamic Function In Catalogs
One of the fundamental aspects to the Quantification tool is the ability to create functions in the catalogs to calculate quantities. A good example of this is in the calculations of concrete. If you do a model takeoff on concrete from a model authored in Revit, the calculations are based on cubic feet. When you perform a model takeoff, regardless of the units you select in the catalog, the values will be calculated in cubic feet. In order to properly calculate the volume, you can change the formula from “=ModelVolume” to “=ModelVolume/27”
When modifying a formula, you can modify the formula to effect only one instance of a takeoff, or you can modify the master to modify all instances of the takeoff. As a best practice, it is suggested you only modify the master for consistency.
Iterative Take-Offs
Because the nature of construction documents is iterative, Navisworks allows for your takeoff data to be updated along with the model geometry. When a model is updated, the geometry in Navisworks is automatically updated in the nwcs that comprise the nwf. The quantification tool allows you to view the changes from one iteration of the model to another through the use of the Change Analysis tool. This tool displays multiple different icons to warn you about changes to the model.
When model geometry is updated, you are able to view what quantities in the item changed. For example, if the thickness of a slab changes, the area and perimeter would be the same, but the volume would be changed. You will be able to hover your mouse over the affected cell and view the changes between the old and new versions. You then have the option to accept or reject the changes.
Figure 6: Updating quantities
Updated Measuring Tools
The measuring tools in Navisworks have changed dramatically, allowing you to more accurately measure objects. You now have the ability to lock the measuring tools to any xyz plane or surface. This is important because you can ensure you are measuring on the correct plane.
With these measuring tools you can accurately perform takeoffs on objects that are not modeled. For example, if you know there is a storm drain missing, you can draw it in with the measuring tools and perform a takeoff on a non-modeled object. When takeoffs are performed on non-modeled objects, the values will not update with model iterations.
Leveraging Catalogs
When you have developed an extensive catalog, you can export it to be used in future projects. Following the example of other tools in Navisworks, this allows you to create a workflow that leverages all your work on one project to another project.
Clash Detective Changes
The Clash Detective clash algorithm was updated to allow for quicker identification of constructability issues. When multiple clashes are found between the same pair of composite objects, they will be treated as a single clash. Clashes between two parts of the same composite object will not be reported.
Clash item highlight colors have also been updated, allowing you to set the highlight color of clashing items when viewing your clashes.
A new column in the Clash Detective displays the status on the Clash viewpoint. Clash viewpoints can be automatically updated by using the Auto-Update Viewpoint setting, or manually updated by right-clicking on the camera icon, then clicking Save Viewpoint.
Another new column, Comments, has been added to the Clash Detective that displays the number of comments associated with a clash.
The Filter tool has been upgraded to allow you to determine how you wish to filter the selected objects. You can select none, exclusive, or inclusive. Exclusive will show clash results where both of the clashing items are included in your current item selection. Inclusive will show clash results where one or both or the clashing items are included in your current item selection. You can even choose to create reports only on selected items. This feature is in the Include Clashes group on the Reports tab.
The toggle between Dim Other and Hide Other has been restored to the interface in Navisworks 2014. This will significantly improve the workflow allowing you to more quickly toggle your view controls.
The reporting features of the Clash Detective were also upgraded. The new features allow you to preserve you dim setting in the nwd. This means that users with only Navisworks Freedom will have the ability to view your model with the Dim setting that previously could only be seen in Navisworks Manage with Dim Other selected.
Other Upgrades
The Section tool received an upgrade in this release allowing you to fit a section box to a selection. This allows you to select a collection of objects and select the Fit To Selection tool to encapsulate the selected objects in a Section Box. This tool can be used in coordination meetings to quickly isolate the area for conflict resolution.
The update to Timeliner allows you to export Timeliner tasks and save them as a selection set. This means you can manage and perform actions on groups of objects, rather than individual schedule items. Timeliner now also supports Primavera P6 v8.2 data sources.
Autodesk ReCap
Autodesk ReCap is supported in Navisworks to allow for point clouds to be aggregated quickly and accurately. ReCap has a Windows 8 style with tiles to allow you to navigate all its tools. It is useful software that enables you to import a large variety of point clouds and edit them within ReCap.
One of the key benefits of ReCap is the ability to combine multiple point clouds together, then parse out the combined point cloud into sections that better fit your project. For example, suppose that your laser scanner is set up in multiple points and it requires five scans to view the completed building on a campus. Rather than export the whole campus, in ReCap you can combine the five point cloud files together, then create sections to isolate each building. You can then export just the sectioned building for use in other products such as Autodesk Revit.
This new point cloud software allows you to simplify the way you work with point clouds. Navisworks 2014 will natively read ReCap files, allowing a good workflow between ReCap and Navisworks.This plugin allows remote access to BuddyPress networks through an XML-RPC API..

With foreign markets requiring reductions in the use of chemicals, there is great demand for biological solutions to pest management. Zamorano University will promote the use of beneficial nematodes instead of traditional pesticides to control insect infestations in select horticultural crops. Through scale-up of their biocontrol laboratory, Zamorano will produce and sell 20 times as many doses of beneficial nematodes over the previous year. Small producers will be able to access this biocontrol at a much lower cost than a synthetic chemical product throughout the western departments of Honduras.
Outcome: 9,000 hectares of smallholder land will use biological pest control. In addition, Zamorano will sell through a commercial partner to build a sustainable distribution channel in the country.
See:Lymphedema swelling usually occurs in an arm, however occasionally in numerous arm or legs. The reasons of primary lymphedema are unidentified, as well as symptoms, though really uncommon, might establish on their very own at any kind of time. Specifically, surgical treatment involving lymph nodule extraction develops a high danger of developing lymphedema.
At the very least two sleeves need to be gotten, as well as their usage alternated. They may be washed in cold or lukewarm water with a mild soap, preferably after each usage, after that set out standard to dry, and should never be wrung. Regarding two times a year they could be changed as a result of stretching over time. Several different shades, weights as well as textiles are available for compression sleeves, and there are additionally compression gloves to use for puffy hands; a doctor’s prescription could aid cover the price through insurance.
leg compression sleeve knee
Running arm sleeves have actually ended up being an usual view at races and favored neighborhood running trails everywhere. There are many reasons to use running arm sleeves varying from raising convenience during runs to speeding recuperation.
A compression sleeve is usually worn simply while the user is awake; exemptions consist of any case where it might come to be moist, such as recipe cleaning, swimming as well as showering, as skin irritability may result. The sleeve is most reliable throughout any physical activity and also should then constantly be worn. When the sleeve is gotten rid of for resting– as well as the skin ought to be totally dry prior to putting it on once more, moisturizing the skin daily is recommended– generally at evening.
Amongst sportsmens, compression sleeves are increasingly being used, particularly on puffy legs. The sleeve’s objectives include warming the limb for increased adaptability, better blood circulation to boost efficiency, and also protection from scratches, cuts and rubbing burns.
Compression sleeves are garments generally fitted to an arm or leg, and have an elastic, stretchable nature. One of their functions is to treat the swelling as well as discomfort linked with lymphedema. An additional use of compression sleeves is regularly seen in sports and also working out.
As soon as lymphedema has been identified, one of the a lot more usual therapies suggested is a compression garment, normally a sleeve or stocking. These sleeves are frequently custom-fitted in order to use the right amount of pressure for reliable swelling decrease. A sleeve also tight will limit blood circulation and also should be taken out immediately. They usually will certainly not be advised for those with blood clots, diabetes, or high blood pressure.
1. Compression
Compression arm sleeves can additionally be utilized as a healing device. After a long term simply put on a pair of rehabilitation compression arm sleeves. These compression sleeves increase blood circulation, which helps the extraction of lactic acid that developed in your muscular tissues during your run. This speeds up the amount of time it takes to recuperate from a long run and also lowers muscular tissue discomfort.
Some joggers use compression sleeves for arms to assist decrease swelling induced by longer runs. This swelling is because of muscle resonances and splits, which generate an inflammatory feedback. This draws excess liquid into the arms. Putting on compression arm sleeves helps prevent arm swelling.
2. Sun protection
Using a set of running arm sleeves with a high UPF element is a terrific remedy. If you are a pavement-pounding pro or a casual runner, the sun security that running arm sleeves provide is one of the top factors to have a pair in your running kit.
Running outside is a great means to get via those challenging runs by having even more to look at than the treadmill in front of you at the health club, which is a great device to keep your mind active. While there are several advantages to running outside, doing so raises your direct exposure to the sunlight’s unsafe UVA as well as UVB rays.
3. Adaptability
Running arm sleeves have actually come to be a typical sight at races and also preferred local running trails almost everywhere. There are several factors to make use of running arm sleeves ranging from enhancing comfort throughout runs to speeding rehabilitation. Some runners use compression sleeves for arms to assist reduce swelling induced by longer runs. After a long run merely put on a pair of healing compression arm sleeves. If you are a casual runner or a pavement-pounding expert, the sunlight defense that running arm sleeves supply is one of the leading reasons to have a set in your running package.
Exactly how commonly do you start a long run when it is a little chilly outside and after that finish up around mile 4 being sorry for that extra layer you put on? Even if you take off that lengthy sleeve tee, you’ll have to bring it with you for the remainder of the run.
compression sleeve for arm youth
This is where the elegance of running arm sleeves comes in. If you had a pair, you could possibly begin your runs pleasantly warm and comfortable, as well as then simply slide them down towards your wrists when you warm up.
No matter what type of jogger you are, you will thank on your own consistently by having a set of running sleeves.To my mind the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being. … I hold that, the more helpless a creature, the more entitled it is to protection by man from the cruelty of man.—Mahatma Gandhi

Mark Begich and Lisa Murkowski introduced legislation last month seeking to ban Aquabountyâ€™s so-called Frankenfish, they put the interests of Alaskan citizens over corporate plutocrats and near-sighted regulators. We should applaud the senators for their intervention on behalf of our stateâ€™s most important economic, cultural, and natural resource.
But the simple fact is this: nearly all the food we put into our bodies contains the same genetically modified organisms that we supposedly decry in our debates about this salmon. The corn that finds its way into products as diverse as breakfast cereals and filet mignon has been reengineered by biotech firms to resist a host of pests and pesticides that might otherwise damage the countryâ€™s most valuable agricultural good. The soy products that extend meatloaves and enhance soups have undergone similar manipulation in the past two decades. At this point, 90 percent of all soy grown in the United States â€” 60 million acres or so â€” is genetically modified, most of it to withstand the application of glyphosphate, a toxic herbicide.
If we expect consumers down south to pay a premium for our wild Alaskan salmon, we too should make a similar sacrifice to purchase products that guarantee that we are not eating genetically modified organisms. Certainly, we can push our food producers to utilize non-genetically modified food stuffs; we, too, can purchase foods certified organic by the USDA. Such sacrifices will be difficult, of course, but we will be taking a stand against the biotech oligarchies that have a stranglehold over our food system.Anything else would be unjust to our fishermen.

Lambing season is in full swing. We had twins born last night and a single the day before. Still waiting on three more ewes to drop. Of course we just started a blizzard, so the timing is impeccable.
Some awesomeness has descended on the homestead. Karma has apparently decided we have had enough of the negatives. There are some final things to work out and then I will be able to tell you all about it.
We are still moving to Kentucky, this awesomeness has slowed it a bit. Which is fine. It will make transitioning smoother for us. And six chickens have found a new home.
I did mention a blizzard. It just started as I sat down to write. They are expecting 11" of snow by tomorrow. We are ready for it. Plenty of food and wood. Only problem is Husband went into work this morning and the wood stove is at the bottom of the steps, several steps. I am getting better navigating stairs. Up is soooo much easier than down. Never the less I am staying warm.
Progress with my knee flexibility is stagnant. I have taken on putting a movie on, laying on my stomach, and using a scarf to bend my knee until tears erupt. It's awful, but has to be done. Doing my strengthening exercises and other stretches. I know it takes time, and this awesomeness doesn't make me feel that getting back ASAP is utterly important. I can take a bit more time without feeling guilty.
I am back to baking. That makes me feel useful and happy. I made a Boston cream pie, and I think I over did things. It takes a very long time to make one, and my back was done with it all. Just wish the dish would stay around as long as it takes to make it.
Hope you are doing well.

Your pie looks absolutely amazing! And I hear you on the stairs thing, too. After I had knee surgery I went down stairs on my BUTT (also slid down banisters) for longer than I'd care to admit. If anyone has a used stationery bike you can buy cheap or borrow, it's pretty good (but painful, I won't lie) for getting some more bend out of your healing knee. I used one and I hated it...but it helped, I have to admit.
It's good to see an update from your place! Nice to hear that you are up to baking a little bit again. I'm sure that the family appreciates the results!
BTW, that pie looks excellent!
I'm glad to know there's some awesomeness! Looking forward to hearing about it.
Good luck with the therapy. I've been thinking about you and wondering how you're doing.
Your pie looks great!
Awesomeness us good! That Boston Cream Pie reminds me of my Momma. She used to make them several times a year.
The pie looks fabulous,I can see why it doesn't last long on the plate. That's because it's delicious!!!
I can't wait to hear your news of awesomeness, I'm excited for ya'll
That BCP looks just yummy! I'm glad for you guys there is awesomeness going on and glad it will contribute to moving the homestead as well.

John 1:1–18
Gurnet Point Light in Plymouth, Massachusetts, is distinct from any other lighthouse in the United States: It is associated with Hannah Thomas, the first female lighthouse keeper in America. When Hannah’s husband went off to fight in the War for Independence, Hannah remained behind to keep the great lamp burning to guide ships out at sea.
In spiritual terms, women have been keepers of the light for centuries: Agnes of Rome was martyred for refusing to sacrifice to pagan gods. Glady Aylward was a missionary to China who shared the gospel in villages and prisons and among lepers. Rose Lathrop, daughter of Nathaniel Hawthorne, established homes in the late 1800s for young women suffering from cancer. Like John the Baptist, these women directed and guided others toward the true light that came into the world: Jesus.
Have you ever watched the sun reflecting off prisms hanging from a crystal chandelier? The prisms themselves are not the light; they merely reflect the light produced by the chandelier. Yet they are capable of throwing hundreds of sparkling rainbows throughout a room. In his book Desiring God, John Piper wrote, “We were made to be prisms refracting the light of God’s glory into all of life. Why God should want to give us a share in shining with his glory—shekinah—is a great mystery. Call it grace or mercy or love—it is an unspeakable wonder!”
To reflect the light of God’s presence in a dark and damaged world, we have to stay close to the source: the Son. The more we let his light shine into our eyes and reflect into the eyes of others, the more we become like him. “And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit” (2 Corinthians 3:18).
Let’s be keepers of God’s light—ensuring that the light of his love burns brightly. We can also reflect that light into the lives of others. It only takes a small beacon of light to dispel the darkness
John 1:7–9[John] came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.

Lorraine Smith doesn't think feminism is incompatible with a penchant for pornography. She argues that the industry is finally beginning to benenfit women, both as participants and viewers.
If there is one subject guaranteed to produce a lively debate amongst a group of feminists - male or female - it has to be porn. I have never been particularly vocal about my feelings on the subject until I visited this very site for the first time and saw a quote (taken from another website) on the issue saying that, "People who believe that porn is liberating for women (idiotic, but there are women like this) should call themselves 'pornists' or some other word. They are not feminists. Period." This infuriated me. What right does anyone have to say that I can't call myself a feminist because I like pornography? Do politicians have to tow the party line on every single policy in order to rightly call themselves Liberal/Conservative/socialist/whatever? I think not. I have no problem with other feminists' varied views on porn and will gladly read any reasoned argument, be it pro- or anti-, so decided that it was time to actually sit down and analyse some thoughts on the subject in more detail but from my own perspective.
it seems that more and more these days it is an industry where women are coming out on top
Pornography used to be terribly dull for women. For years the industry was run by men for men and so it was understandable that women would feel threatened by porn, but it seems that more and more these days it is an industry where women are coming out on top. Pop along to the Hot D'or - an alternative to the Cannes Film Festival for the adult industry - and you will get a glimpse into a world where a 'Best Actor' (sic) category had to be added for fear that the male performers wouldn't get a look in. Female porn stars are usually much more highly paid than the men and, at the top end of the market, really do call the shots. Women are also taking the opportunity to get busy behind the scenes too with photographers like Suze Randall producing images that appeal women as well as men, female directors becoming more prevalent (such as the French former star Ovidie), and others even setting up their own companies to produce a more 'female friendly' product. From a feminist perspective, you could say that things have never looked better.
Exploitation does still happen however, as a Channel 4 documentary called Hardcore illustrated two years ago, but this is no longer the norm and I don't think that the entire industry should be tainted by the behaviour of the few. Of course this should not be allowed to continue and anyone forcing people to perform acts on camera against their will should be prosecuted, but this is not the sort of porn I would either view or purchase. Banning pornography would not stop this from happening as women are exploited and harassed in many other industries besides porn, so perhaps better education and worker representation is the way forward. Earlier this year, Britain's fourth largest union launched a campaign to protect the rights of sex workers and an international union is currently working towards the decriminalisation of all aspects of sex work involving consenting adults. Surely, when an industry that employs so many women is seen to be working hard to stamp out unsavoury practices, this should be considered a good thing?
better education and worker representation is the way forward
The often heard feminist viewpoint that pornography is degrading to women was reinforced by Gloria Steinem writing in Ms magazine that the word 'Pornography', "begins with a root 'porno', meaning 'prostitution' or 'female captives', thus letting us know that the subject is not mutual love, or love at all, but domination and violence against women". Although this may have been the case when the first 'modern' porn was produced, over 500 years ago, anyone who has actually looked at the genre in the 21st century must surely realise that the linguistic root of the term is no longer relevant to what it describes. The dictionary defines pornography as a "creative activity (writing or pictures or films etc.) of no literary or artistic value other than to stimulate sexual desire", serving to differentiate it from erotica as an art form but at no point mentioning prostitution, domination or violence. Feminists for Free Expression counter the argument that pornography promotes violence against women by stating that, "Studies in the U.S., Europe and Asia find no link between the availability of sexual material and sex crimes. The only factor linked to rape rate is the number of young men living in a given area. When pornography became widely available in Europe, sexually violent crimes decreased or remained the same. Japan, with far more violent pornography than the U.S., has 2.4 rapes per 100,000 people compared with the U.S. 34.5 per 100,000". People who say that porn is responsible for the many violent attacks that take place on women every year are probably the same people who claim that rock music makes kids shoot their classmates. There are evil people in this world who are going to do these things whether or not porn exists and, in this modern 'blame culture' of ours, some people are just determined to find someone or something to take the flak for it.
Even without the claims of misogyny and violence, the subject of porn is faced with hoots of feminist derision. You may say it objectifies women, but just look at the poor men involved. Yes, that's right, you often can't see more than one part of their bodies! A feminist view on a related subject featured in The Observer newspaper's recent 'Body Uncovered' supplement: "Feminists increasingly make the argument that cosmetic surgery is a statement of empowerment, allowing women to stress the strength of their sexuality and enhance their idea of self". If this is the case, then surely enjoying pornographic images could be viewed in the same way. Don't look at the women in the images, look instead at yourself as a viewer of these images and you'll see the liberation. I feel that it is a mark of how society has progressed that women are no longer afraid to embrace their sexuality, and have a great many ways to do so. From the Ann Summers chain's Christmas advertising campaign for the Rampant Rabbit to hardcore star Jenna Jameson giving advice to UK men in a mainstream magazine, we have come a long way in a relatively short time.
I think that pornography is a rare product because it really needs no clever marketing campaign to sell itself. The majority of human beings have sex and most of those do so for recreational purposes; because they enjoy it. Pornography not only provides fuel for these desires but is handily available in a variety of 'flavours' to suit all tastes and is, within reason, guaranteed to do no more than excite. I find good quality pornography a turn on and other women all over the world also benefit from porn either by profiting from its sale or enjoying an improvement their sex lives, so why not seek to eliminate the bad parts rather than attack the industry as a whole? You can love it, as I do, or loathe it but please don't tell me what to think about porn. In return, I'll leave you to make up your own minds too.

As always, your comments are welcome and responses will be printed - EditorPeople spellbound by the “n word”Category: Don't Say The N Word!
A panel of blacks and the white-hating zealot Tim Wise had a discussion about the “n word” on CNN. I didn’t watch it, but can rest assured that it was as bad as anyone could imagine..
CNN, in a ratings hole, has waded deep into the trial of Zimmerman, who’s been charged in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin, adding a new 10 PM Anderson Cooper-hosted trial recap show — and yes, we to have heard the gag about the network changing its name to ZNN. Meanwhile, the TV ratings gift that is Paula Deen’s unsuccessful bid to manage fallout from a deposition acknowledgement she’d used the N word is the stuff Reporters Who Cover Television will be talking about for weeks to come.
Clever CNN combined these two biggest ratings-getters into one special, The N Word, which, maybe most notably, included a 15-minute segment mulling, N Word Vs Cracker: Which is Worse? That’s a nod to a Martin pal having testified he told her on the phone he was being followed by a “creepy-ass cracker” just before he was shot. Had that segment been moderated by rapper El-P, it would have wrapped much more quickly. He answered the question last night in one quick tweet: “probably the one you won’t spell out, you f— hacks. Just a guess.”
If CNN really wants to have a frank discussion they can always invite me back on to discuss the “r word.”
How to you think the “debate” featuring such a panel played out?
An all black panel? Nothing racist about that. Any discussion by them folks will be fair and nonracist.
That is quite a “panel” indeed. The only person missing, other than ‘Rev. Al’, is Shmuely Boteach himself. He undoubtedly would have lelped to “heal” the wounded egos of the assembled anti-White lynch mob of Negroes and Mulattoes, and the omnipresent Jewish instigator Wise.
Oh goodness, I am going to have to do like James, and back out of watching it.
There was another recent panel discussion, where it was Time Wise, two blacks, Matt Heimbach, and Jared Taylor. One of the websites posted it, but I can’t remember what the news channel was. Even that was hard to watch. The air time for each person was very unbalanced.
While we are on this topic, the discussion on the “N word” seems to come up a lot on “The View”. There are two black hosts on that show, and out of the white female hosts, notice how the youngest and most attractive is the conservative, Elizabeth Hasselbeck.
RamZPaul did a good video on this phenomenon, on how feminist women are ugly and women on the right are pretty. It was a good watch. He made that video right after the Amren conference, and compared what the women among the protestors looked like compared to the women attending the conference.
Anyways, I sometimes watch the discussions about the “N word” that get discussed on The View, and it is sometimes hard to watch. I have to hand it to Elizabeth Hasselbeck, for throwing a wrench into the discussion, and bringing up how “if whites can’t do it, then blacks shouldn’t be able to”.
But even she is hard to take sometimes. A few years ago, there was some story where she broke down on the show crying about how much she hates that word. With the recent events with Paula Deen, they discussed it again, and I have to admit that she did a little bit better.
Im glad you dont like to watch TV n general James, I cant even take the weather channel it seems these days.
What’s funny is…Blacks make themselves look weak, by pointing out that the ‘n’-term bothers them. The more they stereo-type Whites, the more back-lash they’re going to receive. So the behavior (itself) ought to acknowledge that Blacks are trying to stir up hatred in us, which consumes every moment of their day (other than boning like jack-rabbits & extorting money). (Had there been no liberal activism & media, the slavery-issue (etc.) would’ve died centuries ago. European-Americans don’t just sit around, thinking of ways to fling insults at others. We’re trying to preserve what’s right, while the opposition destroys.)
Andrew
(9:55 a.m.)
Gee, something tells me the diverse panel of 5 blacks and one Jew agreed that the N word is more insulting and demeaning than the C word. After all, we are just white people, the most vile people in all of world history and hurling racial epithets at us is just karmic comeuppance.
I think more of us are spellbound by the R word.
It’s an evil spell which MUST be broken.
I like quite a few black folks, and a lot of them don’t care for n******, YES there is a difference.
I’m only spellbound by the F word: Fired.Giro Men's Aeon Helmet

0:32We’ve read through the minutes of Monday night’s Fans Forum meeting a couple of times, and there’s some decent information there, and it’s very good these meetings are being held, because in the long term they will definitely improve communication between the fans and the club – there’s little doubt about that.
Mike Ashley – keeping NCJ media ban in place
Here are the various questions that were asked on the ongoing NCJ Media Ban and some ancillary comments added at the meeting – and those are followed by the Board’s the answer:
===========
“Will the club lift the ban on NCJ Media?”
“Will you implement a lifting of the ban on NCJ Media starting next season? The intransigence is a huge distraction and is detrimental to both parties.”
“The Chronicle is damaging the public’s perception of the club with its coverage.”
“It is mentally ingrained in some people to believe what they read in the local media.”
Answer:The club confirmed its position will remain unchanged. Decisions made by the board are not – and will not be – influenced by media coverage, however negative.
===========
And there have been moves by some fan organizations to (try to) persuade people with season tickets to ditch them in protest of the running of the club, but as we expected, that’s having little to no effect.
We always think it’s a difficult task to persuade Geordie supporters to stop going to the games – however bad we are doing, and certainly we’ve done very poorly this year.
===========
“How many season ticket holders have not renewed for next season?”
Answer: The board stated that approximately six per cent of season ticket holders had not renewed to-date; similar levels to previous seasons.
===========
We hope to hear some news on new signings soon, very soon in fact.

On santon, disagree a bit
He had a great first full season when he eventually broke through but had been terribly out of form before we signed him and had gone from rated under Mourinho but eventually getting loaned out to AC Cesena where he only played 11 games
Maybe he’s just not that great of a defender?
Awful penalties from Cordoza and Rodriguez

Think he’s blown his top a few times but why shouldn’t he?
Fantastic win ratio for them got them playing well, bought through a couple of youngsters found a great way to get performances out Eriksen and all he done was face question after question about when he was getting sacked
4 ochytoon // May 14, 2014 at 10:40 PM
Not a fan of reposts but you know what Eds like with these threads haha. Anyway, I just wanted to give my opinion on the current state of the club.
The boards lack of ambition is disgusting. We know the potential the squad has (maybe that should read had) and European qualification is within our reach. I am convinced that Mike Ashley owns us for the sole reason of promoting his business, the money which he has made from us is an added bonus.
The way in which he masks his true intentions is through the use of Alan Pardew. This man would certainly have a far more successful career in PR than he ever has or will in football management. His constant lowering of expectations is an insult to our collective intelligence and I’m surprised anyone still stands by him in all honesty. I actually gave him until this season to win me over but the negative football (worst I’ve seen us play in my 20 years as a Toon fan) he’s enforced on us is a disgrace to our tradition. He knew he was never in any danger of losing his job as Ashley has no intention of firing someone who tows the party line, taking the flack for him, and hiring someone he has never worked with before. Even if Ashley was to do the unexpected and replace him, he’d most likely bring in a Wise/Kinnear-esque manager or promote one of the backroom staff, likely Beardsley, to the role.
Whilst I have attacked both Ashley and Pardew for their role in the demise of our club, we need to recognize the worst enemy of Newcastle United Football Club; Us.
We are quite possibly the least functional, organised, and united fans in the country. Its not a question of which fans group should we follow, since most of us are divided on the present and future of our club anyway! Unfortunately, there will always be a core of fans who are happy to go to St, James’ week in, week out, and watch the utter dross served to them by the Ashley regime. In addition to this, we now have fans who are more concerned with the financial side of the club and somehow are overjoyed that we’re one of two clubs in the Premier League (more likely all of English football) who run a profit season after season. At what point did football become about enjoying the accounts? I’m not denying that its admirable but we are nothing like Arsenal, who at least invest in their squad and youth development every summer.
Finding a common goal between us Newcastle fans is going to be incredibly difficult, if not impossible. The current fan groups are failing to represent us and our ambitions for the team. We need a new, proactive fan group which is able to effectively organize us fans into a coalition of sorts. We’re never going to agree on everything but if everyone is at least in the same group, with fair representation of everyone’s views, at least we will make some progress. Whether that’s, the removal of Pardew and Ashley through means of popular protest, or the backing of the team to turn St. James back into the stadium it was, remains to be seen. However, before we achieve any of this, we need to form a new fans group capable of galvanizing and uniting us.

He just doesn’t conduct himself in a professional enough way for me. For some reason, he reminds me of Kinnear.
No doubt he’s done a better job than AVB but I still have doubts over his tactical ability.

Lol fair play, wasn’t saying i wanted him here just that he was handling himself well on the panel for the Europa league match
And still think many managers, especially given his inexperience and media focus, would shows signs of cracking if after weeks if not months of constant questioning from the media over there future the board hadn’t decided to release a statement

The worrying bit from the minutes for me was the fact they hadn’t yet decided an objective for next season
Goes back to what i was saying to TDS a few weeks back, the club chop and change there targets to how things are currently going
There’s no long term targets or progression imo
10 GeordieTwo // May 14, 2014 at 10:50 PM
Santon may as well leave us tads. Pardew has ruined him now along with so many others. I’ve seen dogs bollocks do a better job with young players. Dummett is headed the same way. As is Adam Campbell.

Unfortunately for his patsy Pardew the fans anger will be vented at him next season as getting at him seems the only way to get at Mashers, normally I would say that is a bit out of order, but seeing as Pardew is totally complicit in the whole set up he deserves everything he gets, I can see where pundits are coming from saying he is doing a good job as his hands are tied but they have to realise he is complicit in having them tied, I can also see that if John Ando says too much that he will find himself banned from the stadium and his cushy little number on x amount of K a year on BBC radio will dry up.

Whats the point. They feel like they’ve reduced our expectations for the club enough. There’s definitely enough fans who agree with the statement anyway.

I have been saying it for awhile now that this five year plan was being made up as it went along, JfK was never meant to be part of it, finishing fifth certainly wasn’t, the only objective is to stay in the PL and assess window to window.

I definitely agree that Lee Ryder of the Chronicle is hopeless like. I follow him on twitter and he clearly doesn’t get football at all.
For example when Stoke scored that fluke goal which was a cross that sneaked in he called it a wonder goal. He also thought Man City might slip even with Liverpool drawing with Palace and i had to point out to him that City had Villa and West Ham at home and only needed a draw. his next tweet was about how Liverpool had no chance haha.

PORTRAIT OF A WINNER
Endeavors by Winner bring jobs to the area
By Jennifer Hall
Herald Staff Writer
After a period of buying a variety of buildings and properties throughout Mercer County, Sharon businessman James E. Winner Jr. has many projects in the works with a variety of completion dates.
From the Veterans' Walkway next to The Winner to the Walk of Fame planned to accompany the Halls of Fame, Winner sees himself as a visionary.
``I typically think two, three, four years ahead,'' Winner said. ``The short term escapes me a little, but it's the visions for the future that I map out.''
A future project that Winner is looking at is a charter school, which is what he planned if he had been the winning bidder for Sacred Heart School in Sharon.
He served on Team Pa. headed by Gov. Tom Ridge that looked at the overall economic development of the state and discussed education.
``Where education today is lacking is in preparing people for the industrial jobs, where they are now required to be computer savvy because all of the mills are high-tech,'' Winner said, adding that would be his goal with a charter school.
Winner owns almost 30 properties throughout the Shenango Valley, with the biggest concentration of those being in Sharon. He has big plans for all of the buildings but said those plans take time.
Eventually he will buy land from the city of Sharon after it demolishes the building that houses Ideal Bakery, Szabo's Jewelry and Reliable Insurance. Winner plans to build a three-story office in the spot to complement The Winner.
While properties such as Tara in Clark are just right the way they are, Winner said his other projects should be on the fast track to completion. But he did say many of the properties he purchased were in worse shape than he and construction people first expected.
The chairman of Sharon-based Winner International, the holding company for a number of Winner enterprises, originally purchased The Winner, where Winner International and his off-price clothing store are located, because he had hopes for improving the downtown.
Winner said he has bought businesses such as Ultimate Technologies Inc. to keep the job base in the Shenango Valley. He is expanding what is now called Winner Steel.

Show MoreToday, Tuesday 31 January, John Mann, Labour's MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire and a vociferous backbencher, tabled eight Presentation Bills in Parliament, proposing to relocate the headquarters of the following government departments to cities outside of London.
· Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to Bristol
· Department for Business, Education and Skills to Sheffield
· Department for Transport to Birmingham
· Department for Culture, Media and Sport to Manchester
· Department for Education to Nottingham
· Department for International Development to Newcastle
· Department for Work and Pensions to Leeds
· Department for Communities and Local Government to Liverpool
He says:
This is part of twenty alternative budget deficit proposals I am making in Parliament today as an alternative to the Conservatives' cuts in front line services.
By spreading department headquarters around the United Kingdom, the Government can begin levelling a playing field which is currently heavily weighted in favour of London and the south east.
Doing so will remove pressure from the overheated London economy, save money currently spent paying employees a London allowance, bring jobs to areas hardest hit by the recession, and provide the Government with a more rounded perspective when creating policies.
And so say all of us.
And, through its actions, so does?).

Finding a needle in a chemical haystack
By combining the nanometre spatial resolution of atomic force microscopy with the label-free material characterizing power of Raman spectroscopy, researchers at Imperial College London, UK, are able to differentiate between various single-walled carbon nanotubes and amorphous carbon contamination in a prepared mixture. This powerful technique can be applied to probe the heterogeneity of materials at the nanometre scale, providing new insights into complex materials such as engineered nanocomposites, self-organized macromolecular structures and biomaterials.
Currently, atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides nanometre resolution images of the topography of nanostructured materials, but no chemical information about the materials. Raman scattering gives specific chemical information, but only at the micrometre scale. However, by merging the two techniques together it is possible to obtain the best of both worlds and achieve chemical imaging of materials at the nanometre scale.
Label-free chemical imaging
This combined approach is called tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS), which is based on the localized surface enhanced Raman scattering effect at the apex of a gold coated AFM tip. The apex of the AFM tip acts as a single gold nanoparticle, providing localized enhancement of the Raman signal, which is then scanned across the sample to build chemical images with spatial resolution well beyond the diffraction limit of visible light.
This method was applied to look at a mixture of bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes with different diameters and chirality. Due to the small difference in the size of the carbon nanotubes and their close proximity to each other, it was not possible to localize the distribution of the various types and diameters using standard confocal Raman microscopy or AFM alone.
Using the scanning TERS method, which provides a spatial resolution of 14 nm, the team revealed that the prepared mixture of carbon nanotubes obtained from different manufacturers does not form bundles after the mixing process. In addition, the group found that within the bundle of carbon nanotubes from the one manufacturer were carbon nanotubes of different diameters. Nanosized amorphous carbon contaminant was also detected using this method.
The researchers presented their work in the journal Nanotechnology.

Arthropods Facts
Arthropods are air-breathing invertebrate animals which have paired jointed legs, exoskeleton and a segmented body. Arthropods are generally classified into four classes:
1. Insects (Includes Ants, butterfly, grasshopper, cockroaches etc. Over 1 million known species)
2. Crustacea (Includes shrimp, lobster, crab etc. Over 44 thousand known species
3. Myriapoda (Includes Millipede, Centipede etc. )
4. Arachnida (Includes scorpion, spider, mite, etc. Over 65 thousand known species)
Arthropods are found everywhere on land, sea and air.
75% of the known living things on earth are Arthropods, having more than 1 million species on this earth.
Facts About Insects for Kids
Insects are air-breathing invertebrate animals that are categorized by their three main body parts (called the head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of legs and a pair of antennae on their head. With more than a million species, insects are almost half of all living things on this earth.
Characteristics of Insects
Insects have the following distinctive characteristics that put them in the class of insects:
- Insects posses a hard outer covering called exoskeleton instead of backbone and spines and thus are classified as invertebrates.
- Insects body can be divided into three main parts called the head, thorax and abdomen.
- Insects have six jointed legs.
- Insects live on both land and in water.
- Insects usually have an antennae that helps in sensing touch, hear, taste and smell
- Insects are cold blooded.
- Insects usually lays eggs and sometimes give birth to live young ones.
- Insects usually have four wings to fly.

Buttonmashing Goodness
A solid design and really fun for a couple minutes... and then it's just a bit of a repetitive grind.
Maybe add combos? More types of moves, or just varied animations? Different enemies requiring more strategy?
Not a bad start, but it could be more. Go Bunny.
Rated 3 / 5 stars
6/10
Good Concept, but this game is just a buttonmashing. You really should reduce the Mana gauge or make the refilling harder, because i can either dash through multiple enemies, recover a little, and dash'em again, or use s button a lot, especially at invisible type of character, which will be always within the reach of S attack, and they are easy to defeat. This game needs serious work, but now, it's just not bad.
Rated 3.5 / 5 stars
Funky
Funky little game bro, I'd have to agree with SpacerPrime though (2 reviews down) about the collision detection. And maybe a little faster movement with your character as he seems to move quite slow. Other than that, loved the art and animation. Peace!
Rated 4 / 5 stars
Awesome!
The only thing that I dislike is that you have what appears to be a pretty good reach when you attack, but the only part of the weapon that hits is what isn't in the motion blur section so hitting enemies means you pretty much have to be right on top of them to make sure you hit and when there are the hordes and hordes of enemies it means you start to get hit a lot..My votes go for the first 10 seconds of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'

The intro to Eric Claptons Layla
The guitar riff in Dire Straits Money For Nothing (0.34 - 0.49)
Fleetwood Mac - Big Love (1.24 - 2.05)
Nah.
Absolutely anything from Reign Of Blood by Slayer - that's them at their peak. Riffs, solos, whatever.
I listen to lots of metal, not sure anything beats this.
FACT?
Loads, but Lenny Kravitz's Mama Said has to be up there with my favourites. Almost anything by Audioslave or Rage Against The Machine - although I have to say that Tom Morello is great at riffs, but crap at solos.

Despite previous post...
Riff - anything from Damaged by Black Flag - just stupid guitar abuse!
Solo - anything from Damaged by Black Flag - just stupid guitar abuse!
Some of the Pixies' riffs must be up there, and Hendrix knew what to do with a solo.
Whisky in the jar, Thin Lizzy

Creek 5350 Amp - Creek Evo 2 CDP - Squeezebox Touch - Epos Elan 30 speakers - various Van Damme & Mark Grant cables
Riff: Icky Thump - White Stripes
That is DocG, with a "c".
There are so many great riffs/licks to choose from, but a current favourite is from 7:44 onwards on Loan Me A Dime by Boz Scaggs, with the great Duane Allman on axe duty....a slow, miserable build up through the song and then at 7:44 they just give him the nod and let him fly, with the rest of the Muscle Shoals house band in hot pursuit. Not everyone's cup of tea, but there's no debying the boy could play. Gotta be worth a listen !
Has to be Dave Gilmour at the end of "Comfortably Numb".
I've heard "better", but watching him perform it - through a pair of binoculars! - standing on top of The Wall at Earls Court in 1980 was awesome.
No mention of Johnny Marr? (handsome devil, how soon is now, hand in glove) yes I know he comes across as quite pretentious but crikey he knows how to pick (not strum) strings.
if you actually watch his technique the man is a genius I rate him as one of the best along with Lindsay Buckingham!
Rega Elicit R, Apollo R/DAC, RP6, Kudos X2
In descending order Dave Gilmour - Comfortably numb - On the Turning Away - High Hopes
Mind you Doyle Bramhall II does a pretty good solo in the middle of Dogs on Roger Waters In The Flesh Tour
Finally Dave Gilmour in the middle of Sam Brown's This Feeling although this is not technically a solo as Sam Brown is still singing..... a bit.
Cortez the Killer Neil Young
As soon as I hear the opening I get all tingly, have been suffering this for years !
Should also add Sister Morphine The Rolling Stones, especially after a few, fabulous soundstage, big fuzzy ball of sound, marvellous.
BEST RIFFS:
Anything off the first 2 Stooges albums, Ron Asheton was the business, nothing comes near.
BEST SOLOS:
A lot of Neil Young's stuff
Radiohead - Just The solo at the end is magnificent, and what a video.
The Ruts - Savage Circle 1.24 - 2.21 Who said Punk bands couldn't play their instruments?
And I hate to say it, but, Gilmour at the end of Another Brick In The
Little River Band live 1977- Days On The Road.Love the bass intro to this song.Great Aussie band of the past
Forgot AC/DC for riffs, and Angus for solos.

AB guest blogging for Michael Ruhlman. Just plain funny....
One of the comments by Homer Fink stated.. funniest thing I have read this year.
- re: byteme55
Um.......
And they say there is no Devil.
- re: byteme55
I have never gotten over this hideous concoction I sent the Bourdain "tearing the FN a new one Blog" to several of my fellow culinary pals ( Chef 's I know from culinary school) and they absolutely loved it and then I directed them to the kwanzaa cake and most comments about it in return were, " Was this some kind of april fools day show" or "Why is this woman on FN?" and the best from my pastry chef friend Rachel "This woman is evil and MUST be stopped!!!" she feared for the lives of other innocent pastry that may come near her boney witch like claws
The nightmare didnt stop in that episode, did anyone remember her "Christmas Crecent Ring" made with those crecent rolls from the can!!!.........
Thanks for the link. Some of the imagery is spot-on and hilarious.
Ruhlman has a fine website and interesting blog. For those who are uninitiated, his series of books "Making of a Chef," "Soul of a Chef" and "Reach of a Chef" are well-written, give an intimate sense of the restaurant kitchen and training at the CIA, and have some laugh-out-loud anecdotes.
He really hit the nail on the head with "Ace of Cakes." I have watched several episodes and while his creations are pure eye candy, I always ask myself if there is more than just a pretty facade.
Do the cakes taste good? Who knows? They never show anyone actually eating the cake and raving about how good it is. Once the knife goes into the cake, the show is over, so there better be something else there.
- re: Seth Chadwick
- re: Seth Chadwick
I'm from Baltimore and word on the street is that the cakes are also quite tasty. I haven't had one, so I can't comment. I will say that I find it a very hard to believe that they'd taste any good since often those super-duper decorated cakes are quite dense (to support the layers of icing and whatnot) and made days in advance (because the decorating takes so long). Plus, in my opinion, fondant and all those other technically-edible-sugar-concoctions they use to decorate just don't taste good, period. All tolled, I seriously can't imagine it's a cake actually worth eating.
But like I said, word on the street is, they're good.

To combat insomnia that can trigger depression or sickness, the new SSLM panels are made up of LEDs that can transition between blue, white and red. The colors correspond to different cycles of sleep that we're used to on Earth. In 2001, NASA reported that nearly 50% of crews on space missions took sleeping pills to help them fall asleep.
NASA plans to test the new lighting in 2016 at a budget of nearly $11.2 million.

The research, published today in EMBO Molecular Medicine, shows that blocking the so-called Hedgehog-GLI pathway can prevent the growth of tumours, metastatic lesions and cancer stem cells, the cells thought to lie at the root of cancer growth.
Colon cancer often begins in a treatable form when it is confined to the bowel wall, but in frequent cases it can develop to an incurable metastatic stage. A Geneva-based research team has discovered the essential role played by HH-GLI in the progression of colon cancer to these late and incurable stages. liver."
This research opens the possibility of new anti-cancer therapies, specifically the use of RNA interference and of Cyclopamine, a plant product known to block Hedgehog pathway activity. This and other similar molecules can now be considered for future research as a treatment for terminal patients with metastatic disease and to fight resurgent forms of the disease.
."
Using these genetic or pharmacologic methods to block HH-GLI activity also prevents cancer stem cell self-renewal. Using a new in vivo assay to test the participation of cancer stem cells in a growing tumour, the research team demonstrated the essential role of this pathway for the maintenance and survival of cancer stem cells.
"This work firmly establishes the critical action of HH-GLI in human colon cancer cells, providing the platform for preclinical and future clinical work." concluded Ruiz i Altaba. "The finding that a blockade of HH-GLI for a relatively short period was sufficient to eliminate the tumour and prevent recurrence, without negatively affecting the health of the mice, opens the possibility for the use of a therapeutic window to eradicate the tumour without major side effects.".
• Navigating the required steps. Even the public cloud model is never one-size-fits-all. A successful cloud initiative requires several best practice steps, which occur in three phases:
Plan, including aligning the business and architecture strategies, planning and design, and security.
Build, including staging, testing, and implementing solutions and systems integration.
Manage, including network assurance, remote monitoring/diagnostics/alerts, optimization, and support.
• Establishing the business justification. Calculate the projected and actual ROI from cloud project expenses for equipment and services.
It’s very rare for any IT organization to already have all the in-house expertise and experience that’s required for a cloud project. This will eventually happen, but IT organizations can fast-track their cloud initiatives by partnering with a company that understands the cloud journey.
Cisco Services has a proven methodology for implementing private clouds that can help ensure your agency makes a smooth and effective transition to cloud. It starts with the Cisco Domain TenSM discussion to identify where you need to focus among ten crucial areas:
Cisco Cloud Enablement Services professionals and Cisco Certified Partners can guide you through any, or all, of the plan, build, and manage steps. They can help you integrate the entire cloud solution, including reducing the complexity of security.
New cloud platforms are rapidly transforming government IT—just as client/server and mainframe/terminal platforms did in decades past.
If you embark on the cloud journey, you’re committing to an exciting and long-term opportunity. And when you step out your door to head to work each day, you’ll be an agent of change for your organization and your career.
I’m curious, what do you see as the biggest challenges to a government entity adopting a cloud model?

There are two key factors of this test:
- You may not claim an exemption for a dependent, unless the person is a US citizen, resident alien, national, or a resident of Canada or Mexico for at least part of the tax year.
- If you are a US citizen or national who has legally adopted a child who is not a US citizen, resident alien, or national, this test is met if the dependent lived in your household for the whole tax year.
Please also note that foreign students who stay in your household as part of an international education exchange program would not qualify as dependents.As we sat around the family’s Thanksgiving table, our bellies full of turkey, mashed potatoes, and candied yams, we reminisce of the family traditions established years ago. Then it happens. The family album gets pulled off the shelf. Not our personal family album, but the new book by Sean Maher titled My Little Dysfunctional Family Album.
Indiscreet chuckles echo in the dining room as each page is turned, because in some way we can relate to this family. The old-timey pictures remind us of the pictures we have of our own parents, uncles, aunts, and grandparents back when black-and-white photography was the best technology around.
Sure, the pictures are familiar, but did grandpa really think that? You know what, maybe he did. Each photo is captioned with not exactly the proper thing to be thinking, especially in those days. But in reality, that thought just might be what was going on behind grandma’s horn-rimmed glasses.
The classic basketball team photo is captioned with the phrase, “Winners don’t need to worry about things like sportsmanship.” In my own family album, I am reminded of a similar photo and that is exactly what the team was thinking as they took home the championship trophy.
Then there is the photo of a young boy with the caption “Giving in to peer pressure is just an opportunity to be cool.” We all know that is a true statement. And didn’t we all want to be cool? Why did our parents tell us differently? They probably didn’t want us to be as cool as they thought they were.
The five-inch square padded book contains sixty old-fashioned photos with hilarious captions on every page. Author Sean Maher has captured the sentiments of many dysfunctional families. This will be a family album to be cherished and read over and over. Who knows, you may just find a member of your own family characterized perfectly within the pages of My Little Dysfunctional Family Album.Powered by Sidelines2

that they have a funny rules (very-very strict rules).
The rules is they may use anyones property without asking because they said it was Allah's. They can only speak, touch, and look at others face if they were one society with them!
The other rules is they don't believe in educational science that teachers gave to them. Examples: Gravitation in earth is not a physically matter, but it's a matter that we can not answer (and search for answer) for only Allah knows it.
My question is: Is this society in Allahs way. This society is really disturbing us. So pleas kindly answer and reply.
Praise be to Allaah.
According to what was said in the question, this is a weird group whose ideas, beliefs and conduct are misguided. It is strange that you say they have strict rules, but they are so lenient with regard to other peoples property and overstep the limits by using peoples things without their permission. This is Zulm (wrongdoing, oppression), and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress men and rebel in the earth without justification; for such there will be a painful torment [al-Shooraa 42:42]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The whole Muslim is sacred to another Muslim: his blood, his property and his honour (Narrated by Muslim, 4650). And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: It is not permissible for a man to take any of his brothers property except with his agreement (narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 20180).
The Creator and Lord of wealth is the One Who has forbidden the violation of the wealth which He has bestowed on people in this world and given them permission to possess it. So how can these people accept this corrupt justification for going against the rulings of Allaah? The fact that their deviation is extreme is abundantly clear from the fact that they do not touch or speak to anyone who is not a member of their group. I wonder how they can live among people if they are not even allowed to look at others!
Moreover, they have forbidden looking at the heavens and earth and finding out what Allaah has created in them, by forbidding scientific research and finding answers to questions about natural phenomena. But Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
Say: Travel in the land and see how (Allaah) originated the creation, and then Allaah will bring forth the creation of the Hereafter (i.e. resurrection after death). Verily, Allaah is Able to do all things [al-Ankaboot 28:20]
Say: Behold all that is in the heavens and the earth [Yoonus 10:101]
Do they not look at the camels, how they are created? And at the heaven, how it is raised? And at the mountains, how they are rooted (and fixed firm)? And at the earth, how it is outspread? [al-Ghaashiyah 88:17-20]
And there are other texts which indicate that we should ponder the universe and find out about what Allaah has created.
Ideas such as those promoted by these people do not find acceptance except in an ignorant society and among foolish and simple-minded people who do not know the basics of Islam. We have to advise this misguided group and call them to the truth, whilst warning people against their falsehood. May Allaah protect us and you from confusion, innovation and misguidance. And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight path.Tell State Farm: Stop funding voter suppression
We wrote State Farm to let them know that more than 100,000 ColorOfChange members have asked that they disassociate themselves from ALEC. We made sure State Farm knew that through their membership in ALEC, they supported racially-discriminatory voter ID laws that have the potential to disenfranchise over 5 million people in the upcoming elections.
After hearing that information, companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's and even Wal-Mart all decided to end their relationships with ALEC. But despite correspondence including letters and telephone conversations, we can't get State Farm's management to give us a commitment that they'll leave ALEC. They need to know that people like you want them to do the right thing.
Will you help us hold State Farm accountable for supporting voter suppression? Please take a moment to call State Farm and demand that they stop supporting ALEC.Campus Manor Studio Apartments is a small complex just off campus offering 18 fully furnished single occupancy studio units.

2005-06-12 14:07:59 I've lived here for a year now and found the manager to be a very nice person. The main plusses are living alone and being right off campus. You really can't beat that combination in my book. —NiareeHopelian
2006-05-02 10:37:22 I also lived here a year without any problems. The location is the best (plus covered parking, not often offered in this area.) The manager lives on site, so is easy to get ahold of—very good at responding to notes. —EliSenior
2008-04-22 21:35:37 what is the current rent for the 08/09 year? —goosey
2008-05-03 20:49:55 I've lived her for almost two years, and I think it's a great place to live. Quiet, you don't have to worry about buying furniture except for maybe a desk and chair, parking, coin-op laundry, an apartment manager who actually enforces the rules and cares about making improvements to the complex - everything a studious student who likes her privacy wants. —Ruthann
2009-01-17 21:02:16 Whats the square footage and lighting situation? —alyssap
2009-04-08 02:48:02 what is the rent for current year 09/10? —ashna.singh
2009-04-14 21:30:28 Is this complex quiet? —nataliesadler
2009-04-26 15:22:45 Do the rooms have full kitchens? —BrianLi
2009-04-26 15:31:55 (By which I mean, a stove top and an an oven) —BrianLi
2009-05-13 14:42:55 To Allysap: It's 400 square feet (200 for bedroom/living room, 200 for bath & kitchen). The lighting is more than sufficient/ample. To Ashna.Singh: Rent for upcoming academic year (09/10): $815 for new tenants, with $800 deposit. To Nataliesadler: Yes, the apt complex is quiet. Everything that a good, studious undergrad/grad student could possibly want. To BrianLi: Yes, every apt comes with a fully equipped kitchen: stove top, oven, dishwasher, microwave, refrigerator, and kitchen sink.
2009-05-13 14:59:18 I've been living for two academic quarters in this apartment complex. It's been great so far. I can find no major cause for complaint. On the manager: Quite possibly, the best apartment manager one can encounter in one's life. Very prompt at fixing things, very responsive to notes you leave on his mailbox; in general, he is a very friendly and informative person. —EddieH
2009-05-16 23:34:41 It sounds like a pretty sweet place — right next to campus and everything. does it get lonely at all? if so how do you cope? :P just wondering! —junniperlee
2009-05-30 21:05:22 Does anyone have any photographs of the inside of these apartments? —nataliesadler
2009-10-03 22:46:43 junniperlee: As a third year transfer moving into a studio, in a complex that already has a reputation for being quiet, I've definitely had some lonely moments. But I think it's worth it, considering how uncertain it can be when it comes to finding good roommates. The positives of living alone outweigh the negatives tenfold!
Also, if you're more of a board games and movie nights kind of person, as opposed to beer pong and crowds, Campus Manor is the perfect place for you :) —SJung
2009-10-28 18:25:12 I thought I'd put up a new comment. I moved in here in early August and I love it. It is nice and quiet. Only occasionally do I hear music or a television from a neighbor and that's easily drowned out with a fan. Another thing, too, the space is plentiful for one person! It's perfect. :-)
And, I love the curtains, SJung! I'm thinking of doing the same thing! —nataliesadler
2009-11-02 15:56:10 hey - so this might be a dumb question but...do you HAVE to get the apartment furnished? I've lived in greystone the last two years (this year will be the third) but now all my roomies are graduating and I'm staying a fifth year so I wanna find some place that's simple for one person and close to campus. this sounds great but I already have couches and a bed and tables and stuff so does anyone know if I can get an empty apartment???
also, I've been used to having my own washer and dryer in my apartment complex at greystone - how difficult, inconvenient, and/or expensive is it to do laundry there??? —brie311
2009-12-03 05:28:38 To brie311: Hi there! To answer your questions on doing laundry, I've been doing mine for a year now in the shared laundry room located on the ground floor. I have no major cause for complaint. The cost is $1 each time you operate the washer or dryer (must be paid in quarters since the machines use coin slots). The only drawback that I can think of is, you have to remove your laundry promptly once you're done. It is, after all, a shared facility and other tenants may be waiting to use the machines. It takes about an hour to do laundry for me: 15 minutes for washer and 45 minutes for dryer. Hope this information helps! —EddieH
2010-01-22 15:05:40 Can anyone post more pictures? I want to see the other part of the studio. It seems so nice at the entrance :D —iciel
2010-03-25 15:26:55-03-25 15:35:19-04-03 09:01:19 For me, it's about $30/month for gas and electricity charges. The manager takes care of the rest (water, hot water, garbage removal). —EddieH
2010-04-15 19:40:00 Can anyone tell me how long have you waited for before you get in? I filled out the form in March and haven't hear any thing back yet... —kay701112
- I haven't lived there, so I can't comment on normal wait times, but for anything where you're applying to get in, it's worth following up to express your continued interest. Touch bases, let them know how interest you are, and it'll be easy to find out what kind of wait you're looking at. —TomGarberson
2010-04-18 10:24:03 Thanks! I did ask the manager one week after I applied. He told me I have a room. but from then on, I have't hear anything from him... I'll ask again anyways. Thank you! —kay701112
2011-05-30 14:38:43 I have lived here for over a year and it has worked extremely well for me: it is SAFE, CLEAN, and across the street from school!!! The manager has always helped me with anything I needed - he shows up after one phone call or one note (that can be conveniently dropped into the mail slot on his door, here on site) and takes care of whatever needs to be done. In sum: EXCELLENT LOCATION and A GOOD MANAGER. —Adri
2011-06-06 16:52:06 Hello. Can anyone please tell me what the office hours are? I'm not in Davis and need to contact the manager but haven't been lucky. Is there any email adress for that purpose? Thanks —MagdalenaB
2011-07-14 06:41:58 Is there an email address of the manager for contact? —YanruLu
2011-09-28 15:59:47 @YanruLu: Tim the manager doesn't have a cell phone, doesn't use the Internet (so no email address), and is out of his apartment for much of the day. So the best way to contact him would be to leave him a voicemail through the 530-number. And because he's out a lot, there aren't any office hours—I'd recommend calling ahead and scheduling something with him.
@Kay70112: Like TomGarberson said, if you filled out a form you should definitely follow up with a phone call and voicemail.
**I honestly think it's the best apartment complex in Davis, so keep calling, leaving voicemails, and trying! Tim emphasizes that there be a studious atmosphere, he is quick to respond to requests, and is one of the best people I've met in Davis. If you're afraid of having to deal with shady apartment managers, leave that worry behind with Tim. I sound like a walking ad but I really enjoyed my time at Campus Manor. I just moved out after a two-year stay and I miss living there so much. It's right between campus and downtown, next door to at least six different food options, and a quiet place to have to yourself.i —SJung
2012-01-09 22:30:09 Can anyone tell me about their experience getting a deposit back? I don't want to get stuck with a manager that unfairly takes your deposit,or a huge chunk of it. Thanks. —maryh
2012-02-22 18:45:18 Hello! Are there any studios left to lease starting in Fall 2012? Also wondering if there are any left for the summer, and if so, if it's possible to begin renting in the summer and then stay in the same room for the Fall? I've tried both the numbers provided on this page, but am still awaiting a response. Are there any other ways to contact Tim the manager? Besides the faxing option, I guess continuing to call and leave messages is best. It doesn't sound like I'd be likely to find him if I tried to visit during the day. I'd appreciate any suggestions. Thanks! :) —LookingForAStudio
2012-02-24 17:25:45 @ LookingForAStudio: I'm a current resident here and I'm graduating/moving out after this quarter. I would love to find someone to take over starting Spring, but if you're interested in moving in during the summer that'd be great too! Shoot me an email at aewu@ucdavis.edu and we can chat =) Btw, unless he's changed his policy, people who move in during summer get priority on rooms for fall. You may or may not end up in the same room. —AngieWu
2012-12-14 22:43:05 I'm moving out in the next few days and my apartment will be available to lease for the winter quarter. Not to sound like a broken record, but it really is a nice place to live. Quiet, extremely close to campus and downtown, and Tim (the landlord) is great. Contact me at camoen@ucdavis.edu if you're interested. —CMoen
2013-01-08 17:36:17 I'm looking to rent a studio here starting from September 2013 to June 2014, if that's possible. What is the availability on the studios here? —YaoSaephan
2013-06-04 16:36:17 I'm looking to sublease my unit for July and August, price is negotiable and it's possible to renew in September! just email me ahaberman@ucdavis.edu —Haberman
2014-01-09 10:23:50 So, I have been living in these apartments for a full quarter now, and I understand that I had a quite rapid move in ( had issues with my previous roommate) but there are some things that I wish the manager had mentioned to me prior to move in.
-No nails in walls (only tacks) -Can't let water go above switch if you are taking a bath -In order to get anything done by the manager he needs you to drop off a paper order (no email and can call but he rarely answers and has to get back to you) -The first couple months the manager "checks on" you pretty often which is kinda annoying.
Even through all of this I do like the place. As long as you are good on your own this place is actually pretty nice, just gotta make sure you have friends. If you have good ones who don't mind the slight shabbiness that this place has in spades then it is nice. The location is beyond convenient, I love being able to go anywhere downtown or on campus in a matter of minutes. That being said I am gonna try to find an apartment that has W/D in room, just something that I find necessary enough to merit a move —PhilipDorin
2014-09-09 18:41:25 I thought this place was great at first. Nice location, semi-ok rent, kind of run down but mostly fine. Not so. The manager gets NOTHING done, ever, and is never around to contact. During the summer, the AC kept emitting noxious fumes that made people sick and he avoided addressing the problem, which is NOT okay when you run a place like this. The parking garage is covered but SKETCHY. When I left for the summer and came back with a subleaser, he'd moved all of his own things into MY LEASED apartment and he said that he already had someone lined up and "he thought I'd moved out already", not to mention that the place was MINE to lease through nearly the end of August. Talk about a CON ARTIST. Who knows how long this guy has been taking students' rent and ALSO subleasing their places. Needless to say, I got NONE of my deposit back. DO NOT MOVE HERE, SUPER SKETCHY. Pay the extra $$$ and move into a LEGIT and ESTABLISHED one bedroom somewhere ELSE. —jillcaesar
2014-09-18 18:58:56
I have lived at Campus Manor since 2011 and do not see myself moving anytime soon. This is honestly the best complex I have stayed in. It is in a prime spot, located right across from UC Davis and has all of downtown behind it (which is nice because you can walk everywhere and avoid downtown parking). I especially appreciate how quiet the complex is—definitely helped during exam time. If studying at home isn't your thing, the Shields Library is a 5 minute walk from the complex.
The landlord is easy to reach by phone or if you leave a note in his box. He has always returned my phone calls and taken care of any problems that have arisen. He is a great landlord and a nice guy.
As to the previous posts, I have never had any problems with my AC...and I use it a LOT during the summer. The covered parking is also beneficial during all seasons because it keeps your car cool in the summer and windows ice-free in the winter. I do not know what the person means by "sketchy" parking garage. The landlord does have tools and boxes in the garage...but isn't that what a garage is for?
I have no complaints about the landlord or the complex and love living here. —-K
2015-02-15 19:06:41 I moved in about 5 months ago and while my stay has been okay, I'll definitely be moving out next year. The apartment had a lot of problem when I moved in (the stove and AC were broken. In fact, the entire front of the AC fell off when I first tried to use it...) I also had the electricity go out in half of my apartment for a good month (problem spontaneously resolved itself.) The apartment is in the heart of downtown, so it can definitely be loud. I expected it to be a bit more reasonable given its seclusion from the bars, but it's still very loud. Additionally, my unit is next to the stairs, and the door slams louder than any other door I've ever heard. Literally wakes me up WHENEVER someone comes or goes, which is every time of the day. It's a bit annoying being woken up at 4 in the morning every Tuesday... The apartment is sketchy in general. The parking garage has spray paint all over the walls, and there are tools/junk everywhere. There's a spot in the garage where the roof is leaking, and it looks like the apartment above could collapse at any time. One of the staircases has a huge crack in it and you can literally see the stairs sagging. It looks like it's going to collapse within the next few years. The hallways, garage, and laundry room are very dirty/rundown. The entire complex (20ish units) only has one washer and one dryer, which have taken my money without working before. Signing the lease was sketchy, too. He had signed it over to someone else, but when they didn't pay the deposit he literally just crossed off their name and had me sign it... Not even sure if it's legally binding at this point... The parking garage is so tight that I along with a few other tenants have hit poles. Makes me paranoid to go drive anywhere. The landlord can only be reached by phone, so no emailing. That's a bit annoying. Also, the internet here is practically unusable. I couldn't connect for over a week so I just ended up getting myself Comcast. Yesterday my sink started filling with water while I was gone and overflowed into the kitchen... the water was being backed up from the pipes and it smelled like sewage. I still can't get the smell out. Absolutely disgusting. You can't live with a roommate here, so it's pretty expensive ($915 a month and goes up every year.) It's a bit annoying, since it would be pretty easy to fit two people in the apartments. The landlord can be pretty paranoid. He yelled at one of my friends to "never park here again". My friend was simply getting something out of MY car... Only pros I can think of: The apartment comes furnished and is extremely close to campus. Otherwise, I would avoid. —Bohemian

How so? I created JS and its run-to-completion execution model and setTimeout all at once in 1995. It has not changed in execution-model semantics since. There's no contradiction: programs including those eval'ed by setTimeout (or functions passed instead of a string to eval and called later) must and in fact *do not* nest or preempt any other executing JS in correct (to this approximation) implementations. The issues with setTimeout have more been about "core langage" vs. "DOM level 0", and the lack of a "DOM level 0" standard prior to HTML5. /be > > - peter > > On Fri, Mar 18, 2011 at 1:51 PM, > > > > _______________________________________________ > es-discuss mailing list > es-discuss at mozilla.org > -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

Maybe they are in the wrong place. There was also this story in today's FT about the art market, and how its worth many tens of billions a year. But interestingly though increasingly unsurprisingly the main growth is in China where there has been a 100-fold increase!
I'm guessing the top-end art and top-end boat markets have some similarities. In which case thats the sort of market expansion that must make boat builders drool into their vintage champagne.Pat and Dean’s trips to Lollapalooza

Report CoverThe sellout crowd at Value City Arena was rocking, the undefeated No. 1 team in the nation looked to be rolling again, and OSU coach Thad Matta was pointing at Buford as Michigan brought the ball upcourt.
It turns out that Matta wasn't saying, "Way to go, Will."
"After he makes a big shot, sometimes he takes a play off on the defensive end," Matta said. "That was, 'Get down in a defensive stance.' "
Continuing to grind their way through an undefeated season, relying on their defense when other things aren't working, the Buckeyes (23-0, 10-0 Big Ten) made enough big shots and got down enough on defense to pull out another tense conference battle, overcoming a three-point halftime deficit to beat the Wolverines, 62-53. After winning six of their previous eight games by five points or fewer, this game, though the OSU lead was only two points with eight minutes to play, practically qualified as a blowout.
Four things I think about OSU's win
1. After Thursday's 62-53 win over Michigan, Ohio State coach Thad Matta said he thinks in the past several games Big Ten teams have been getting more physical with the Buckeyes and with big man Jared Sullinger in the particular. He seemed to spend much of the night expressing that to the officials as well.
"One Big Ten coach told me after Greg Oden left, 'We told our guys to foul him every single time, they won't call every one,' " Matta said. "I'm not saying that's the case at all ..."
But we get the point that Matta is trying to make. Sullinger played 40 minutes on Thursday night for just the second time this season and he said he wasn't tired, but he was sore after getting bumped in the hip on an alley-oop.
2. Sullinger did have some problems at the foul line, making just 5 of 11 free throws after coming into the game shooting 73 percent at the line. It was the third time in his past five games that he missed more than half his free throws, going 1-for-3 against Iowa and 2-for-5 against Purdue. Sullinger said it wasn't physical but mental, that he missed some early foul shots that went in and out and then he got frustrated.
"It kind of messed with me and I started to think about it at the free-throw line," Sullinger said. "I nearly air-balled one. I've got to get in the mindset of making every free throw again."
3. Matta has tried to downplay the Buckeyes' undefeated record for weeks, but there was one point he wanted to make after the Buckeyes moved to 23-0, the second-best streak in team history, behind only the 1960-61 team that started 27-0.
In 2006-07, the Buckeyes won 22 straight before their national championship game loss to Florida, and now they bested that streak, and David Lighty was on both teams.
"It's one of the most incredible things I've seen in my life," Matta said. "I don't know if there's another college player that can say he won 22 in a row and 23 in a row."
4. Matta agreed that Michigan sophomore point guard Darius Morris may be the most-improved player in the Big Ten, and he hurt the Buckeyes early, scoring 10 first-half points on 5-of-6 shooting. But Aaron Craft clamped down on Morris in the second half and Morris also forced some shots, going 1-of-7 after halftime to finish with 12 points.
-- Doug Lesmerises
"I know it'll help us going into the [NCAA] Tournament," Ohio State freshman Jared Sullinger said of another tight night. "In March it's a whole different level, so with us winning now, we experience the taste of almost getting defeated."
Thanks to Sullinger, it wasn't all that close in the end. He had a game-high 19 points and 15 rebounds, shooting 7-of-10 from the field, but only 5-of-11 from the line. Buford added 13 and David Lighty and Jon Diebler each had nine.
Sullinger adjusted to the way Michigan double-teamed him from the baseline in their first matchup -- a 68-64 Ohio State win in Ann Arbor on Jan. 12 -- and sometimes passed out of pressure, sometimes dribbled away from it and other times went right over the second smaller defender coming to help. And sometimes he twisted his body to grab air-balled 3-pointers and lay them back in, as he did to extend the OSU lead to six with just over five minutes to play.
"The last time I saw that, Blake Griffin did it," Michigan coach John Beilein said. "He has incredible body control."
As a team, the Buckeyes had to fight to stay in control. Matta stomped and shouted his way through a game with a combustible undercurrent, nearly following an official into the Michigan huddle to voice his displeasure during one break. Many of the 34 foul calls in the game -- 23 on Michigan and 11 on Ohio State -- could have gone either way. Certainly, Michigan had a lot of reasons to wonder about calls, too, but whatever happened, with the officials and with opponents continuing to get more physical with the Buckeyes, Ohio State stayed on track.
"I thought our guys did a very good job of maintaining composure when things didn't go the way we thought they were going to go," Matta said. "The offense wasn't as efficient as we needed to be tonight. The defense probably saved us."
Saved for the 23rd time this season. Sunday at Minnesota, it's back in the stance.

Ask her if she has ever been to school, she shakes her head vehemently and blurts out, "School? I don't even know how to hold a pencil."
All of 8 (at least that's what she looks), Rupa Parveen is a rag-picker.
She has been one since the age of 4. That's how she earns her bread.
She has learnt the rules of life the hard way at this prime age. Which is why she would not allow any cameraman near her.
Reason?
"They will publish it in the newspaper and I will lose my job."
However, after slight hesitation, she allowed this correspondent to take her photograph with a mobile camera and even consented to her photograph getting printed.
Working about 8-10 hours a day, Rupa makes about Rs 40 a day. She stays in a kholi in south Kolkata with her 60-year-old dadi.
The garbage that they pick is sorted at a dumpyard near Park Circus in south Kolkata and payments are distributed to each one of them.
With the money that the grandmother-granddaughter duo earns, they can afford only two square meals a day.
"When I feel hungry in between, I just have two bottles of water. It kills the hunger, you know," she says with a defiant smile.
Her rest of the family stays in Bangladesh. "Dadi and I go there every month via the border town of Bongaon," she pauses, to add, "without passports, of course."
"We need to pay Rs 1,000 to men at the border and they let us in," she claims.
Rs 1,000 out of Rs 2,400 that she and her dadi earn is steep, isn't it? "Yes, but I just can't help it. I need to see my parents and my 5-year-old brother at least once a month you see," she sighs.
"My parents work there as agricultural labourers. When they go out to work, our neighbours take care of my brother."
How and when did she come to India?
"I was too young then to remember anything. But dadi says there was some political turmoil there and all of us were asked to leave our homes.
"We fled to this 'part' of Bengal. But when things settled down a bit, my parents moved back leaving me with dadi. The latter by that time had got this 'job' and she wanted to keep me with her."
India, the world's second-fastest growing major economy, has millions of Rupas strewn across the streets. We come across some of them every once in a while.
Child labour is a dagger through India's soul. The country has the dubious distinction of being home to the largest child labour force in the world, with an estimated 30 per cent of the world's working kids living here.

Comment
articleThe Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) acting in consort with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) have mandated cell phone manufacturers include a special Obama Chip in each new Cell Phone in order for the President to 'stay in touch' in the run up to the 2012 election.
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, speaking through a translator from somewhere in either Poland, Romania or Manchester, England, and DNC Hairperson Debbie Wasserman- Schultz (DWS), announced the mandate at an Obama $500,000 a plate fund raiser in Napa Valley, California before a crowd of celebrities as soft as the grapes they were toasting.
The official spin on the edict is that Obama will be able to warn Americans by regions of imminent danger of terrorist attacks, flooding, tornadoes, locusts, African killer bees, impending IRS audits of 'Non Profits', locations of 2 fer 1 food stamps, or even a threat to their pensions.
According to Democratic Strategists cloaked by a Super Injunction, and therefore who can't be named even though they were caught screwing the American Taxpayer, the real case behind the measure will enable Obama to interrupt cell phone conversations with emergency fund raising messages, arrange for limo rides to polling places, provide a sample ballot with the proper check marks, and even text using pictures for the illiterate.
Said DWS, "the American Public needs this guidance from the President. If they follow his
New Life Plan to 'Change' including eating what he tells them, hiring who he tells them, building factories where he tells them, and joining unions that he tells them, and ultimately votes for whom he tells them, we'll come out of this mess that the Founding Father's got us into....BASTARDS!"
Another insider said he was disappointed Bin Laden was killed last week. "We had been holding back to zap him until the time was right, about 3 weeks before the election in order to put Obama over the hump with a last minute surge."
" Unfortunately that Arse Hole Joe Biden included him on the distribution list of a forwarded E-Mail to Nancy Pelosi inviting her to view the action of his demise in Michelle's White House Media Room....Osama, Obama...I mean, it was probably an honest mistake..a simple slip of the finger don't ya think?"
Unfortunately, according to an unnamed source inside the Pentagon, Obama is only batting .500. "We had two buttons set up for him, one to put a missile up Quaddaffy's arse and one to sic the SEALS on Osama. The President was clearly told "do not push the buttons until you're told! So simple a caveman could have done it. But no, we told him it was a 'go' on Bin Laden and the simple bastard pressed both buttons at the same time....missed Quaddaffy by 30 seconds as he hadn't come out of his bomb proof toilet yet....$1.5M down the shitter and no time to reload!"
Chicago Rapper "Common" invited to give a 'reading' at the White House said he was preparing a new ode to the President in honour of taking over the internet:
Obama Bin Everywhere.....hmmm, hmmm, hmmm
Hey Bro, no need to knit yur brow,
with dat chip in your phone, you can hear 'em now
we know he can dribble and ain't no quitter
now he be known as dat King of Twitter
da MAN bin in your plate, even telling you how to masticate
can't be tellin' 'em 'get out my face'
He's even invaded and taken over MY SPACE
He's in the kitchen with yo ho on what to cook
he's even your bess frien now on FACEBOOK
You can run and hide if you kin find a place
But Obama Bin Everywhere including outer space
So, Yo, get it together like birds of a feather
no one kin tell us when to stop,
I hear voices in my head to cap a cop
We be cool, ain't our fault,
we just be doin' wot we be tolt
Homeys together, couldn't be colder,
they can't touch us cuz Bam's got our back with Eric Holder
Keep that phone close at hand,
never know when Bam gonna need the Band
load that '9', it be fine and jis remember
that cell gonna ring to celebrate the next 11 September
Obama Bin Everywhere....hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm!Regal Riverside Hotel, Sha Tin

Album Review: Butcher Boy - 'Helping Hands'
Delicate, warm indie popMore on Butcher Boy
5 / 10 Boy oh boy, Butcher Boy, the inclusion of lines like, “I paint a chain of buttercups around your neck” (from a song called ‘Bluebells’, no less) don’t half make pigeonhol… sorry, reviewing your third album much easier. Add to that the surely pertinent observation – the fact – that this is delicate, warm indie pop of the early Belle & Sebastian ‘Imperial’), but testicles are nowhere to be seen.

The Bulldogs, who saw their five-game win streak snapped, lost in spite of the fact they outgained the Wildcats 306 to 229. Ferris had some turnovers, including a lost fumble and an interception, that hurt the cause. Moreover, the Bulldogs were hampered by good field position Northern took advantage of through special teams (on returns).
"We're very disappointed. We've been kind of rolling the dice and winning in these tight games," Ferris head coach Jeff Pierce said as his team falls out of a first-place tie in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. "(Saturday) was a day we were not able to pull that off. We didn't execute the things we needed to execute to beat a good football team."
Northern was a good football team with a strong running game. John Privitelli, who rushed for 135 yards and one touchdown, got the scoring started as he rushed into the end zone from two yards out at 11:02 of the first quarter.
Ferris answered as speedy running back Tyler Thomas scored at 8:10 of the first quarter from 23 yards out to make it a 7-6 game in favor of the Bulldogs.
Later in the first half, at 3:06 of the first quarter, Dustin Brancheau scored on a 13-yard pass from Privitelli on the halfback pass for a 13-7 NMU.
In the second quarter, at 14:19, fullback Aaron Olman scored on a 6-yard pass from quarterback Tom Schneider to put Ferris up 14-13.
Rockne Belmonte, the NMU placekicker, booted a 51-yard field goal to put the Wildcats back up at 16-14. at 10:58. To open scoring in the third quarter, Belmonte connected on a 27-yard field goal to put the Wildcats up 19-14.
Ferris countered as receiver Mike Ryan hauled in a
Northern, however, won the game off the foot of Belmonte. The Wildcats capitalized on good field position and used a 31-yard field goal from Belmonte to seal the deal at 4:16 of the fourth.
The Bulldogs were unable to counter as Northern held on for the win.
Schneider completed 21-of-28 passes for 190 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Thomas was the top rusher with 66 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries. Ryan was the top receiver with six receptions for 76 yards and a TD. Defensively, Tayo Moss led Ferris with 10 tackles and 1.5 sacks while Jacob Moreno had eight tackles. Brad Iskow and Matt Ryan each had seven tackles.
With the loss, Ferris falls to 5-2 overall and 5-1 in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference while Northern improves to 4-3 overall and 4-2 in the league.
"We'll bounce back and if (the Bulldogs) can't get ready for next weekend then there's something wrong," Pierce said. "It's not going to be hard to get them back and get them focused."
Ferris has no time to dwell on this loss as it hosts archrival and national power Grand Valley State University at Top Taggart Field in the Anchor-Bone Classic at 2 p.m. Saturday.Website by

To find your Personal Year Number for 2015...
First we need your MONTH of Birth:
January is a 1, February is a 2, March is a 3, April is a 4, May is a 5, June is a 6, July is a 7, August is an
8, September is a 9, October is a 1 (1+0=1), November is an 11 (Master Numbers are not reduced) and
finally December is a 3 (1+2=3).
Now we need your DAY Number:
If you were born on the 1st through the 9th, just write down the number of the day you were born.
If you were born on the 10th through the 31st, you will have to reduce that number to a single digit. To
reduce to a single digit, simply add the 2 numbers together. For example, if you were born on the 23rd,
add 2+3 which equals 5 and you would know your Day number is a 5. Another example would be if you
were born on the 17th, add 1+7 which equals 8 and your Day number would be an 8.
NOTES:
The only exception is if you were born on the 11th or the 22nd which are Master Numbers and in
Numerology, and we do not reduce a Master Number so leave them be.
AND, if you were born on the 29th you would add 2+9 which equals an 11 and because we do not
reduce a Master Number, you would write down an 11 for your Day Number.
Finally, we need the UNIVERSAL YEAR Number:
2015 is an 8 Universal Year.
Now add your MONTH number to your DAY number to the UNIVERSAL YEAR number.
Again, if you arrive at a double digit number, you will have to reduce to a single digit by adding the two
digits together.
Example: DOB - December 17
3 (MONTH 1+2=3) + 8 (DAY 1+7=8) + 8 (UNIVERSAL YEAR) = 19
(Since 19 is a double digit, we reduce it by adding the two digits together)
1 + 9 = 10 1+0=1 (
1 is the personal year number for December 17
)
Example for a Master Number Birthdate: DOB - March 11
3 (MONTH) + 11 (Do not reduce a master number) + 8 (UNIVERSAL YEAR) = 22
(Since 22 is a double digit, we DO NOT reduce it by adding the two digits together)
(
22 is the personal year number for March 11
)
Now that you know your Personal Year Number, go back to the
Monthly Forecasts
page to find what
your Personal Month holds for you. Enjoy!- Power Conditioners & Surge Pro...(5)

The researchers used microphone arrays and photographic methods to reconstruct flight paths of the bats in the field when these nocturnal hunters find and capture their insect prey in air using their sonar system. Surlykke and Kalko took this information as a base to estimate the emitted sound intensity and found that bats emit exceptionally loud sounds exceeding 140 dB SPL (at 10 cm from the bat's mouth), draw-back.
This is the first comparative field study of bat echolocation sounds focusing on intensity and the results revealed, very interestingly, that although signal intensities (and frequencies) of bats vary widely, they appear to converge on similar detection ranges, because the bats emitting the highest frequencies were also the bats emitting the highest intensities. Thus, the study illustrates the value of an interdisciplinary approach combining bat biology, ecology, behavioral biology and acoustics.

Indeed the president has not always concealed his disappointment in the people, not just those who cling to “guns or religion, or antipathy to people who are not like them,” but all who “had gotten a little soft.” It’s a little like the East German puppet Stalinist regime that “lost confidence in the people” in 1953, prompting Communist playwright Bertolt Brecht to ask whether they proposed to “elect another people.”
After such a debacle as the country has endured these last few years, only the president, the “head of the American people,” as FDR described him (self), can lead and bring the country through. This does not consist in this president’s preferred gambit of decrying the “mess” he inherited. (The federal deficit in 2007 was $161 billion, in 2008 $459 billion, and between $1.42 billion and $1.3 billion each year since and forecast to continue). The president’s late colleague Richard Holbrooke claimed never to have seen anything like “the mess we have inherited” — the same Richard Holbrooke who had seen and prominently assisted in creating the unutterable shambles handed by President Johnson to Richard Nixon, and the one handed by President Carter to Ronald Reagan.
In April 2009, President Obama famously said that “words must mean something,” as he announced his pursuit of a nuclear-disarmed world, the signal for intensified nuclear-proliferation efforts by North Korea and Iran. His words in the State of the Union seemed to have little meaning.
First, the matters I agreed with: By all means let us encourage multinational companies to repatriate jobs to the U.S., doubly so for high-tech start-ups in economically depressed areas. If it is true that almost all the states have raised educational standards, that is a great achievement, and Arne Duncan, the education secretary, does seem to be one of the administration’s brightest lights. “A new law that gives illegal immigrants a chance to earn their citizenship” is a good idea and could be a start in dealing with the immigration crisis. Here as elsewhere, a little specificity would be helpful. (“More boots on the ground” haven’t dried up illegal immigration; the recession has.) Opening 75 percent of offshore sites for oil and natural-gas drilling is a big step forward, though the president still clings to his old fixation on clean energy, which he still fancies a potential source of job creation. I agree with his proposal for an obligatory vote on federal nominees to office within 90 days, and with his desire for stronger conflict-of-interest rules for members of Congress.
Not so uplifting were the calls for more incentive money for schools while “keeping education costs down,” and the requirement for all students to graduate or stay in school to age 18. I have been a secondary-school teacher in this country and I doubt if any great progress can be made until the teachers’ unions who have held education levels hostage to their greed have been decertified, their benefit packages have been adjusted to conform to reduced official means, and there is more stability in American families, especially in African-American communities.
The president’s call for a “comprehensive plan to fight climate change” is nonsense, especially coming from the man who padded around the most absurd conference in history, the one on the environment in Copenhagen in 2009, trying to raise a pledge of $100 billion annually for underdeveloped countries, to salve the consciences of the West in favor of such moral pillars as Mugabe and Chávez. The president did not explain why we should fight climate change, particularly as it is only one centigrade degree in 30 years and has no relationship with carbon emissions or human conduct generally.
Nor is the president’s invocation of the workfare programs of the New Deal or President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System plausible. He has not proposed putting the able-bodied unemployed to work in conservation or infrastructure projects, and it is hard to see this otherwise than as a shabby effort to repackage his catastrophic (gravediggers’) shovel-ready $800 billion stimulus plan (exposed as a scam in a recently revealed memo from former Treasury secretary Larry Summers) by attracting to it some of the prestige of the TVA, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and other New Deal successes such as the Lincoln Tunnel and the Triborough Bridge.
Equally far-fetched was the promise of $10 billion of savings in regulations over the next five years, and the “new rules [that will] restore what should be any financial system’s core purpose [of] getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas and getting loans to responsible families” — in furtherance of which, banks will make a “living will” explaining how they will repay that debt. This is a frightening fairy tale.
Though he did inherit a mismanaged, undermanned operation in Afghanistan, and does deserve credit for the command decisions that got rid of Osama bin Laden, the president knows that it is not true that the U.S. is withdrawing in Afghanistan from a “position of strength.” It is probably time to go, but no one should be under any illusions about how strong our position is. His claim of credit for getting rid of Qaddafi, when he had to be dragged by the ear by the French to do anything — like his assertion that Syria’s Assad, with whom he has effectively sided through most of his civil war, “will discover that human dignity cannot be denied” —- had me reaching for the sick bag. And I almost needed defibrillation, if not the clergy, over his assertion that “through the power of our diplomacy, [the] world . . . now stands as one” in imposing “crippling sanctions” on Iran. In fact, he beseeched the Congress to soften those sanctions, which should have been imposed three years ago when he was playing footsie with the theocratic butchers in Tehran as they stole their election.
No one would begrudge the president trying to spin his record positively, but some of his falsehoods were potentially dangerous. He implicitly tried to excuse government from “the collapse of the house of cards in 2008,” which he blamed entirely on “huge,” “wrong,” and “irresponsible . . . bets and bonuses with other people’s money” in the private sector. The U.S. government, and mainly the Democrats, gave America the trillions of dollars of non-commercial mortgages, the unsustainable bank-borrowing ratios, the mark-to-market rules that assured a short-sellers’ paradise, and a fraudulent housing bubble in the name of family home ownership that was really an enrichment of real-estate speculators and the building trades. Clinton, Rubin, and Greenspan have more to answer for than Sandy Weill, or even the president’s generous supporters at Goldman Sachs, for all their outrages.
The president last week claimed the creation of 3 million jobs in 22 months, but said little of the previous loss of 8 million jobs. His claim to have reduced the deficit by $2 trillion is a pie-in-the-sky ten-year guess that produces only a 15 percent reduction in projected deficits.
The presentation of the consumers’ watchdog and his plan for a financial-crimes unit to crack down on risky mortgages was nightmarish. The last thing the twilight zone of the neo-fascist American prosecutocracy and bloated custodial system needs or should receive is a new reign of terror of proscriptions in the middle echelons of the financial industry.
Inevitably, the steroid-fed canard of Warren Buffett’s taxes raised its furry, bespectacled head in the president’s remarks. “Do we want to keep tax cuts for the wealthiest or do we want to keep our investments in everything else, like education, medical resources, a strong military, and care for our veterans? Because, if we are serious about paying down the deficit, we can’t do both.”
At a 30 percent tax rate, Buffett’s real taxes, on his real income, including reasonably imputable capital gains and the distribution through equity accounting of federal corporate tax, would increase from their actual 29.5 percent by about $7.5 million, a trivial fraction of what he will gain as a railway owner from the president’s irresponsible cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast.
Every reduction of such taxes, under Harding, Coolidge, Lyndon Johnson, and Ronald Reagan, raised the percentage of GDP paid by the wealthiest in their taxes. And the idea that the quantum involved here would have any relevance to the education, medical research, or military budgets is a monstrous fiction. So is his claim that his health-care program relies on a reformed private market.
It is a bit rich for a president so thirsty for more authoritarian and meddlesome government to claim, as he did, to agree with Lincoln that government should only do what the people cannot do better for themselves. “Anyone who tells you that America is in decline, or that our influence has declined, doesn’t know what they are talking about.” The end came: If the whole population is in agreement, and behaves with teamwork, “the state of the Union will always be strong.” Not with this coach, or this playbook. Mitch Daniels’s response for the Republicans was excellent; his party should draft him or Jeb Bush to spare the nation four more years of what is becoming a variant of the Big Lie.

Volleyball players’ scoring streaks get statistically fired up
By Bruce Bower, 16:20 PM January 12, 2012
Volleyball players have taken a stand — make that a leap — for the existence of that statistically elusive feat known as the hot hand.
Not only do top volleyball strikers go on scoring runs that can’t be chalked up to chance, but players and coaches notice when a player is on a hot streak and funnel the ball his or her way, say psychologist Markus Raab of German Sport University Cologne and his colleagues, who studied the hot-hand phenomenon by analyzing playoff game data from a German vol...
Source URL:There was no sex in the USSR. Or so the saying goes. While that seems unlikely somehow, there is one thing that the Soviet Union certainly did lack — philanthropists. Sponsorship of the arts, like everything else, was the prerogative of the state. But now, with the government playing a more reluctant, and more doctrinaire, role in funding culture, the arts agenda is largely being shaped by billionaire philanthropists like Roman Abramovich and their pet projects. These donors are giving Russian culture new impetus. But at what price?
The new wave of generosity has not come from nowhere — many see it as the rebirth of a long-dormant Russian tradition in which wealthy individuals used art and culture to exchange their gains (ill-gotten or otherwise) for public respect. The golden age was the late 19th and early 20th century, when entrepreneurial merchants became major collectors, gallery-owners and patrons. At Abramtsevo, his extraordinary style russe estate, textile magnate Savva Mamontov hosted some of the country’s most talented painters like Ilya Repin and leading composers such as Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Moscow’s renowned Tretyakov Gallery was founded in 1856 by another textile millionaire, Pavel Tretyakov. Just before WWI, merchant-turned-collector Sergei Shchukin educated a generation of avant-garde artists by showing his collection of French modern art, which is now housed in the Hermitage.
In the past decade, this model for funding has made a comeback. The new philanthropists made their money not in factories, but in natural resources and petrochemicals, and they show their support by launching cultural projects and sitting on museum boards. A signal move was the creation of Moscow contemporary art centre Winzavod in 2007 in a former bottling factory. Roman Trotsenko, the owner of investment fund AEON Corporation, put about $15m in the reconstruction. At around the same time, metals billionaire Vladimir Potanin created an endowment fund for the Hermitage in St Petersburg, with an initial investment of $5m; in Moscow in 2009 the Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design was founded by Alexander Mamut, Sergey Adonyev and Ilya Oskolkov-Tsentsiper with an annual budget of $10m.
"In the 19th century donors were convinced that money was essentially impure, a burden on their immortal souls"
The highest profile initiative was the Garage Center for Contemporary Culture set up by Roman Abramovich in a former avant-garde bus garage in the north of Moscow in 2008. His investment is estimated to be around $70m. This initiative was followed by the still ongoing “cultural reconstruction” of St Petersburg’s New Holland, an island surrounded by canals created by Peter the Great as a naval warehouse. As with Garage, the parent company of New Holland is the Abramovich-bankrolled Iris Foundation, which is headed by his partner Dasha Zhukova.
Although the peak of activity came in the run up to the global financial crisis of 2008, the crash has not taken away the zeal of the new philanthropists, only modified their tactics. At a recent panel on charitable giving at the St Petersburg Economic Forum, it was revealed that, in the last two years alone the number of so-called specialised endowment funds (designed to fund charitable initiatives) has doubled, with their combined funds now totalling 18bn roubles ($560m). 13 new art and culture charities have been set up. Of course, from a global perspective, these figures are not all that impressive. But the most important thing for Russia, with its undeveloped cultural infrastructure, is the direction of growth.
Here’s another old saying, albeit not Russian: there’s no such thing as a free lunch. While philanthropy was considered something of an eccentricity in the 19th century — in his will, pledging money to the eponymous museum, Tretyakov begged his brother not to “laugh at his wishes” — but these generous donors were convinced that money was essentially impure, a burden on their immortal souls. While their ancestors had built churches with their fortunes, they preferred the new religion of the fine arts.
So does the same inner sense of justice drive sponsors today? Contemporary Russian society seems to think not. A public opinion survey by Moscow’s Higher School of Economics suggests that Russians believe that fewer than 75% of charitable givers do so with mercenary intentions. So what else might be motivating them?
"It’s hard to pin down what exactly Vekselberg got in return, but it’s not hard to see why he’d prefer to be in the government’s good books"
Demonstrative altruism is certainly a good way to advertise integrity and thus help guarantee financial security. Commentators such as Andrei Mukhin from the Centre of Political Information have tried to find a relationship between bursts of charitable giving and important business deals. Without doubt, philanthropic gestures can make businessmen’s day jobs easier, particularly by ensuring a good relationship with the Kremlin. In 2006 oil and aluminium oligarch Viktor Vekselberg helped finance the return from the US of the archive of Ivan Ilyin, a nationalist émigré philosopher. His assistance was, it’s said, requested personally by a representative of President Putin, and the purchase of the archives was part of the president’s “For Reconciliation and Agreement” programme. It’s hard to pin down what exactly he got in return, but it’s not hard to see why he’d prefer to be in the government’s good books.

Regardless of motive — vanity and desire for a historical legacy must also play a role — philanthropic giving has certainly helped cultural institutions be more flexible and dynamic in their practice, attracting new audiences and nudging the big state museums into introducing more modern, multidisciplinary programmes. But there’s another side to this big shiny coin. While the influx of new money has certainly been a breath of fresh air, it has perhaps lead to a situation in which an individual can acquire disproportionate influence.
"More than 60% of Russians believe that charity should be everybody's business"
For instance, German entrepreneur Peter Ludwig, the so-called Chocolate King of Europe, used his confectionery millions to build up an empire of 12 museums bearing his name across Europe at the end of the last century, including a wing of the Russian Museum in St Petersburg founded in the late 1990s. No Russian patron has yet reached this level, but private institutions like Garage and Strelka, the origins of which can be traced to one person’s tastes, are increasingly dominant in the cultural scene. More and more, the Ministry of Culture and other government organisations are looking to them for guidance. Their success is partly a product of their professionalism, and to the structures put in place to ensure checks and balances; however, in distinction to most leading global institutions, single individuals still hold enormous sway. In the UK, for instance, the top galleries and museums, both public and private, are governed by unpaid, disinterested trustees; in the US sponsors do get a seat at the table, but there are enough major donors to prevent one voice dominating. In Russia, by contrast, the individual tastes of an unaccountable oligarch can still have enormous repercussions.
The answer, perhaps, is not fewer donors, but more. It has become a mantra for Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, that cultural institutions should have multiple sources of income in order to ensure autonomy and curatorial independence. Private cultural projects with only one major backer run the same risk as state institutions: if, for whatever reason, their solitary supporter cuts off funding, they are doomed to disappear.
The next logical step is to diversify the pool of sponsors by bringing in smaller private businesses and wealthy families into the process. This approach has potential — opinion polls conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center show that more than 60% of Russians believe that charity should be everybody’s business — and many big cultural institutions have already started down this path: make a small investment and you can become a “friend” of the Hermitage, the Tretyakov or the Russian Museum.
Such a model would suit the government too, obviating the need for investment in the cultural infrastructure. For this reason, among others, a law is under discussion which would make it easier to support cultural projects, potentially offering tax break incentives to donors. What boost this will give aspiring mid-level philanthropists is unclear, and as the economic conditions which created the initial wave of super-rich giving have not changed, it seems as if the billionaire enthusiasts will continue to define the cultural scene in the near future.Palmer: Titans should have thrown to Cook earlier

Interesting Facts on Skunks and Their Behaviour:
- Skunks are legendary for their powerful predator-deterrent—a hard-to-remove, horrible-smelling spray. A skunk's spray is an oily liquid produced by glands under its large tail.
- Skunks have poor to fair senses of hearing and smelling. They also tend to be somewhat clumsy runners due to their short, stocky front legs.
- Skunks have been known to be carriers of rabies. This will happen if they are bitten by or eat an animal that is affected.
- Skunk spray does not carry rabies.
- Skunks are not all bad, they like to eat the garden bugs and slugs that damage your crops.
- Skunks can grow anywhere between 16" - 27" in length and generally weigh from just over 1 lb. to just over 6 lbs.
- Skunks can spray up to 4-7m (13-23 ft) in a favorable wind-although they are usually only accurate for up to about 2m (6.5ft).
- Skunks are found in a wide variety of habitats, and are common in many urban areas.
More Facts about Skunks
Although skunks are commonly considered a nuisance, their tendency to consume insects and rodents while.
Skunks are solitary animals. They come together only during the breeding season and during winter when several may be found denning together. Skunks are characterized as being shy, secretive animals. They discharge their scent when disturbed, cornered, or harassed. Prior to releasing scent, the skunk often will stamp its forefeet rapidly while lifting its plume over its back..
There is no one size for skunks. They can vary in size from the Spotted Skunk that can be the size of a squirrel all the way up to the Hog-nosed Skunk, which can be the size of a small lap dog. Most skunks sport the almost universally recognized pattern of a black body with white stripes. The exact strip pattern can vary with each individual animal, and contrary to folklore it can't be used to determine the skunks gender. Less commonly known is that they can occasionally have a brown body and white stripes or a grey body and white stripes. Some may even be completely white, without being an albino, or a solid black. Unlike most small animals that try to blend with their surroundings to avoid predators, skunks want to be seen. Much like the bright colors of poison dart frogs in the Amazon rain forest, skunks deliberately standout to warn other animals to stay away.
Skunks become a nuisance when their burrowing and feeding habits conflict with humans. They may burrow under porches or buildings by entering foundation openings. Garbage or refuse left outdoors may be disturbed by skunks. All skunks seem able to dig their own burrows but will also use abandoned dens of other animals, hollow logs, wood or rock piles. They also burrow under buildings, stone walls, hay or brush piles and trees or stumps, elevated sheds, openings under concrete slabs and porches and access to crawl spaces under houses.
Skunks in Your Home or On Your Property?:
B&B Wildlife Removal Services understands that skunks can be a bit intimidating with their reputation for the foul-smelling spray. Skunk denning activities can also create great damage. Skunks can also be a major disease factor. We humanely trap the skunks and relocate them to a safe place.
Skunks and Rabies:
Rabies may be carried by skunks on occasion. Skunks are the primary carriers of rabies in the Midwest. When rabies outbreaks occur, the ease with which rabid animals can be contacted increases. Therefore, rabid skunks are prime vectors for the spread of the virus. Avoid overly aggressive skunks that approach without hesitation. Any skunk showing abnormal behavior, such as daytime activity, may be rabid and should be treated with caution.

All public and private entities in the state of Minnesota must accept your assigned Safe at Home address (PO Box) as your actual address of residence, school address, and address of employment. This requirement is mandated by Minnesota Statutes Chapter 5B.
If someone is insisting that you disclose your real address, call the Safe at Home office before you make any disclosure!
Yes. If you are a Safe at Home participant, you can have your Safe at Home address put on your Minnesota driver's license or state identification card.
Remember, by law you are not required to disclose your actual residential address to the Department of Vehicle Services when you apply for a driver's license or state identification card.
If you want to vote and you are a Safe at Home participant, do not go into your local polling place.
You can register to be ongoing absentee voter through Safe at Home. It is the only way to vote and not have your personal information (your name and address) accessible to others.Voting by absentee ballot through the Safe at Home office is done entirely through the mail. You are notified of an upcoming election in your community in plenty of time to vote by absentee ballot, and your ballot is never viewed by Safe at Home staff.
If you are a Safe at Home participant and did not register to be an ongoing absentee voter during your application process, call Safe at Home at 651-201-1399 or 1-866-723-3035 for assistance. You can also call if you have questions about the voting process in general, or refer to the Guide to Voting for Safe at Home Participants in your Safe at Home Information Packet.
Safe at Home may release data to law enforcement authorities in emergency situations. However, law enforcement requests must be made by utilizing the law enforcement data request procedure through the Duty Officer at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The law enforcement request is screened at two levels.
Other than these rare situations, your real address remains under security with the Safe at Home office. Under no other circumstances is it disclosed.
You may submit a completed blue Change of Information Form, or you can write your new address on a piece of paper, sign the paper and mail it to the Safe at Home office.
If you do not update Safe at Home of your address change, your program participation will be cancelled.
As a Safe at Home participant, you may give Safe at Home written consent to share your information with others in order for Safe at Home to assist you with your interactions with other entities.
However, you can NEVER give Safe at Home consent to disclose your actual address to a third party. This policy is in place for your own safety.-  Headlights

In my talks and in Blame My Brain, I explain that risk is important. It’s biologically programmed into us to take some risks in order to succeed. We mustn’t just think of risk as being about physical danger. Risk-taking also includes experience-seeking and sensation-seeking; and the desire to push ourselves to take some risks and try new activities is what makes us dare to do things we might fail at, such as going for promotion, or trying something new that we might not be good at.
In biological terms, each time we take a risk we are urged on by the rush of a neuro-transmitter called dopamine, which is exacerbated when we succeed. I call dopamine the “yes” chemical – it’s what makes us want to say yes to things, to try them, to take the risk. We need some dopamine to make any active choice, even to get out of bed in the morning. People who are depressed often lack sufficient dopamine levels, which is why people with depression often find they don’t feel like doing anything at all.
But dopamine is addictive. And there’s evidence that at least some teenagers have different dopamine responses (meaning that they may need more stimulus to feel the dopamine rush). Some studies have suggested that the dopamine-producing areas are suppressed in some teenagers (again suggesting that they may require more stimulus to produce the effect.)
The parts of the brain implicated in the desire to act are the emotional ones: the limbic system, which is well-developed in children and teenagers. But the part we need in order to make a more calculated assessment and controlled decision is the prefrontal cortex, which doesn’t develop fully into well into the twenties. So, in teenagers you have a strong desire to act with a weak ability to say no and to value or measure future danger.
Additionally – and fascinatingly – recent research shows on fMRI scanning that teenagers use different brain areas when deciding about risk if they feel their peers are aware of the decision. And when you realise that teenagers are five times more likely to have a car accident when driving with others in the car than when alone…
So, what can we do about this? After all, no one can really choose which parts of the brain to use. Well, first, the way we learn is by trying. The brain learns by practising. So, by setting the boundaries and by incentivising teenagers to take responsibility and think, we encourage the prefrontal cortex to develop more quickly. We also learn by modelling, so teenagers need to see adults making good decisions. And by understanding the danger spots (specifically, the power of peers), we can anticipate risk areas ourselves and try to minimise serious risk.
But teenagers do need to be able to take risks. Playing sport and negotiating moderately dangerous situations are ways in which they can take some risks, enjoy the dopamine, and push themselves further. No life can (or should) be made entirely safe.
Alcohol and drugs, however, pose a whole different level of risk, and I’ll come to that in another post.

An excellent piece, Nicola. I hope you succeed in getting your message across to teachers and others who think that the best way to protect children is to eliminate risk, even to the extent of forbidding fun activities enjoyed by previous generations. It sounds as though you’re familiar with Laurence Steinberg’s work but for anyone else who wants to explore farther, here’s a research paper with some great links: ttp://
Margret – thanks so much for reminding me about his work. I’ve added the link into the post. It’s fascinating stuff!To encourage conservation biologists and natural resource managers to work together, the Committee for the National Institute for the Environment (CNIE) will provide them with an electronic meeting place. For instance, managers can post research projects they would like to see done and scientists can post projects they would like to do, says Washington DC-based CNIE senior scientist David Blockstein in the June issue of Conservation Biology.
In urging conservation biologists to become more involved, Blockstein says, "The stakes are high and the consequences of inaction are unacceptable."
Called the Managers-Researchers Exchange Bulletin Board, this electronic meeting place will be at the CNIE's National Library for the Environment website () in time for the 17-21 June Society of Conservation Biology meeting.
While important, the electronic meeting place is just a first step. To answer resource managers' questions, scientists will also need to do more interdisciplinary, large-scale studies. But doing such studies is difficult because the "science funding infrastructure has no home for what we do," says Blockstein.
To increase funding for research designed to improve the scientific basis of environmental decision making, the CNIE is promoting a National Institute for the Environment (NIE). Endorsed by the Society for Conservation Biology, the NIE had 92 bipartisan co-sponsors in the last Congress and is gaining supporters in the current Congress.

Competition Law
Article excerpt
Your sales manager was spotted in the bar at a conference last week in a huddle with his opposite numbers at your two main rivals. He says it was just a social chat, but how can you ensure your firm isn't engaging in anti-competitive behaviour?
So what's that? There are two main areas of competition law: anti-competitive agreements, including price-fixing, bid-rigging, carving up the market and other cartel-like behaviour; and abuse of a dominant position, covering anything from over-pricing to refusing to supply certain customers.
Put it on the agenda. Get top-level buy-in - penalties can be up to 10% of turnover and five years in jail. Consider putting it in your vision and values statement; spell out that knowingly participating in anti-competitive practices constitutes gross misconduct.
Comply with me. Your lawyers can help you create a compliance programme. 'It's all about education,' says Angelique Bret, a senior solicitor at Denton Wilde Sapte. 'We create a set of rules giving your employees practical guidelines on what they can and can't do, tailored to your business.' Have the rules laminated and stuck on the wall, or handed out as cards.
Stop careless talk. 'Don't talk to competitors about prices, markets and customers,' says David Marks, a partner at CMS Cameron McKenna. 'Even if you're not making agreements, any sharing of information in these areas inherently leads to less competition.' An employee caught up in an awkward conversation should withdraw - then report it to the legal department afterwards. …Beyonce: Fierce, Fearless, Female

Interestingly enough, Aguilera was initially resistant to signing on. "I've never watched an entire episode of 'American Idol,'" she admits. . If there had been a show like 'The Voice' [when I was starting out] I would have gone on it. It would have been amazing to be coached by a mentor."
And it turns out viewers found the concept to be pretty amazing, too, as "The Voice" became an instant hit. As a result, things are looking up for the pop star, both professionally and personally.

ColumbiaWere the first two games a mirage? Did the Predators really not play well, despite winning? At least that was the tone in the locker room following Thursday night’s home-opener 5-2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. Judging by some of the Predators’ words, it almost felt like Nashville should be 0-3-0. Still, it’s early in the season. Teams improve as the year goes on. Now is for fine-tuning. Of course they’re not going to be satisfied. In some ways, the loss was a good thing. As Barry Trotz said. “Sometimes you need to get whooped a little bit to bring you back to reality.”
Here are your ponderings…
- The.
- The Predators need Francis Bouillon, and they know it. Once again, it’s pretty clear Trotz doesn’t completely trust his third defensive pair. Teemu Laakso played 11:38 and Mattias Ekholm played 11:30. It’s tough to expect the “Cube” to step in and be his old self immediately. But he can add some depth at 15+ minutes per night. This could at least give Shea Weber and Ryan Suter a rest. Both played upwards of 27 minutes again.
- Niclas Bergfors is going to have to work his way onto this team to get a regular role. He showed flashed of offensive flair early, but played only 1:29 in the third period. It will probably be a situation similar to Sergei Kostitsyn last season. Trotz didn’t give Kostitsyn a regular offensive role until December. So wait another couple of months for Bergfors to possibly get a normal spot in Nashville’s offensive rotation.
- Don’t look now, but David Legwand is leading the NHL in scoring through one week. He had two assists tonight — one was a nice feed to Colin Wilson. We’ve discussed this before, but he looks refreshed playing with Wilson and Craig Smith. Could Legwand finally break out at age 31? He’s showing some very positive signs.
- Who would have thought that through one week of play, Ryan Suter would have more goals than Shea Weber. Granted, it’s just one week, but Suter is getting off to a nice start to his contract year. Three points in three games and averaging 27:44 of ice-time.

Next ArticleOn Sept. 10, 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton began the first leg of an historic trip to Asia. The trip was the first for any ICE director to South Korea and China. Director Morton visited Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou over six days. The focus of the trip was to build international investigative cooperation, especially with regard to intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement between ICE, the principal investigative arm within the Department of Homeland Security, and law enforcement authorities in China and South Korea.
The first stop was Seoul, where Morton and South Korean Prosecutor General Joon Gyu Kim signed a memorandum of understanding on Sept. 13 to increase cooperation and collaboration on some of the most pressing investigative issues under ICE's jurisdiction. These include intellectual property rights enforcement, counter-proliferation, cyber crime, money laundering and human trafficking and smuggling.
Director Morton also visited the Korea Immigration Service and the Korean National Police headquarters where he met with top law enforcement officials from each of these agencies.
In Beijing, China, Morton signed a letter of intent (LOI) on Sept. 14 with China's Economic Crimes Investigation Department Director General Meng Qing-feng. Under the LOI, ICE and China agree to cooperatively fight IPR crimes and work together on other matters. IP theft is a serious crime of a predatory nature that undermines innovation and costs jobs throughout the world. IP theft threatens our economic stability and national security, restricts the competitiveness of U.S. industry in world markets and places the public's health and safety at risk.
The conduit for cooperation on IP theft enforcement with the Chinese Government is to be the ICE-led National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) in Arlington, Va. The IPR Center is a true task-force, consisting of 13 domestic and foreign investigative agencies dedicated to IP theft enforcement.
At another major event in Beijing on Sept. 15-the Quality Brands Protection Committee (QBPC) meeting-Morton emphasized the need for U.S. law enforcement and Chinese companies to partner together to thwart IPR crimes. The QBPC includes representatives of more than 180 multinational companies, representing more than $70 billion in investment and hundreds of thousands of employment opportunities in China. Morton said that IPR crimes cross international borders and pose problems for both China and the United States. He also said private industries have a strong incentive to protect IPR.
"You've made significant investments - but counterfeiters and pirates attempt to hijack that investment for their own gain. Even worse, shoddy or unsafe knock-offs can damage your company's reputation for quality and customer service," said Morton.
Morton also addressed the American Chamber of Commerce of South China, where he was able to meet with representatives of dozens of American companies with interests in China. Morton's message was that the IPR Center and ICE are working tirelessly to address IP theft enforcement so that American companies can focus on innovation and productivity as opposed to spending capital protecting their products.
The China trip also included a visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice in Beijing, meetings with the Public Security Bureaus of Shanghai and Guangzhou and a tour of a U.S. company's manufacturing plant in Guangzhou.
Morton visited the customs agencies in each place they visited, including the Korea Customs Service, China Customs in Beijing and Shanghai Customs.
"It has been a tremendous privilege to visit both South Korea and China on behalf of ICE," said Morton. "Meeting with our counterparts in law enforcement in Asia proved that we share common goals and often face a common enemy in organized criminal enterprises, especially those engaged in IP theft. The agreements we reached truly made this trip highly productive and served as another step toward conducting investigations with the coordinated global enforcement necessary to combat transnational crime."Ads are chosen by Google and not necessarily endorsed by this website.
Tactical Rifle Painting by John McQuay
You have spent the time and effort to spec out the perfect tactical rifle, or maybe you bought an off the shelf Remington LTR or 700P. Either way, you now have great rifle that you intend to deploy in a tactical environment. The problem is these type of rifles don't usually come from the factory setup to blend with your surroundings. They are usually "tactical black" or if you are really lucky and purchased a fiberglass stock, you may get a camouflage pattern molded in. In both of these circumstances it's unlikely that the weapon will actually match the terrain. You also probably have a black colored barrel, action, scope and hardware. All are likely to stick out like a sore thumb to anyone with decent eyes. Rarely do we find black in nature. So what to do? The answer is simple. Just break out the spray paint. Now relax. I know some of you just cringed. It's OK. If you take the appropriate measures you will not hurt your expensive rifle. I know it looks pretty "naked" but we aren't trying to impress the guys at the range. We are trying to conceal our position in the field, allowing us to better gather intelligence and if need be to engage selected targets.
This article is mainly geared towards the Military Sniper or LE Sniper who operates in rural terrain, however Urban LE Snipers would do well to follow along. Even in cityscapes a big black rifle stands out. Most cities still have parks, bushes and trees here and there. If you don't like the colors we use, then go with some light and dark shades of gray and tan. Anything is better than black.
Here is our starting point:
This is a Remington 700 .308 Varmint in a Bell & Carlson Light Tactical stock. It's equipped with a Falcon Optics 4-14x44FFP rifle scope. It looks good, but it sure won't blend in to most AO's.
First we need to make sure the weapon is unloaded. Then wipe down the outside with alcohol, acetone or another solvent that will not leave a residue. If you use acetone, use it sparingly. Acetone can eat away many plastics and finishes. Also take care to keep the acetone away from the optics. It can damage seals. Once you have the rifle free of any oils, the fun begins. Take a moment to look the rifle over and think about anywhere that paint could cause problems. Obviously optics need to be taped off so that all of our markings will be visible later. The lenses also need to be protected from over spray. Paint can and will get everywhere. DO NOT rely on your scope caps to keep paint out. Any small screws and bolts need to be protected. Paint will build up in the heads and prevent you from getting the appropriate tool in later and can lead to stripping. The trigger mechanism needs to be completely taped up. We don't care about the trigger bow, but all access to the trigger mechanism itself must be sealed off. The following images illustrate some of the areas and methods I use. Regular blue painters tape works extremely well, comes off easy and does not leave the residue that some other masking tape does. Please take care to plug or tape the muzzle. A little paint over spray in the muzzle will likely be forcibly removed with the first shot, but every shot counts. If you got a large amount of over spray it could damage the bore. My favorite method is to place a disposable foam ear plug in the muzzle and let it expand. This creates a nice seal without having to worry about tape sticking and I don't have to pick it off later. The bolt should be removed for the duration of the process.
Extra care should be taken to mask the optics. I like to remove the scope caps and stuff the objective and ocular housings with cotton balls. Then tape over the cotton balls. Lastly, reinstall the caps. The cotton balls will catch any over spray that makes it past the masking.
Areas to pay attention to when masking:
Compared to masking, the actual painting is simple. First we need to select an area that is dry, well ventilated and will be unaffected by over spray. If you do this in a garage, make sure the car isn't there. Over spray will get on everything. I do most painting on my back patio on a large piece of cardboard. This is not fancy show gun painting. We are painting a rifle that we intend to drag in the dirt, so absolute cleanliness is not needed. You should take care to make sure that there isn't so much dirt about that it will affect how the paint sticks to the weapon.
A quick word on types of paint. In the past I have primarily used Bowflage to paint bolt action rifles. It was easy to use and easy to remove. There will come a time when you need to strip the rifle. I have since been told that bowflage is no longer made. I have not been able to locate it anywhere. For this time around I decided to give Krylon's Fusion Camouflage paint a try. Most paints will work as long as they are designed for wood, metal and fiberglass. Try to stay away from "gloss" paints. Flat is best. You do not need to use "camo" specific paints. Any flat spray in the color you want will work. I used the Fusion Camouflage because it was the flat color I wanted and I was curious as to how it would hold up since it appears to be intended for firearms and outdoors gear. The results were great although I have no feedback on durability yet. Ultimate durability is not a great concern since your color requirements will change with the seasons, thus requiring periodic repainting.
Now that you have masked off your rifle and setup an area to spray, select your base color. I start with light and work my way to dark. It's easier to darken the rifle. It's much more difficult to lighten it up. Spray in several light coats. We do not want to load the paint on. It will cause runs and make it very hard to remove later. Heavy coats will also tend to leech into areas we don't want it.
If you use Butler Creek or some other brand of "flip-up" scope caps then you need to pay attention to the inside of the Objective scope cap. When open this will appear as a huge black circle to the target. First remove the cap from the rifle and spray two light coats on the inside surface of the cover. This is best done before you start masking the rifle. This way the cap has amble time to dry and you can reinstall it to help protect the lenses while painting the rest of the rifle.
I like to start by painting the bottom of the rifle. If you have large turrets you may be able to balance the rifle on the turret. If you have a quality scope, this will not harm it in any way. If it's not possible to balance the rifle in this manner then find a cardboard box that will allow the scope to fit down into it. Cut two larger "V" notches in either end of the box and allow the barrel and buttstock to rest in them with the rifle upside down.
Spray light coats allowing for some dry time in between. When in doubt, follow the directions on the can. Krylon recommends thirty seconds between coats. This worked fine for us. Make sure you get the bottom of the scope and mounts. Continue until you are satisfied with the coverage. Secure the rifle so it will not fall over, then allow it to dry for the suggested time. For the Krylon Fusion 15 minutes was the recommended time. I let it go for a little longer.
Now turn the rifle over and support it. I do not suggest installing a bipod if your rifle is usually so equipped. The pressure of the bipod will most likely damage the fresh finish. Since my stock has a flat forend I just supported it on some wood blocks. Get creative, just make sure you cover anything that will be damaged by the paint.
Spray several more light coats making sure you get even coverage. Ensure that the muzzle is coated evenly. Also pay attention to the scope turrets. It's very easy to miss a spot due to their shape and location.
I also take this time to spray my bipod. I don't worry too much about masking it. I just give it a light dusting or two. If you later need to disassemble it for any reason there isn't much on it that acetone will damage (other than the feet) so paint removal shouldn't be difficult.
While you are waiting for the base coat to dry, go out into your AO and select some suitable vegetation to use as templates. I find that pine boughs work very well as do handfuls of long grass. Small leafy branches also work well, but may be scarce depending on the time of year. This was done in February in the midwest so leafy trees are a scarcity.
The next step is pretty simple, but takes a little finesse. Simply hold your vegetation against the rifle and mist it with one of the darker colors. This gives you a "shadow" effect. Alternately you can spray a stripe of darker color, then hold the veg. against it and mist with your light base coat. There really isn't a "right" or "wrong" way to go about it. Below you will see a combination of the techniques. Make sure you apply some to the bipod as well. All we are really worried about is breaking up the outline of the rifle and changing the colors to mimic those found in nature. Your target should never be close enough to actually see if that is a leaf or an outline on the rifle. Even high powered spotting scopes don't have the resolution required for that after a couple hundred yards. Closer than 100 yards and you will be relying on other field skills to escape detection.
I usually only give the bolt a light dusting. It's a small part and on the back of the rifle away from the target. If you train with your rifle you will wear the paint off the bolt handle. It's also a critical part that can get gummed up if you get paint down into the shroud.
Finally, make sure you give some love to any accessories that you are using. This rifle usually wears an Eagle Stock Pack to adjust the height of the comb. It's also a handy spot to store scope tools and a few extra rounds. The big OD Green blob doesn't work well with the environment and is a bit too green for winter/early spring. While spray paint is not a good permanent solution for 1000D nylon, it will alter the outline for a few months of use. Once the paint has worn off, it's a simple matter to reapply. I use the same treatment on my drag bag. I don't know how well the "Fusion" will hold up, but I have an old pair of High Tech Magnum boots that I used for stalking that still wear the paint I put on them years ago (when black was the only color military boots came in).
Here is a picture of the completed project to give you an idea.
The above picture shows that the paint job blends well in shade and sun at close range on a lawn. At 50-60 yards in broken terrain it would take a trained observer to detect it.
Materials Used:
A word to those who would try this. First, this is a technique intended for working rifles. It's not something that's going to impress your buddies at the range. As it wears in it will just get uglier. It's rough and while mine came out pretty well, sometimes you end up with bits of leaf or pine needles stuck to it if the paint doesn't dry fast. That's life. We aren't out to win any beauty contests. It's about making a working rifle more functional.

Recent CommentsTHE CAPITAL, TALLAHASSEE, July 11, 2012
Michael Peltier, The News Service of Florida
Gov. Rick Scott said Tuesday that signs of strength in the global civil aviation market are being tempered by worries over declining U.S. defense budgets as he meets with private companies during a weeklong trade mission in the United Kingdom.
Speaking from London, Scott told the News Service of Florida that he remains optimistic that the state can benefit from global developments within the aircraft manufacturing industry that include the announcement last week of a new Airbus facility in Mobile, Ala.
Florida remains well poised to capture some of the economic activity expected to be generated by the $600 million plant, which is projected to directly employ 1,000 workers but will have a much broader economic impact, especially along the Florida Panhandle.
"People are excited," Scott said after a day of meetings with business prospects at the Farnborough International Air Show in London."There are a lot of suppliers to Airbus, and I think they are going to be more interested (in looking at Florida) now."
Scott said there is concern that long-term defense cutbacks could affect portions of Florida's aviation sector, which now is made up of nearly 2,000 companies employing more than 83,000 workers. Florida has a huge military aviation sector, with flight installations located throughout the state.
As part of a budget deal forged last year, federal lawmakers have agreed to $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts over a decade, half of which would affect the Defense Department. The cuts are expected to begin in January, but congressional leaders have been speaking about extending the deadline to March.
The budget cuts were part of a deal signed into law in August to raise the nation's debt limit. Along with spending cuts, lawmakers are also looking at moves that could increase taxes and eliminate tax loopholes. Scott said the looming deadline is on the minds of many at the air show.
"On one side, the one dealing with U.S. defense spending, there is concern about the automatic cutbacks" that could kick in, Scott said.
The governor said concern on the military side is being offset by an apparent buying spree in the commercial flight sector. Deals have already been announced at the air show totaling billions of dollars in contracts for aircraft and related equipment.
"On the civilian side, this is one of the busiest times for sales," Scott said. "Boeing has made some big announcements already."
Scott said the six day trade mission has given him an opportunity to tout some recent developments in the state including the push toward science, technology and math degrees and the creation of Florida Polytechnic, the state's 12th university that backers say will be a showcase for STEM education.
Besides making pitches to companies that Florida is a great place to do business, Scott said he's also meeting throughout the week with tourism officials. Britain is Florida's third largest source of tourists behind Canada and Brazil.
Scott also said he remains fiscally cautious about how to spend the state's economic development funds, which total about $103 million. Alabama reportedly provided about $165 million to Airbus to locate its manufacturing plant in Mobile. Scott said the news won't necessary prompt him to ask Florida lawmakers for more money.
"I want to make sure we get a return on the number of dollars we spend," Scott said.- Tickets >

Re^3: OT: Mathematics for programming (again)
in thread OT: Mathematics for programming (again).
You did not leave von Neumann there. Not "for" and "JMP", but rather "for" and "recursion". And recursion in a language that doesn't have mutable variables. And
The thing is not whether it's possible to implement the same algorithms, but whether reasoning about the individual building blocks of one kind of programming languages will be useful for other kinds.
With your "for" vs "JMP" you've stayed within the von Neumann architecture, there are languages that are built on , say, lambda calculus. And even though both are turing complete and may be used to implement the same algorithms and eventualy transform the same data to the same result, their building blocks are different.As part of our Get Inspired series, we’re posting fabulous, inspiring, innovative and passionate video talks from some great thinkers around the world.

BEHEADING OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST
Catholics mark today the Feast of the Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, the precursor and cousin of Jesus Christ. Masses will be held by the hour from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and at 12:15 p.m., 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. at the St. John the Baptist Parish (Quiapo Church) in Manila in honor of its patron. Commemorative rites, masses, and processions will also be held in many parts of the country particularly in Catholic churches named in memory of the first century Jewish preacher. Also known as the last of the Old Testament prophets, the liturgical commemoration of the Feast of the Beheading of St. John the Baptist is as old as the feast of his nativity on June 24.

- Unprecedented volumes of data
- The need to easily analyze this data, make sense of it and put it into action
- The importance of driving real business value from this analysis
It’s the perfect storm… to create opportunity.
Organizations can’t sit by and “wait out” this storm, due to several factors, chiefly: the shift of power to the consumer, internal pressures to do more with less and increased financial regulations and controls.
A recent IBM Institute for Business Value and MIT Sloan Management Review study confirms that organizations who are embracing analytics are significantly outperforming their competition. Those that wait it out will only fall farther behind and risk being at a significant disadvantage.
To help organizations speed past their competition, IBM announced its unique approach to analytics that harnesses the power of this perfect storm to transform the way organizations make decisions and empower individual employees to act confidently and decisively.
With IBM Smarter Analytics, organizations can now easily leverage the deepest portfolio of hardware, software, services and research capabilities to:
- Align, around information and create a trusted information foundation that improves IT economics and optimizes analytic workload performance.
- Anticipate, and shape business outcomes by leveraging Business Analytics to spot and analyze trends and anomalies, predict potential threats and opportunities, plan, budget, and forecast resources, and assess and manage risk.
- Act, with confidence, at the point of impact by embedding analytics directly into business processes and converting new insights into action.
- Learn, from solutions that get smarter with every outcome by returning confidence-based responses for the next best action, such as specific offers that should be made to a specific customer, at a specific time, and in a specific setting (online, in the store, etc.).
It is clear that traditional computing models simply cannot keep up with the increasing demands to do more with less.
That is why IBM Smarter Analytics will challenge and change the status quo by taking an organization’s most valuable natural resource – its data – and turn it into intellectual property.
The more data an organization has to analyze, the more patterns it can identify. And the more insight it can gain from those patterns, the better business outcomes it can drive.
The storm is coming. Are you prepared?

To make cleanup easier, I often place a piece of aluminum foil down before the food. It doesn't cook as quick and a clear path for the grease to drain is not always there..... but when I am in a hurry it's so easy to just pitch the foil.
... so it's a foreman grill?
this is more like a Sugar Ray Grill, but it is good! I have the Griddler Jr. at home. Removable plates were the major selling points for me. Love it!

I have the model with removeable plates which makes cleanup much easier since I can pop them in the dishwasher.I had a different brand with fixed plates and ceaning was a royal pain. The Gridler does a great job of grilling.
This is a quality product. I own it and it's great because you can do so many things with it. It's an indoor grill, it's a panini press, it's an electric griddle. Clean up is super easy because it has removable plates - a function that really sets it apart from a George. Down sides - it's a little big and awkward to store and it takes a bit of time to heat up.
Not the Griddler, this is a Griddler express. I would recommend the original over this one as its limited greatly by its size and options.
Good price. Everyone else has it for $30-100. Even refurb.
I've been using this thing for 3 years, and it's worked well.
One of my roommates destroyed the knob on it, so it just goes to the hottest setting automatically now.
Overall, not great, but not terrible. Worth 20, yes. Worth 30-100, probably not.
i bought one xD
In for one. For $20 with free shipping I'm willing to give it a shot.
Great Deal! In for 1
I bought one of these about a month ago from Amazon. It lasted about 90 seconds, and then the plastic composite cracked when I try to close it. I sent it back and got a different brand. the new one, admittedly a the more costly, has given good service for the last four weeks.
my suggestion: avoid this item.
Wh@@ps. My comment (preceding) applies to the FULL SIZE Griddler, with removable heating surfaces.
Apologies for the confusion.... and the typos
Bought one and had my order canceled a couple days later.
Sucks! Sold out!!

289: Biomass Task Force Report
This briefing is summarised from a report to government by a group led by Sir Ben Gill.
Year of Publication2005
Biomass can contribute to the climate change agenda but a strategic approach by the Government is needed to enable the potential to be exploited. Renewable heat, in particular needs more attention and waste-derived biomass could be utilised.You are currently browsing the category archive for the ‘books’ category..
A few posts ago, I mentioned that my goal has been to try at least one recipe from each cookbook that I get from the library. I have the habit of seeing a shiny new cookbook and putting it on hold, flipping through the recipes picking out ones that look tempting, and then never managing to try any of them before I have to return it to the library. Here’s my current batch:
So far I’ve made recipes from three (all except The Dahlia Bakery Cookbook), although I’ve checked out The Sprouted Kitchen twice, so I suppose I should make a second recipe. And, confession, I had to return The Science of Good Cooking because it had holds, and I barely even looked through it first.
Here’s what I’ve made.
Vintage Cakes: This is one that I requested my library buy, because it looked gorgeous and because I own and like Richardson’s other cookbook, Rustic Fruit Desserts (plus, she’s local). I had it out in the fall and made Pearl’s Chocolate Macaroon Cake (a yummy coconut layer inside a chocolate bundt cake – what’s not to like?) This time I made the Kentucky Bourbon Cake, since someone in my house is a big bourbon fan (and it’s not the baby). If you like the flavor of bourbon, this is a must-try. There’s some in the batter, and the cake itself is a nice moist, buttery bundt. Then you make a bourbon-sugar-butter glaze, poke holes in the flat side of the bundt, and pour half the glaze in. This gives you nice gooey, extra-boozy streaks in the cake. Then you flip the cake out of the pan and pour the rest over the top. Mine was unattractive (it stuck) but delicious.
The Sprouted Kitchen: I can’t remember where I saw this recommended, but I thought I needed something to balance out all the baking books. Lots of things look tasty, and so far I’ve made the Ranchero Breakfast Tostadas. It felt like a lot of steps and ingredients for a relatively humble meal, but it was worth it. You toast a corn tortilla and top it with a black bean mash, a fried egg, cheddar, avocado, cilantro and lime juice. We had them for dinner instead of breakfast, and the runny egg yolk really pulls it all together. I’d make this again – or at least use the basic concept once I have to return the cookbook.
The Dahlia Bakery Cookbook: It turns out that I saw this on a list of 2012’s best cookbooks on NPR – along with The Sprouted Kitchen and The Science of Good Cooking. I haven’t made anything yet, but I’ve been eyeing some of the pies, like the Triple Coconut Cream Pie, although realistically I might manage some muffins or scones.
Super Natural Every Day: Some of these recipes have me drooling and some are less appealing, especially in my extremely carnivorous state. However, I made the Baked Oatmeal yesterday, reheated leftovers today, and think I’ve found a new breakfast standby. Not as quick and easy as our current favorite, a Dutch baby with a layer of sliced apples on the bottom (which I can make without referring to a recipe), but nice and hearty. And a worthy use of the last of the summer blueberries. I’d also like to try the White Beans and Cabbage, the Bran Muffins, or the Frittata.
I’ve found myself reading more ebooks than usual lately, mostly in the middle of the night when I don’t want to turn on a lamp to read any of my print books, but I’m awake feeding baby and getting him back to sleep. The Kindle app on my phone is perfect for the middle of the night, and I’ve been reading a combination of ebooks from the library and ARCs from Netgalley. Here are a few I’ve gotten from Netgalley – I think they’re all out now, or almost out.
In the Shadow of Blackbirds by Cat Winters
Publication date: April 2, 2013
I’d recommend this to anyone who likes books about diseases, spiritualists, ghosts, World War I, or a creepy combination of the supernatural and historical fiction. The setting is particularly vivid, as well as the historical details about how people tried to protect themselves from the flu – sometimes the truth is as creepy as the fictional bits! It’s a dark story that might pull fans of the supernatural into the realm of historical fiction. Or, if you were intrigued by The Diviners but wanted it shorter, minus the humor and slang and flippant characters (for the record, I liked both books).
Being Henry David by Cal Armistead
Publication date: March 1, 2013
The story of a boy who wakes up in a train station and doesn’t know who he is makes for an instant page turner. I loved never knowing quite where the story would go, or who he would turn out to be. Several side characters were nicely drawn and I liked the way Thoreau and his writing were worked into the story (except for the visions of Thoreau himself, which felt unnecessary). Unfortunately, the story takes a turn into lackluster high school drama with the battle of the bands plot line, which just felt like padding. Also, while the main character gets some resolution, several other characters are left hanging at key moments in their stories. I was particularly interested in the brother and sister characters and what would become of them. Unless Armistead is planning a companion that centers on them, leaving them mid-story was just mean.
Anything But Ordinary by Lara Avery
Publication date: September 11, 2012
Bryce’s story was compelling and the whole thing was an interesting if fairly standard drama, somewhere in between a problem novel and something more original. Girl wakes up after being in a coma for several years, life has moved on without her, etc. But Avery throws in some elements that take the story out of realistic and into ‘her brain has been changed in mystical ways’ territory, and those pieces of the story didn’t work as well for me. I think I would’ve preferred to see Bryce deal with things in a strictly realistic way. I also have mixed feelings about the ending, and ultimately felt a little let down by the whole thing. Still, a story that I’d recommend to teen readers who are hooked by the whole premise and don’t need a 100% happy ending.
View all my reviews
Please excuse the silence on this end – all my reading has been one-handed for the last few weeks, and typing one-handed isn’t my favorite thing. Here’s my excuse:
We seem to be getting into a bit of a routine, 5 weeks into it, and I’m in the curious position of feeling like my time isn’t my own and like I have all the time in the world (at least until I go back to work). I do have nice chunks of time to myself during the day, while he naps, and I’m just starting to figure out how to put them to my advantage. Depending on the previous night, there are naps to take myself, there are chores to be done, meals to be eaten, and projects to undertake.
So many projects!
Run errands while he won’t cause a fuss.
Take a walk if the weather’s nice.
Write a letter. A few friends and I, mourning the coming loss of Saturday mail service, decided to write 30 letters in 30 days – any type of mail counts, from postcards to packages – and I’m loving it, even when I’m a few letters behind. Right now I have three letters to reply to, which makes the whole project feel real.
Bake – I have a pile of newish cookbooks out of the library and I want to try at least one recipe from each before I have to return them. Right now I have The Sprouted Kitchen, The Dahlia Bakery Cookbook, and The Science of Good Cooking. Meals are always iffy around here – the baby seems to sense that I’m hungry and work up an appetite himself – but I’ve managed some baking during his afternoon nap, and I might as well try some new things.
Read all those books that I kept thinking would be perfect for maternity leave. At the moment, I’m rereading the Elizabeth Peters books that I happen to own. Leila at Bookshelves of Doom is doing an Elizabeth Peters week, which I think is ending today, but it inspired me to pull out a tattered copy of Naked Once More and now Crocodile on the Sandbank – I haven’t read any of the Amelia Peabody books in years (I went on a reread through the Vicky Bliss books a few years ago) and I’m remembering why I loved them so much (even though they do get a bit repetitive as the series goes on…and on). I’m discovering that mass market paperbacks, which I usually dislike because they don’t lay flat – an important quality if you read while eating – are perfect for reading one-handed while nursing.
More soon, I hope. The creature is stirring..
The!)I am taking Solid State now and using Kittel as the textbook. Needless to say, I don't understand almost anything that's happening. I'm still stuck on Reciprocal Space here. If I have a lattice of atoms of spacing X, then in reciprocal space I get something like 2*pi/X spacing. My prof. explained that as being the momentum space since Reciprocal Space is basically a Fourier transform of the lattice. That only makes sense if X is a wavelength and therefore 2*pi/X * h-bar = momentum. But I don't understand why X would be a wavelength. I guess it would be the maximum wavelength between atoms? And then 2*pi/X * h-bar is the minimum momentum that can get transferred? I am really clueless.Reader Drew is currently stranded at Dallas Fort Worth airport and would like to speak with someone from American Airlines on the telephone. Unfortunately, we’re the only ones he can reach.
Drew says:
Bad weather = dangerous = a somewhat understandable need to cancel flights. That’s fine..
Yuck.
Edit Your Comment
My dad just called and is stranded in Houston from the same storms. Not too fun.
Uh…doesn’t AA use DFW as one of their hubs? Why are you stuck having to call the 800 number? I know it’s kind of retro compared to fixing things online or over the phone, but you’re in an airportâ€”aren’t there plenty of real live people around that should be working on getting everyone’s travel unsnarled?
Once in Seattle with a snowstorm, I wondered why some airlines showed no delays on the departure screen while my flight was delayed. But as soon as it got closer to their departure time, they announced delays also.
If there are flights taking off, then be upset.
Watching the local DFW news and they had an interview from earlier in the day with a AA gate person. She said they were all told to go home for the night. So, I can only imagine that most, if not all AA employees at DFW are gone. AA said they cancelled all flights until midnight. Maybe a skeleton crew hanging around somewhere…..good luck Drew
@CaptZ: So, I can only imagine that most, if not all AA employees at DFW are gone.
That’s some damn good planning there.
umm, shouldn’t Drew be upset at Mother Nature? What is AA supposed to do about it?
this seems like more of a weather issues than an AA issue. Maybe consumerist should point out that there’s not much the airlines can do about the weather.
I was delayed coming into Detroit late one evening and missed my connecting flight. Literally the second everyone had disembarked – WHILE WE WERE FORMING A LINE AT THE TICKET DESK to inquire about the next available flight, the employees up and left. There was NOBODY. Oh, and they claimed “weather” (it was the calmest flight I’d ever been on) was the reason we were delayed, so we had to pay our own hotel for the night as well.
Doesn’t surprise me much that all airline employees would be checked out.
This is just another example of why Dallas is a dumb place to locate a major Airline hub as it is frequently subject to unstable weather from the regular collisions of the Canadian (cold) and Gulf of Mexico (warm) air masses.
I’m keeping my fingers crossed because I have to stop there next week on my trip to Costa Rica.
Wait… WHY, after your flight was delayed for 6 hours, did you not reroute through a different city withOUT weather delays? You flew yourself into the fire, as it were.
Also, out of the hundreds of humans at DFW who work for AA, you decide to call a number that only has so many lines and expect that it will go through every time even though you’re one of thousands of passengers trying to call as well? Would you rather have a busy signal? (Wait, I’m sure you want AA to hire 10,000 more phone agents so you can speak to one).
The storm sucks, the cancellations suck… but those are the realities of air travel (especially when you fly headlong into a storm).
Yes, be done with AA… it frees up a seat for me.
(FYI – A quick search shows that all United flights are also canceled. I bet I know what I’ll find if I spend the time to search the other airlines.)
Drew has every right to be upset with a company that takes his money and hangs-up when he calls.
Yes, Mother Nature is to blame for the weather. AA is to blame for FAILING on its customer service ‘pledge.’What makes AA or, in my case, UA, believe they have the right to under-staff the telephone banks when bad weather occurs?
What gives the airlines (and the airports) the right to strand passengers on runways during weather-related delays? The airlines seem to believe they don’t need to have backup plans because that would raise the price of tickets. WHO THE HELL operates a business that way? Seriously, I completely expect that my ticket price includes the cost of simple life-saving measures during weather-related delays.
For example, when bad weather strikes, where are the emergency cots that every airport should stock? Where are the emergency plows and buses to free passengers from being stranded on the tarmac for hours and/or overnight? Where are the backup telephone operators? Why do they have a telephone system that’s overloaded? HOW IS IT that American Idol can accommodate 30 million phone votes every week but American Airlines can’t handle their customers’ call volume when, predictably, bad weather happens?
Yeah, blame Mother Nature.
I can understand that there is bad weather, and that flights were canceled. What I don’t understand is why did they cancel all the flights for the rest of the day? It’s not a snowstorm that going to dump a crapload of snow on the field. Certainly flights later in the day would be able to operate.
@petrarch1608: Provide a team of employees to deal with customers, provide information and rebook people? I don’t think that is too much to ask.
… and not a word about this on their website.
@petrarch1608: Did you RTFA? He said he understands it’s about weather, but he’d like to talk to an employee. Because you know if he misses the flight he’s been rebooked on, AA is going to blame him. When there is am obvious reason for high call volume(storms), they need to start calling in more people to answer the phones.
@petrarch1608: mother nature didn’t make AA not take his calls, just made them not fly any plains.
on the upside, DFW has to be one of the best airports to be stuck in. not much of an upside though…
@petrarch1608: This is crazy snarky. It is really clear that he wants to talk to someone about the next available flight. I don’t understand the confusion.
Having just been royally screwed by AA on an international flight, I fell his pain.
jcapello: whinefest much?
@jcapello:
“What makes AA or, in my case, UA, believe they have the right to under-staff the telephone banks when bad weather occurs?”
What makes AA do this is its incompetent, unqualified management, that doesn’t understand that this is exactly the kind of situation that NEEDS TO BE MANAGED by working with the people (customers) that make their paychecks possible.
Umm the weather here in Dallas is awful and is going to be all night, that is why they cancelled the flights. It’s a very unstable airmass with microbursts embedded making it very dangerous for flights. Yeah AA should probably answer the phones, but with the dangerous flooding conditions in Dallas right now, it was a good decision to let employees go home safely before it gets dark.
@jcapello: Very well put!
As shitty as the not being able to contact anyone sounds, the weather here is insane. I can’t say I blame them and it’s probably not a constant recording, just a all lines are busy call back or something. Certainly he’s not the only persona calling and to expect any company to have that many people staffed would be a little ridiculous.
But if they just turned off their customer service to not deal with it, that would be beyond bad. Seems very unlikely though.
Anyways, there isn’t a damn thing any airline could do today. The monsoon turned to hail and I’d be much more pissed if they flew me in it rather than strand me.
Also apparently a database crashed at DFW airport, so all flights are cancelled due to that. Although the weather isn’t letting up at all, other than for 5 minutes here and there.
Phone # working properly as of 7:25pm
Couple of things here. If you use a travel agent then you can call them instead of trying to call the airline 1-800 number. The travel agent can access your reservation on their computer and make any changes for you, and by the time you get to the head of the line, all the airline person has to do is hand you your new boarding passes.
To the poster who made the comment about “it’s not like snow on the field and flights later in the day could operate”, in theory, yes, but they may (probably)don’t have the equipment there to operate later flights, because the planes were supposed to be coming in from somewhere else and didn’t get there, because the flights were cancelled. Contrary to what many people think, airlines don’t have spare planes sitting around, even at their hubs, that can go out at a moments notice. Even if they did, they have to get a crew there to operate the plane.
No, I don’t work for an airline, but I am in the travel industry, and it really is a lot more complicated than most people think it is.
Can’t get through to the 800#? Just call the Spanish 800#. 1-800-633-3711 We did this today at work for an employee who was flying to DFW today. Got right through after 1 ring. They answer in Spanish but all speak English once you start speaking English.
It’s obviously his fault for expecting assistance in response to money taken and service not rendered…
(I kid)
woah looks like i’m gonna get my account banned again.
@jcapello: HOW IS IT that American Idol can accommodate 30 million phone votes every week but American Airlines can’t handle their customers’ call volume when, predictably, bad weather happens?
Nothing to do with the difference between talking to a computer and talking to a human being who needs to be paid.
What makes AA or, in my case, UA, believe they have the right to under-staff the telephone banks when bad weather occurs?
Yeah…someone at AA saw a huge storm heading for Dallas and decided to give half their phone reps the day off (roll)
They probably had the same number of staff as they always do to handle the calls coming in. They just got a larger spike than they generally would because of the sheer number of people affected (DFW is a hub, so this storm probably affected AA flights everywhere, not just out of Dallas).
I’m sure they were calling everyone they could think of to come in and work the phones once they realized what was happening.
But it’s not like you can just grab people at random off the street, hand them a headset, and have them start taking calls.
If AA let their staff at DFW head home early just because they canceled all their flights, that’s a bad decision worth railing against. Getting pissed off because their call center got overwhelmed by a freak storm isn’t.
Wow…there’s a lot of stupid in this thread.
@sourc3: “Oh, and they claimed “weather” (it was the calmest flight I’d ever been on)”
The weather causing the delay doesn’t have to be at the airport you’re landing at. If your connection will be flying into bad weather, there could be an ATC backup – planes have to have more spacing and time to land during bad weather. If there’s bad weather at the origination of your connection, it could be delayed from taking off for the same reasons.
Drew wrote: “Meanwhile, I don’t see any notice about any other airlines canceling all their flights.”
Those other airlines don’t route most of their daily flights through Dallas, where funnel clouds and hail have been reported all afternoon. Seriously – take the SkyLink around DFW. Count all the airplanes belonging to airlines other than American – not even 100, despite the 200+ gates at DFW’s four main terminals.
“Why don’t the phones work?”
LIkely because American contracts for a certain number of voice circuits from their telecom provider. When the number of calls to their Reservations number exceeds the number of contracted open circuits, those calls will be routed to IVR. On a day like today, when American is handling not only regular reservations calls, but also tens or possibly hundreds of thousands more calls than normal, this is perfectly normal and expected; they’e at least trying to help by providing you with an automated system when there is neither the hardware (circuits) or people to help you.
I don’t expect people to know all the ins and outs of telecom or the airline business – but if you want to blame someone for bad service at the airlines, don’t blame the employees. They’ve taken pay cut after pay cut and stayed on the job, dealing with cranky and sometimes unfair customers.
Blame the executives who take millions in bonuses while making flying a frustrating a la carte affair. The service you’re paying for (a flight from a to b, possibly through c) has decreased in cost in real terms over the past ten years, despite the fact that the jet fuel costs over three times as much as it did in 2000.
American could have possibly done something to make your day a little better, but in the end, it comes down to a twenty thousand (or more) people on the ground at DFW, no safe way to operate aircraft on time, and dependencies (like landing slots and open gates at other airports) that can’t be changed on a whim.
I usually defend AA but I must say, I’ve always been underwhelmed at how AA handles accommodations for people due to weather cancellations. I’ve had it happen to me more than once at various elite levels and every time they just sort of go home and leave you looking for hotels. It’d be nice if they at least stuck around at the airport for 90 minutes to help people find hotel rooms.
@Corydon: If AA let their staff at DFW head home early just because they canceled all their flights, that’s a bad decision worth railing against. Getting pissed off because their call center got overwhelmed by a freak storm isn’t.
I disagree. I have sympathy for anyone that had to work through those conditions and perhaps may have sent them home — particularly since customer service calls can be handled at umpteen other venues (including overseas).
My problem with the airlines is that ‘freak storms’ aren’t uncommon. Hurricanes, blizzards, tornadoes, monsoons, tidal waves, ice storms — they happen all the time SOMEWHERE in the world. BAD WEATHER is no excuse for having a customer support telephone system that can’t handle a spike in calls.
Look, I don’t pretend to know how to run an airline, but surely there are ways to have standby Customer Service reps for emergency circumstances. What about part-timers working from home? How about former employees willing to work piecemeal? How about call centers in other time zones? How about a telephone queue that doesn’t hang up on customers? How about redirecting agents from new reservations for an hour until the stranded customers can get help? At the airport itself, why not send some of those front-desk ticket agents back to the concourses to assist with the chaos?
I’m always amused when a storm hits Denver and United has, say, two people staffing the 8 stations at their Customer Service counter where 200 people are lined-up. Doesn’t United employ hundreds of people at that airport? Are you telling me that NONE of them are capable of staffing Customer Service during an emergency? And don’t look for those ubiquitous Customer Service telephones for assistance during an emergency. They, too, disconnect you when the airline is deluged with calls from customers they’ve stranded.
My advice nowadays? Find a comfortable seat near a power outlet because your cellphone battery is sure to go dead while you’re trying to get through to the airline.
@CaliforniaCajun:
Darn well done.
The help-the-customer-after-taking-their-money division isn’t as advanced as the money-taking division. Try calling the money-taking division.
As someone who just drove through this crap to get to work, I can attest that it’s nothing any sane person would want to be driving through. (The prosecution rests, your honor)
AA has its main reservation center just off FAA Blvd near Dallas/Fort Worth International. The two main highways near there–State Highways 114 and 183–are FLOODED. 183 is down to one lane in a lot of spots, and 114 is closed according to local radio traffic reports. Highways all over the Metroplex are shut down due to wrecks or simple water.
From experience and knowledge, AA has reservations centers in other locations, but none overseas from what I am told. However, the size of these centers pales in comparison to the main center here in Dallas. Would you be willing to shoulder the cost of two equally-sized reservation centers just for the 1/12th of the year when AA’s main hub gets smacked around?
Yes, lack of communication is frustrating, especially when you’re stuck in a 70s-era airport with limited entertainment and located in the smack middle of nowhere (by intention), comparatively speaking. On the other hand, sure is nice that DFW Airport is usually on time with limited ground delays–compared to, say, JFK or LGA–and ample parking the remainder of the year, isn’t it?
Why not walk to Atlanta’s Hartsfield airport?
A little-known but handy factiod, if you walk far enough down Atlanta’s concourse D, you will suddenly
find yourself in DWF’s Terminal E, just past gate E38.
Go ahead, call me crazy, but try it, you’ll like it.
Mother nature FTW!
@jcapello: Feel entitled much?
You are wondering where the free cots, backup reservations center (the main one is in Dallas, and they likely sent the employees home so they could actually get home to do things like take care of their kids, which they can’t do if it isn’t safe to leave the airport), emergency plows, extra buses, and tens of thousands of phone lines are?
Here’s a hint: Those things are expensive. If you want those things, they most certainly can be included in your ticket price, if you don’t mind that ticket price going up. Over and over, the American public has shown themselves to be tolerant of lousy service, because they want to pay the absolute lowest for a ticket.
If you’re ever stuck in D/FW, head to terminal D (the newest terminal) – lots of room, plenty of food options. AA has plenty of room to improve, but I’m finding it hard to get really mad at them when their biggest hub (AA is in 4 terminals & approx. 110 gates) is shut down by weather, completely wrecking the schedule NATIONWIDE. I would think bringing in a couple extra shifts to work the phones would barely put a dent in the number of reservations they have to change.
Sounds like AA needs to due some call routing management or at least hire a few more CS agents.
@wesmills: Well, it’s a shame that there are no other suitable locations for call centers other than Dallas.
@IceTrojan: You try changing your flight plans without getting bent over by the airline. THAT’s why it didn’t happen, I bet. And you can still wind up screwed by this kind of thing out of the blue too. How do you know he knew this was happening.
as a pilot, i say get over it. You really want to fly in unsafe weather? Not with me.
@jcf70816: Do travel agents routinely stay late in their offices so they can answer angry calls from passengers at say 7:25 PM? Seriously, it’s been so long since I’ve used a travel agent that it would be nice to know if you can count on them outside of regular business hours in a case like this.
I also think that no matter how crappy the weather was outside the airport and making it hard for AA employees to get home, you would think that it being an AA hub full of passengers who are going to need to get somewhere, sometime, that there would at least a few AA employees left on duty through the night to try to start the process of rebooking the stranded passengers a little bit earlier than making them all stand in a huge line first thing in the morning. No, I take that back, that’s too much to ask, too sensible.
@pshifrin Keep that under your hat. If “everyone” knows it won’t work as well for you and I in the future. Also as an added benefit you don’t get a Mumbai accent from an outsourced call center.
@jcapello: “If AA let their staff at DFW head home early just because they canceled all their flights, that’s a bad decision worth railing against. “
God forbid those AA workers at DFW get to leave their jobs early when flooding is prevalent and they may not be able to leave later.
I mean, hell. Let their kids wonder where mom and dad are while thunderstorms, hail and funnel clouds pound the DFW area. Mom and dad might have some customers to asuage at the airport, after all.
More proof that people these days think first and foremost about themselves.
@doctor_cos: “Well, it’s a shame that there are no other suitable locations for call centers other than Dallas.”
Yes, damn American Airlines to hell for wanting to employ local people at decent jobs. They should farm all that help over to India so that we can all bitch and moan about it even more.
You want customer service? Then get ready to pay a thousand dollars for an advance purchase nonrefundable coach class ticket for a cross country ticket.
Because the cost of jet fuel is sky high and you’re still paying 1999 prices for tickets. Reality enters the equation when you suddenly realize that the airlines have cut their employees’ pay several times and don’t offer the service you think they used to.
@coddat: I was just going to say the same thing– it was probably a decision on the part of the DFW station management to allow their employees the opportunity to go home early, before it got too late and they, too, were stranded at the airport…
While I have plenty of negative things to say about the airlines and the way they treat both their employees and their passengers, allowing people to leave early and close when there is inclement weather is a good thing– a kind gesture on the part of AA.
I’m sure there’s still some AA employees floating around there at the airport somewhere, and chances are this guy has already been rebooked on another flight but just doesn’t know it yet…
Things happen– storms happen, flights get cancelled. It doesn’t really seem like AA didn’t anything wrong here and that all of the airlines are having the same problem. It sucks to be stranded in Dallas with no idea when you’re going to leave, but this is just one of those things that you can’t predict and that isn’t really anyone’s fault.
I think somebody got its facts wrong. The employees who left early were not the ones in answering the phone calls but the ones in the ramp. Thunders and funnel clouds are sometimes the reason of why operations are stopped and no plane can join/leave from the gates ( they need the wing walkers and bag loaders to do the work you know…)
Another little fact being ignored is that one of the control towers got evacuated because of fears of a tornado.
So what is it now? AA needs to have robots working the ramp and the tower control. Most likely somebody is going to complain because they are putting people out of their job… yadda yadda
American Airlines, there’s something special in the ground!
Oh, and one other thing– most airlines have a policy of not allowing a passenger on a flight when they are going to get stranded at their connection.
Since the OP stated that he was on a non-AA flight TO Dallas, I have to imagine that he bought two separate tickets and that AA didn’t know he was flying in from somewhere else and that the airline that brought him to DFW didn’t know he had an outbound connection in DFW…
While I don’t want to jump on the “blame the consumer” bandwagon, it kinda seems like he got himself into this pickle.
Why did the OP get on the flight to DFW if that wasn’t his final destination– especially in situations like this, where there’s not going to be any hotels in Dallas, there’s not going to be any place to sleep in the airport, and there’s no way to know when he’s going to get out of there…
It’s better to be stranded at home rather than in some connection city, right? And he said his flight to Dallas was six hours late– what did he think was going to happen?…
Even if his AA DFW flight hadn’t been canceled, he wouldn’t have made it on time… And the people working his AA DFW flight, which I imagine was scheduled to leave HOURS before he even arrived in Dallas, would have left long before his flight even touched down.
Let this be a lesson to other travelers: never, ever book tickets separately. Seriously. If you book tickets separately, you have no protection at all– had his AA DFW flight actually left on-time and his inbound flight arrived six hours late, causing him to miss his connection, both airlines would tell him he was SOL. And they have every right to, because they held up their end of the contract, which was getting him from Point A to Point B– they knew nothing about the secondary contract that gets you from Point B to Point C and have no legal obligation to ensure that you get to Point C.
Plus, if it had all be put on one ticket, he never would have been put on the flight to DFW, and would have never been stranded in Dallas, in the first place…
I flew DFW-BOS on the 6:25am flight on the 18th. We luckily left on time with maybe an 80% load factor since the storms hadn’t hit yet. Since there was severe weather predicted, I was quite surprised that more people did not show up earlier and fill the flight. At the very least, I believe AA elites shouldn’t have a problem getting put on an earlier flight in those circumstances (even if they hadn’t had their flight affected by weather yet.) And the DFW-BOS route is certainly quite full of passengers with high-tier elite status, especially on an early morning flight like that. So where were they? Certainly they had access to weather reports. I have never had any problems as a DL elite getting reaccommodated if it looks fairly certain that there will be bad weather en route, nor in general on other airlines. And that is just being speculative as to delays; if the flights are already delayed and it looks like I will misconnect, I have never had an airline not at least make a good attempt to reroute me (and they generally have.)
Reader Drew should have been proactive in looking for other connections as soon as it was apparent that he would misconnect with his original connecting flight in DFW, which probably wouldn’t have been more than a couple hours after his initial planned departure. It does not appear to me that he did that, instead opting to fly to DFW 6 hours late and then pass the buck on to AA. Why would anyone leave their originating city 6 hours late without having done anything to try to improve their chances of getting to their destination without serious delays?
Now, I think AA should have had a contingency plan to have more representatives available in a situation like this, but due to the magnitude of this event I can understand why they wouldn’t. They had hundreds of cancellations, and all flights are booked up for the next couple days now. All over the place, too, since MANY planes are out of position due to not being able to fly in/out of DFW. Again, you need to be PROACTIVE when you are traveling to try to avoid a situation like this. Even if Reader Drew got through to AA after arriving at DFW, he most certainly wouldn’t have been given any options past taking a flight a day or two later since many other people would have been rebooked by then and filled up most available seats.
I would have more sympathy if Reader Drew had been denied at least an attempt at reaccomodation at his originating airport, rather than trying to call AA after getting in on a flight that had been delayed for six hours.
As for AA employees leaving the airport early, well, that part is inexcusable in my book. They should be paid extra overtime to stay late in a situation like this so that there are more humans to deal with all the stranded passengers. There are many inexperienced flyers who need to deal with a real person in a situation like this, especially if the phone lines are over capacity. But anyone savvy enough to be writing in to The Consumerist should also be savvy enough to not have arrived at DFW in such bad weather on such a delayed flight without having previously tried for an alternate routing.
Reader Drew fails to mention where he was coming in from, what airline he was arriving on, how long of a connection he had, whether it was an international arrival, whether he had a single ticket or had booked the flight out of DFW separately (generally a bad idea), whether he attempted to have his original flight rerouted after the flight to DFW was delayed, etc. He is simply complaining that AA did not answer the phones. But, again, did he seriously expect to easily get through to a human when it appears his first attempt to contact them was after getting to DFW many hours late in the middle of a severe weather event? (And I have to mention that AA had a fair amount of delays at ORD, their second largest hub, due to weather as well. Not a good day for them.)
As to the separate ticket issue, it’s Reader Drew’s own problem if he DID have a separate ticket from DFW and arrived late, for whatever reason. (Again, generally a bad idea to have separate tickets in a situation like this.) If he was on the same ticket as I assume he was, it’s up to the ticketing or handling airline to reroute him. But he needs to ask them to do that, not sit around and wait to get to Dallas where he is certain to miss his flight.
Oh yeah-and I have to add that I don’t even like AA very much. I was traveling on them this morning due to revenue tickets very being expensive and AA frequent flier miles being the best to burn for this trip. But I still don’t think they did anything wrong, other than perhaps send some DFW employees home earlier than they should have.
@I Ain’t Tryin’ a Hear Dat!:
Agreed about airlines not putting a passenger on a flight if they can’t make their connection (or be rebooked on a different connection.) But this, in my experience, often does not apply when you are interlining from one airline to another; if it’s your final leg with airline A and you are connecting to airline B, all airline A may care about is getting you to your final connection point with them. (But, of course, the ticketing airline still has the responsibility of reaccommodating you if you miss airline B’s connection, assuming it is on a single ticket as it almost always should be.) So one does need to be more proactive in an interlined (multiple airline) connection situation if it looks like there will be a misconnect or other problem.
It’s pretty simple. If you are delayed, figure out if you are going to miss your connecting flight. Check the weather at your connecting city/cities. Check the flight status on your connecting flight(s). If any of the above are problems, talk to an agent immediately (at the airport or on the phone.) Not after you get to somewhere in the middle of your trip that has funnel clouds and microbursts bearing down on it.
To paraphrase the great Louis CK..
‘you know, there was terrible weather in a city I had a flight out of once and they ALSO canceled the flight’
‘Holy shit really? Wow, you fucking old lady, that’s amazing!’
@psychos: Ya, that’s what I was saying.
I knew he was interlining (the OP states as much in his email), and generally if the entire routing is printed on the same ticket stock, airline A will be more attentive about making sure that you’re not stranded at your connection, even if it’s airline B operating the second leg…
Not as attentive as if it was airline A operating the entire routing, but attentive none-the-less– if he misconnects on airline B because of airline A, it’s airline A’s responsibility to get him rebooked, so they’re usually pretty good about it… So long as it’s all one ticket.
I imagine that the OP, to save a buck, booked two separate tickets– perhaps a WN ticket from his home airport to a connection on AA in DFW to his final destination.
If that was the case, airline A, the one that brought him to DFW, would have never even known that he had an outbound connection and would not have advised him to stay at his home airport until he could be reaccomodate.
Savvy, frequent travelers/consumers would never, ever book two separate tickets for one routing because of the inherent risk involved… Hopefully this unfortunate case can serve as a hard-lesson-learned for anyone who was thinking about booking seperate tickets to save a buck (or ten).
It’s just not worth it.
@Buran: Actually, I’ve never been bent over by AA, and I’ve flown many flights. In fact, AA has changed my flights around weather every time I’ve asked, and has saved me every single time I’ve needed them to. I also help things along by NOT FLYING INTO BAD WEATHER LIKE A DUMBASS.
I also happen to check the weather in the cities I’m flying to, especially in the winter and spring. Don’t you all (besides Drew) check the weather before you drive to work?
(I also can’t help but notice that most of the whiners wrote only a few lines, and most of the ones who are in the know had substantial posts. Interesting, but not surprising. While everyone is busy bitching, I’ve already gotten my boarding pass next flight).
@DogTown:
Yeah…real dumb to locate a hub at DFW… it’s not like they’re the world’s biggest airline or anything.
My dad is stranded in Atlanta going to TX from this…
@scoosdad: There are lots of travel agents like me who work from home who are available 24/7 to their clients, and then there are those that utilize a back-up service, so the answer to your question….while I can’t speak for every travel agent, yes, there are some that are available 24/7.
I can’t believe that everyone got so freaked out by a little storm. The flights got grounded because the scaredy-cats at the FAA freaked out about the funnel clouds and decided to evacuate the control towers. Of course, it could have been the 70 mph straight winds that caused them to wimp out. Those weenie pilots should show some backbone!
700 flights got canceled, I’m not great at math but I think if there were 20 people on each canceled flight that would be 14,000 people who needed to get in touch with AA at the same time. They should be taken out and shot for not having enough CSRs to handle the volume!
The really bad part? All the humidity made my hair frizzy, and it is all AA’s fault!

@IceTrojan: Yes, once your flight is delayed, you can just pick and choose from ANY reroute in the whole world! You have total control over that — at least on Bizarro World. In this one, you don’t. Seriously, have you EVER been on a flight? I don’t understand how you could say something like that with any, any information whatsoever.
Weather delays (when genuine, which they aren’t always) are unavoidable, and it helps to have patience and a sense of humor. It ALSO helps to have airline personnel on the ground doing their best to help people out, which seems to be severely lacking for AA in Dallas today.
OK, so the real deal is that the airlines have scheduled more flights than they have capacity for. One thing goes wrong and then there’s a domino effect and flights are delayed for days.
I fly about once a month and I haven’t had a flight in recent memory where at least one leg wasn’t delayed by an hour or more. This is not acceptable.
@IceTrojan: So, if you have an important business meeting in Omaha, and there turns out to be bad weather that day, you just tell your business associates to fuck off? Or if you’re headed home for your grandmother’s funeral in Chicago but Illinois is windy, you just send a couple carnations and a card? I seriously doubt it. If so, the phrase for you that’s coming to mind is not “smart traveler.”
What is the recorded info? I know that I have often been rescheduled and AA has called me before I was able to get through to them. If they are busy rescheduling all of their passengers and making notification calls instead of answering phones, it may not be so bad. Maybe the recorded info is something to that effect?
Re: No people answering phones – this is the problem with having a major hub, corporate headquarters, and large call centers all in the same area. Just when you need them the most, the employees that you depend on are stuck in traffic or in drainage ditches (or both).
Re: Dumb place to locate a major Airline hub – Any other city in the middle of the country (Chicago? St. Louis? Denver?) will have similar issues, depending on the time of year. Of course, most of the others will also be more susceptible to more disruptive snow and ice.
Re: Cancelled all flights for the rest of the day despite no snow – Wind gusts were regularly too high to safely takeoff/land, and like a previous commenter said, the area has a history of microburst wind shear in those kind of conditions. Look up Delta Air Lines Flight 191 for more info.
@billbillbillbill: Given that it is currently 70Â°F/21Â°C in Houston with a 0% chance of rain (according to weather.com), it sounds like it is the better place to be.
Unless you’re sitting in the airport with 50,000 other stranded passengers instead of the comfort of your own home (assuming it wasn’t in danger), of course.
My friend is currently sitting on the tarmac en route from DFW to LGA. Her flight was scheduled to depart at 1pm (CT) today. Though it has yet to take off (now the airline is citing adverse weather conditions in New York), it seems at least slightly more hopeful that she is actually on a plane.
Also, while she was unable to get through to anyone on the phone since her original flight was cancelled on Tuesday, she was able to get seats on subsequent flights by talking to the counter agents directly, and also by showing up for the earliest scheduled flights of the day to try and get a seat. I know no one WANTS to spend a full day at the airport hoping to maybe possibly get a flight, but it seems worth it if you really want/need to get to your destination.
A.A. gave a big F.U. to all of their Customers by not staffing the AIRPORT to assist customers with booking new flights. Nevermind the phone lines, they should have handled it all face-to-face.
@picardia: I think that you’ve shown yourself to be the not so “smart traveler”…
In fact, yes, I know the weather before I take off, and I will get myself rerouted. “Oh, there are t-storms in Dallas? Route me through Chicago!” Obviously, since you’re too retarded to actually do that, you’ve never experienced the joy of boarding a new flight why people such as yourself stand around moaning and groaning as your flight was delayed. And yes, ANY routing… I once flew from San Francisco to New York via Miami because of weather in both Chicago and Dallas, and the direct flight was full. So if that’s “Bizarro world,” then I’m living in it.
Oh, and what would I do if I had to be in Omaha if it’s clear weather is going to keep me from getting there?
–1st call to AA, “Hi, can you fly me to Sioux City instead?”
–2nd call to business meeting, “Hi, I’m going to be about an hour or two late because of the weather, so I hope you understand. But I’m so committed to making this deal happen that I’m driving from Sioux City to make it happen.”
Actually, for a business meeting, I would fly in the day before to make sure that problems like this don’t happen.
What about the funeral?
Call to AA, “ORD is closed? How about fly me to Indianapolis via Dallas or St. Louis? I’ll take it… it’s my supposed grandmother’s funeral and all…”
How do you like them apples? Retard. (That’s the phrase that comes to mind when I think of you).What's new with Marpa

This follows the literature, but I presented it a little differently -- rather than explicitly "augment" the grammar, I point out that I can assume that the augmented start rule exists, without loss of generality. I took this approach because it is orthogonal with the way I handle most other grammar rewrites in the paper.

News of the latest prosecution for forced labor in Florida’s fields — the eighth since 1997 — made hardly a ripple when it broke last week.
Only a handful of Florida papers ran short, backpage stories on the unsealing of the indictment in federal court. Florida’s agricultural industry, for its part, took no responsibility. For industry leaders, every new case of slavery comes, afresh, as its own shocking and lamentable aberration — isolated anomalies without any underlying systemic explanation. Rogue farm bosses, one and all.
And, of course, retail food companies that buy Florida produce said not a word.
But despite press indifference, and the agricultural industry’s unending claims of ignorance, the call for retailers to take real responsibility for inhumane conditions in their supply chains is rising by the day. This message found a voice in the growing alliance between farmworkers and consumers through the Campaign for Fair Food. And now echoes of that call are being heard at the highest levels of government and society, both here and across the Atlantic!
First it was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, calling out companies that turn a blind eye to slavery in their supply chains for their “reckless disregard.” This rebuke and demand for action, coming last month at the ceremony in which the CIW’s Laura Germino was recognized for her contributions to the fight against modern-day slavery, was well received. From The Nation:
Now comes news of a powerful speech given late last month by Britain’s Prince Charles at a meeting of the Consumer Goods Forum in London, an organization that “brings together the CEOs and senior management of around 650 retailers, manufacturers, service providers and other stakeholders across 70 countries,” according to the group’s website. The combined annual sales of their members totals over $2.5 trillion.
Although it is little known on this side of the ocean, Prince Charles in fact has long been active in advocating for more sustainable agricultural practices, particularly when it comes to better stewardship of the earth’s natural resources, our rainforests, water, and soil. But his vision of a truly sustainable agricultural industry goes beyond caring for natural resources. As Alice Waters told the New York Times, “He is, in private, really one of the most forward-thinking, radical humanitarians I have ever talked to.”
But if his recent speech to the world’s leading CEOs is any indication, it seems that the Prince can be pretty rousingly forward-thinking in public, too. His presentation focused primarily on the urgent environmental crisis, and used the degradation of the world’s fisheries as an example of the kind of life-and-death problems we are facing on the global level. He underscored the desperate need for action by retail companies to demand the highest standards from their suppliers if we are to avoid disaster. In short, he called for a new paradigm, one based on a genuine commitment by retail leaders that goes beyond quarterly profits and places real value on measurable ecological and humanitarian standards in their supply chains. Here is an extended excerpt:
Prince Charles’ speech was a passionate call to action and truly a must-read. As Eric Schlosser said about the Prince and his commitment to sustainable food in a separate context, it’s hard to “think of any American political figure who has spoken (as) eloquently or bravely about these issues.”
The speech is also a perfect parallel to the Campaign for Fair Food’s call for urgent action to end the human rights crisis in the agricultural industry.
Labor-intensive food crops are produced, almost without exception, by exploited labor. And for the most part, this is true whether the production is conventional or organic. In the case of plantation-scale agriculture like that found here in Florida, farmworkers all too often face horrific abuses, including sub-poverty wages, systematic wage theft, sexual harassment, structural disregard for workers’ health and safety, forced and unpaid overtime, and, in the most extreme cases, modern-day slavery.
Respect for human rights must be an integral element in any meaningful definition of sustainable food, and for that definition to become a reality, the major retail purchasers of produce must use their volume purchasing power to demand fair labor standards in the fields where they buy their produce.
This won’t be easy. It will require new levels of transparency in global supply chains to allow for the accurate tracking of sustainable products and a verifiable commitment to fairness-based purchasing principles by which purchases are directed towards growers with improving labor practices and away from growers on whose farms the worst abuses are found.
But with a growing and vibrant alliance of workers, consumers and, now, more and more political leaders every day, true sustainability is possible.DNR Suspends Poacher's License To Harvest Oysters
Annapolis, Md. (February 2, 2011) — The Maryland Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) has served John Hunter Haddaway, 23 of Tilghman, Md.,
with an Order for Summary Suspension, suspending his entitlement to harvest,
buy, sell or cull oysters for the remainder of the 2010-2011 season. Haddaway
was most recently apprehended for harvesting oysters from an oyster sanctuary,
his eighth natural resource violation since 2005.
“These offenses represent a serious violation of the public’s trust that must be met with serious consequences,” said DNR Secretary John Griffin. “We must continue to send the message to poachers that abuse of our shared resources, and putting the future of those resources at risk, will not be tolerated.”
On January 17, 2011, Haddaway was arrested by Maryland Natural Resources Police (NRP) officers and charged with poaching oysters from an oyster sanctuary. After observing Haddaway dredging for oysters five miles northwest of Crisfield in the Tangier Sound Oyster Sanctuary, NRP officers seized 12 bushels of oysters from his boat and returned them to the sanctuary. A trial date for this offense has been set for March 31, 2011 in the District Court of Maryland for Somerset County.
Haddaway was previously apprehended on December 22, 2010 with 15 bushels of oysters onboard his vessel north of the Tangier Sound Oyster Sanctuary, three bushels above the authorized limit. He was charged with exceeding the daily bushel limit for oysters and failing to display his Tidal Fishing License number on the vehicle transporting his catch. He is scheduled to appear in court for both charges on March 10, 2011.
In the past, Haddaway was convicted of with several other natural resource violations; in December of 2007, he was convicted for taking oysters without a commercial license; on January 2007, he was convicted for possession of undersized oysters; in December of 2006, he was convicted for possession of undersized oysters; in September of 2006, he was convicted for crabbing without a commercial license; and in January of 2006, he was convicted for taking oysters without a commercial license and dredging for oysters in a restricted area.
Since 1994, the Chesapeake Bay oyster population has languished at 1 100,000 bushels a year since 2002, while the number of oystermen working Maryland’s portion of the Bay has dwindled from more than 2000 to just 550.
Last year, Governor Martin O’Malley put in place an Oyster Restoration and Aquaculture Development Plan. The plan increased Maryland’s network of oyster sanctuaries — from 9 percent to 24 percent of remaining quality habitat; increased areas open to leasing for oyster aquaculture and streamlined the permitting process; and maintainedIntroduction.
To understand the selection process, this article first looks at issues that confront the company buying the software and the vendor selling the software. Understanding the issues confronting each side, the article considers what value can be gained by combining the best of the functions and features approach with a business processes approach.
This is Part Two of a two-part note.
Part One looked at the buyer's perspective.
Seller's Perspective
The vendor's approach to software selection has its merits although the methodology may have a built in bias. Vendors are obviously interested in their software and want to get to the decision, good or bad, in the fastest route possible. On the vendor side, however, there can be detours. These detours include the unduly long and costly sales cycle to educate potential clients of software offerings, painstaking and numerous responses to questionnaires, and the possibility of pursuing a mismatched opportunity. All of these can cause a project to go terribly awry, increasing the time and money vendors must expend in the pre-sales cycle. Some may argue that this is just the cost of doing business and it is built into the software prices. While this suspicion may true, it is only built into your software price if you make the decision to buy. As a result, you may also be paying for the costs and time invested in sales cycles for unsuccessful clients.
Vendors will argue that by implementing their software with little or no modifications, the client can take advantage of the best practices embedded in the software. Furthermore, according to software vendors, buyers should concentrate on the
business-critical processes. Vendors will argue that you should not waste your time on minor functions and features, RFPs, and analysis of checklists. However, unless the client has the discipline and commitment to embrace these practices, havoc and dissention may prevail. Typically, clients do not foresee the impact of best practices in terms of the changes in their organization or they underestimate the degree of internal resistance. Consequently, departments balk at using the software unless it works and feels like the old software. Can you spell "enhancements?"
Vendors are also confronted by an emotional issue when they persist in their approach of selling business processes or solutions. This approach is not your typical business model whereby the buyer of software and services must conform to the methodology of the seller. Buyers prefer to present their requirements in a format that they are comfortable with. Furthermore, they are more comfortable with defining what they need and letting the vendors document how they can satisfy these needs. In so doing, the buyer always has the excuse that the vendor did not disclose certain issues. To counter, the vendor blames the buyer for not doing its due diligence. Let the finger pointing begin.
If buyers and sellers proceed down the business process and solution path, there may be another issue waiting for them during the implementation. Having inadequate information to assess the software's ability to fill gaps can result in software failing to meet intended expectations that were never investigated. Fear and loathing will be followed by the dreadful "scope creep" to make up for perceived lost functionality. Furthermore, this type of situation, where little documentation is available, makes it difficult for even the most experienced consultants to step in, save the day, and constructively assist the client in making proper software and technology decision.
Failed projects do not bode well for the vendor. Their sales cycle costs can only rise even more and their reputation can suffer or, at least, become suspect. Surely, the consequences can be much more severe for the client where an incorrect software selection can lead to business losses. Accordingly, it is in everyone's best interest to select the right enterprise software and do it economically but with confidence.
Combing the Best of Both Approaches—The Third Alternative
The buyer wants comfort, coverage, and adequacy so that their needs will be satisfied.
The seller wants speed, efficiency, and satisfaction when selecting their out-of-the-box solutions. It's the classic "men are from Mars, women are from Venus" confrontation. The dilemma is that both approaches have merits and objectives that you want to preserve. How can we combine the best of both worlds?
The proposed combination is a two-step process. First, use a software selection service to develop your short list of two or three vendors. Then, let the vendors conduct orchestrated demos to ensure that your business critical processes can be accommodated.
The selection service will provide the user with the comfort and confidence that their needs are considered. After going through the function and features checklist and using an automated software tool to match these requirements against vendor capabilities, users should be assured that their needs have been adequately addressed. This does not mean that users have to take the vendors' abilities on blind faith. Hopefully, however, the number of questions and "show me" requests can be limited to a critical few as opposed to an inconsequential many.
With the short list of vendors, you can proceed with a degree of confidence into the vendor demos and presentations. These demos would concentrate on the processes critical to how your company does business and what makes it unique. While users would provide the scenarios and data, vendors "strut their stuff" and prove their statements and claims of functionality. This is not to say that you cannot address other uncertainties within the user community, but this can be kept to a minimum and of course, users will have the opportunity to talk to their counterparts when checking references.
Consultants familiar with the class of software being selected can assist in developing the scenarios. Furthermore, consultants can be useful in organizing and running the demo, allowing your company to devote its full attention to the demo results.
While attempting to combine the best aspects of the two approaches, the third alternative also can assist your company in completing the process effectively while requiring less of your company's time and money. Shown in figure 2 is a comparison of the steps for the third alternative and the more traditional approach. It takes many more steps in the traditional approach to get to the same place in the third alternative, namely the short list of vendors.
Figure 2: Comparison of Approaches
More importantly, in using the traditional approach, it could take more than two months to arrive at the short list of vendors. This assumes that you have everyone's cooperation and their schedules can accommodate the project. Using the third alternative, you could realistically identify the short list of vendors in two weeks, even allowing for some adjustment of priorities.
Summary
Prior to Y2K many software applications had suffered from years of neglect. Software processes had been held together with band-aids patches. Y2K changed this paradigm into a replace, not rewrite, mentality. Accordingly, evaluating and selecting software has become a more common occurrence for IT and user departments. The common focus that both buyers and sellers share in this process, is to do it as confidently and efficiently as possible.
The third alternative for selecting software, as discussed in this article, attempts to provide assurances needed by the buyer and the efficiency desired by the vendor. Use a selection service to quickly arrive at your short list of vendors who can meet the majority of functional requirements of your user departments. Then, let these vendors demonstrate their solutions with your business-critical processes and confirm them through reference checking.
A software selection service can save you time and money. It does not, nor should it, select a vendor at the push of a button. One-on-one time with the vendors is still needed.

or click "post a comment" belowIt's no secret that group buy is more or less in shambles in China for everyone but a few of the top players. But it seems even some of those top players aren't immune to the industry's problems, as analysts have pointed out what seems to be a sort of exodus of high-level management from Chinese group buy companies.
For example, 55tuan lost its vice-chairman Chen Yongjun despite its status as second place in the contentious market; Mr. Chen left the company to join Lafaso, a more traditional e-commerce site. Manzuo, another top group buy site, also lost its vice-chairman; Si Xinying apparently left the company for a position in the media industry. Ganji (another vice-chairman), Gaopeng (a CEO), and other group buy sites have all also recently lost upper management staff. Insiders at 24quan, another top group buy outfit, say that numerous upper management types are making plans to leave that company as well, mostly because of disagreements with the CEO.
Whatever the reasons, the loss of experienced upper management probably isn't good for China's fledgling -- and floundering -- group buy industry. It's also significant that most of these people are moving to other industries; in some cases, even industries like traditional e-commerce that compete directly with group buy for customers.

Swan Telecom promoter Shahid Usman Balwa Monday moved the court hearing the 2G spectrum case, seeking permission to withdraw the answers given by him earlier in response to the court's questionnaire.
"This was a bona fide mistake and the same was neither intentional nor deliberate but only due to an inadvertent error of recording the answers on the court's computer," said Balwa, who faced court's ire last week with the Central Bureau of Investigation Special Judge O. P. Saini saying that he "deserved" to be taken in custody for his misconduct.
The court Saturday said that Balwa had "embarrassed" it a lot due to his conduct and asked if he has not understood the questions of the court during recording of his statement, then why has he given answers to them.
Balwa told court Monday that he will "not raise any question of prejudice caused to him on the ground of non-understanding of any questions" asked by the court and requested to take on record the written answers afresh.
He was handed over a questionnaire with 1,700 questions running into 824 pages March 27 by the court. The questions are part of the recording of the statement of the accused in the case.
Balwa in his plea said that he had understood the court's queries and he required no further clarification on it.
The court fixed the matter for further hearing May 16 and asked CBI to file its reply.

Pisces | Aquarius | Capricorn | Sagittarius | Scorpio | Libra | Virgo | Leo | Cancer | Gemini | Taurus | AriesMonday, July 27, 2009
The Apalachicola Ecosystems Project is a summer dig. Wearing 100 percent Deet spray and leather work boots, students in Dr. Thomas Foster’s Archeology Field School are spending four weeks literally digging their way through summer with shovels, trowels and hatchets. They’ll receive four credit hours and a valuable experience no classroom can give.
Foster, assistant professor of anthropology and director of the Waring Archeological Laboratory, is investigating a 17th century Native American village in a remote forest that borders the meandering Chattahoochee River.
“Anthropology is a lot like being a detective examining a crime scene and looking for clues,” explained Foster at the pits. “Here there is evidence of possible rituals and feasting ceremonies.”
This summer, 13 students enrolled in his field school to help with the archeological research project. They’ll use all the knowledge they’ve gained in class to explore the remains of the 400-year-old village.
Every discovery of a bead, pottery shard or button is saved, stored and documented for future research. Hitting 90 degrees and higher, the site is a flurry of activity where teams of students dig layer by layer into clay and soil, sift through a variety of sediments to discover the smallest and largest artifacts the pits have to offer and then meticulously document everything.
“Undergrads have a chance to do real research,” said Matt Boehm, a volunteer graduate student assisting the dig. “Normally this type of research is offered on the master’s level.”
Students are learning multiple phases of archaeological investigation ranging from field reconnaissance, orienteering, survey and test unit excavation. They’ll also learn to use GPS and surveying equipment, a compass and cameras.
Students at the dig are majoring in anthropology, history and chemistry mirroring the wide applications of anthropological studies.
“This is the best time of my life,” said Nancy Garner, a history major, echoing the group opinion. “This puts what we learned in the classroom in perspective.”
The Department of Anthropology is a unique degree program because of the Antonio J. Waring Jr. endowment that supports the program and the Waring Archeological Laboratory.
The Waring Lab is the only facility of its type in Georgia specifically designed to meet both academic needs and federal standards for the curation of archaeological collections.

In a post on his Twitter, Johnson denied speculation that he was trying to buy the Los Angeles Clippers from embattled team owner Donald Sterling.
The logic is a little fuzzy — just because a team has an owner, that doesn't mean it can't be bought, right?
Johnson belongs to an ownership group that owns the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Johnson's name was mentioned in racist comments attributed to Sterling on a recording obtained by TMZ. Johnson has vowed never to attend a Clippers game as long as Sterling remains the owner.

Digging project removing contaminants from Oak Harbor lot
Neither a fast-food restaurant nor a seafood joint is being built on the site of the old Ford dealership in Oak Harbor.
At least not yet.
The sight of workers digging at the high-profile location spurred a few rumors, but city officials say it’s part of a clean-up process that began years ago.
The property is located at the intersection of State Highway 20 and Pioneer Way.
City of Oak Harbor’s Development Services Director Steve Powers said remediation overseen by the state Department of Ecology began in the 1990s on the property, which was apparently the site of a leaky fuel tank.
In the current project, the property owner hired Krieg Construction to remove about 100 cubic yards of contaminated soil, which is being taken to a facility and burned.
Powers said the people doing the removal project didn’t realize in the beginning that they needed to go through a State Environmental Policy Act process and make a permit application with the city. He said filling and grading projects involving 100 cubic feet or more of soil must go through both processes.
Powers said the necessary permits were obtained and the project went forward this week. He said the city required the company to hire an archeologist to be on site during the dig and look out for cultural artifacts.
An architect and a construction manager for McDonald’s Corp. submitted a pre-application to the city earlier this year for a 4,386-square-foot restaurant on the site, but the company didn’t go forward with the project.

Community Board 6 indicates several great ways to help locally...
In Park Slope there are 2 emergency shelters operating out of John Jay High School at 237 7th Avenue, and the Park Slope Armory at 361 15th Street. Periodic announcements indicate that at any given time they may be in need of either supplies or volunteers or both.
In Red Hook, the Red Hook Initiative has been coordinating relief and support efforts (and doing a phenomenal job!). Feel free to drop in at 767 Hicks Street or call them at (718) 858-6782.
Also, Give blood. Some of the City's blood supplies were contaminated from flood waters and need to be replaced. The best way to donate locally is to reach out to the NY Blood Center (800) 933-2566 and schedule an appointment at the nearby location in Downtown Brooklyn at 120 Lawrence Street.

- United States Grand Prix - Red Bull
Webber takes blame for missing pole
Mark Webber admitted a mistake in the last two corners of his qualifying lap cost him pole position at the United States Grand Prix.
Webber was on provisional pole after the first runs in Q3 but was beaten by Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel at the final attempt. He set the fastest first and second sectors of anyone but ran wide in the penultimate corner and lost time overall.
"You get two shots [in Q3] and we both had two sets of option [tyres]," he said. "The first part of the lap was very good and I was happy with that, but I didn't quite get [Turns] 19 and 20 as I wanted. If I'd just repeated what I'd done initially in Q3 it was going to be enough, but I just tried to squeeze a little bit more out and it's easy to unload the car a little bit in these conditions."
Webber admitted he was frustrated by his mistakes.
"Sometimes you're happy that you've given your best and you're on the front row, but this time we've let one slip through our fingers," he said. "We're up there and well done to Seb, he put three sectors together and I put two and half together and just dropped it in the last sector. It's not satisfying when you do that and it's not your job to do that."

Cells
The Theme of Structure and Function in Cells
Up until now, we have spent some time (OK, maybe lots of time…stop looking at us like that) describing the junk, er, different components you might expect to find in different kinds of cells. We have also spent a lit—lots of time talking about what each of these unique components do for the cell. That is, we have talked about their functions. Hopefully, by now, you have begun to notice that, in almost every case, the structure of a given cellular component has a lot to do with its function. In fact, one mantra of biology encapsulates this idea perfectly: "Structure dictates function" (you should probably memorize this phrase now). The name for these relationships are, uh, structure-function relationships. To really appreciate how true this idea is, let’s look at a few examples in detail.
Let's zip back to mitochondria and chloroplasts. These organelles are really nothing more than membranes within membranes, with a little space between said membranes. The main function of mitochondria is to convert the energy in glucose to ATP, a usable form of energy for the cell, through the process of cellular respiration. This exceedingly important function is only possible because of the unique structure of the mitochondrial membranes, which allow for an intermembrane space to form where protons can accumulate, and for a matrix to which the protons can flow.
Without the inner mitochondrial membrane, or IMM, there would be no "Hoover Dam" to hold back protons and force them to flow through the ATP synthase rotor. Moreover, the IMM is folded into structures called cristae, which pave the way for millions of ATP synthase complexes to jam into a single mitochondrion. Sounds a little crowded. Without the unique folded structure of cristae, cells would need millions of mitochondria in order to produce the same amount of energy produced by just a few with cristae. Structure dictates function.
As for chloroplasts, without the thylakoid membranes separating the stroma from the lumen, there would be no space for protons to accumulate and flow back into. Without the products produced by the thylakoid membrane proteins, including ATP (we know; he's everywhere), and without a space for glucose to be made, or the stroma, photosynthesis would not occur, and life on Earth as we know it would cease to exist. Are you ready to acknowledge the vital relationship between structure and function yet, or what? Do you want the world to end? DO you?!
In the end, only the structures of the mitochondria and chloroplasts allow the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis to take place. In both cases, the presence of a membrane allows for compartments to form. Those compartments can have different concentrations of hydrogen ions, and it is those differences in concentration that drive formation of important substances.
Ribosomes provide another good example of structure determining function. These small cellular components are made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Their main function is to translate messenger RNA, or mRNA, into strings of amino acids called proteins.
Ribosomes are composed of two main parts:
- A large subunit
- A small subunit.
Let's go back to our picture of a complete ribosome:
The small subunit has a special groove that allows for mRNA to bind to it. Once the mRNA is bound, the large subunit attaches on top, and a complete ribosome is formed. mRNA is pulled through the space between the two subunits as another molecule, transfer RNA (tRNA), binds to a second groove in the ribosome and to the mRNA, leaving behind an amino acid in yet a third groove.
For every three base pairs of mRNA, tRNA leaves behind one specific amino acid. When the end of the mRNA strand is reached, the ribosome subunits detach and let both the mRNA and the newly formed string of amino acids, aka the protein, run free into the big wide world. The grooves of the ribosome allow for mRNA to be held in place while tRNA reads the "code" that determines which amino acid is next in the sequence. It is the very structure of ribosomes that completes the Central Dogma of Biology, or DNA to RNA to Protein.
See?
Without proteins, a big, fat nothing would get done in the cell. N.O.T.H.I.N.G.New To Alive Church?

Mancini 'very happy' to keep Balotelli
Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini says he will not sell Mario Balotelli to AC Milan, insisting he is "very happy" to keep the striker at the club.
While Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi labelled Balotelli "a rotten apple" earlier this week, the seven-time champions of Europe are still reported to be interested in signing the striker.
And Inter Milan, who sold Balotelli to City for £24 million in 2010, have claimed they have first refusal on the Italy international if he leaves the Etihad Stadium.
It is believed City would be willing to let Balotelli leave if the right offer came in, however, Mancini has made a point of quashing these rumours.
"It is not true. I am very, very happy [to keep him]," he said.
Last week, Mancini pledged to give Balotelli "another 100 chances" despite their recent training-ground clash, when the manager was pictured grabbing his player.
Balotelli returned to the City team 48 hours after their altercation, coming on as a substitute in Saturday's 3-0 FA Cup win over Watford. It was his first appearance for almost four weeks, since December's Manchester derby defeat, when Mancini was criticised for selecting his compatriot.
The striker followed this up by appearing for City's Elite Development squad in Monday's 4-0 victory over Blackburn, in which he scored twice. "He went with the Under-21s because he needed a game after 40 days [actually four weeks] without a game," Mancini said. "He played one game and he played well."
City travel to Arsenal on Sunday in the knowledge they have not won a league game away at Highbury or the Emirates Stadium for 37 years.
They lost 1-0 at the Emirates in April - a game in which Balotelli was sent off - to leave them eight points behind Manchester United with only six matches remaining, leading Mancini to hit out at the player after the match.

After the sleep deprivation started to wear off, I caught up with Megan Mcgaughy and John Brophy of The Gingerbread Patriots at a Sunday afternoon house party—complete with cardboard floors, a keg in the corner and a performance by New Zealand's Ryan McPhun and the Ruby Suns. I cornered John and Megan in the back room to ask them a few questions about SXSW, only to discover their plans for relocation.
How's your South By Southwest experience been? Did you see a lot of music?
JB: Yeah. It was harder than last year. We didn't get in to every band we wanted to see because there were long lines. We did end up seeing a lot of great bands, like Ariel Pink, Elf Power and Six Nick Noltes, but we didn't plan on seeing them. We just happened upon them and they were great. Earlimart was pretty cool. We never got a chance to see the Flaming Lips ... well, Jeshua [Brophy] did. I envy him. I wanted to see them, but we had one badge and he got it that night.
How did that work with the badge?
MM: It didn't work very well. I think next year we should plan it where each day one person gets the badge.
JB: When they invited us to play, we could either pick getting paid or get wristbands and a badge—one wrist band for each band member and a badge. Of course, we took the wristbands. We realized, it's kind of a joke, a cruel joke to only have one badge, cause everyone is fighting over it, who gets to use it. Next year we'll know how to do it.
Do you guy check out at anything in the conference center?
JB: No, we didn't go to any of the talks or any of the workshops or stuff. We did go to Flatstock. It's really bad, because you want to spend so much money. There's so many awesome posters and artists. We walked out with a good pile of stuff. That was fun. I wanted to go to some of the talks, but it was hard enough to fit music into our schedule let alone talks.
You came last year?
JB: Yes.
Were you playing an actual showcase?
JB: No, we just came and played some day parties and day show. One on Sixth [Street] at the Co-op bar, and then one at a house party type thing.
How was it different playing an actually showcase?
JB: Free wristbands, number one. That was the coolest. Being on the South by Southwest Web site got us a lot of attention, a lot of people on our web site and Myspace profile finding us through the South by Southwest page, listening to our mp3 on there. Sending us messages saying, "Hey, saw you on there—liked your song." The exposure, basically, being on the listings and people seeing our name, hearing our name. Just being recognized, having people come up to us from different parts of the media, different bands. It's kind of cool.
Any bands you would tell people to avoid at all costs?
JB: I had some pretty big let-downs. I was really excited about the Animal Collective show, and apparently the first half was all improv. It didn't quite sit well with me. It was impressive for them to be doing it, and I admire them for it, but it just didn't work for me. I left and the second half was actually decent from what I heard. That was kind of a let-down for me, cause I was really looking forward to that. Also, they kind of screwed up Ariel Pink's sound, which was a bummer, too.
Anything you can take back to Albuquerque?
JB: You know, we did see quite the Albuquerque presence while we were out here. Friday night there was a big gaggle of musicians and friends at the Animal Collective show all hanging out, as if they didn't know what else to do but hang out with each other.
Would you recommend other bands from Albuquerque to apply for South by Southwest?
JB: Yeah, definitely, of course. It's definitely worthwhile. I think, pretty much anyone who's in a band knows that, but for some reason when the time rolls around we aren't quite as aware of the deadlines as we should be in this community. Next year we're going to be in Portland and we're going to still try to come out, that's going to be quite the distant to come.
Are you guys moving?
JB: Yeah, we're moving to Portland to May. We're all relocating, except for Nate [Santamaria]. Nate is staying with Oktober People and my other brother, Joel, is going to start playing drums. It's going to be us three brothers and Megan--mostly all Brophys. I can't wait to hear what comes out [of the change]. We have almost the exact same voice, me and my younger brother, so whenever we start building three part harmonies it's going to be really weird.

A scheme to impart skills training to senior students has been launched in select government schools in Haryana and will be introduced in 19 states next year, Human Resource Development Minister M.M. Pallam Raju said Friday.
The scheme was launched by the ministry under the National Vocational Education Qualification Framework for students of classes nine to 12.
"In the context of teacher training, a pilot project was started in Haryana based on four sectors - information technology, security, auto and retail - where the standards have been developed by the sector skills council," he said while delivering the keynote address at the inaugural session of the 2nd India-Australia Skills Conference.
He further said that there is an opportunity for sector skill councils in Australia along with the training partners, to work with their Indian counterparts to ensure a world-class outcome.
The conference with its theme 'Training and Industry: Bridging the Skills Divide' was organised by the ministry and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and supported by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).
An initiative of the Australia India Education Council (AIEC), the conference has brought a delegation of experts from Australia's skill sector to explore how they can partner to meet India's burgeoning demand for skills development.
"India needs to train up to 500 million people by 2022, and is projected to add 12-15 million workers to its labour force every year over the coming decades."
"Quality training delivery and standards will be essential, and Australia is well positioned to provide this expertise," said Australia's Acting High Commissioner to India Bernard Philip.
The second edition of the conference intends to build on the success of the first conference that was held in Perth, Australia in July 2012.
The Australian government has funded its Industry Skill Council engagement with India's new Sector Skills Councils in the areas of telecommunication, agriculture, retail, mining and media/entertainment.
Raju also emphasised the need to vastly increase the existing skill capacity of people in India by eight to ten times.
"There is a demand-supply gap for skilled persons in every sector in the economy. It is for all of us to sit and work together to be able to develop sustainable entreprenuerial models that result in great opportunities for training providers in both the countries," he said.
The Australia Skills Mission to India includes representation from Australia's government owned Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutions, private skills training providers, Industry Skills Councils, and Commonwealth and state/territory governments.

*************************************
CVs for International and UN Organisations.
The Profile + Application system is used for jobs in the UN Secretariat (active from March 2010) in a system called 'Inspira'. Most UN specialised agencies, such as WHO, UNESCO and UNICEF, have their own independent online recruitment systems. An increasing number of international organisations, particularly in Europe, have an online application system and also request a CV.
In order to be ready to apply for international jobs, and to network successfully, you need to be ready with an adaptable PHP, a CV, and a cover letter which can be modified to match the requirements of particular jobs.
Employment History: Two Sections in Inspira
The space for describing your work experience in the UN Personal History Profile is broken into two sections for each job:
1. description of duties
2. summary of achievements
This separation is an important feature of the UN application process. It gives an opportunity for applicants to describe their skills and expertise through career achievements as well as to describe job-related duties. Specialised agencies with their own recruitment systems usually do not formally split the work experience in this way, but the emphasis on describing achievements to illustrate key skills and expertise is the same.The number of characters available for each job in UN applications is different:
* Description of Duties: 2500 characters (about 300 words)
* Summary of Achievements: 3700 characters (about 400 words)
Try grouping, or 'clustering', your achievements under keyword headings - transferable skills and competencies - which are used in the target job or field. Avoid long lists of unconnected achievements - find a way to connect them to well known and widely used competencies. For a list of common keywords to use as headings in PHPs, see under 'Resources to Download'.
Also consider highlighting significant training and professional development under 'Achievements', even if this information is given elsewhere in the PHP. Golden rule: highlight anything which is relevant to the target job or field you are going for.
For more on completing the employment history and reasons for leaving, please see the course Handbook, available under 'Resources to Download'.
Preparing for Job Change: Inspira + PHP + CV
Tip: Whatever you do - don't draft new material online! Many people have lost whole drafts which they thought they had saved, but which in fact have disappeared. Draft material offline first.
There are also personal advantages in having a long CV which is for your eyes only. It gives you an opportunity to find out management.
I have found that people who constantly work on their material, updating and revising on a regular basis and getting valuable drafting experience, are much more successful in the job market. They are proactive, not leaving applications to the last minute, preparing material in advance, and overcoming the fear of job applications and career change.
Sometimes it is only by drafting a CV for your own eyes that you find the best wording to use in an actual application. (See the FAQs for more on the 'long' and 'short' CV).
More Tips on PHPs and other Online Applications
* cover letter.
*In most job vacancy announcements, the words used in the selection criteria are more important than those used in the description of duties and responsibilities. Some international organisations, such as FAO and EU agencies, make selection criteria explicit. You should include keywords from this section in your PHP and in the cover letter. In UN Secretariat jobs, pay special attention to the words used under the 'Professionalism' competency. This is the most common place for hiring managers to identify job-specific requirements and will be important in the selection of candidates.
*When describing your achievements, try using keywords related to areas of expertise (eg Human Rights) or competencies (eg Team Leadership) as headings. This will break up the list of bullet points and make your material more relevant to target jobs. Choose your keywords from the vacancy announcement. For this to work, you may need to adapt material from earlier drafts, so don't copy/paste from other applications without making changes.
*Use a variety of dynamic verbs to describe your achievements. See under 'Resources to Download' for a list of good words to use in PHPs and CVs. When describing achievements, try to include the ACTION, CONTEXT and OUTCOME (A-C-O) of each event or project in the statement. Avoid vague statements such as 'performed a range of administrative tasks'. Be specific about numbers when describing size of team, number of clients, budget or material outcomes.
*Keep your description of duties as concise as possible to give the reader an idea of the scope of your responsibilities. If you are applying for a job internally, information about duties can be more extensive. When applying externally, the most important thing is to describe your responsibilities concisely and to give some contextual information about the organisation you work(ed) for (eg 'UN international tribunal focused on war crimes prosecution'). Do not assume that readers will automatically know what your employer does just from the name. Avoid using abbreviations which readers outside your workplace or field of work will not understand.
* Bear in mind that the duties/achievement split is only used by the UN Secretariat and a few other organisations. Most specialised agencies of the UN such as WHO, UNESCO and FAO have their own online systems or use application forms with only one box for duties and achievements combined. This also applies to other IOs such as ICC, OPCW and NATO. My tip for 'one box' PHPs would be to keep your duties as concise as possible (one or two sentences) and then focus on your achievements related to the core requirements of the job. Select the achievements which are most likely to get you an interview. Use a sub-heading such as 'Key Achievements' or 'Significant Contributions' to set these apart from the duties. If you have been more than five years in a job and you have a number of achievements, consider clustering your statements under key competencies or areas of expertise rather than presenting them in a single list.
* Ensure that information about start/end dates, names of supervisors and salaries is correct. Keep a record of this data offline as you may need it for future applications. Always check and update the contact details of your referees.
* If you are promoted to a new level and get a new job title, start a new entry in the PHP. If, however, you take on new responsibilities at the same level, put the information in one entry, and indicate a change of job focus or area of responsibility with start/end dates in brackets. In Inspira, put this information in the 'Duties' section.
* If you have had lots of jobs and cross-training within the same organisation, decide if you need to create separate entries for each job. Will this help your application or make it too crowded? For example, a period of cross-training might stand out more if you create a new entry in your PHP. However, if it is not relevant to the jobs you are going for it might be better to list it as an achievement under your main job. Always think: will the information be relevant to the target job?
* There is no need to repeat duties performed at a promoted level in earlier entries if the employer is the same. The reader will see the promoted level first. Earlier levels will probably include similar duties, in which case write 'Duties as above'. Don't fill your PHP with repeated information.
* Remember, however, that earlier jobs in your career often include particular projects and outcomes which are worth mentioning as achievements. Use earlier jobs to highlight skills and expertise which might be useful in your future career and also to indicate career growth in the past. Always indicate promotions as achievements. For UN jobs, always include employment from the last 15 years. Make sure that the jobs you list give you enough years to meet the minimum years of experience for the target job. Internships and extended voluntary jobs should also be included as well as periods of military service.
* Under 'Reasons for Leaving', indicate positive career direction as far as possible. Don't rely solely on negative reasons such as 'End of contract' or 'Downsizing'. Use verb phrases such as 'Looking for...' or 'Seeking opportunities to...' to indicate your career aims and your reasons for wanting to leave your current job. For earlier jobs, focus on career development as far as possible.
UN and Other Non-profit International Jobs: What Experience is Valued?
Although the UN and other international organisations (IOs) employ a wide range of people in different roles covering almost every field of work, there are certain types of experience which are commonly valued in PHPs and may, in the right circumstances, make you stand out as a candidate.
Whatever you do, proven experience is key, especially experience that gives you useful expertise and skills which are valued. Bear in mind that the UN is not a 'graduate employer' - it rarely employs people directly from university or school. Exceptions to this are the competitive Young Professionals Programme (YPP) and, in some cases, the Junior Professional Officer (JPO) programmes. If you are just starting out, the best thing to do is to apply for an internship and start building experience, professional knowledge, useful skills and contacts. Bear in mind that internships within the UN Secretariat are extremely competitive. You may have more luck with the specialised agencies and independent and smaller international organisations first. (For more on YPP, JPO and internships, please see the links in the side-bar). Consider UN Volunteers (UNV) as another way of gaining experience.
Remember always that UN internships, like UN jobs, are very popular. The 'market' is potentially the whole world. You need to be patient, persistent and creative if you are seriously committed to working in international organisations, and always positive about learning new things. Remember always too that working at the national level - in education, health, human rights, law, business - might ultimately be more rewarding and more successful in long-term career terms than working internationally.
Many international organisations, including the UN, are under financial pressure and constraints, with downsizing a common feature. At the same time, international organisations depend on the commitment and honest energy of many thousands of brilliant and committed people - staff members, contractors and volunteers - who are driven by a humanitarian principle to improve the world without profit as the main concern.
All this considered, what kinds of experience are most valued at the international level within civil society and non profit areas? All organisations and agencies have their own specific competencies and favoured areas of expertise, but some kinds of experience and knowledge are frequently asked for. If you have experience in any of these areas, make the most of them in your PHP or CV:
Working in the field
If you have any experience working in the field, even for a limited period, make sure this is clearly described in your PHP and cover letter. Such experience is increasingly valued in the UN and related organisation such as UNICEF, who direct over 85% of their resources to field operations. Work in conflict zones, emergency situations and highly challenged development contexts warrant significant mention in your PHP. Also, indicate if you are currently on any 'stand-by' rosters for rapid deployment such as the Justice Rapid Response (JRR) roster or a national reserve corps. Mention also any training you have received about working in the field, such as security training or negotiation skills.
When describing any field work, make sure you explain briefly the context, scope and size of the field operation and its intended aim or mandate (one or two sentences). In particularly tricky and hazardous situations where, for example, you had to be evacuated, indicate this in the PHP. Don't assume that people will know all about the situation because it is in the news as a conflict zone.
Focus on specific projects or responsibilities. Where possible, indicate outcomes, both for yourself and the team or mission. Consider developments in your own skill-set and knowledge as achievements. As with all PHPs, select the details which are most relevant to the target job and consider clustering your achievements together under relevant 'transferable' competency headings such as 'Technical Assistance', 'Logistical Support' or 'Providing Legal Advice'. These keywords often appear in vacancies as desired areas of expertise, especially under the 'Professionalism' section of UN competencies.
Note: The 'Professionalism' section is the place in UN vacancy announcements where hiring managers add job-specific requirements to the list of standard UN competencies. These additions often give good clues as to what kinds of experience and knowledge will be valued during the selection process. Another good place to look for useful keywords is the section on 'Screening Questions' which often appears at the end of the PHP.
Managing Projects and Programmes your PHP. If you have lots of project experience, choose the ones which are most relevant to the target job and which have the clearest outcomes.
As with field experience, describe the context and intended aim of the project as well as the results. Remember, when describing your achievements: A - C - O = Action - Context - Outcome (see above for more on this, or see the handout on PHP tips under 'Resources to Download').
If you have a formal qualification in project management (such as Prince 2), include it in your PHP as an achievement and consider also mentioning it in your cover letter. Full details of the qualification can be given under 'Training and Education' or (in Inspira) under 'Certificates and Licences'. However, it may be worth mentioning project management as a professional development achievement in your professional history too, especially if you did the training 'on the job'.
If you have any experience of budget or financial administration, don't forget to include this in your PHP, especially for management-level jobs. It could prove useful as a value-added detail, even if the target job is not related explicitly to budget. Budget experience is particularly useful in small field offices where staff are required to perform a range of functions, but is generally a useful part of anyone's skill set in international jobs.
Raising Money and Making Partnerships
Fund-raising is an increasingly valued area of expertise throughout the non-profit and civil affairs sector, but especially at the international level where donors play such a major role. Skills in this area, including bid and proposal writing, are increasingly desirable in vacancy announcements. Look out for keywords in vacancies such as 'Donor Relations' and 'Stakeholder Management' and use them to structure achievements in your PHP if you have the right experience, however small.
If you have any experience raising money and building good working relations with donors, describe it in your PHP. Don't forget to indicate the outcomes (money raised) and the goals of the fund-raising initiative. Knowledge of relevant information management software in fund-raising and proposal development (for example, Raiser's Edge) could be an asset. If you have any NGO experience, you might find such software a useful addition to your skill set. Experience in writing or contributing to funding proposals (for example, for the European Union) is also proving to be an asset in some international jobs.
Building and maintaining networks and partnerships is another growing area where international non-profit employers look for talent and experience. If you have helped to build a partnership between two organisations or demonstrated skills in liaison and cooperation, make sure you mention this in your PHP with a clear statement of context and outcome. If you liaise in your current work with lots of other organisations and agencies, mention some in your PHP but don't get too carried away with name-dropping: your role in liaison and its outcomes are also important. If you work in a team to build partnerships, give an idea of the size of the team and your particular role in it. Use participation verbs such as 'contributed to' and 'acted as focal point for' instead of 'managed' or 'ran' if you worked as part of a big team. (For more on verbs, see under 'Resources to Download'.)
Communication
All organisations place great value on 'communication skills'. But what do these skills actually mean in practice? In each job there will be particular communication demands. Identifying these in each job might give your PHP an edge.
Instead of saying something vague in your PHP such as 'demonstrated good communication skills', try to be more concrete and job-specific. What kinds of communication skills do you have and what evidence can you give?
Vacancy announcements may give you clues. For example, if a job requires 'giving presentations', could you add to your PHP any examples of proven experience in presenting or public speaking? This may be presentations to colleagues, the public, a conference audience, or as part of a training programme. The ability to present confidently to different audiences is a valued communication skill in itself and is worth mentioning in your application. If any of your presentations are available online as videos, mention this.
Look out in vacancies for keywords such as 'knowledge transfer' or 'information sharing'. These areas, frequently connected to training, learning and resource management, involve communication skills, both written and spoken. Do you have experience in managing and sharing knowledge which you can add to your PHP? Look out in particular for references to online communication such as writing and updating web copy or using social media for outreach. Increasingly, skills in this area are not just the province of media professionals, but belong to everyone. Do you have media experience that you could utilise, such as writing a newsletter, updating a blog, or creating a video for professional use?
Think also about written communication, a massive area of activity in all UN and IO agencies. What are your specific written communication skills? Remember that reporting and drafting are frequently cited as core skills in many jobs. If you have experience in drafting reports, consider mentioning some examples in your PHP with a clear statement of the report's audience and aim. If you regularly write many types of texts for different audiences, cite some examples to illustrate the range. You may even be able to identify the written genres used in the target job, such as 'project proposals' or 'mission reports', if you do your background research well. Some jobs ultimately depend on good writing and drafting skills and such skills often form the centre-piece of technical testing of candidates. Also mention any training you have done on report writing.
Note: If there is one thing you can do every day to enhance your international career, it is to develop excellent writing and drafting skills in English and one other major language. In European Union recruitment, writing skills tend to take second place to verbal, numerical and abstract reasoning skills during the initial testing phase, but they can turn out to be a crucial factor in the later stages of selection. The ability to write well can often separate equally qualified candidates in international jobs.
Languages are another area to consider when describing your communication skills. If you are able to work in two or more languages which you know will be used in the target job, mention both languages in the PHP and the cover letter. Especially, indicate examples of any ability to write in two languages (for example, English and French, or French and Arabic).
Teamwork and Team Leadership
All international organisations, from the smallest field office to the largest UN agency, involve teamwork, usually in multi-cultural, multi-faith and often multi-disciplinary teams. Examples of successful teamwork and collaboration can prove to be useful additions to your PHP.
If you have been a team or project leader, consider including this in your PHP. Indicate the size of the team under your leadership and the areas of team-building and motivation in which you played a role, such as recruitment, performance management, or staff coaching. Refer to specific organisational changes which might attract the attention of employers. If you have managerial experience of start-up or downsizing, make this clear in your PHP; and mention any large-scale challenges which you faced as a team leader, such as budget cuts, re-organisation, policy changes or evacuation of mission. Often, specific management experiences like these - even if you were not in the job long enough to see the results - can catch the eye of recruiters who are facing similar challenges in their own organisations. Employers often select candidates to help solve problems they are facing. They will look for experience that matches the need.
Technological Awareness. Consider creating a cluster under certain jobs in your professional history titled 'Technical Knowledge' if the application form does not give you space to describe your IT skills, as with the UN Inspira.
Setting Out?
If you are just setting out on your career, make good use of your studies and any projects which involved teamwork and collaboration, especially in an international sphere. Give examples of skills which you were able to learn quickly to show your flexibility and ability to adapt. If you have done an internship, focus on the skills and knowledge you developed through your experience, and mention any positive feedback from supervisors or mentors which highlights particular contributions.
If you are currently doing an internship, make the most of your experience. Use the opportunity to talk to people, build your network, and volunteer to contribute to projects wherever you can.
Get Qualified
The UN and other international organisations are popular employers and receive hundreds of thousands of applications for jobs and internships every year. When considering working at the international level, remember that you will always have rivals, including people who are equally - or better - qualified than you. This is a fact of life. The market for UN and IO jobs is potentially the whole world.
In order to increase your chances, aim to get as well qualified as you can and always look for opportunities to upgrade your skills and add diplomas in areas which are in demand. This process should not stop throughout your career.
Bear in mind that having a Masters-level qualification is increasingly desirable for Professional (P) level jobs in the UN. At the moment a Masters is not essential, but it is quite possible that in the near future P-level jobs will become Masters-only.
Get Experience at National Level
As the UN and IO job market becomes more mobile and flexible, with regular upsizing and downsizing of operations meaning short-term contracts rather than permanent jobs, international careers will become more fluid and less predictable. Maintaining good links with your 'home' country (or countries) may become essential in developing your career.
If you are in a professional field such as law, medicine or engineering, it might make long-term sense to get a solid basis of national experience under your belt first, before embarking on an international career that might not be stable and reliable. It is very difficult to go back 'home' into a domestic job market without contacts and experience if you have been away too long. After all, the UN tends to look for initial experience in any case, with the average age for entry into P-level positions in the late twenties.
'Hybrid' careers, which combine national employment with international assignments, may become the norm in the future as international civil service jobs become less stable. There is also some evidence that international organisations will rely more on specialists who can deploy quickly from national reserve lists, rosters or through the UN's 'Global Marketplace' of consultants. Keeping in touch with the national and regional employment scene through your contacts and visits home may prove to be a smart career move.

* When describing duties and achievements, don't rely on lists of bullet points for each job and do not copy your official job description word for word. Cluster your achievements under keyword headings which matter in the target job - areas of expertise, core competencies, or knowledge areas. Don't use vague phrases such as 'Performed a variety of administrative tasks' and don't praise yourself without giving concrete examples (so avoid saying things like 'I am an excellent team player' without giving an example).
*When describing your achievements, make sure that your statements communicate to a general audience, especially if you are applying as an external candidate. Don't use abbreviations which readers might not understand. Each statement should give the reader an idea of the ACTION, CONTEXT and OUTCOME of the achievement (A - C -O).
*Make sure that you strike a balance between summarising your skills and achievements and giving specific examples. Make sure that achievements are at least as strong as duties - preferably stronger. Keep duties to a concise minimum and focus on achievements. (In the UN Inspira form the maximum space given for duties under each job is 2500 characters. For achievements, it is 3700. Although you should not strive to fill the boxes completely, these numbers are saying: focus mainly on achievements.)
* Make sure you use a variety of strong and dynamic verbs in your PHP/CV, particularly when describing achievements. Don't begin every statement with the same verb. For a list of useful verbs and verb phrases to use in CVs and PHPs, see under 'Resources to Download'.
*.
* As with all online applications, check the language and proofread the text. Do not rely on a spellcheck programme to do this for you. Applications may be immediately rejected if you spell an important word, especially a job-related word, wrong. It creates the impression of carelessness and lack of attention to detail. If you can, get someone to check your application before you press 'send'.*Make sure you get the names of employers correct in written form and only use first-time abbreviations if you are sure that the intended readers will know what you mean. Avoid informal language and contractions like 'can't' and 'it's'.* Use your most recent performance appraisal (if you have one) to generate material for your PHP. For many UN jobs the two most recent ePAS documents must be submitted with applications through Inspira. Don't, however, assume that the ePAS will be read (so avoid saying 'see ePAS') and at the same time don't copy/paste chunks from your ePAS. Select, edit and highlight the strengths.Meteoroid hits moon, goes boom!

NASA’s lunar monitoring program has detected hundreds of meteoroid impacts, nearly all of them on the dark, earthlit areas of the moon where they stand out against the darkened moonscape. You’ll also notice how few have been spotted in the white lunar highland regions. This is a selection effect: flashes stand out much better against black than white. Credit: NASA
That good news because the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter should have no trouble spotting the crater once it targets the impact region. Comparing the size of the crater to the brightness of the flash would give researchers a valuable “ground truth” measurement to validate lunar impact models.

Travel Goods Association Releases State of the U.S. Travel Goods Market 2001-2012; Sales Improve in 2012, But At What Price?
Princeton, NJ — Travel goods sales jumped in 2012, but at a price, according to a new report released today by the Travel Goods Association (TGA). Travel goods are defined as luggage, backpacks, travel/sports bags, business cases/computer bags, handbags, personal leather goods, and luggage locks. TGA estimates that sales of travel goods in 2012 returned to pre-recession levels, with U.S. consumers spending an estimated $25.5 billion in 2012 on travel goods, a rise of 20.2% from 2011.
Those numbers don't tell the whole story, however, as volume sales in 2012 also increased, but at a much smaller rate — 6.8% over 2011 — meaning higher prices made up the difference.
"American consumers reignited their love affair with travel goods, in 2012," explains Michele Marini Pittenger, TGA's President.
While sales in most travel goods segments achieved significant gains in 2012, sales lagged for luggage and briefcases/computer cases. Commented Pittenger, "Consumers were much more willing to buy more of the so-called "fun" travel goods in 2012 — handbags, smartphone and tablet covers, backpacks — but only bought what they had to when it came core travel goods, like luggage and computer bags."
And, while certainly welcome news, the higher prices consumers were willing to pay across the board in 2012 presented a double-edged sword for the industry.
"U.S. travel goods firms offered consumers not only value and quality in 2012, they also gave them excitement and variety," noted Pittenger. "The result was a winning formula with consumers willing to pay more, not only for the right product, but also for the new and exciting product."
"But," cautioned Pittenger, "rising prices in today's economy does not necessarily translate into higher margins for the industry. Costs continue to go up throughout the supply chain, meaning that increases at the cash register in many cases are only a reflection of the cost increases born by our members."
Concluded Pittenger, "I remain cautiously optimistic that the market will continue to grow in 2012."
Here's a quick look at how TGA estimates each of the major travel goods categories performed in 2012:
Luggage
Luggage sales lagged in 2012 as the pent-up demand for new luggage experienced in 2011 fizzled and rising airfares took their toll. According to TGA estimates, luggage unit sales in 2012 slipped 1.5% by volume. On the other hand, unit sales shot up 11.9% by value. This growth was driven by an increasing willingness by consumers to buy the right piece of luggage, not the cheapest. As a result, the average unit price for luggage increased 13.7% in 2012.
Backpacks
Backpacks were still high on consumers' shopping lists in 2012, but growth slowed from significant gains made in 2011. With backpacks continuing to penetrate untraditional markets in travel and business, unit sales of backpacks increased 3.2% by volume and 8.9% by value in 2012. With Americans buying a whopping 133.4 million backpacks in 2012, unit prices continued to recover, increasing 5.5% for the year.
Travel/Sports Bags
Travel/sports bags — from "freebies," or promotional bags, to new variations on the duffel bag — continued to be popular in 2012 as more consumers chose travel bags for non-traditional uses such as travel and business. TGA estimates that unit sales of travel/sports bags in 2012 grew 8.2% and dollar sales grew 28.8%. The increasing popularity of travel bags led average unit prices to jump 19.0% in 2012.
Business Cases/Computer Bags
Unit sales of business cases and computer bags suffered, down 3.4% in 2012 as consumers increasingly looked to non-traditional travel goods — backpacks, travel bags — for work. However, with the job market stabilizing, those who did buy again bought the right product versus the cheapest product, pushing the average unit price for business cases and computer bags up 12.0% in 2012.
Handbags
They just couldn't stay away. While still nowhere near pre-recession sales, Americans reversed gears from 2011 and began to rekindle their interest in handbags in 2012. TGA estimates that unit sales of handbags grew 8.3%, dollar sales increased 18.4%, and average unit prices increased 9.3% in 2012. To put these numbers in perspective, Americans bought an incredible 252.2 million handbags in 2012. In other words, every female in the U.S. above the age of 14, on average, bought two handbags in 2012.
Personal Leather Goods
The rise of tablets joined ever-growing smartphone sales to drive up sales of personal leather goods in 2012, with TGA estimating unit sales up 5.4% and dollar sales up 17.7% during the period. And with the growing view of covers as the new "fashion" item, as well as something needed to protect their expensive electronics, people were willing to pay, driving average unit prices up 11.6% in 2012.
Luggage Locks
Luggage lock sales seemed to finally hit bottom, and even recover slightly in 2012. TGA estimates that unit sales of luggage locks in 2012 grew 3.6% and dollar sales rose 4.4%. As a result, luggage lock prices continued to reverse course, with average unit prices growing a modest 0.8% in 2012.

Under the terms of the settlement, which ended the legal dispute among the companies lodged in the Nevada Sixth District Court in 2011, Rye Patch would transfer the disputed claims to Coeur in exchange for $10-million, a 3.4% net smelter royalty (NSR) from revenue generated at the Rochester mine and an option to receive the Blue Bird claim next to Lincoln Hill, west of Rochester.
The NSR would be payable from Rochester production and sales starting on January 1, 2014, and was expected to be completed in about four years, once Coeur had produced 39.4-million ounces of silver at the Rochester mine.
The settlement transactions were expected to close by June 28, and were not subject to any significant external closing conditions. Rye Patch had until ten days after closing to exercise the option to acquire Blue Bird.
“While we believe our legal position is strong, it is, ultimately, in the company's best interests not to continue with a potentially lengthy and protracted lawsuit at the expense of our core business operations.
“This settlement allows Rye Patch to move forward and focus on its core business of finding and developing gold and silver resources in Nevada, while providing nondilutive cash and a royalty stream to the company to identify the next value-adding opportunity,” Rye Patch president and CEO William Howald said.
Coeur president and CEO Mitchell Krebs said that, despite Coeur remaining confident in its legal position, the company believed its stockholders were best served by achieving a commercial solution to this ongoing litigation.
The two companies had been scheduled to meet in court in September.
The battle began in August 2011, when Rye Patch said Coeur failed to pay its yearly fee to retain mining claims around the producer’s Rochester mine.
Rye Patch then staked the claims it said the bigger company had forfeited, some of which accounted for one-fifth of Rochester’s mineral reserves, Coeur said.
The biggest primary silver producer in the US then took Rye Patch to court in December of that year.
Rye Patch in March last year filed a restraining order in Nevada to prevent Coeur from exploring on the claims around Rochester it asserted it now owned.
Rye Patch controlled more than 75 km2 along the Oreana trend in west-central Nevada and 66 km2 along the Cortez trend near Barrick’s gold discovery.
Rochester produced 2.8-million ounces of silver and 38 066 oz of gold in 2012, at average cash operating costs of $9.62/oz of silver.
At December 31, 2012, Rochester’s proven and probable reserves totalled 79.9-million tons containing about 44.9-million ounces of silver and 308 000 oz of gold. Rochester also reported year-end measured and indicated resources of 264.3-million tons containing about 120.7-million ounces of silver and 865 000 oz of gold. Inferred resources totalled an additional 45.6-million tons containing 27.2-million ounces of silver and 123 000 oz of gold.
Rye Patch’s TSX-V-listed shares lost C$0.10 a share to close at C$0.19 apiece on Tuesday, while those of Coeur dipped 0.31% to close at C$12.78 apiece.

Fox-Pitt’s two Burghley rides both have chances. Seacookie and last year’s winner Parklane Hawk, the horse many were surprised not to see at London, both scored top dressage marks in their prep-runs at Somerford Park last week.
Zara Phillips is not entered, though London team-mate Mary King rides King’s Temptress, third here last year.
There will also be strong competition from Olympic reserve Lucy Wiegersma (Simon Porloe and Granntevka Prince), still smarting from her omission, plus Oliver Townend, who gained the ride on former Nicholson top string Armada this spring, too late for an Olympic bid.
The overseas entry includes Germany’s Olympic team gold medallist Dirk Schrade (Hop and Skip), Allison Springer (Arthur, a surprise omission from the US Olympic team), former world champion Jean Teulere of France (Matelot du Grand Val) and Kiwi Mark Todd, who is down to just one ride (Major Milestone) after putting three horses on the market to fund the purchase of Stan Mellor’s training yard near Marlborough, Wilts.
Nicholson is just six points adrift of Fox-Pitt for the HSBC bonus. He rides Avebury plus either Calico Joe or Mr Cruise Control, depending on the footing.
“Cruise needs a dry ground, but he is much more experienced than Calico,” said Nicholson. “It’s a big week all right; this is one event we need to win, and there is big money at stake.”
Capt Mark Phillips has designed a 11min 30sec cross-country incorporating three Olympic jumps shipped over from Greenwich. Organisers report a surge in ticket sales following the Olympics and the general washout of a season that saw wet-weather cancellations of Badminton, Chatsworth and Gatcombe.Skoda Nov 2012 sales increase globally, in India decline by 13 percent

Auto News Release
ŠKODA POSTS GROWTH IN NOVEMBER
13/12/12 from Skoda
Worldwide deliveries rise 3.8 per cent to almost 78,000 in November 2012
ŠKODA grows in Western Europe in November despite the market trend
Advances in China and Russia
Mladá Boleslav, December 13th, 2012 – ŠKODA AUTO raised its deliveries by 3.8 per cent year on year in November. Deliveries to customers rose to 77,900 (full year: 75,000). From January through November, sales advance by 6.9 per cent to about 873,000 (January through November 2011: 816,800).
“Once again, we increased our deliveries even though markets were difficult,” says Werner Eichhorn, ŠKODA Board Member for Sales and Marketing. “Our growth in Western Europe in November is especially welcome given that we grew against the market trend. The situation on the markets continues to be demanding. However, ŠKODA remains on the offensive with new models,” says Eichhorn.
In Western Europe in November, ŠKODA again posted growth, raising deliveries by 4.3 per cent to 28,200 (November 2011: 27,000) in an otherwise strongly shrinking overall market. ŠKODA has significantly outperformed the market throughout the year so far as deliveries reached 331,900 from January through November 2012 (January through November 2011: 336,800). Market share rose above 3 per cent for the first time during the first eleven months compared with 2.8 per cent a year ago. The brand posted strong gains in its strongest Western European markets in November, these being Great Britain (plus 30.2 per cent) and Germany (plus 15.2 per cent).
In Eastern Europe ŠKODA achieved a plus of 7.9 per cent in November for a total of 12,400 vehicles (November 2011: 11,500). The brand rose by 26.7 per cent to 123,500 units from January through November (January through November 2011: 97.400). This growth was almost three times as strong as the overall market, which was 9.4 per cent. At the end of November, ŠKODA’s market share was close to 4.1 per cent against 3.5 per cent from January through November 2011. Once again, Russia contributed strongly to the brand’s growth as deliveries were up 12.5 per cent to more than 9,000 (November 2011: 8,000), making this November ŠKODA’s second-best in Russia after June 2012. In the first eleven months, ŠKODA’s deliveries in Russia were up 36.6 per cent to almost 89,100 and market share grew to 3.6 per cent (January through November 2011: 2.9 per cent). Series production of the ŠKODA Yeti in Russia began in early December.
In Central Europe, ŠKODA delivered 10,200 vehicles to customers in November (November 2011: 10,600). The brand’s sales in the first eleven months rose 1.3 per cent to 114,100 units compared to 112,600 one year ago. Market share in the area rose to 18.8 per cent from January through November (January through November 2011: 18.5 per cent). Deliveries in the Czech Republic, the brand’s home market rose 3.3 per cent to 54,700 as at the end of November (January through November 2011: 52,900).
ŠKODA also continued its growth in China: the brand’s posting and advance of 4.9 per cent to 21,100 deliveries in November (November 2011: 20,200). As at the end of November, ŠKODA has sold 225,900 cars in China or 7.1 per cent more than a year ago when the comparable figure was 211,000.
In India, ŠKODA deliveries numbered 2,000 in November (November 2011: 2,300). From January through November, ŠKODA grew by 24.4 per cent to 32,100 deliveries to customers on the subcontinent (January through November 2011: 25.800).)Monitor condition of pipe, Place emergency response facilities, replace existing culvert.

Lanes Open During San Diego-Coronado Bridge Night Work
SAN DIEGO – Two lanes of the San Diego-Coronado Bridge will be closed for night work beginning Monday, Nov. 28, according to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Crews will close one lane in each direction from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. Sunday through Thursday. At least one lane in each direction will be open for all motorists.
The closure is for routine maintenance work on the bridge deck and is expected to take about three weeks to complete, weather permitting. During the course of the work the westbound connecter ramp to either the northbound or southbound Interstate 5 (I-5) will be closed. Motorists will be detoured to the open connector ramp to the closest available off-ramp then detoured to their desired direction on I-5.

Liam Jones the big winner from arrival of Stewart Crameri, says Western Bulldogs veteran Daniel Giansiracusa

WESTERN Bulldogs veteran Daniel Giansiracusa is hopeful the arrival of new spearhead Stewart Crameri will help fellow key forward Liam Jones deliver "big things".
The Dogs were the fourth highest-scoring team in a hot finish over the final six rounds of last season and acquired Crameri on a big money deal to inject more potency.
While the scintillating form of injured forward Jarrad Grant was a key reason for the increased scoring power late last year, Giansiracusa yesterday says the club has not given up on the 197cm Jones, despite some inconsistencies.
The 22-year-old, who was the club's No. 1 forward target last year, kicking 22 goals from 19 games, will benefit from the forward line reshuffle, according to Giansiracusa.
"(Jones is) working really hard at his game, he's obviously a huge talent and someone that we are expecting big things from," Giansiracusa said.
"I am looking forward to seeing that in the pre-season games and coming through."
The Dogs' big men helped pay for their own altitude camp to Colorado in the off-season under the direction of development coach Ashley Hansen.

Giansiracusa, 31, said Crameri's running power had impressed since his arrival from Essendon and was confident the former Bomber would help the club build on its strong finish to last year.
"Stewy's got a huge tank and those younger guys are still developing there (in attack)," he said.
"As long as we can jell as a forward line I think we'll kick winning scores.
"We haven't really set any expectations in terms of wins, but we're driving each other and the coaches are driving us to get better."
Grant will likely miss the start of the regular season with a fractured foot but Giansiracusa said the flashy half-forward would reclaim his position.
Shaun Higgins remains on a modified program in his comeback from a severe foot injury.
"It's disappointing, obviously he (Grant) showed great signs late in the year and he's had a fantastic pre-season, he's taken steps again I think," he said.
"But unfortunately that's footy and we expect him to bounce back really quickly and I can't wait for him to get back into the group once he recovers from the surgery and go again."Originally published as Jones winner from Crameri trade

Happiness had come to the Emerald City. As the sun peeked above the horizon, the city was already a buzzing with excitement of the events to come, long awaited and highly anticipated. Shops that were normally darkened were awake and active with preparations, carriages that usually sat docile now carried heaping loads of materials to the same destination, and people who typically valued every moment of possible sleep now found that very activity impossible to achieve. All if because of one thing. It was a day of joy, a day of love, a day of life.
It was a day to celebrate.
The morning hours passed like a surreal fantasy, each one blending into the next until it was nearly impossible to keep accurate time. Every individual in residence of the palace was especially excited. After all, it was not every day that two people whom they loved so dearly would knit their lives together and makes the binding pledge of eternity. There was no question in anyone's mind that the event would be nothing less than perfection. He was perfect. She was more perfect, if that were even possible? How could they be anything but perfect together?
So, the countdown continued. When the clock stuck noon, hearts throughout the city lifted in joy as the knew the time had finally come. Those lucky enough to be present gazed in awe at the elaborately decorated throne room, only to have their breaths stolen again a few moments later when the rear doors opened and they saw her.
Bedecked in a snow-white gown and a glittering tiara, Lady Glinda practically floated down the aisle, looking very much like the princess that many thought her to be. At the other end, Prince Fiyero waited, a tiny smile gracing his handsome face. There was no doubt that he was the luckiest man alive and even more, there were surely hearts breaking all over Oz. As Lady Glinda continued her last journey as a single woman, cameras flashed almost simultaneously, each one hoping to capture the moment in the perfect photograph, no doubt that would grace the covers of the papers the next day.
Prince Fiyero stepped down to take her hand as she neared and she shyly accepted it with a dainty smile. Lifting it to his lips, he kissed it and bowed to her father, who kissed his daughter's porcelain cheek and then took his seat next to his wife. Seats were taken and the officiate began the ceremony, droning on for several moments above love, eternal bonds, and commitment among other things. Had one been paying attention to anything but the happy couple (which of course, they weren't) one might have noticed the hooded figure slip in just before the doors were closed by the guards.
Taking a seat in the back of the room, the stranger seemed perfectly content to stay and observe like any other person in attendance. That is, until those time-tried words were spoken.
"If there is anyone here who has reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace."
"Wait!"
Gasps rose from around the room as the voice sounded it's objection. Eyes of every shape and color began to search the room for the person who would dare to object to such a perfect event and none seemed to hold more surprise than the bride and groom's when it was realized just who it was.
Releasing Fiyero's hands, Lady Glinda squinted, "Elphie?" Is it really you?"
One green hand moved to take down the hood, revealing the face that had stricken fear into hearts for nearly three years. "Yes, Glinda. I'm here."
The guards immediately sprang into action, but were immediately stopped with one word from their Captain. Planting her hands on her non-existent hips, the blonde leveled her best glare on her best friend. "What in the world are you doing here? Interrupting my wedding!" She then broke into a smile. "I knew you wouldn't miss it."
"That's not exactly why I'm here?"
Fiyero stepped forward then, "Then why are you?"
Allowing her eyes to take him in for the first time, the green girl gave him her full attention. "To stop you from making a horrible mistake."
His blue eyes widened, then dimmed. "And you choose now to do so?"
Glinda had frozen. "What mistake? Elphie! It's just like I told you. We are getting married."
"And that's the problem."
At this statement, a collective gasp went up from the room's occupants. Fiyero's face remained void of expression, but Glinda's registered an unflattering mixture of shock, hurt, and anger. "Elphie," she said evenly, "please don't be saying what I think you're saying. It makes no sense."
"Why, Elphaba?" Fiyero said, stepping forward. "Why is this wrong?"
"I…" Shaking her head, she quickly retreated, seemingly moving much faster than she should be able to. "I shouldn't have come. I..I was wrong. The best to both of you…really. You deserve each other."
"Elphie!" Glinda called to her friend. Thrusting her bouquet towards Fiyero, she exclaimed. "I have to talk to her."
Fiyero shook his head and handed the flowers back to her. "I'll go." He hesitated a moment, then simply said, "I'm sorry, Glinda."
Confusion lit her eyes. "Dearest? Why are you sorry?" But he was already out the door. Stepping into the sunlight, he was assaulted by rapturous applause of those waiting outside, certain that he was now a married man. Forcing himself to breathe, he ran after her, ignoring the many questions thrown at him from the crowd. A flash of green and black caught his eyes and his feet followed it's direction "Elphaba?"
He found her in the palace courtyard, hat clutched in one hand, broom in the other. Bent at the waist, she had leaned against one of the willow trees for support, no doubt traumatized by her actions and the unexpected results. Her intent had never been to hurt them; he was sure of that. There was, however, a reason that she did what she did and he was determined to find out just what that reason was.
Slowing to a jog, he approached her. "Ephaba?"
Her head snapped up at his voice. "Fiyero?" Guilt colored her face. "What are you doing here?"
"I could ask you that same question, " he responded. Nodding toward the palace, he asked, "What was all that about?"
She took a sudden interest in the grass. "I..I don't know. I wasn't thinking, clearly. I had no right."
"You're right," he said sternly. "You didn't. Unless…"
Her head came up again. "Unless?"
"Unless you had a good reason."
"That's a matter of opinion isn't it?"
He shrugged. "Perhaps. But I'll never know unless you tell me."
She snorted. "I've embarrassed myself enough for one day, don't you think?"
Placing a hand on her shoulder, the prince forced her chin upward, bringing her gaze to his face. "It's just me, Elphaba," he said softly. "Fiyero. Charming, handsome, slightly brainless Fiyero. You can tell me anything. That's what friends are for. Nothing you say can make me think of you any differently"
Her eyes darkened. "And that is exactly why I didn't say anything." Frustrated, she yanked her arm from his grasp. "I have to go. The guards are most likely waiting for me at every entrance."
Fiyero shook his head. "They won't do anything without my orders. Elphaba, please. Trust me."
"I do. That's not the problem."
Now he was getting frustrated, "Then what is it? I'm only a man, Elphaba, not a mind reader. I can't help you if you don't tell me what's going on."
"Nothing! Aright? Nothing is the matter." Shoving the pointy hat back on her head, she stalked away. "Go!" she said with an angry wave. "Go back inside and marry Glinda. It's what you both deserve."
Stepping into her path, he stopped her. "I'm not going anywhere until you explain yourself. What is so important that you would risk your safety, your life, to disrupt my wedding?"
He saw her eyes slide shut as she softly answered, "You."
Unprepared for her answer, he could only muster, "What?"
"You heard me." Shaking her head, she turned away. "This is exactly why I shouldn't have come! I only ruin everyone's happiness. If only I had left well enough alone, you and Glinda would be married and together and happy and I-"
Her words were cut short by his kiss. Startled, Elphaba could do nothing but stiffen as he kissed her. His lips were warm on hers, awakening things within her that she never knew existed. She heard him chuckle against her mouth, only to have him pull away a moment later.
"What…what was that for?" She asked dumbly.
He shook his head. "Elphaba Thropp, speechless. I never thought I would see the day."
She ignored him. "What the hell are you doing, Fiyero? You were moments away from marrying Glinda. What gives you the right to follow me, scream at me, or even kiss me? You have a lot of nerve!"
"I have a lot of nerve? You were the one who decided to moonlight as a wedding crasher!" He waved her off. "Anyway, none of that matter anymore because you were right?"
Elphaba blanched, "I was right?"
Coming to stand before her, he nodded. "You were. Because I was marrying Glinda for the wrong reasons. I couldn't have the one I wanted, so I was willing to settle for the one who wanted me?"
She knew she shouldn't, but…."The who was it that you wanted?"
"You really have to ask?" Closing the space between them, he laid her head on his shoulder as he spoke into her hair. "Elphaba, I've loved you from the moment you screamed at me in my carriage. It simply took me a long time to realize what I thought was loathing but the strangest, most wonderful thing I could ever ask for?"
She dared a glance at him. "Don't lie to me, Fiyero. My heart can't break again."
"I'm not lying." And once look into his eyes confirmed it. Beyond all things reasonable, he loved her. "I'm beyond happy that you came today. And furthermore, I'm ecstatic that you had the courage to say what I never could. At least until now." Wrapping his arms around her, he said softly, "I love you, Elphaba. I always have."
When she didn't reply, he called, "Elphaba?"
"Elphaba?"
Elphaba?
"Elphaba?"
Startled, the green girl jerked upright. Taking a moment to wipe the sleep from her eyes, she found herself under the amused glance of Miri, her friend and confidant for the last two years.
The Cat wore a smug smile. "Did you have a pleasant dream?"
She blinked. "I'm not exactly sure."
"Well, I'm no expert, but it certainly sounded satisfying to me."
"It was…strange." Sitting up, Elphaba quickly explained the dream to her friend. "And he chose me. That's what so unbelievable."
"If you say so," the Cat shook her head. "Who knows? It could happen."
Not likely. Elphaba rose, mind suddenly going to the forthcoming mission. "I have to get ready for tonight. I'll see you later, Miri." The Cat only watched her go.
As the green girl readied herself, images of her dream continued to play through her head. For one traitorous moment, she allowed herself to imagine what it would be like to confess her heart, fell his arms around her, and taste his kiss. As always, it only ended with a shake of her head. Fiyero would never love her. How could blame him. She would never be brave enough to interrupt a wedding, never have the nerve to confess her feelings, and never find the courage to face them again. Besides, if given the choice between Glinda and herself, it would be no competition whatsoever.
Glinda would win. She always did.
Instead, she threw herself into her work, never daring to imagine herself acting should the chance to speak now ever present itself.
Thankfully, yet unbeknownst to her, when the time did come, she wouldn't have to.<<

Brousse is a soft, fresh cheese made from either ewes' or goats' milk in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. It gets its name from the fact that the curd is beaten before being drained. It is sold in plastic moulds.
Brousse is light, sweet, and mild, with a slight smell of milk. It resembles a cross between chevre and ricotta. Traditionally it is eaten with honey or fresh herbs. The fat content is 45%..Resorts unveil early discounts on season pass sales
The competition to hook season passholders for next winter jumped Tuesday with both Vail Resorts and The Mountain Collective, which includes Alta and Snowbird, unveiling early-signup enticements.
Vail Resorts, which operates Canyons Resort outside of Park City, said its 2014-15 Epic Local Pass is available for $549 if bought before April 13. The spring purchase price can be locked in for a down payment of just $49, said Canyons spokeswoman Caitlin Martz, and also comes with six "buddy tickets" good for discounted lift tickets next winter as well as summer gondola rides.
The Mountain Collective also started its spring sale, announcing that a limited number of passes are available for $359. The pass is good for two days of skiing or riding at each of six independent resorts Alta/Snowbird, Aspen/Snowmass, Jackson Hole, Mammoth Mountain, Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows and Whistler/Blackcomb.
In addition, the collective is adding two free days of skiing this summer at Thredbo, Australia, and Valle Nevado, Chile, when those Southern Hemisphere resorts are in their winter seasons. It also provides a 50 percent discount on extra day passes and discounted hotel rates.
The international component of Vail's Epic Pass is selling for $729 this spring, giving purchasers five days at Niseko Resort in northern Japan along with unlimited days at Canyons, Vail's four Colorado resorts (Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge and Keystone), its three in California (Kirkwood, Heavenly and Northstar), Afton Alps in Minnesota and Mt. Brighton in Michigan.
Epic Local Passes have use restrictions on 11 days Nov. 28-29, Dec. 26-31, Jan. 17, 2015 and Feb. 14-15, 2015.

And say goodbye to $4gal gas, and hello to $8/gal and the great beyond..
sure entitlements are part of the problem.... but how about the gargantuan military beast that is the United States taxpayer continues to feed year after year.... probably close to 1000 bases around the world... no other country comes close. all for the benefit of the people? sure it is... shut it all down. fuck the bankers and their wars of conquest.
Europe has a tiny military budget compared to the US, yet they still ran their entitlement systems up on the rocks even faster than we did.
Drop military spending to zero, we still have a big problem.

YGFBKMe... On ZH ~ I used to have a lot of respect for you... It took awhile ~ But now I think you're just an average, run of the mill FOOL... I don't give a fuckng fuck about what you may think about francis_sawyer...
TOOL CITY BITCHEZ... [Sooner or later all armaments get beaten down into plowshares]... I guess that will be the francis_sawyer fate, sooner or later... Hopefully, the LATTER...
You're glorifying a fucking stooge who, himself was a SOROS stooge... That, essentially, makes YOU a stooge [as well as your 'green arrow army']...
TYLER(s)... PLEASE!?!... Bring back the MATH QUESTION...
Think whatever you wish.
I'm well aware of the allegations regarding Soros, and I have no idea as to how many of those as a % are true or not. But unless you know of the dynamics between Druckenmiller & Soros, with specificity, all you're doing is huffing & puffing about your own raw conjecture (there's nothing wrong with that, IMO, so long as you put a big disclaimer in front of your claims, along the lines of "I am Francis Sawyer, and despite not having any actual, direct evidence of what I am about to state, I believe it's possible that A-B-C based upon X-Y-Z).
For all I know, and certainly based on you history of comments, you loathe the guy based on the singular point that he's jewish (I, unlike you, do not believe that the entire spectrum of people of jewish ancestry are inherently bad, for the wide assortment of malicious traits you obsess upon when you're at your least logical; I know and have known many jews who are as well intentioned and charitable as the most honorable people of any other ethnicity or religion, and I do my best to judge people based on their individual character, rather than damning them immediately and in preconceived fashion in a "guilt by association" way that you seem to love to do.)
My praise of Druckenmiller was and is based on his statements as to why he closed shop, his claim that there isn't a market of any type in all the land that hasn't been reduced to a massively manipulated & rigged roach motel, & his macro opinion as to the hows/whys many western economies are already bankrupt, essentially.
Is he lying about those things he expresses? I don't know. Do you?
The simple fact remains that the guy OBJECTIVELY had the best performance of any large AUM fund manager for a massive stretch of years, consistently, and instead of staying in the game post-financial crisis and massive central bank rigging of markets, which he certainly could have done and should have done if he's some corrupt bastard who is tied in with the den of thieves (which would imply that he has access to and can leverage insider information), he called the Ponzi for what it was, returned all limited partner funds to his investors, and called the scam for what it is in a way that neatly dovetails with my own impressions.
Excellent comment sunshine, my sentiments exactly.
But unless you know of the dynamics between Druckenmiller & Soros, with specificity, all you're doing is huffing & puffing about your own raw conjecture
as well (& such)... YOU ARE... with your RAW underscore [until you fancy ALL OF US with your IN DEPTH carnal knowledge ~ Entertain us... PLEASE]... ZH'ers ~ please DON'T think that francis_sawyer knows anything... INSTEAD ~ Take it ON FAITH that TIS is within the INNER CIRCLE of the SOROS/DRUCKENMILLER conclave... [perhaps even sodomizes the same choirboy goats]...
I, unlike you, do not believe that the entire spectrum of people of jewish ancestry are inherently bad, for the wide assortment of malicious traits you obsess upon when you're at your least logical
Bully 4 u... chilly 4 me... Congrats on having achieved the quintessential KISS ASS status... [Note: You're not a KISS ASS if you do so out of soundness... Instead ~ you're a KISS ASS if you do so in an effort to circumscribe your own pretention of valor]...
Fuck Druckenmiller [He's part of the PROBLEM ~ NOT the SOLUTION]... Your sugary platitudes have ZERO value...

END THE FED [That's your avatar]... Which, purportedly has some TRUTH towards your motives...
THE FED is fucking jewish families dipshit!... Indulge me by proving to me how I'm WRONG [& otherwise my 'huffing & puffing' is therefore misguided]...

People... ZH'ers... IT'S FUCKING ON NOW BITCHEZ...
Tylers... You'd better kick my ass off this blog RIGHT FUCKING NOW [I implore you to do so, & in the process, make a quantum leap towards becoming run of the mill MSM]... Because I may have been joking before, but with this BULLSHIT, I'm not joking anymore...
It's a waste of time to even attempt to debate you because you're obviously in an unstable mental state, so this will be my last response to any of your tripe.
I do hope that you get well soon. Many formerly paranoid individuals consumed by the type of irrational, raging, blind hatred that you are clearly presently suffering under have recovered.
Perfect... That's a CLASSIC 'loser' response... 'ATTACK THE INDIVIDUAL ~ NOT THE ARGUMENT'...
~~~
Notwithstanding ~ You are somewhat correct... I get the impression that you've 'opted out of' the possibility of future exchanges...
Congratulations on your valor!
END THE FED [Yeah bitchez ~ I 'really' mean it... No, SERIOUSLY... I DO!... I'm NOT a poser who just tries to be intellectual about a bunch of shit that I have marginal knowledge about... I may make 'kewl' comments now & then, & people may LIKE me, but mostly that's because I pretended to want a solution to problems INSTEAD of focusing on where the REAL problems lie]... The fact that I defend jews [AT ALL COSTS], especially the fact that jews are the major shareholders of THE FED should not concern anyone in the least...
Instead ~ you should mock francis_sawyer for even bringing the subject to mind...
~~~
THE ABOVE... TIS... Is your posture [unless you care to argue otherwise]... IMO ~ 'Legacy' counts for exactly SQUAT... [Especially if your 'LEGACY' consists of nothng more than a clarion call to END THE FED]... Hell ~ My guess is that one could live... EASILY... Another 20 years with that idea and be a FRIEND to many a dissident...
How far are you willing to go to make that a reality?... [or is it all 'huffing & puffing', as you mentioned before]?
If you question the integrity of this former Soros partner, what think you of Jim Rogers?
Birds sometime fly together that are not similar in feather.
now we're talking. this is what the interview SHOULD be about (these things are all very scripted in advance so...no "we're not going to talk about something real." he might be throwing his hat in the ring for Treasury Secretary here...who knows. But YOU fine sir "have summed up the simplicity of our age quite nicely.") and to answer your question...if there was a question in there...is simply put..."NOT EASY." in other words "it was more expensive to get OUT of Vietnam than it ever was getting into it." And unlike the Nam "this war is one we cannot nor will not ever leave from"...so it makes your point the ONLY valid point namely "to pay for the war IS THE WAR ITSELF." What this interview reveals is that our media (ironically enough major supporters of Israel ALL of course) "simply can't even bring up the reality" let alone "begin to have a debate on "how we fix this thing called...THE WAR." and these talking points simply put DID NOTHING. In short "you'd better begin...repeat and end with the word ECONOMY" because that is how Governments are financed and every war in HISTORY has been paid for. Devolving "Government" to the word "spending" simply gives lie to YOUR whole enterprise of "trying to finance the thing." In other words "businesses have a spending problem...but Governments have a problem WITH THE ECONOMY." Now i can go into great detail...and indeed have "in my own way" about how Government and the private sector "is in fact already solving this problem without even knowing it" (no thanks to the Kings of MBS, CDS, CDO's, RMBS, etc...etc) "but it's still not enough." And the reason which is obvious for the whole world to see "is because the problem is REALLY PHUCKING BIG!" (one of the ways i solve it is to "throw the entire State of Illinois under the bus" for example. Apologies to the State of Illinois of course...but this is how problem solving is in fact done on this level and scale.) I've had a lot of my ideas applied (President mentioned natural gas two State of the Union's ago...MBS purchases-sorry to say--are now being bought) but clearly "the plan to get the economy growing" say 12 percent considering the spending right?--clearly is not working. The President is a real good basketball player so the way i would put it is "you need to be the Lakers of the 80's here" and "be masters of the transition." In other words the President has the "set offense" pretty good: "Clyde Drexler is natural gas" so "you want to pass to him whenever possible." On the other hand "Kareem Abdul Jabbar is Big Oil" so "once he posts up you have to give him the ball." The key though is "you being Magic Johnson." no look passes (3d printing), jukin' the defender ("we're going to Syria" when you really meant Mali) "dishin'" (hey NATO...right at ya!) and most importantly "be ready for the put back" (WTF Wall Street supporters of Israel?) But the way the Lakers played...and WON...back then was IN TRANSITION. In other words "when you screwed up they scored." And that's how you pay for Governments...UP TEMPO AFTER THE STEAL. simply put "you gotta lighten the load" and economics does this by STRETCHING that dollar (and not just "raising taxes to get more of them.) this is your TRUE "force multiplier" (both for the Presidents AND the citizens) and mastering it at the the political level is THE hardest of tasks "because it means you have to have an understanding of banking, how to price a municipal bond, what mortgage insurance actually is"...in short IT'S BORING. But this is in fact the bread and butter of Wall Street AND Government...not at all what you see on television and the stock market. These "boring people" are interested in funding GOVERNMENTS more than anything because "that income stream can last centuries." so sure..."why do we even need bases when we have a war effort?" or better yet "why even have a war effort period and then we can get rid of the bases too"? EXCELLENT observations...and clearly "The Question" that Mr. Druckenmuller should have been addressing. In short "we have a WAR problem" not a spending one. If he is truly serious he will address THAT ahem "issue"...and no other. Most don't...indeed are incapable of doing so...and in the end "are just another Wall Streeter." If you want to be an Alexander Hamilton, a Salmon Chase, a JP Morgan, Henry Morgantheau of Hank Paulson "you don't simply look at Government and say it has a spending problem" cuz all your saying is "i'm in the business of making money and the only thing Government is good for is being in the way." To which i would say "and Government thanks itself for being that way" cuz they don't really give a rat's ass about money either now do they!
I Downed you for no line breaks...
And you type too much...
tl;dr Some of us seem to have a "paragraph" problem....
Druckenmiller seems like a decent bloke. His ex-partner Soros needs to be pushed into a wood chipper.
Why ruin a perfectly good wood chipper?
don't worry, according to Stan we still have 4 to 5 years to get our house in order. we will be fine.
And that day will be when Atlas Shrugged
Zap Powerz, that world will have many fewer humans populating it. There are some idiots around here who are upset that the human herd must be culled without cheap oil. But it must, and it will either happen orderly or not.
UH UH! you have an OLIGARCH problem first
then an entitlement problem because that's the carrot the oligarchs have used to dumb the sheeeps
I think that someone with a modicum of "moral authority" other than Mr. Bankster Druknfuk should make these decisions. After all it must be easy to say "means test" some schmuck that ran a small business and save 300K for retirement and can now live on his .025% rate of return "fixed investement". It shouldn't take too long for that 300K "nest egg" to go the way of the DODO bird. Or say maybe we can have some 75 y/o ZH truckers on the road pullin' those gas tankers for his escalade with his armed bodyguard. Watta fochin' schmuck. Buy more drones right Druknfuk?
The only surprise in my book is that at the end Maria didn't say: "Ok Stan, what stocks should we be buying here????"
ObamaPhone. People voted for this and he also stole 2012 along with a lot of stolen Dem House and Senate seats. Vote fraud Obama.
You'll like this one then Freddie:
while checking out the Obama voter fraud link, just a slight digression on my part, as is usual, and I end up on an article about Kate Middleton's royal pubic hair. I am now disgusted with myself as well as the bullshit system.
I have my own Obama vote bullshit anicdote. In Reno Nevada, a battleground state, I personally saw a big foodbank truck handing out food on voter fraud day. Truck was situated such that voting place was between free food and about 2000 low income apartments. The streets and sidewalks were chock full of obviously no income women with multiple kids and pushing strollers carrying bags of goods. Multiply this by the whole country and Obama's elected.
downvote me all you want but this makes me sick.
You're pikers. I live near (definitely not IN) Philly. Go read up about all the shenanigans that happened at polling places in that one-party town at election time. Poll monitors were thrown out of the facilities by election officials. Whole precincts that tallied votes 100% democratic- not one single vote for Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, no write-ins. Zip.
Chicago's got NOTHIN' on Philly.
So, no downvote from me. Even though I laugh at the minor trifles you call corruption. That's just an average Tuesday in Philly. ;)
Voter Fraud - Stuffing The Ballot Box - for sure.
Several contests in Florida due to "Irregularities"
Like 140% of a precinct turnout against Allen West
little late now, eh friends?
Winning counts.
…..to my horror under the George Bush administration they went from 50% to 63%….
That must be a typo .... ROFL
The Obama phone is an urban myth moron – Google it
Better yet:
The Reagan Phone
In said it before and I'll say it again: I find it incredible that most American's can't see that O is trying to sink and destroy this country as fast as he can.
I never thought the American populace was this stupid, but they are.
This whole healthcare and increase in taxes has not affected the rich, but is absolutely killing the poor. I had a waiter tell me last week he didn't understand why his paycheck took out an extra 2% from his paycheck because he voted for O. I mean its all been lies. To all.
Things today are so much different than 7 years ago and I don't trust the government at all. From 9/11, to CT shootings, to protecting yourself from a deranged gunman with scissors, we've lost our innocence and everything seems to be rolling in one direction.
I can't watch any TV. It's horrible. I don't find most of my fellow Americans interesting anymore, just poor, tattooed uneducated slobs who contribute nothing to society.
Was it PT Barnum that said "no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of most people"?
Complete loss of confidence seems to run rampant globally. And in a matter of time, just as fast, people will hopefully wake up.
But I'm not that hopeful. Only a civil war would settle this. It's that bad now. Democratic Capitalism is severely threatened.
The Obama Phone:
The Obama phone story is an urban myth. Once again the unsophisticated sheeple are fooled by the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, Drudge, etc, etc. Funny, Freddie never watches TV but somehow knows all about the “Obama Phone”. A two second Google search dismisses the story as bullshit and it was actually started under Reagan and Bush.
I am not an Obama fan at all by the way.
You don't know the first fucking thing about the wired or wireless telephone system. There is a legitimate reason for subsidizing wired phone service-- it has to do with the economics of wired networks. There is no fucking excuse to subsidize wireless phone service.
…..There is no fucking excuse to subsidize wireless phone service.
Ok, I agree 100%. But what does that have to do with the “Obama Phone”? Obama has nothing to do with giving free phones away.
This is the part that is so hard for me to understand:
It doesn’t matter if you love or hate Obama (I don’t like him). Ask this question to yourself “Does Obama give away free phones” the answer is no. If you hate him or love him, the answer is still no.
If you like macaroni and cheese but I hate macaroni what am I to do? Should I ridicule you, down arrow you, insult you, etc, etc just because I don’t like an ingredient in a dish you like? When only you are stating a fact that macaroni and cheese contains …. [drum roll] macaroni. This is just a fact and it doesn’t matter my opinion because ……[second drum roll] macaroni and cheese has macaroni in it.
Am I on the wrong website? Booze is kicking in and I have an early flight tomorrow, got to go. Remember folks - I like to throw gas on the fire and I like to play the Devil's advocate - keep that in mind
There are a hand full of folks on here that simply do not like facts. For them, facts are a terrible thing if they get in the way of their retoric. Facts get down arrows on a regular basis.
its also a pension problem
Especially Governemnt, Civil Service & Military pensions.
Killing the dollar...
All that fucking interview with super shill Bartaromo did was fucking assure me that we are completely fucked as a nation.
Fuck you Maria you stupid fucking fake bitch. Every fucking day she gets her fat fucking horseburger eating ass in front of that fucking camera and shreiks in her fucking yenta voice about how strong this fucking monkey shit market and recovery is. Now she supports what these guys say?...fuck you bitch. Go step in from of a fucking bus you fucking sellside dick swallowing whore.
I'm speechless......heh,heh.
I often get a laugh out of your comments [because ~ STRANGELY ~ they mirror my own views]...

But THIS was 'HEROIC'... I swear ~ it took me 5 minutes to get thru the comment because I was CRYING LAUGHING along the way...
+! SOUPS ON!!! missed ya man, now by God we've got some real posts to read!
Very nice. +1
Nice, but I feel a sudden urge to go wash my eyes out with soap and call mom.
The most disgraceful entitlement is the congressional pension.Only term limits can fix this mess before crisis. Enough said
the most disgraceful Entitlement is that these FUCKS get to breathe to stay alive. what a waste of O2..................
Nice little slip from friend of ex Fed Governor
"The federal reserve is a very powerful institution - and to some extent, by printing all of THEIR money - Pause - printing the money they are...."
I'll shorten the article.
Modern finance and banking is based on the greater fool theory, fraud, and immunity from prosecution. As one zerohedger said, things won't change until one of these bankers gets a bullet to the brain.
Exactly right.
Not one word mentioned about how the country has been raped by the bankers & plundered by the war machine.
Nothing in there about the unbelievable differences in effective tax rates of hedge fund managers making a half $billion/yr and sheltering off shore.
Nothing about multi-nationals bleeding off our jobs and paying off Congress to look the other way as the manufacturing base gets dismantled and shipped out...while they come up with 'legal' schemes that allow them to book profits off shore and further escape taxes, screwing all of us a little more.
Nothing about massive manipulation of Oil and other commodities required by the general population for daily living.
Did you see anything about high frequency trading, skimming and sucking dollars away from everyone who does not have a monster computer located across the street from a stock exchange.
What, no mention of exploding health care costs in the for-profit sytem we have allowed to build upover the past 30-40 years? What did happen to all those public hospitals we once had, anyway? And what about the fact that Medicare delivers the most cost effective helath care in America (except mayvbe the VA, until all the war-torn vets started showing up)
....and I could go on, but just let me say "fuck you", kind sir, and the Social Security slaying horse you rode in on.
I posit that NOTHING can be fixed until huge gobs of corruption get puked up and the system is purged of the rotten bankster meat that is killing us from the inside.
This prick talking about fairness disgusting. It is a joke, and the joke is on all the rest of us.

It was supposed to have been a long weekend en masse with the rest of the family but financial, time and health considerations eventually meant that DH stayed at home with DS2 and a bout of pneumonia – so bad that he had to call in my mother as a reinforcement on Sunday afternoon – while DS1 and I took the overnight ferry there, coming back 36 hours later.
On Sunday we were taken to the beach, which of course for a 3 year old was the most exciting thing ever, regardless of the fact that it was November and the North Sea was on the nippy side (I didn’t go in the water myself but I ascertained this fact after DS1 paddled for an hour and then went blue when he had an icecream).
The best aspect of Sunday for me, however, was not the water, but the fact that it did not require us to Get on a Bicycle.
I have had a bike for most of my life, and have indeed cycled quite happily round various university towns without much mishap apart from hippy floaty skirts getting stuck in the chain, and one occasion where the heel of my boot fell off half way down the Woodstock Road. However it has been a while since I’ve cycled on a regular basis. DH is going midlife cycle mad (clear victim of the Bradley Wiggins Effect) and the garage is filled with his (what I would call) ‘racer’ bikes – all of them with crossbars too high and saddles too hard for me to see any pleasure at all in trying to go anywhere on them. I also have a fundamental fear of speed, and of being out of control, so I do approach bicycling on random machines in unknown places with a degree of trepidation.
So imagine my delight when we met our lovely Dutch Friend (DF) outside the railway station, and she said she had thought we should hire a bike with a bucket at the front for DS to sit in. At this point I thought that was a fine idea, because I was under the impression that they were three-wheeled. Suited me. However when we got to the bike shop it turned out to be a two-wheeler, with the front wheel about the size of a saucepan lid and a lonnng way away from the rest of the machine. I didn’t fance wobbling that around Amsterdam with my first born and my luggage in the front, so went for the least worst option which was to ride DF’s bike.
Down side #1 of this was that DF was about a foot taller than me, and her bike was such an old rusty boneshaker the bike guy could only lower the saddle a couple of inches. So I had to jump down from the seat to touch the ground.
Down side #2 was that it was reverse-pedal braking. This is frankly a total nightmare, not least because I like to kick off pedalling with my right foot on a high pedal. But when I braked to stop and jumped forward off the seat to put my feet on the ground, the right pedal was invariably down. You couldn’t whizz it back up to starting position (as you would on a NORMAL bike) when you were ready to go, so to start again I had to stagger forward by foot until I got to the top of a bridge (of which there were many, thank goodness) and freewheel down it until my pedals got back into the correct position.
If DH had been there he would have noticed the alarm in my eyes and perhaps kindly suggested I take a taxi, but instead I just had to bite the bullet and go for it. We then spent the next two hours on a ‘scenic’ bike rid round a freezing Amsterdam, me with my eyes glued firmly on the back of DF, running through red lights in a desperate attempt to keep up and not to have to stop. At one point she turned round to find me and I tried to wave but my sleeve got caught on the handle which lurched the bike to the right; at another point, when she and several other cyclists actually had stopped at a red light after all, I somehow couldn’t get my wobbly legs to manoeuvre correctly and sailed straight towards her and a right-turning car, yelling ‘Fuuuuuuuu….’ – a disaster which DF calmly averted by just jamming her left arm out across my chest.
When we finally got to her flat I was a gibbering wreck, and had seen none of the sights at all she’d been trying to point out.
Her (British) boyfriend was thankfully a bit more sympathetic, and when we set out with him in the afternoon to see the Van Gogh exhibition (which, despite priding myself on my knowledge of linguistics AND art history, I’d failed to realise we were going to, thinking we were going somewhere unknown involving something called Ven <guttural cough > Hoch), no one suggested I got back on that bike.
Instead I was challenged to take a ride in the bucket at the front of the rental cycle, which was equally horrendous, but thankfully DS was desperate to go back into it so I was relieved from that position. Instead, after trying various people/bike configurations, it was decided that DF took DS in the bucket cycle, and her boyfriend took her bike … giving me a backie on the back.
I have never had a backie in my life. It has always seemed to me to be totally unnecessary. However the combined assumptions of everyone else that I was capable of this meant that I had to go along with things, or feign madness and fall in a dribbling heap in the middle of the street. So for the rest of the afternoon we mosied around Amsterdam, with me side-saddle on the back of the bike, on a metal structure apparently built for people to sit on. I can assure you that the state of the bruises on my bum do not regard that as true.
The most astonishing thing of the whole experience, however – and one which I still can’t quite get my head round – is the process for mounting. The boyfriend had to start pedalling to get some steam up, with me beetling behind him, and then when he gave me the nod, I had to somehow propel myself forward with my right hip in the lead, fast enough to keep up with him, and land accurately with my right buttock on this metal bit. Then I’d wriggle around until most of my bottom was in the right place, cross my legs at the side, shove my right hand round his waist (cunningly hiding it in his puffa jacket pocket to keep warm), and with my left holding for dear life onto the bike. And we had to do this every time he stopped, which as he is British, was at every red light, and sometimes at the bottom of slopes where our combined weight was defeating him.
Despite all of this, it was Not Too Bad. I couldn’t see where we were going, so just gazed left at lovely Dutch houses lit up in the gloaming, and fairy-lit bridges shining over canals. My bum got numb after a while, so to speak – though I can still feel the aches 3 days later – and before we knew it, I was leaping on and off that bike like a native.
Though when it came to going out for dinner later that day, we took the tram. What would they have proposed otherwise? 3 men on a bike? And alcohol? I knew not to push a good thing.
And thus endeth my observation on backies by a 41 year old woman. Wear padded pants. And look before you leap.A Chocolate a Day Keeps the Blues Away
We all know chocolate can cure a sweet tooth, but did you know that just the smell alone can make you happier? Research has shown that the smell of chocolate can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed. One study at the Cognition and Research Centre at Middlesex University measured brain activity and found that the smell of chocolate caused an emotional high. Other studies found that it significantly reduced theta brain activity, triggering relaxation.
And, it doesn’t stop there. Chocolate offers more than a sugar rush and emotional high. It’s super rich in antioxidants and nourishing moisturizers, which are known to promote overall health.
When Too Faced Founder and Creative Director, Jerrod Blandino, learned about the benefits of cocoa while having a chocolate facial at a Hawaiian spa, he was inspired to combine the power of this natural skin boosting ingredient with makeup. Our cocoa infused bronzer, Chocolate Soleil was launched in spring 2009 and became an instant obsession, followed by its lighter version, Milk Chocolate Soleil. Inspired by their success, we just launched our Chocolate Bar Eye Shadow Collection, a delicious palette that satisfies your beauty craving with 16 irresistibly sweet shades pigmented with pure cocoa powder. Now that’s indulgence.
If a chocolate a day keeps the blues away, then our cocoa powder infused makeup collection is just what the beauty doctor ordered. It’s an instant pick-me-up for your face and your mood. All glam, no guilt.testing content on TweakTown - Page 2

Dog shows are fun and funny. There are times when you will have to travel long distances, and this can be difficult. You have to remember to pack everything you need, before you start your journey. If you forget everything else, please remember to bring a blanket, a pillow, and a stadium seat cushion.
The weather might be a little bit chilly, and the seat cushion is to protect your bottom from the hard bleachers. The pillow is for resting your head when you are traveling in the car, and want to take a light nap. Just in case you have never been to a dog show before, or perhaps you need a friendly reminder as to what you need to take along, here is a list of things you need to include in your travel kit:
– Bottled water– at least a 24 pack
– Zip lock bags – great for storing snacks
– Towels of seat covers– great for protecting your seats from pet hair
– Paper towels– to clean up the spills
– Lint roller– good for removing lint from your clothes or seats
– Air freshener– great for masking doggie scents
– First aid kit– anything can happen along the way
– Raincoat– you never know when the weather will change
– Lifejacket– just an extra precaution
– Prescription medication– please don’t leave home without your meds
– Pack your own chair– unless you want to stand the entire time
Pet Stuff
– Medical records– proof your pet is disease free
– Poop bags– you don’t want to leave home without these
– Pet shot record– proof your pet has all its vaccinations
– Vet number– have the number of a vet in the city you are going
Tips to remember
Always look where you are stepping. Not everyone will bring poop bags, or follow directions. If you step in doggy poop, everyone will know it. You cannot hide the smell.
Bring plenty of treats for your dog, yourself, and any children you might bring along. Your dog will perform better and act nicely if he knew a surprise is waiting.
Whatever you do, please remember to bring the kennel. After all, you don’t want to put up a missing dog sign in another part of the country, right?Thirty years have passed since then… Bakura thought to himself, and laughed. For the longest time, he reminded himself that the only reason he stayed at the monastery involved protection from the authorities, a roof over his head, and a good meal. It was an empty promise, though, much like considering Ryou a means to an end.
The truth was, Bakura eventually came to accept, that he enjoyed it there. For the first time in five thousand years, his soul didn't feel so heavy.
He leaned against the cherry blossom tree.
The monk could no longer climb it. In fact, it had been ten years since anyone had done so. But that didn't matter any more. Viewing the picture in the sand had become far less important over the years. Bakura knew what each and every one was. He could see it in his heart, before and after it was made.
And it was always Ryou. In one form or another, it was always Ryou.
He smiled. The sun was starting to rise in the east, its rays spreading over the sand garden. As the light inched its way towards his feet, the vast colors of sand were illuminated. Swirls of red, pink, and yellow marked the Egyptian sun in the northwest corner of the garden. Soon, long white and blue figures danced in the sand. Pyramids jutted out from behind the dancers, each brick outlined evenly in black.
As Bakura felt the sun on his face, he smiled.
That picture had taken the longest to complete. His body, no longer the pillar of youth, could only draw small sections at a time. A total of two months he had worked on this one, thinking of Ryou with each grain of sand he dropped onto the field. Hoping with each loving touch that he would someday see him again.
Slowly, and painfully, Bakura stood up. His bones creaked with age and abuse, and the millennium ring jangled at his chest. He slowly walked over to the side of the monastery, where he kept the rake.
He smiled as he took it in his hands, and set off towards the start of the garden.
The opening of the large wooden door distracted him. A visitor? He turned around.
Standing in the doorway were all of Ryou's old friends. Bakura froze. The rake fell from his hands, and crashed into the sand, scattering part of an oasis.
"Yu…" he tried to speak, but found the words stuck in his throat.
They were all there.
Yugi Moto stood in the middle. He was still as short as he was before, and perhaps a little shorter. His hair was still spiked, but streaked in grey instead of blonde. He still looked innocent, even after all those years.
Tea stood next to him, her hair tucked neatly into a bun. Yugi had plumped with age, but Tea was still as beautiful as he remembered her. Bakrua supposed that a career of dancing would do that to someone. Her smile was still infectious.
Joey leaned on a cane. He appeared to have injured his left leg. As Bakura stared at it closer, he noticed it was artificial. Surely there was a good story behind that, or at least an amusing one. With Joey, you never knew for sure.
Mai stood next to him. She had lost some of her looks with age, but her charm and spirit still showed through. Several new faces stood next to her. Bakura supposed they were Joey's children and grandchildren. He had such a large family. Perfect for his generous heart.
Tristan looked the most familiar. He had hardly changed a bit, except for his age. His expressions were still the same, and his cocky smile still made Bakura laugh. No wonder his hikari was fond of him.
Kaiba was sitting on the end in a wheelchair, with a quilt draped over his knees. Tristan had brought him in. He hardly resembled the gruff young CEO that Bakura remembered. Instead, he seemed to have softened with age. His eyes actually showed traces of laugh lines.
Surprisingly, as he looked at his visitors, not a single hint of regret appeared across his face. There was only a soft smile.
"Mokuba was taking his son for a flight in the new Kaiba Copter," Yugi smiled. "He saw the drawing of you and Ryou…"
Bakura just stood there. The others nodded their assent.
"That's how we found you." Joey smiled. The group asked a variety of questions, all at the same time. How was he? What happened? How did he end up here, of all places?
Bakura smiled. It was too long of a story. And it was one he'd rather not tell.
"It was a beautiful picture, Bakura… Ryou would have liked it." Yugi finally spoke.
Slowly, Bakura limped over to his friends. All traces of anger and sadness had been raked away. Now, he just smiled. And suddenly, one lifetime didn't seem so useless after all. Maybe Ryou was right all along…
"Oh, Yugi… he does like it…" Bakura replied calmly. He glanced up at the sky, which seemed to smile back. "I know he does…"The Roman emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117-138) left arches in many cities he visited. The arch in Athens marks the entry to the Temple of Zeus. Rant and Reddish describe the arch:
The imposing Arch of Hadrian was constructed in honor of the emperor following the completion of the temple [to Zeus], and Hadrian himself walked through it to attend the dedication of the temple in 131 C.E. The western side of the arch (toward the old city) carries the inscription “This is Athens, the city of Theseus.” The inscription on the eastern side of the arch facing the temple (and toward a section of Athens that had been newly renovated by Hadrian) states, “This is the city of Harrian and not of Theseus. (A Guide to Biblical Sites in Greece and Turkey, 33)
To get a photo like this one requires some good footwork. The arch faces one of the busiest streets in Athens, but one must move out into the street between cars to get an unobstructed view.
Photoshop, and some other photo editing programs, provide the opportunity to manipulate photos in unusual ways. Here is the same photo textured as if it were painted on canvas.
The fourth major persecution of the church by the Roman Empire came in the days of Hadrian.
Where is this arch located in Athens?
You’re right about the footwork. I’ve risked my neck countless times trying to get a good shot too.There was talk of pedestrianising the avenue (traffic would go through a tunnel) but that was before the “crisis” began.
Great post! I’ve always wanted to visit Athens, still hoping that one day I may have the chance to go there and feel and see the wonderful things in Athens and not just in photos or videos anymore. If you are looking for a travel inspiration, has everything you need to know. Travel ideas, Events, guides, what to do, where to go in Athens.

But it’s not just his performances in shows like Breaking Bad that are getting people hot under the collar. Paul is currently starring in a TV advert for games console Xbox One, and a number of users have reported that when he utters the words "Xbox on", it activates the device's Kinetic voice/motion sensor, causing the Xbox to switch on. Reactions have been mixed, with some gamers apparently enjoying their living room interactions with the star and others just finding the phenomenon annoying... HAHAHA omg. @aaronpaul_8 just turned my Xbox One via the Xbox advert. (Which triggered the IR blaster to switch my TV off..)

A bigger than life short film with cutting edge visuals effects. And true emotion... Join the crew ! Read more
Funding Unsuccessful
This project's funding goal was not reached on October 10, 2013.
A bigger than life short film with cutting edge visuals effects. And true emotion... Join the crew !
About this project
Well, How do we Kick-Start ?!
I have always been very thankful that people say they feel a connection to my work. But after a few years, I realized I could go much further artistically. That is why I decided to create a film that would be epic, emotional and hopefully have a strong impact on the audience. More than ever.
A film without any compromise that should be unique and innovative.
I know... It's a lot !
But I do believe Cinema is meant to break limits. To make you feel and live something you would never experienced in the real world.
And this short one is meant to push the line a little bit further... It is a 8 minutes long film that is meant to kick ass.
Twice !
... Yes, it is in 2 parts.
SHOOTING WITHOUT ANY LIMITS :
...OR ARTISTIC COMPROMISE :
Note : All the images below are WORK IN PROGRESS stills from the short film Triumph and Disaster and are completely computer generated.
"IT IS ALL ABOUT EMOTION"
Let me tell you in more detail about this project. So the film is in 2 parts. It can be viewed as a whole piece or as two separate shorts.
And both parts are 4 minutes long.
PART 1 - TRIUMPH
In the first film, a man is standing on the roof of the tallest building of a beautiful city. He is watching the sun rising... The mood is full of happiness and expectation. But who is he ? Why is he here ? The sun begins to spread its light like a wave of gold...
We realize the streets are empty. No one is here.
But there are people in the city... Waiting.
Waiting for him... Waiting for the sun...
Waiting for something that will change their worlds forever !
PART 2 - DISASTER
In the second part, a young girl is looking at us. She is walking into the biggest cathedral ever made... A breath-taking and magnificent place where each inch is pure creation.
She is alone, walking slowly to her destiny. She is beautiful like an angel and she is about to face the unknown. Why is she here ? In this place ? At this exact moment ?
It will be hard to believe what happens next. She will experience one of the most epic moments ever witnessed... Something that will change her destiny in a very radical way.
"THE NEXT STEPS"
The two characters evolve in environments that go beyond reality and that is why we are creating these locations from scratch. Yet it has to look completely real so that the audience ( you and me ) can concentrate on what is really important : Emotion.
I believe that visual effects are here to help to tell a story. So in order to bring this emotion to life, the visual effects have to be perfect. And this is why I’m inviting you.
Visual Effects Breakdown : Here are some samples from Triumph and Disaster before and after the Visual Effects.
The most challenging part is behind us and this is a chance for all of us. It means that if we are strong enough, the first part could be released in approximately 4 months.
All that remains is the 3 big final steps. The most important and tricky ones in fact.
Compositing, Sound Design, Music and something More...
In order to finish these two films the way they should be, your donation will be used to do all the compositing process ( which is 12000 images to work on ! ). It means making the images look photo-real, shooting elements ( like dust, fire...) and using a lot of magic to make theses films just right.
It will also help us to work with great sound designers and musicians, which will give the film the feature quality it deserves so that we can touch the biggest audience possible.
One important thing : Please donate only if you can offer it and if you believe in what I’m creating. If you don't have the financial ability to be part of this project, you can send me a motivational email. It would do the job too.
( .......... And now everyone is going to send me an email........... :).... )
Here we are...
Thank you for you taking the time to read this Kickstarter page and I hope those words will drive a community of motivated people and artists that will help Triumph and Disaster to become what it should be.
I know it is hard to share excitements through the net but I think it is a great opportunity for all of us to be part of a unique experience.
Let's make it big all together.
Pierre MICHEL
Risks and challenges
I’ve read that people ask for donations and then after a time they ask for more for the postproduction. Well, I’ve already taken care of the shoot and some part of the visual effects so I think we can say there is no "risk" to ask for more...
... But for sure this is a huge challenge : to make not 1, but 2 pieces that will stay in your memories for a long time. And that you’ll - hopefully - make yours too.
Thank you.

Wideout Derek Hagan made a 5-yard grab, and running back Jackie Battle caught two balls for 4 yards. They'll all visit the Eagles in Week 12.
In nine games, McCluster has a total of 24 carries for 76 yards. The Titans host the Steelers in Week 11.
Despite the test, McCluster's injury is not expected to be serious. He didn't record a touch in Sunday's loss to the Ravens.:
Jaguars wide receiver Allen Robinson (42 percent owned), Raiders wide receiver James Jones (68 percent), Jets wide receiver Jeremy Kerley (29 percent), Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans (66 percent), or Vikings wide receiver Greg Jennings (53 percent).
If you have Marshall slotted into the flex spot, consider running backs Jerick McKinnon (19 percent) of the Vikings, Justin Forsett (63 percent) of the Ravens, Jacquizz Rodgers (19 percent) of the Falcons, Jonathan Grimes (13 percent) of the Texans, or Dexter McCluster (19 percent) of the Titans.
Maybe it was just the flow of the game, but Greene's role was much-diminished Sunday. Greene saw sporadic playing time, including deep into the fourth quarter, but took a big backseat to both Dexter McCluster and Bishop Sankey. Greene played 46 percent of the team's snaps in Week 1, but has seen that number fall to 16 and 20 percent over the last two weeks.).
Dexter McCluster dominated the backfield timeshare through two weeks, playing 52 offensive snaps to Shonn Greene's 40. However, Greene currently leads the team in rushing with 111 yards on 20 carries. McCluster has 59 yards through the ground on 13 carries, with two catches on three targets.
Bishop Sankey has only played 14 snaps this season, 10 of which came in Week 1. He has eight carries for 28 yards, which ranks third among his running mates. Although Leon Washington has played 22 snaps, he's gotten only four touches. Washington has two carries for 23 yards through two weeks.
McCluster popped up on the injury report Wednesday with a foot injury. The fact that he was upgraded to full practice bodes well for his status Week 3.
The Titans are back in action Week 3 against the Bengals.."
"The number of carries will vary per week depending on the situation of the game, but it is clear that all four guys will be a part of the Titans' game plan on a weekly basis," the website said.
McCluster finished second on the team with nine carries for 29 yards, which trailed Shonn Greene's team-high 71 rushing yards on 15 carries. McCluster did factor into the passing game, but he had just one catch for 17 yards. He was targeted twice.
The Titans are back in action Week 2 against Dallas.
McCluster did have a career-high 511 receiving yards, 53 catches and two touchdowns in 2013 for Kansas City. Though, he had just a career-low eight carries for 5 yards.
Running backs did all right against the Chiefs in 2013. They averaged 18.1 Fantasy points per week, which included a playoff game against the Colts. For the season, running backs averaged 95.2 rushing yards and 42.4 receiving yards against Kansas City, but had much better success against them down the stretch. Over the final nine games, including the playoffs, running backs averaged 117 rushing yards and totaled eight eight rushing touchdowns.
The Titans will probably use McCluster in a similar way to how the Chiefs used him as a pass-catching option. Though, much like Kansas City as well, the running back depth chart is stacked in Tennessee, with Shonn Greene and Bishop Sankey ahead of McCluster on the unofficial depth chart heading into Week 1.
McCluster is probably a better option in PPR formats heading into Week 1 than standard leagues. But he still remains a low-end start in PPR formats.
"We had to list somebody at one," Whisenhunt told The Tennessean. "We're rotating those guys, and he was the senior member. He came back and has worked hard. That's where we are right now."
The depth chart contradicts the conventional wisdom that Sankey, the first back drafted, will end up leading Tennessee in carries.
"I see myself running a lot, and that's what has me most excited right now," McCluster said. "I'm ready to get back out there and see how things unfold."
McCluster is expected to work in committee with Bishop Sankey and Shonn Greene, but he could be the change-of-pace rusher and catch passes out of the backfield."I guess it was based on everything I did in OTAs," McCluster said. "I did pretty much everything, but I was more excited about how much I've been running the ball."How many times per game does McCluster expect to carry the ball this season?"I don't know. I joked around all last year (with the Chiefs), saying, 'Hey, coach, just give me my 10 (carries) and I can make something happen,'" McCluster said. "But really, I'll take as many as I can."
The report says Sankey will share playing time with Shonn Greene and Dexter McCluster. The Titans want Greene to be their power back in goal-line and short-yardage situations, and McCluster has to prove he's more than a specialty back and pass catcher.
The Tennessean recently projected Sankey for more than 1,200 total yards and seven touchdowns. Based on those projections, Sankey would have finished as a Top 20 Fantasy running back in 2013.
"He's the Swiss Army knife now for this team," Walker said of McCluster. "He can play multiple positions, and I think you’re going to see Dexter moving around making great plays for us."
McCluster is expected to be used in a Danny Woodhead-like role for the Titans based on new head coach Ken Whisenhunt, who was the offensive coordinator in San Diego last season.
"I think moving forward we're going to look for another back with just some all-around ability, with size and speed, some explosiveness and possibly one that could stay on the field all three downs," Webster said in a radio interview..
Whisenhunt isn't saying that he exactly will fill that role but did suggest that is the direction the Titans are moving in.
"[W]e'll get an opportunity to see what Dexter can do," Whisenhunt told CBSSports.com from the NFL Owners Meeting in Orlando. "I know he can be successful in the slot, I know he can be successful out of the backfield, I know he can be successful as a returner, but how much we are going to be able to play him is going to be a function of the different roles that he can handle. ... [D]o I see a lot of similarities from the standpoint of matchup problems that you can create? Yeah I'd like to think so."
Whisenhunt added that there are roles they haven't seen McCluster in that they'd like to try, such as running through the A-gaps and pass protecting. He also noted that he can line up in the slot, something Woodhead didn't do much of in San Diego. The more McCluster can do, the more the Titans will use him.
"The Chiefs have gone through several coordinators during McCluster's four seasons and none has been unable to unlock his big-play potential," the report said.
Kansas City recently signed CFL veteran Weston Dressler, who has a similar skill set to McCluster. That could be an indication K.C. is preparing to let McCluster walk.
TSN reports the Chiefs are reportedly on the verge of signing Canadian Football League receiver Weston Dressler, a 5-foot-8, 172-pound speedster who caught 70 balls for just over 1,000yards and nine touchdowns last year for Saskatchewan.
"Weston and his agent were very up front they were going to go through the process and we were made aware of a possible situation coming up in the next couple of days where Weston was more than likely going to get an opportunity," Roughriders GM Jeremy O'Day told reporters. "From our standpoint it's tough to lose such a good player that's been here for a long time, is a leader in the locker-room. But again, you've got to feel happy for him that he gets that opportunity. He hasn't gone through the process of being in the NFL and as any competitor you just want to see how you compare with the best available players. We wish him the best."
ESPN believes that Dressler's arrival could push out McCluster, who has 1,500 receiving yards, 662 rushing yards and six total offensive touchdowns in four seasons. Here's a highlight reel of Dressler's plays.
McCluster was targeted eight times in the game, hauling in seven of those passes for 52 yards. He added one rush for 3 yards in the season-ending loss.
The loss can't remove the luster from McCluster's career-best season. He appeared in 15 of 16 games, racking up career-highs in receptions (53), yards (511) and touchdowns (two), while adding two return touchdowns in the regular season.
McCluster ends the regular season with 53 grabs for 511 yards and two scores. He'll catch passes from Alex Smith in Saturday's wild card game in Indianapolis..
McCluster).
McCluster has 46 receptions for 438 yards and one touchdown this season. He has started five of the 13 games in which he has played.
McCluster has an infection on his ankle that required a minor procedure to clean Thursday, when he spent the night in the hospital.
But considering he gained only 22 yards, his greater contribution by far in Week 14 was on special teams. He was partially responsible for the Chiefs' commanding lead, returning a punt 74 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter. It was the second punt that he returned for a touchdown this season. He had 177 return yards in all.
The Chiefs visit the Raiders in Week 15.
McCluster has stepped up his production over the last few weeks, catching at least five passes for at least 40 yards in each of his last three games.
The others are offensive linemen Rodney Hudson (elbow) and Jeff Allen (groin/knee), defensive end Mike DeVito (knee), defensive back Ron Parker (shoulder) and running back Anthony Sherman (knee/ankle)..
McCluster was targeted a team-high 10 times against San Diego. He was mainly used as a safety valve, averaging just 8.4 yards per catch. McCluster finished with seven receptions for 59 yards. He also had one rushing attempt, but it went for -1 yards. McCluster will take on the Broncos Week 13.
McCluster, who returned five punts for 33 yards, plays San Diego in Week 12.).
McCluster's day would have looked far better had he not dropped a wide-open pass in the second quarter, which would have been an easy touchdown. Instead, it bounced off his arms and the Chiefs went into halftime down by seven.
The Chiefs are on bye next week, then travel to Denver for a Week 11 showdown against the Broncos.
If the popular argument for Dwayne Bowe's downfall this season is Alex Smith's lack of arm strength, then you have to embrace McCluster for the same reasons -- he's a sparkplug x-factor who can take a short pass and run it for several yards after the catch. He's seen 20 targets and 12 receptions over his last three games. When Donnie Avery exploded earlier in the season for 141 yards, everyone was ready to embrace him as a Fantasy asset. Now that he's fallen off, McCluster has emerged -- yet remains owned in just 29 percent of leagues.
The reason for his sudden emergence? Maybe it took McClulster a few weeks to learn the new offense. Maybe he's proven himself in practice. But he has emerged in the last two weeks as a serious pass-catching threat. And with a great matchup and some momentum on his side, McCluster has some great sleeper value in Week 9.
The seven receptions were a season-high for McCluster, who was targeted 10 times in the game. He now has two straight games with 65 or more receiving yards.
McCluster and the Chiefs travel to Buffalo to face the Bills in Week 9.
Then he got hot. McCluster caught three passes for 66 yards after intermission to help his team sneak by upset-minded Houston, 17-16. Included was a 43-yarder late in the third quarter that helped Kansas City move to the brink of a touchdown before the Texans made a goal-line stand.
McCluster, who had just one reception for 10 yards in the previous two games, hopes to take his momentum and run with it next Sunday against Cleveland.
The Chiefs host the Raiders in Week 6.
McCluster finished with five catches for 48 yards, Brock had two catches for 27 yards, Sherman had one catch for 6 yards and Davis had one carry for 2 yards.
Quarterback Alex Smith looked McCluster's way four times in the passing game, but he was only able to bring in one pass for 1 yards. McCluster added a single rush for -3 yards.
McCluster has six receptions for 58 yards on the season. The Chiefs face the Giants in Week 4.
McCluster also managed seven punt returns for 80 yards. His longest punt return went 36 yards.
Kansas City hosts Dallas Week 2.
The Chiefs will play their final preseason game on Thursday against the Packers at Arrowhead Stadium.
Baldwin is listed as a starter alongside Dwayne Bowe, but the Chiefs also boast some depth in Dexter McCluster and Donnie Avery.
McCluster has two grabs in two preseason contests for 21 yards. He's also been returning punts.
Baldwin was not involved with the offense much, as he was not targeted in the passing game. McCluster barely faired better, finishing with just one catch for 12 yards, while being targeted twice.
McCluster and Baldwin are battling for the No. 2 receiver spot across from Dwayne Bowe.
"One million, five hundred and thirty-six ways that I can get the football,"’ McCluster said of his role. "This offense is wide-open. You get opportunities everywhere. It's a fun offense."
"He can do a lot of things, so we're going to let him do lot of things," Reid said of McCluster. "He's a smart kid, tough kid, quick, fast, can catch, run, can do it from the backfield, can do it from a flex style, can do all those things."
"Who knows in my position," McCluster answered. "I'm just out here trying to play and do whatever I can to make a big impact."
McCluster was also asked if this is this a big year for him.
"Most definitely," he said. "Every year is a big year. I'm coming in with a chip on my shoulder, and I know what I can do and what I am capable of. I think it's about time for people to know who I am."Exclusive Interview: Briana Cuoco Happy to Be Stolen By Blake Shelton on ‘The.AM Headlines -- 1.25.13

However, something like 75% of companies essentially drop leads that aren’t ready to purchase immediately. Adopting even a simple nurturing program can give you a significant competitive advantage.
Lead management is a shared responsibility. Your sales team rightly concentrates on the sales-ready, short-term leads. The long-term leads sleeping in your database should be kept with (or returned to) marketing, to be nurtured until they do finally become sales-ready.
Here are the top five reasons why B2B organizations can’t afford to throw away long-term leads – followed by ten fundamentals for nurturing prospects from end to end, from that first contact to the closed deal.
“A sustained relationship with (the) influencers and decision-makers in a potential customer, through which relevant and valuable insight is delivered through integrated channels in a coordinated process, in exchange for increasing intimacy and influence.”
1. B2B buyers are not impulse purchasers. Sales cycles continue to get longer, and involve more decision makers. The business buyer generally researches a product or service and competitive vendors before putting a proposed purchase into a budget plan. The plan itself may take time to be approved, or may need to cycle through annual budgeting. And, the buyer with high accountability for purchases will be cautious.
Research from MarketingSherpa found that 70% of leads generated by marketing are “longer-term opportunities worth nurturing.” If you use nurturing to maintain your mindshare with the prospect, you have a chance to shape buying criteria and expectations, positioning your company as the one most able to deliver desired outcomes.
2. Communication can be a key differentiator. A study conducted by the Bridge Group found it takes an average of seven touches to convert a “suspect” to a “prospect.” In some complex industries with enterprise-level customers and CXO buyers, it often takes between nine and 11 touches before a deal closes.
These touches are often steps along an educational path, with the buyer slowly accumulating the knowledge necessary to make a decision. Where the handoff between sales and marketing happens depends on your process, but make sure not to leave gaps. One thing is clear: Don’t quit communicating too early.
3. The discard pile often contains money cards. According to benchmark research from SiriusDecisions, 80% of the prospects deemed “bad leads” by sales teams do go on to buy within 24 months.
The lead who’s not ready to buy now (but is interested) may just wander off to another vendor – if you don’t keep them warm and engaged with personalized communication and education. Companies ignoring these longer-term leads are handing over opportunities to their competitors. Don’t leave the field.
4. Nurtured leads often end up being more profitable. The Aberdeen Group report “Lead Nurturing: The Secret to Successful Lead Generation” found Best-in-Class organizations see double the bid/win ratio on nurtured leads, compared to peer organizations.
A Lenskold study notes that 28% of marketing teams using marketing automation reported an increase in the average deal size from a marketing qualified lead that was passed to sales; the credit goes to the stronger relationships resulting from nurturing and educating buyers.
5. Leaky funnels are a drain on ROI measures. Too often leads wind up in limbo. Ignored by marketing, not accepted by sales, they languish and either fade away… or just find another vendor. Automated lead nurturing makes it easy to keep pace with the lead, helping them progress through the buyer’s journey without a manual strain on your resources. Advanced organizations track where prospects fall out of the buying cycle, and use this data to shore up shortfalls in the nurturing process.
Keeping leads alive and nurturing them reduces your cost per lead, increasing profitability.
Managing the long sales cycle: If you’re going to keep a deal alive over the course of a long sales cycle, you need to keep the customer relationship alive and healthy. Nurturing lets you establish a rhythm of contact and keep the communications line open with ongoing touchpoints. The marketing and sales teams can work together to deliver a mix of emails, videos, infographics, white papers, invitations to events, and/or phone calls. Your best approach will likely be some combination of several channels; that looks more spontaneous and genuine, less rote. One big plus for using marketing automation to do this is automating the heavy lifting of what to send when, and making sure communications go out on schedule.
"Effective nurturing strategies are built around the customer's journey through the buying process."
Lori Wizdo
Forrester Research
1. Align with sales so you understand buyers’ profiles and specific needs. Work with the sales team to understand and define buyer personas; get clarity and agreement about what a qualified lead looks like for your company and what the buyer’s journey is. Establish common criteria to determine the difference between an inquiry, prospect, marketing- qualified lead, sales-qualified lead, etc. (or whatever segmentation and naming conventions your organization prefers).
Understand what signals buyers give as they progress through the pipeline from stage to stage. It’s critical that sales and marketing align on these criteria and definitions, so you can map content and actions to the stages of the buyer’s readiness.
2. Start simply. Lead nurturing tactics can be very sophisticated, but it’s best to begin simply and then add more complex programs only if needed. If you build a simple framework and launch quickly, you’ll see ROI more quickly. If you create a more complicated plan, test it in steps so that you can analyze the results of each step before executing the next.
Don’t make it more complex than it needs to be. The simpler the program, the easier the execution, and the more obvious the metrics.
3. Keep score. Whether you use prospect-provided explicit data such as BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing), or implicit, observed data such as prospect behaviors, or both, do begin to develop a lead scoring model, and assign numerical values to each characteristic.
Scoring leads will help you determine which contacts need more hand-holding or education before they can take the next step toward conversion. Again, this is easy to complicate. Review your established criteria with your sales team and start with something well-considered… but simple.
4. Develop content that addresses the needs of buyers. Buyers want content that directly addresses the issues they face at each point in the decision process. It’s not enough to have one white paper, and it’s not enough to focus on a single channel. Buyers appreciate product comparison breakdowns, ROI calculators,videos, and case studies as they progress through the buying cycle. Start out by addressing each phase of the education process separately, and fold those individual content pieces into your nurturing campaigns.
5. Avoid one-off messaging that serves your own short-term interests. Remember this: It’s not about you; it’s about your buyers and their desires and hopes. Too many marketers send one-off individual emails with this week’s sales messaging, without considering the prospect’s recent behavior or areas of interest. This could get you and your offerings labeled as irrelevant. Successful nurturers develop coordinated campaigns with a series of scheduled offers, and then track, evaluate, and respond to opens, clicks, registrants, etc.
6. Remember that cadence counts. The main benefits of nurturing are educating your prospects and, in turn, accelerating their buying cycle. To do that effectively you have to develop the right frequency and messaging to place in front of them, without being bothersome. Frequency is important. Depending on which study you read, buyers need from three to 11 encounters with pieces of content before engaging with a solution provider. One of the most successful strategies to accomplish this balance is to develop a content piece you can deliver as a series, e.g. 10 Steps to Transform…, and then deliver a different message around each step over a 10-week process.
7. Plan for progression. Make sure your marketing department can build forms and landing pages that allow prospects to fill in their contact information just once – usually the first time they download a piece of content – and then recognize the returning prospect. This alleviates the nuisance factor of having to fill out a form (again), and sends a signal that your company is both smart and friendly. The next step to consider is adopting progressive profiling practices that allow you to collect a little more information about prospects each time they engage. This is a gentle process that begins with basic contact information, and then gathers more intelligence about needs, budgets, and timelines as the prospect feels more comfortable engaging with your brand. As this dialog progresses, you can exit a prospect from one nurture campaign and enter it in another campaign if it becomes more suitable to this prospect’s evolving business needs or timing.
8. Establish rules for the handoff, and make it two-way. Plan and establish a speedy, seamless process for passing nurtured leads to sales. Once a genuine, proven buying signal has been given, it’s critical to pass the lead as soon as possible. Statistics show that the likelihood of closing a sale drops off dramatically with even a day’s delay, so a real-time handoff is important for effective follow-through. The handoff must go both ways. Leads that appear to marketing to be sales-ready may be disqualified by sales, based on budget, timing, or some other factor that will eventually resolve. These temporarily disqualified leads must come back to marketing. You’ve already invested in a relationship with them and you may have an opportunity to close them later on. (Statistically, you’ll get that second chance within 24 months.) Develop a process to send these “delayed” leads back to marketing, where they can be nurtured until the issues are resolved and they are ready and able to buy.
9. Wake the “dead.” Are there contacts in your CRM system or marketing database that you wrote off when they stalled in the pipeline? Don’t ignore them; find ways to re-engage those contacts with new content. In some cases the dead- lead pile can prove to be very fertile ground for farming new deals. “Nurturing capabilities can be integrated into the sales process to re-engage ‘dead’ opportunities and bring more of them back to life,” suggests Dave Green, co-author of The B2B Refinery and Director of Best Practices, Applied Research, for MECLABS. “For example, survey all the dead leads to find out what’s changed, and use those answers to offer solutions in subsequent email campaigns to get the opportunity back on track.”
10. Set up metrics to track progress. Track measurable indicators, such as how often you get certain data to further qualify or segment leads; click-through rates; conversions through each stage; time to conversion; and so on. As you nurture these prospects and measure your results, you can influence the percentage who progress from a prospect to a lead to a sales-qualified lead and ultimately an opportunity. By tracking the conversion rate at each stage of the funnel, you can improve overall performance and ultimately quantify marketing’s contribution.
Once you’ve gotten nurturing down to a science for closing those prospects, consider how you might use it for upselling existing customers or cultivating retention. These are the highest-value people in your database, and communicating with them on a regular basis just might nurture them into your best advocates.Wahit, Mat Uzir and Hassan, Azman and Mohd.

Rubber toughened polyamide 6/polypropylene (PA6/PP) nanocomposites containing 4 wt % of organophilic modified montmorilonite (OMMT) were produced by melt compounding followed by injection moulding. Four different types of elastomer were incorporated into the blends as a toughener, i.e., ethylene-octene elastomer (POE), ethylene-propylene elastomer (EPR), maleated POE (POEgMAH) and maleated EPR (EPRgMAH). The influences of maleating on the interfacial adhesion and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated in term of mechanical testing, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. The results showed that modulus and strength of the nanocomposites was not significantly affected by types of elastomer and their functionality. However, the toughness of the nanocomposites toughened by maleated elastomer was higher than the unmaleated elastomer. The SEM observation revealed that rubber functionality reduces the elastomer particle size in the PA6/PP matrix due to the in situ formation of graft copolymer between maleated elastomer and PA6 during melt processing. XRD revealed that the type of elastomer and functionality did not affect the dispersion of the organoclay in the system.

Wenger: It's in our interests to finish top
Arsene Wenger has stressed the importance of Arsenal staying first in their Champions League group, and said he would "feel guilty" if the team again got a difficult draw in the last 16 as a consequence of dropping to second.
Arsenal are currently top of a tight table, and Borussia Dortmund's home game against Napoli on Tuesday could potentially set up a three-way tie on 12 points on the last day.
Wenger is intent on reaching that number of points at the Emirates against Marseille and giving his side the best chance of both qualification and top spot.
Week in Pictures

"The draw can be as bad if you finish first as second but you always feel when you finish second and have a bad draw, that you feel guilty," Wenger said. "At least if you do the job well, you qualify and finish first, you can say 'we."
Wenger does feel the team are well primed to do so, the mood very high after the 2-0 win over Southampton.
"I would say the recent history, the recent results of the team have been good but these results are of course linked with quality, but also linked with the quality of attitude of the players.
"It is always difficult to know if you win because the players have a good attitude or do the players have a god attitude because you win? I think you win when the players have a good approach to the game and that is what we have and the confidence is linked with the recent results."

GAO reviewed the Department of the Army's test and acquisition plans for the Common Ground Station (CGS), the fifth version of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) ground station modules (GSM). GAO found that: (1) the Army planned to purchase 22 CGS in two years of low-rate initial production at a cost of $138 million, but it now plans to procure 34 CGS systems; (2) the Army has neither demonstrated an urgent need for CGS nor proved that the expected benefits from accelerated procurement outweigh its risks; (3) by 1998, the Army will need at least 4 CGS to complete operational test and evaluation; (4) since earlier versions of CGS have not tested well or completed an operational test and evaluation, the Army's acceleration of CGS low-rate intial production increases the risk of procuring a costly and ineffective system; and (5) because the Army is only required to purchase one CGS in the second year of low-rate intial production, it could significantly reduce system costs by procuring fewer systems in the early stages of the contract. --------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM: NSIAD-96-71 TITLE: Tactical Intelligence: Accelerated Joint STARS Ground Station Acquisition Strategy Is Risky DATE: 05/23/96 SUBJECT: Defense communications operations Advanced weapons systems Radar equipment Command/control/communications systems Military contracts Army procurement Testing Military systems analysis Ground warfare IDENTIFIER: Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System JSTARS JSTARS Common Ground Station JSTARS Light Ground Station Module E-8 Aircraft JSTARS Medium Ground Station May 1996 TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE - ACCELERATED JOINT STARS GROUND STATION ACQUISITION STRATEGY IS RISKY GAO/NSIAD-96-71 Tactical Intelligence (707119) Abbreviations =============================================================== ABBREV CGS - DOD - STARS - FDT&E - GSM - LPU - LRIP - OT&E - Letter =============================================================== LETTER B-270674 May 23, 1996 Congressional Committees The Army and the Air Force are jointly developing the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS). The Army is responsible for the development, test, production, and fielding of Joint STARS ground station modules (GSM). Because of the cost and importance of the Joint STARS effort and concerns about the GSMs' performance in prior tests, we reviewed the Army's test and acquisition plans for the Common Ground Station (CGS), the next GSM version. We conducted this review under our basic legislative responsibilities. We are addressing this report to the committees of jurisdiction because it identifies problems and calls for corrective action that the Department of Defense (DOD) has indicated an unwillingness to take. We are suggesting that Congress may wish to take the necessary action to ensure that DOD addresses the problems we have identified. RESULTS IN BRIEF ------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1 The Army's acquisition strategy to accelerate production of the CGS system unnecessarily risks millions of dollars on an unproven system. The Army had anticipated procuring 22 CGS systems in 2 years of low-rate initial production (LRIP) at an estimated cost of about $138 million. However, the Army contracted for 18 systems in the first LRIP year, 8 more than originally planned and 14 more than needed for a planned fiscal year 1998 operational test and evaluation (OT&E)\1 of the CGS. Furthermore, the Army's fiscal year 1997 budget request reflects a plan to acquire 16 systems in the second LRIP year, 4 more than originally planned. Because earlier GSM versions have performed poorly in developmental level tests and have yet to complete an OT&E, and because OT&E can be a key internal control to ensure that decisionmakers have objective information available on a weapon system's performance, we believe that buying more systems than are needed for OT&E significantly raises the risk of procuring a costly and ineffective system. At the direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, the Army accelerated the program and moved the first fielding date for the CGS from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 1998. However, DOD and the Army do not have analyses demonstrating an urgent need to field the added capabilities of the CGS system 4 years earlier than originally planned or showing that expected benefits of accelerated procurement, prior to the successful completion of an OT&E, outweigh the associated risks. DOD believes that (1) the Army's acquisition strategy espouses prudent risk and (2) the CGS is not an immature system but rather it has the same functional baseline as the Light GSM. Our concern with DOD's approach is that it relies heavily on the functional baseline of the Light GSM when that system has experienced poor test results, and that the Light GSM and other earlier GSMs have not successfully completed an OT&E. For example, the Light GSM passed only 1 of 12 performance-related criteria during tests in 1994 and 1995. Moreover, the OT&E for the CGS is not scheduled until fiscal year 1998.. Given these facts, we believe the Army's acquisition strategy contains risks that could be easily mitigated. -------------------- \1 OT&E is the primary means of assessing weapon system performance in a combat-representative environment. It is defined as (1) the field test, conducted under realistic conditions, to determine an item's effectiveness and suitability for use in combat by typical military users and (2) the evaluation of the results of such a test. BACKGROUND ------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2 Joint STARS is a multiservice, multimode radar system that is to provide the capability to locate, track, and classify wheeled and track vehicles beyond ground line of sight, during day and night, under most weather conditions. It is to provide Army Corps and Division commanders an "electronic high-ground" from which to observe enemy forces across the forward line of their own troops into an enemy's first and second echelons. The Joint STARS radar is mounted on an Air Force E-8 aircraft, a Boeing 707 variant. It is to provide real-time information simultaneously to operators in the aircraft and operators in Army GSMs. These GSMs are to have the ability to supplement this radar data with unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and electronic intelligence reports. Through fiscal year 2001, the total cost of the Army's Joint STARS development and acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. Since the Joint STARS program inception, four versions of GSMs have been developed prior to the CGS. They are the Limited Procurement Urgent, the Interim GSM, the Medium GSM, and the Light GSM. Descriptions of the various GSMs are provided in appendix I. Production quantities by fiscal year and GSM variant\2 are detailed in table 1. Table 1 GSM Production Quantities By Fiscal Year And Variant CGS Limited (original Procuremen Medium Light planned Fiscal Year t Urgent GSM GSM buys) ---------------------------- ---------- ------ ------ ------------ 1987 3 1988 6 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 5 1994 7 1995 8 1996 2 10\a 1997 12\b 1998 12 1999 10 2000 10 2001 7 2002 6 2003 6 ====================================================================== Total 9 12 10 73 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \a The Army actually ordered 18 systems in this year. \b The Army's fiscal year 1997 budget request reflects an intent to acquire 16. -------------------- \2 The Interim GSM never entered production and no future production is planned. THE CGS ACQUISITION PLAN ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1 The Army recently issued a solicitation for the CGS system and selected a contractor to produce the system. It awarded an 8-year production contract\3 on December 14, 1995, and made a fiscal year 1996 commitment to the production of 18 systems,\4 the maximum production allowed by the solicitation. The CGS system is to provide the same functionality as the Light GSM with an initial enhancement of the integration of secondary imagery data, and planned additional enhancements provided by post-award contract modifications. The CGS acquisition strategy provides for 2 years of LRIP, during which the Army anticipated buying 22 CGS systems at an estimated cost of about $138 million, though it received approval from DOD to procure up to an additional 16 CGS systems to accommodate other service and allied requirements. The Army's first year commitment to 18 systems and current plan to acquire 16 systems in the second year raises the estimated 2-year LRIP cost to over $153 million. Regarding program cost, DOD stated that the CGS LRIP quantity includes not only the number needed for testing purposes, but considers production rate efficiencies and cost factors. It believes that producing only four prior to test would require the stop and restart of production, resulting in loss of skilled people, inefficient use of contractor resources, and higher costs. The CGS LRIP quantity does not, however, reflect consideration of production rate efficiencies and cost factors because under the CGS contract's pricing structure, the planned second LRIP year acquisitions can be purchased in later years at lower cost. In sum, under the CGS contract, the Army can save millions of dollars by lowering future CGS LRIP acquisitions to the minimum quantity necessary to maintain the contract\5 and then contracting for those systems in the post-LRIP years. The Light GSM and the Medium GSM were scheduled to be operationally tested during a Joint STARS multiservice OT&E. That test was delayed and then altered because of the deployment of Joint STARS assets to the European theater to support Bosnian operations. The Army now plans to evaluate the Medium and Light GSMs during that deployment and follow-on tests, if needed. It also plans to conduct an initial OT&E of the CGS system in the first quarter of fiscal year 1998. The degree and length of that initial OT&E will depend on how similar the CGS system is to its predecessors, which will be a function of the approach that the CGS contractor follows. The CGS solicitation provided functional specifications such that the proposals received may or may not represent significant hardware and software differences from already procured GSMs. The degree of technological difference between the CGS system and its predecessor systems, the Light GSM and Medium GSM, depends on the approach taken by the contractor. That difference will, in turn, influence the degree to which the Light and Medium GSM's performance during any OT&E can and should be relied upon as an indicator of the CGS's maturity to continue production. Furthermore, the more similar the CGS system is to its predecessors, the less extensive its initial OT&E will need to be. -------------------- \3 The CGS contract contains one firm fiscal year's commitment to production and options for production during the following 7 fiscal years. \4 Under its approved acquisition strategy, the Army anticipated buying 10 of 22 LRIP systems in the first LRIP year. The Army's actual commitment to 18 systems includes the 10 originally anticipated, 2 for North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces experimentation, and 6 for, as yet unrequested/undefined other service or allied uses. Any of the remaining six not otherwise distributed are to be given to Army users. \5 A program official stated and our review of the contract indicates that the Army needs to commit to only one system in each option year of the contract to maintain it. THE ARMY HAS NOT JUSTIFIED ACCELERATED PRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3 The Army began procuring CGS systems prior to the completion of an OT&E by any GSM. However, the Army did not perform any risk analyses demonstrating that there was (1) an urgent need for the added capabilities of the CGS system or (2) any significant benefit to be derived from its accelerated procurement. According to DOD, the revised CGS development and production schedule fields ground stations in synch with E-8C aircraft deliveries. Under the prior development schedule, the Army planned to continue to buy pre-CGS model ground stations--presumably also in synch with E-8C aircraft deliveries. Furthermore, an Army official in the program executive office that has oversight of the Army's Joint STARS program stated that the Air Force is behind in its E-8C delivery schedule and that, as a result, GSM acquisition is currently scheduled ahead of aircraft fieldings. LRIP ACQUISITIONS PRIOR TO OT&E RAISE PROGRAM RISKS ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1 Over the years, we have reported on numerous instances in which production of both major and nonmajor systems were optimistically permitted to begin under LRIP and continue based on factors other than the systems' technical maturity. In our November 1994 report on the use of LRIP in the acquisition process,\6 we detailed a number of examples of systems that entered LRIP before operational tests were conducted and that later experienced significant problems. For example, a year into the LRIP of the Navy T-45A aircraft, OT&E demonstrated that the T-45A was not effective in a carrier environment and was not operationally suitable because of safety deficiencies. Subsequent major design changes included a new engine, new wings, and a modified rudder. DOD believes that, unlike the Navy T-45A aircraft, the CGS is not a new, immature system. It has stated that the CGS system uses 100 percent of the Light GSM mechanical design, rack structure, power distribution, lighting, ventilation, and air conditioning. It has also stated that the Light GSM software baseline is the CGS baseline and that the CGS system represents the Light GSM functional baseline with the addition of product improvements. However, the CGS contractor may make configuration changes that could represent significant hardware and software differences from already procured GSMs.\7 Furthermore, DOD's position is also contradicted by the 2-year delay of the GSM full-rate production decision to follow a CGS OT&E and by the Joint STARS integrated product team's call for an independent assessment of the CGS's testing risk, given the nature and extent of the configuration changes that the selected contractor may make.. While there is an operational need for Joint STARS, and despite the desire of operational commanders to have more capable systems as soon as possible, the fact remains that the Army has not adequately justified the urgency or benefits to be derived from accelerated fielding of the CGS in 1998 versus the originally planned fielding in fiscal year 2002. -------------------- \6 Weapons Acquisition: Low-Rate Initial Production Used to Buy Weapon Systems Prematurely (GAO/NSIAD-95-18, Nov. 21, 1994). \7 Although the contractor that produced the Medium and Light GSMs was awarded the CGS contract, uncertainty remains as to how technologically similar the CGS system will be to its predecessors. PRIOR TEST RESULTS FURTHER INDICATE RISK ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2 The Army's CGS acquisition strategy seems to ignore the fact that to date the GSMs have undergone limited testing and demonstrated disappointing results in those tests. That acquisition strategy allowed the Army to begin procuring CGS systems without demonstrating resolution of issues raised as a result of prior tests and will allow it to continue procuring systems without demonstrating resolution of those issues. In December 1991, a decision was made that the Medium GSM would undergo a limited user test rather than a traditional initial OT&E. The absence of important functionality, including an unmanned aerial vehicle interface, a production representative data link, Defense Mapping Agency electronic map databases, and trained military operators, prompted this decision. Based on the results of this test, which occurred in early 1993, the Army Operational Test and Evaluation Command provided an overall assessment of the Medium GSM's performance. It stated that the Medium GSM "consistently demonstrated potential to be operationally effective" and that the Medium GSM "demonstrated potential to be operationally suitable" (emphasis added). However, this was not a finding that the Medium GSM was operationally effective or suitable. The Command also noted that the "current software lacks robustness and reliability, and limits mission performance." One of the Command's recommendations was that prior to LRIP fielding, the Medium GSM "must successfully complete an independently evaluated operational demonstration including simultaneous employment of all software, interface, and tactics, techniques, and procedures corrections." The Medium GSM has yet to successfully complete an independently evaluated operational test. Its initial OT&E was to be the multiservice OT&E. The Medium GSM follow-on system, the Light GSM, was also to participate in the multiservice OT&E. Like the Medium GSM, the Light GSM has yet to complete an OT&E. The Light GSM has, however, undergone other tests, including a Force Development Test and Evaluation (FDT&E) in September 1994; reliability confidence testing from October through December 1994; and a follow-on demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base in January 1995. In May 1995, we reported to the Secretary of Defense\8 that based on a preliminary review of those test results, it was clear that the Light GSM had not met the DOD-set LRIP exit criteria\9 and that our preliminary analysis indicated that, at best, the Light GSM had only passed 2 of the 12 Light GSM performance-related LRIP exit criteria. At the same time, the DOD Director of OT&E concluded that the Light GSM had only passed 1 of the 12 Light GSM performance-related LRIP exit criteria. The Director recommended a formal review of the program to identify the causes of problems, solutions, and appropriate tests to demonstrate the solutions. In a June 30, 1995, memorandum, the Director, commenting on efforts to resolve 55 specific problems identified in the Light GSM testing, stated that his goal "was to see that the Army had identified the key problems and was working effective fixes for those problems." He added that he wanted the Joint STARS multiservice OT&E "to have a reasonable chance of success." According to an OT&E official, the Director's assessment of the Light GSM's performance during those tests has not changed. The issue of the 55 specific problems was resolved based on the Director's satisfaction "that the Army has identified a process to fix the various problems that have been identified . . . ." In response to a draft of this report, DOD commented that In some instances, problems were attributed to shortfalls in operator training or another non-materiel cause. The majority of deficiencies involved software fixes, not major hardware redesign. The Army has also gained experience operating the GSMs assigned to the III Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps and in training and preparation for multi-service OT&E. In November 1995, the Program Executive Officer for Joint STARS certified the system ready for OT&E, which attests to the developer's confidence in system maturity. DOD believes that the GSMs' prior test results indicate only prudent program risk. It states that the series of tests used in development of the GSMs, including a limited user test, FDT&E, reliability confidence testing, and other demonstrations, have been a continuous fix-test-fix process, which has identified shortfalls, determined fixes, and verified or tested the results. It also notes that during the current deployment of Joint STARS to the European Theater (Bosnia-Herzegovina), members of the Army and the Air Force test commands will conduct an operational evaluation of Joint STARS performance. Although the Army and the Air Force plan to operationally evaluate Joint STARS during that deployment, how well the Army's process has worked remains to be demonstrated through the Light GSM's performance during an OT&E. -------------------- \8 Production of Joint STARS Light GSM (GAO/NSIAD-95-172R, May 26, 1995). \9 Exit criteria define program achievements for a phase of the acquisition program that are measures of progress (risk reduction). In the event exit criteria are not met, a program delay or review may be triggered. DELAYING COMMITMENTS WOULD LOWER COST ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3 The Army's commitment to its currently planned second year LRIP buy of 16 CGS systems prior to the completion of the CGS OT&E would raise not only the program's risk but also its cost. The CGS contract provides decreasing unit costs over its 8-year life. Furthermore, a program official stated and our review of the contract indicates that the Army needs to commit to only one CGS system in the second LRIP year to maintain the contract. If the Army buys one system in fiscal year 1997 and 37 systems in the third and fourth years of the contract, it could save over $5 million while obtaining the same 4-year buy of 56 systems currently anticipated given its fiscal year 1997 budget request and approved acquisition strategy. These savings can be seen in a comparison of tables 2 and 3. Table 2 details the first 4 years of the contract's variable CGS acquisition costs under the Army's anticipated future buy schedule. Table 3 details the first 4 years of those costs under a plan that minimizes the size of the second year LRIP commitment. Table 2 Cost of Anticipated 4-Year Acquisitions Fiscal Fiscal Year Year Fiscal Fiscal 1996 1997 Year Year (LRIP) (LRIP) 1998 1999 Total -------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ======== Quantity 18 16\a 12 10 56 Costs $34,907, $24,834, $18,825, $14,931, $93,499, 358 952 622 544 476 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \a In its acquisition strategy, the Army anticipated buying 12 systems but now plans to buy 16. Table 3 Cost of 4-Year Acquisitions With Minimized Future LRIP Fiscal Fiscal Year Year Fiscal Fiscal 1996 1997 Year Year (LRIP) (LRIP) 1998 1999 Total -------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ======== Quantity 18\ 1 20 17 56 Costs $34,907, $1,885,7 $28,479, $22,975, $88,248, 358 66 972 513 609 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RECOMMENDATION ------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4 The Army lacks an analysis justifying a need to accelerate the fielding of the CGS system and can save millions of dollars by minimizing production in its second year of CGS production. Furthermore, there are inherent risks in procuring systems prior to their successful completion of an OT&E and the benefits of the Army's acquisition strategy do not clearly outweigh the associated risks. We therefore recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to limit the future system procurement to the minimum quantity necessary to maintain the CGS contract (i.e. one system in each contract option year) until the CGS has successfully completed an OT&E. AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR EVALUATION ------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5 In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD disagreed with our conclusion that the Army's CGS acquisition strategy was unnecessarily risky and our recommendation to reduce that risk. DOD took the position that the acquisition strategy espouses prudent risk in balance with program cost, schedule, and technical requirements. DOD's comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix II. MATTERS FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION ------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6 In light of DOD's unwillingness to have the Army revise its acquisition strategy for the CGS, Congress may wish to take the actions necessary to limit the number of CGS systems to be procured under LRIP prior to the CGS successfully completing operational testing. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY ------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7 During this review, we interviewed officials at and reviewed documents from the offices of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology and the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation in Washington, D.C. We also visited officials and reviewed documents from the U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity, Aberdeen, Maryland, and the U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Command, Office of the Program Manager for Joint STARS, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. We conducted this review from August 1995 to April 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1 We are sending copies of this report to other appropriate congressional committees; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, and the Air Force.

The LPU GSMs were produced and deployed as replacements to the AN/UPD-7 Ground Station Terminal. They receive data from the Mohawk Side Looking Airborne Radar and do not receive/process data from Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) E8 aircraft. The Army acquired nine LPU GSMs. They are expected to be decommissioned no later than fiscal year 1997. Interim Ground Station Module (GSM). The Interim GSM receives and processes data from both the Joint STARS E8 aircraft and the Mohawk Side Looking Airborne Radar. Eight engineering and manufacturing development Interim GSMs were developed and fielded to the XVIII Airborne. These systems represent the current GSM contingency force. The Interim GSM was deployed to Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield. No production is planned. Medium GSM. This module provides enhancements to the Interim GSM capability. Its development stemmed from a Department of Defense (DOD) decision that was made in fiscal year 1989 to restructure the Army Joint STARS GSM program. The Medium GSM enhancements include a downsized electronic suite, an enhanced man/machine interface with extensive Built In Test/Built In Test Equipment capabilities, and the ability to simultaneously display and analyze data from multiple sensors. The Army acquired 12 Medium GSMs. Light GSM. This module is housed in a light weight multipurpose shelter, a standard integrated command post shelter variant, mounted on a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle. It is to provide the light/contingency forces a C130 Drive-on/Drive-off Joint STARS capability. The Light GSM has a prime and support vehicle, each with a trailer/generator in tow. It is supposed to be able to operate on the move, receive unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and intelligence reports, and incorporate electronic map backgrounds. The Army plans to acquire a total of 10 Light GSMs. Common Ground Station (CGS). The CGS system is to provide Light GSM functionality with the addition of the integration of secondary imagery data. Further enhancements are expected and are to be achieved through post-award modifications to the contract. Two versions of this ground station are being contemplated (i.e., a light and heavy CGS). The Light CGS will be patterned on the Light GSM two-vehicle configuration. The heavy CGS is to be a track-mounted system, intended to provide the heavy forces a high speed, cross-country/off-road GSM. It is to be integrated into a Bradley Fighting Vehicle variant. Integration of the CGS capability into a tracked vehicle is part of the preplanned product improvement initiatives and will not be included in the fiscal year 1996 CGS contract award. Initial CGS fielding is planned for fiscal year 1998. The Army currently anticipates the acquisition of 73 CGS systems. (See figure in printed edition.)Appendix II COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE =========================================================== Appendix I (See figure in printed edition.) and pp. 5-6. (See figure in printed edition.) (See figure in printed edition.) (See figure in printed edition.) (See figure in printed edition.) The following are GAO's comments on DOD's letter dated January 24, 1996. GAO COMMENTS --------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1 1. While the CGS contractor has prior experience developing and producing ground stations, those ground stations have undergone limited testing and demonstrated disappointing results. Among its previous work, the CGS contractor developed and produced the two immediate predecessor GSMs to the CGS, the Medium and Light GSMs. As we stated in our report, based on the results of a limited user test of the Medium GSM, the Army Operational Test and Evaluation Command stated that the Medium GSM consistently demonstrated the potential to be operationally effective and the potential to be operationally suitable. It noted that the "current software lacks robustness and reliability, and limits mission performance." It recommended, among other things, that prior to LRIP fielding the Medium GSM "must successfully complete an independently evaluated operational demonstration including simultaneous employment of all software, interface, and tactics, techniques, and procedures corrections." Furthermore, the Light GSM passed only 1 of 12 performance-related criteria during developmental testing, and neither the Medium nor the Light GSM has yet successfully completed an OT&E. 2. We continue to believe that the CGS acquisition strategy risks millions of dollars on systems that have not yet been demonstrated operationally effective and suitable. We have, however, revised the report to reflect the Army's apparent commitment to evaluate the operation of the Joint STARS system during deployment to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 3. We have revised our recommendation to allow the Army to maintain its CGS contract in effect and thus avoid a break in production. Because the contract provides decreasing unit costs over its life, and since the Army has already committed to 18 first-year LRIP systems, we want to further limit LRIP pending successful completion of an OT&E. *** End of document. ***So You're Extinct?

DAVE SENKO: Tommy, 65 today, maybe just some thoughts how your round went, and it looks like just the one birdie at No. 12.
TOMMY ARMOUR III: 12 and 16. It was a solid round. I hit the ball pretty good most of the day and my irons got a little iffy at the end but it was pretty good.
I hit it close almost every hole on the front side, made five birdies.
DAVE SENKO: Four in a row there, do you remember how far your putt was on No. 7, the par 5.
TOMMY ARMOUR III: I 2-putted from about 35 feet. The next hole I hit it about ten feet. Next hole I hit it about ten feet. At 1, I hit it about 20 feet and made that.
2, hit it about five feet and missed that.
3, I hit it about 15 feet and missed that.
4, I hit it about eight feet and missed that.
5, a foot from the hole. Next hole, 25 feet.
12, I drove it down there perfect and I had about 104 yards to the hole and hit sand wedge and just didn't quite hit it good enough. It hit that bank and kind of spun back, went in the water.
Q. Nice crowd today??
TOMMY ARMOUR III: Nice crowd today, independence day or Canada Day, a lot of people out there enjoying themselves, great weather good, venue, so it's good.
Q. At the beginning of the day, were you feeling well on the course??
TOMMY ARMOUR III: No, this isn't hot. It's perfect golf weather.
Q. Your performance --
TOMMY ARMOUR III: You mean this year? I kind of played bad the second part of last year and the first part of this year, and I've been working on some things. You know, they are starting to -- I can see good signs. So, yeah, it's nice to get positive feedback.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY ARMOUR III: Yeah, that's why I'm here.
Q. Nice way to get started.
TOMMY ARMOUR III: Yeah, absolutely. 7-under is better than 6-under and 8-under is better than 7-under. Out here on this Tour, you've got to just keep adding them on, because you don't -- you'll get passed.
I learned a long time ago, it is what it is, and you can make a 30 footer and then miss a 3-footer on the next hole. Did you really let one get away, or did you gain one? It's just the game of golf. The whole adage of one shot at a time is boring and old and overdone and used, but it's the truth.
DAVE SENKO: Thanks, Tommy.

Most of the high carbs I had to give up were not an issue--after nine months I find that I can live without them. But there are still a few favorites I can't do without; and yes one of them is the good ol' cheeseburger and fries. I know I can have everything except the bun and fries, but where is the fun in that? I tried it and it was like drinking 3.2 beer. What's the point?
A friend of mine suggested I try portobello mushrooms in place of the bun. Genius!! And it was easy. Remove the stems from the mushrooms and brush the whole cap with olive oil, Pop them into a 400F oven, gill side up, for 10 minutes; flip and cook an additional 10 minutes. Now they are ready to use for your favorite hamburger recipe.
Now for the fries. Additional research led me to try daikon radishes as a source for my "would-be" fries. Daikon is a root vegetable that has the appearance of a long white carrot. Peel and slice into your favorite fries shape. Toss in olive oil and salt and pepper and spread onto a baking sheet. Bake in a 450F oven until brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and transfer to a paper-towel lined platter. Serve with a dipping sauce.Latest Molecular biology Stories

“I’m excited to be back,” said the 45-year-old Chua, reunited with his Tanduay players Eric Menk and Rudy Hatfield at Ginebra. “Who wouldn’t be excited to join the league’s most popular team? It’s an honor to work with the San Miguel group. I can’t believe it happened so quickly. I got a call from (San Miguel Corp. sports director) Noli (Eala) last week asking about my availability. Then, he called again last Wednesday. Two days later, I attended my first Ginebra practice at Xavier Gym.”
Chua said he was welcomed warmly by the coaching staff and players. “I respect coach Siot (Tanquingcen) a lot,” he said. “Coach Siot is a true professional, he knows his stuff and he’s very hard-working. His attention to detail is incredible. He’s open to suggestions from his staff and players. How I’ll fit in depends on what Coach Siot wants me to do. The way he runs the team, it’s great. I hope to be able to contribute to the team’s performance even in a small way.”
With Tanduay, Chua brought the team to four finals in six conferences but never won a championship. With Sta. Lucia, he was coach Norman Black’s assistant when the Realtors captured the 2001 Governors Cup crown. Chua later succeeded Black at the Sta. Lucia helm. Chua was also Black’s assistant at Pop Cola for two years. Before jumping to the PBA, Chua took Tanduay to nine PBL finals and bagged seven titles.
“In my first PBA conference as Tanduay head coach, we went to the finals,” said Chua. “I think Ginebra has a chance to make many more finals. I can see the team winning again. Kerby (Raymundo) makes us tough inside. He’s a go-to guy who can free up our wings. Dylan (Ababou) is young and athletic, can drive strong to the hoop and shoot the jumper. Mark (Caguioa) and Jay-Jay (Helterbrand) are stars but they don’t have a star complex. At practice, they push themselves to the limit. Their attitude is inspiring. I was surprised to find out how hard they work. I’m not sure if fans realize how valuable Mark and Jay-Jay are to the team. As for Rudy, he couldn’t believe I had joined the team when we first saw each other at practice. And when I saw Eric, we embraced like long-lost brothers. Eric just got the go-signal from doctors to play.”
Chua said his basketball philosophy is right down Ginebra’s alley. “I like explosive, exciting, up-and-down basketball which is what Ginebra plays so I think I fit right in,” he said. “As a consultant on the bench, I’ll try to give the team a little more energy. I feel the sky’s the limit for this team and I’m just so happy I can be a part of its future.”
Chua said he’ll be back with his trademark long hair. “What a way to start the new year,” he said. “I can’t get any luckier than being invited to join Ginebra. When I was away from the PBA, I continued to be involved with basketball although I hardly watched the PBA on TV. For a while, I was the NCAA commissioner in the juniors division and worked with the technical staff in the UAAP. At the moment, I am the commissioner of the Tiong Lian league of Chinese high schools.”
Chua said he’s looking forward to the start of the second conference with import Chris Alexander. “I didn’t watch Chris when he played with Ginebra four years ago so I can’t compare how he’s playing now with how he played before,” he said. “But I can see he’s getting into game-shape. For sure, he’ll make us more competitive.”
Chua said joining the Ginebra coaching staff gives him the opportunity to learn more about the game. The assistant coaches are Allan Caidic, Juno Sauler and Art de la Cruz. “Allan’s always been my idol,” said Chua. “Juno and Art know the game well. They’re all very competent and knowledgeable. I’m excited to learn from them and share whatever ideas I have. Samboy (Lim) as our manager is another advantage for us.”
A former UST cager, Chua admitted he didn’t realize how much he missed the PBA until he showed up for his first Ginebra practice last Friday. He is married to the former Jocelyn Penaloza, his high school sweetheart, with four children, Marc Francis, 17, Kyle Francis, 15, Nathan Francis 13 and Cody Francis, 10.[Date Prev] [Date Next] [Thread Prev] [Thread Next] [Date Index] [Thread Index]

Multimedia Access Anytime, Anywhere
On-the-go media streaming is the main selling point for the MegaCloud app. Users aren’t limited to just sharing files with friends and across computers and devices. In addition to enabling uploads for files of any type, the app affords you the chance to play your favorite audio and video right within the app without having to download them first. Photos can be pulled up on demand and viewed with a full-screen photo explorer, then allowing you to download and share photos from your online album without saving to jump between different apps. And, while native video and music streaming isn’t currently available, you can play multimedia with a little help from external apps of your choice. This saves you a lot of download time and data charges.
Take Control of Your Files
Having a smooth, seamless multimedia experience isn’t the only convenience MegaCloud offers. Want to edit documents on the fly? Just fire up the app and you’re able to edit them right on the cloud. Like most cloud storage services, MegaCloud lets you share folders and links to your uploaded content, as well as bookmark them for easy access later. Uploading is a breeze, as the app lets you select an entire bunch of files for uploading at one time through the native file explorer. A simple long press or tap on the arrow icon lets you share, rename, remove, download or bookmark a file or folder.
Protect and Restore with Ease
Once you sign up, you’re offered a pretty generous 5 GB of free storage. An additional 1 GB is given away once you install the app on your mobile device. The app also comes with a nifty password lock feature, perfect for keeping your files out of reach. The Megacloud desktop client runs on Windows and Mac and lets you review and retrieve deleted files, even letting you restore your cloud folders to an earlier saved state if you need to. This comes in handy for when you accidentally delete everything or if you just want to do a system restore with a simple tap.
MegaCloud for Android is available for free on the Google Play Store. Minimum system requirement is Android 2.2. For users who need a little more storage space, subscription upgrades are available at the following rates: 30 GB for US$4.99/month, 60 GB for US$9.99/month, and 150 GB for US$19.99/month.
With an app like MegaCould, cloud storage and file retrieval is made easier. What features do you consider in selecting a cloud storage app that would best fit your needs?(A) requirements as determined by the department; and administration of funds to cover the costs for these activities. The period of institutional controls will be determined by the department, but institutional controls may not be relied upon for more than one hundred years following transfer of control of the disposal site to the owner.
(B) The performance objectives for the general requirements of a land disposal facility are to ensure public health and safety. Land disposal facilities shall be sited, designed, operated, closed, and controlled after closure to provide reasonable assurance that the following performance objectives will be met.
(1) Concentrations of radioactive material which may be released to the general environment in ground water, surface water, air, soil, plants, or animals must not result in an annual dose exceeding the equivalent of 0.25 millisievert (twenty-five millirem) to the whole body, 0.75 millisievert (seventy-five millirem) to the thyroid, or 0.25 millisievert (twenty-five millirem) to any other organ to any member of the public. Reasonable effort should be made to maintain releases of radioactivity in effluents to the general environment as low as is reasonably achievable.
(2) The design, operation and closure of the land disposal facility shall ensure protection of any individual inadvertently intruding into the disposal site and occupying the site or contacting the waste at any time after institutional controls over the disposal site are removed.
(3) Operations at the land disposal facility shall be conducted in compliance with the standards for radiation protection as set out in Chapter 3701:1-38 of the Administrative Code, except for those releases of radioactivity in effluents from the land disposal facility, which shall be governed by paragraph (B)(1) of this rule. Every reasonable effort should be made to maintain radiation exposures as low as is reasonably achievable.
(4) The disposal facility shall be sited, designed, used, operated, and closed to achieve long-term stability of the disposal site and to eliminate, to the extent practical, the need for ongoing active maintenance of the disposal site after closure so that only surveillance, monitoring, or minor custodial care are required.
(5) The licensee shall develop and implement security measures to protect against and to detect unauthorized access to radioactive material or safety and security systems from external as well as internal threats. The licensee shall perform periodic inspections to ensure that all radioactive material is accounted for and that safety and security systems are operating as designed. The licensee shall report any deficiency involving the radioactive material inventory or a safety and security system to the department.
(6) The radioactive waste and its containers shall be protected from adverse environmental conditions including, but not limited to, temperature changes that could compromise the isolation of the waste from the biosphere.
(7) The licensee shall use standard engineering designs and procedural practices to maintain doses to people, and radionuclide releases to the environment, as low as reasonably achievable.
(C) The operation of the disposal facility shall incorporate the following items.
(1) Wastes designated as Class A pursuant to paragraph (A) of rule 3701:1-54-10 of the Administrative Code shall be segregated from other wastes by placing in disposal units which are sufficiently separated from disposal units for the other waste classes so that any interaction between Class A wastes and other wastes will not result in the failure to meet the performance objectives of this rule. This segregation is not necessary for Class A wastes if they meet the stability requirements of in paragraph (B) of rule 3701:1-54-10 of the Administrative Code.
(2) Wastes designated as Class C pursuant to paragraph (A) of rule 3701:1-54-10 of the Administrative Code, shall be disposed of with intruder barriers that are designed to protect against an inadvertent intrusion for at least five hundred years.
(3) Only waste classified as Class A, B, or C pursuant to rule 3701:1-54-10 of the Administrative Code, shall be acceptable for land disposal. All waste shall be disposed of in accordance with requirements of paragraphs (C)(4) to (C)(11) of this rule.
(4) Waste shall be packaged in appropriate containers for disposal when applicable. Wastes shall be emplaced in a manner that maintains the package integrity during emplacement, minimizes void spaces between packages, and permits the void spaces to be filled.
(5) Void spaces between packages shall be filled as needed to reduce future subsidence within the fill.
(6) Waste shall be placed and covered in a manner that limits the radiation dose rate at the surface of the cover to levels that at a minimum will permit the licensee to comply with all provisions of rule 3701:1-38-13 of the Administrative Code at the time the license is transferred pursuant to paragraph (H) of rule 3701:1-54-07 of the Administrative Code.
(7) The boundaries and locations of each disposal unit shall be accurately located and mapped by means of a land survey. Disposal units shall be marked in such a way that the boundaries of each unit can be easily defined. Three permanent survey marker control points shall be established on the site to facilitate surveys.
(8) A buffer zone of land shall be maintained between any disposed waste and the disposal site boundary and beneath the disposed waste. The buffer zone shall be of adequate dimensions to carry out environmental monitoring activities specified in paragraph (E) of rule 3701:1-54-09 of the Administrative Code and to take mitigative measures if needed.
(9) Closure and stabilization measures as set forth in the approved site closure plan shall be carried out as each disposal unit is filled and covered.
(10) Active waste disposal operations shall not have an adverse effect on completed closure and stabilization measures.
(11) Only wastes containing or contaminated with radioactive material shall be disposed of at the disposal site.
(12) Proposals for disposal of waste that is not acceptable for land disposal because the waste form and disposal methods must be different and, in general, more stringent than those specified for Class C waste, may be submitted to the department for approval.
(D) Each licensee shall perform, or permit the department to perform, any tests the department deems appropriate or necessary for the administration of the regulations in rules 3701:1-54-06 to 3701:1-54-12 of the Administrative Code, including, but not limited to, tests of:
(1) Wastes, including physical form;
(2) Facilities used for the receipt, storage, treatment, handling or disposal of wastes;
(3) Radiation detection and monitoring instruments;
(4) Other equipment and devices used in connection with the receipt, possession, handling, treatment, storage, or disposal of waste; or
(5) Environmental sampling or testing.
(E) The licensee shall comply with the quality assurance requirements identified in rule 3701:1-54-04 of the Administrative Code.
(F) The licensee shall make land disposal facilities available for inspections as follows:
(1) Each licensee shall afford to the department at all reasonable times opportunity to inspect waste not yet disposed of, and the premises, equipment, operations, and facilities in which wastes are received, possessed, handled, treated, stored, or disposed.
(2) Each licensee shall make available to the department for inspection, upon reasonable notice, records kept by it pursuant to these regulations. Authorized representatives of the department may copy and take away copies of, for the department's use, any record required to be kept pursuant to this chapter.

Send the kiddies to bed. It's time for grown-up talk about oil, the environment, and the Green Movement.
Thesis:
Opposing all expansions of domestic oil drilling is exactly the same logical and ethical position that the opponents of the Cape Cod Windfarm are taking.
My first career was Biology, and nothing would make me happier than some energy miracle that would take us off the petroleum teat, though there would still be a (smaller) petroleum industry. Oil is too precious to burn up for fuel. It's necessary for plastics, synthetic fabrics, lubricants and many other things. Even if I run out and buy an electric car, the tires, wiring insulation, belts, paint, plastic parts, and lubricants will still be oil-based. The rational environmental focus should be on conservation and alternatives. Opposing all drilling for environmental reasons is like opposing farming because food leads to obesity.
The US (and the world) needs oil, and will need oil for a long time to come, under even the most optimistic projections of conservation and alternative energy development and deployment. In fact, the future Green Energy Infrastructure will be built primarily by the old Black Energy Infrastructure. Those windmills are not going to grow from seeds. They are going to be fabricated, erected and maintained by the consumption of fossil fuels, and many of the components (plastics, epoxies, synthetics) are going to be literally made out of petroleum.
Here's a sobering study on the topic.
So the question is not "Will there be drilling?" but rather where, and how there will be drilling.
Back to Deepwater Horizon. That single event is no more (or less) relevant to the overall safety of modern drilling in the US than an individual airliner crash is to the fact that it is safer to fly from Seattle to New York (on a regulated and inspected US airline) than it is to drive there. If you had a ticket for a flight on Friday and the Seattle-to-New York flight crashed on Wednesday, would you cancel your ticket and blog that airplanes are all death traps and nobody should ever get on one again? Or would you note that the newspaper didn't cover the 2,357 flights that were in the air at the same time that didn't crash, quell your fears, reflect that there had probably been extra-special attention paid to maintenance and inspection because of the crash, and get on the damned airplane?
However, if you were looking at flying in a patched-up DC-3 through the Andes mountains with a one-eyed, unlicensed pilot who keeps a bottle of rum in his chart case (instead of charts), your evaluation of "air safety" might differ.
That's the real choice. Drill in Nigeria, which is an unregulated ecological and humanitarian nightmare, with minimal media and no criminal or civil liability for the polluters, and then ship the oil thousands of miles by tankers, which have been responsible for most of the worst spills in the last 30 years or so, and burn huge amounts of oil themselves, (as well as transporting invasive species) ... or produce it locally, in an industry that is regulated, inspected, enforced, and reported upon and then move it in pipelines which are immensely safer and more energy-efficient than tankers?
Even with the Deepwater Horizon before us, I'll say that modern offshore drilling is generally clean, and not terribly disruptive of the environment as long as there is regulation and enforcement that forces Best Practices and Best Technology. If you go down to the Gulf of Mexico fishing or diving, your guide will probably take you right out to the platforms, which are artificial reefs in a hard-substrate-limited ecosystem. He will have to be careful to avoid the numerous shrimp boats trawling between the platforms. I worked my way through college in the Gulf oil fields to pay for my BS in Biology, and returned to 'the Patch' in 1990 to pay off my debts from my MS in Marine Biology, and have worked there as a USCG licensed Mariner since then. (I decided that, like sex, science was more enjoyable for me as a hobby than a profession.) And I've seen the continuous improvements in the technology, practices and personnel over that time. This is not your Grandfather's oilfield. Certainly there are mistakes, 'cut corners' and violations, as there are in every human endeavor, but the people I've worked with for the last 20 years have been (on the whole) professional and responsible people trying to do an important and difficult job for their society.
Here's an interesting article on the Katrina/Rita damage to the oilfields and the resulting pollution.
The majority of the oil spilled in Katrina and Rita came from damage to facilities ashore, not offshore platforms. Those facilities would exist even if there was no domestic drilling to process, store and distribute imported oil. For that matter, much of the spilled oil probably WAS imported.
The offshore spills were primarily fuel and chemicals stored on the platforms rather than crude from the wells. It's still oil in the water, but not a failure of safe drilling practices. (Also refined products generally evaporate fairly quickly and do less damage than crude.) The total of ALL the Katrina/Rita spills was far less than the single Exxon Valdez spill, reinforcing the assertion that there is more risk in shipping oil by tanker than drilling for it domestically. The relatively small spills caused by such a huge event are a tribute to the safety of modern drilling practices. It doesn't bear thinking about 1960s tech in the same situation. I'm all for energy conservation and alternate energy. But until that Bright Day, we need oil. The Katrina/Rita impacts also highlight a need to spread out our oil fields (and refining facilities) to protect against having one big disaster cripple our infrastructure. This is also worthy of note: "The amount spilled by industry pales in comparison with seepage from natural fissures — an estimated 1,700 barrels per day off the coast of North America, regulators note." Of course that oil comes in small amounts spread over a large area, and is handled by the natural mechanisms of oil degredation, but it gives a sense of scale. (Did you know that there are bacteria that thrive in deisel fuel?)
Is "Buy Locally; Think Globally" less applicable to petroleum than tomatoes? Or do we just care about our local environment rather than the global one?
If Deepwater Horizon had been in Nigeria, we'd probably have never heard about it, there wouldn't be dozens of boats and hundreds of people trying to stop the spill and clean it up, and nobody would be held criminally or civilly accountable for the deaths and pollution. It would be "business as usual."
The current restrictions on drilling have arguably contributed to the catastrophic nature of the Deepwater Horizon spill. If this well was being drilled in 50, or 500 feet of water instead of 5000, it would have been capped in hours or days, and the spilled oil would have been much easier to contain because it would surface in a smaller area instead of spreading out underwater as it rises through a mile before it hits the surface. Deepwater drilling is more difficult and expensive than shallow water operations. So why drill in 5000 ft of water? Because the shallow reserves in the 'Oil Patch' are tapped, and a bunch of NIMBYs in Florida and California want the beef, but don't want to see the cows.
If we're going to burn oil, and we will for most of the rest of this century, the most ecologically, economically, and ethically sound decision is to produce as much as we can right here in our back yards. We will never get to the Green without burning a whole lot of Black. Real environmentalism requires real decisions, not wishing for the Green Fairy to magically get us there.ASUS ROG GX1000 Laser Gaming Mouse Launched

The.Memories of visiting Andy Griffith’s home town
The.
“Well, the Hurricanes are comin’ on. Got a good, young team. Of course, Detroit has a lot of future Hall of Famers, you know,” said Russell Hiatt, one of the real-life barbers whom “Floyd” was based on in the “The Andy Griffith Show.” But this is as far as the hockey talk gets at Floyd’s, on the day of the first Stanley Cup Finals game played in North Carolina.
The chairs are filling up fast, and the talk among the locals is of the 31st annual Bluegrass and Old Time Fiddlers Convention of the night before at Veterans Memorial Park. Hiatt’s partner in the “two chairs, no waiting” shop, Donna George, speaks with a mother’s pride about her daughter’s recent college graduation and acceptance as a first-year teacher at a nearby school.
In between, George has her hands full with a boy of about 3 or 4, who lets out a piercing shriek with each pass of the buzzing clipper. The boy’s teenage brother, Jordan Haynes, does what older brothers do and giggles at his sibling’s misfortune.
Haynes is wearing the familiar blue basketball jersey of the North Carolina Tar Heels, and Hiatt’s eyes light up when the sports conversation shifts to basketball.
“I sort of bleed blue,” said Hiatt, 78, who gives Haynes a high-five over their Tar Heels allegiance. “It’s still a basketball state here. I seldom, if ever, watch a complete (hockey) game. But I think I’ll watch tonight.”
Elsewhere on Main Street, which inspired the fictional town of Mayberry, there is little Hurricanes fever. Next door at Snappy Lunch, where Griffith was a regular customer as a boy, owner Charles Dowell is too busy to talk, with dozens of sizzling pork chops in front of him that need turns with a spatula. Snappy Lunch, where Dowell has worked since 1943, sells its specialty, fried pork chop sandwiches, for $2.65, and there are no shortages of customers at 10:30 a.m.
It isn’t two minutes before a lifelong Mount Airy elderly man looks up from his plate of food and notices a face he doesn’t recognize and makes pleasant conversation.
“Where you from?” the man asks. “Did you go to the fiddlers’ convention last night?”
When asked if he will watch the Hurricanes play the Detroit Red Wings in Game 3 later that night, though, the man says quickly but politely, “No, I don’t believe I will.”
At the sporting goods store on Main Street, there are dozens of North Carolina, Duke, N.C. State and Wake Forest basketball jerseys hanging on the walls. But no Hurricanes merchandise anywhere.
At D & S Collectibles, a sports memorabilia shop down the street from Floyd’s, owner David Cain has only a few hockey cards for sale in his display cases. One is a Score “Dream Team” card of Patrick Roy, reduced from $15 to $5.
“Hockey is a cold-weather sport,” Cain said. “It’s just tough to follow hockey when you didn’t grow up playing it. But I think people around here are noticing the Hurricanes, just a little bit maybe. I’ve been to a couple of games in Raleigh, and I loved it. I wish I could get a ticket for (Game 3). But overall, I don’t think there’s a lot of talk about them here.”
At the fiddlers’ convention at Veterans Park, the air was alive Friday night with the sound of bluegrass, with more than 350 bands from across the country on hand to play. A large, makeshift wooden dance floor was set up on the grass. During any song, at least a dozen people, young and old, would take to the floor to do the particular kind of quick-footed bluegrass dance, almost resembling tap dancing.
Among the crowd of about 2,000, one Hurricanes cap was spotted.
About 200 yards from the park, at Mount Airy High School, summer league youth baseball takes place under the lights. Not too far from there is a drive-in movie theater, and cars start to jam the ticket booth as soon as the sun nears its descent, and nearby barbecue and ice cream joints are doing brisk business. No wonder Andy Griffith wanted the rest of the world to see what his hometown was like.
“Andy went to a different school than I did, so I didn’t really get to know him that well until I started cutting his hair,” Hiatt said. “After a while, he’d come in other than to get his hair cut. He’d come in and just lay back and talk.”
When Hiatt started at the shop in 1946, he was one of six barbers on hand every day. Although Hiatt is commonly referred to as the person Floyd the Barber was based on, Griffith never did say which one he thought of as Floyd.
“Everybody always asks, “Are you the one, are you the one?’ Well, Andy doesn’t say – he doesn’t tell us a lot of things – but I usually say he took all six barbers and made a Floyd out of them,” Hiatt said.
“When I came in ’46, most of the other six barbers were elderly. I knew they wouldn’t stay too awfully long, so I hung on for a spot. And I’ve hung on ever since, even through the hard times of the long hair trend.”
Griffith, who turned 76 last Saturday and now lives in Manteo, N.C., never did officially say Mayberry was based on Mount Airy, although it’s almost certain he did.
He made a reference to a “Snappy Lunch” in one of his TV episodes and the town just up U.S. 52 from Mount Airy, Pilot Mountain, sounds a lot like the “Mount Pilot” from the show. The house Griffith grew up in, about a mile from Floyd’s City Barber Shop, is now a bed and breakfast, with rooms available for $150 a night.
“I haven’t seen Andy in years, although I imagine he’ll come back for a visit when they name part of the highway after him like they have plans to here,” Hiatt said. Of the Floyd character, who was the butt of many jokes for his sometimes bumbling, rambling nature, Hiatt said he never has taken offense.
“I’m having a lot of fun with it. I’m having a ball,” said Hiatt, whose walls are covered with more than 14,000 photos he has taken of his customers. “It might have overplayed it a bit, but most every episode had a moral lesson of some kind.”
Hiatt was a catcher four years for his high school baseball team, and pitched fast-pitch softball in town for 11 years.
“Oh, I’m a sports fan, no question about it,” he said. “Now, hockey, now that’s something I’m going to have to get to learn a little more.”

Thanks so much,
Michael L ‘Don’t Trust the B in Apartment 23′.MGIC Investment Corporation, through its subsidiaries, provides mortgage insurance to lenders and government sponsored entities in the United States. MGIC Investment Corp (MTG) shares exploded upwards 14.74 percent.
Shares of Radian Group and Genworth Financial also gained, up 7.7% and 3.6% respectively. Both companies are expected to report at the end of October.
Bottom line... If a company such as MGIC with 6 years of losses and a current 9 month loss gains 14.74 percent over a $0.04 profit for the quarter, and is trading at $8.33 with a $2.81 billion market cap, $2.02 book value per share, $1.69 cash and equivalents per share, and $1.32 billion in debt, Tower Group (TWGP) should be trading at a much higher price per share than MGIC.
In comparison, TWGP reported a $0.56 per share profit last quarter, is trading at under $4.50 per share with a $246.44 million market cap, $20.85 book value per share, $4.51 cash and equivalents per share, and only $459 million in debt. Enterprise value of TWGP is $457.77 million on a market cap of $246.44 million, while the enterprise value of MTG (MGIC Investment Corp) is $3.28 billion on a market cap of $2.81 billion. Based upon valuation, TWGP should be worth $392.17 million, or $6.82.

thought you would enjoy it , CRS is Council of Residential Specialist. I have a CRS designation. You have to have extra training for this designation.
here is the article from the lastes issue oc October 2012 CRS your home newsletter.."Sage I don't know if I can save her." My eyes widened and I fell to the soft, white carpet.
"Please help her?" The tears in my eyes started to fall down my cheek.
"I promise Sage I will but I don't know if it will be enough to save her." His words took full effect on me and I couldn't move. Being in the afterlife was just like being on Earth. I still have feelings and my heart still pounds I just can't see my sister anymore. But if I don't help her soon she will be here too. I closed my eyes wanting to just be with my sister when the T.V. flashed on and I could hear my sister. "Sage? Are you thinking about your sister?" I nodded. "Sage, stop doesn't think about her! You don't know your powers. If you think about her to hard she is going to hear your thoughts. Stop Sage, Stop!" I immediately opened my eyes to see Lewis only a couple of inches from my face, his warm, chocolate brown eyes stared at mine.
"Are you okay?"
"Yea I'm fine just a little confused. I thought I was allowed to send her a message when I wanted to?" He raised his eyebrows before pulling me up off the ground.
"Sage you have only been here for an hour at the most and you already want to try and send messages to Earth. Wow, that's kind of awesome."
"I still don't understand and you're not helping." I rested my hands on my hip and glared at him.
Lewis laughed, "Oh, come on I'll explain everything." With that said he grabbed my hand and took me out of the room.
"It's about time I get some answers around here." I tried to keep my voice strong but failed by giggling. I hate when I giggle it sounds like I'm a little girl laughing at something stupid. Lewis, on the other hand, liked my giggle. "Your laugh is cute you know that right?"
"Shut up!" We both laughed before stepping outside my door. The sun shined in my eyes and the smell of fresh ocean breeze filled my nose. The warm peaceful meadow has disappeared to a beach. The sand was hot to the touch and the blazing sun took me a couple of blinks to get used to it. Lewis squeezed my hand tightly as he pulled me to the ocean. The sand felt nice to my cold feet but every step I felt a sharp stab. Dumb seashells go away! Just go away! With my thought said all the seashells hiding in the sand disappeared leaving the warm, soft sand in its place. "Wow."
Lewis laughed as he continued to lead me to the ocean water. "Amazing huh?"
I chuckled, "Yea it sure is. One minute I'm stepping on sharp shells the next its warm sand. Just because of a thought."
"Yea, well that's how it works here."
"Can I ask you a question?"
"Yea Sage anything."
"What the hell am I supposed to do here?" I've been here for an hour and I already managed to almost mess everything up.
"Ha. You really want answers don't you?" Yes, finally. My silent said it all so he continued to tell me about this wonderful place I'm in. "Well you already know about the whole 'living here till your time is up' thing so I'll go from there. So let's start with the basics. You still eat and sleep and do everything you did as a human on Earth but now you watch after a kid and can mainly do anything you want. Age doesn't really matter only the years till you leave. So you will never grow and never look older. I mean look at me I've been here for 3 years and I don't look a day over 15." I could help but giggle at him as he winked at me. "You have powers like everyone else. But for some reason your powers are strong. It took me over a week to master the power of thought and imagination and you're over here taking shells out of the ground with one thought. Okay anyway, the powers we have help with the kid we are assigned. Like how I'm assigned your sister. You'll be assigned a kid and you have to help change their faith before they... they die." I nodded even though hearing about young kids die is something I don't really want to continue on. "The people who assign you a kid give you about 4 months to change their faith after that it can be a matter of seconds before they die. They don't really try to help us; they just sit back and watch us suffer with the kid's death. For your sake Sage I really hope your kid stays alive it's the worse feeling ever when you have to look the kid right in the eye everyday as you see them walk down the street." I couldn't help but think the last comment was to me. "I hate them so much for assigning us kids that they know don't stand a chance. But do they care? No, it's fun to them to have all this power yet the world down there is suffering." I couldn't help but think who "they" was.
"Who are you talking about when you say 'they'?"
"I don't know. No one does really. They are just powerful spirits that live up in the sky above us."
"Why don't they help?"
"No one knows. They just keep to themselves. Now back to our powers. You'll have to read a book about learning the ways of an angel. Then you will be assigned a kid. Your book should be back at home waiting for you to read." I can't believe I have to read. I hate reading. I only read one series in my life time but it was only because my friend would not shut up until I read it. I officially hate all vampires and werewolves. Lewis's laughing pulled me out of my thoughts. "What?"
"You have this look on your face... Ha-ha... if you could only see it you look like you want to just kill someone." I grunted at him making the face again this time it's to him.
"Well I don't want to read a book. Just tell me what's in it." He pretend to wipe a tear then looked at me with those beautiful eyes. Stop Sage. Don't think like that your dead for crying out loud. There is no future here so Stop! I can't help but wish there is a future for me and Lewis but I know that can't happen.
"I wish I could help you in your lazy needs but I can't. Every book is different because it's meant for their power needs. By the way your already it's going to be a big book. Like how mine was big and long, because I need to learn more about how powerful my power is." He stopped for a moment and noticed someone in the corner of his eyes. "And Lisa her book was small and had pictures because, to be honest, she's not the brightest." Before he could react a small hand hit the side of his head, hard by the sound it made.
"Owwhhh!" Lewis whined in pain. "That hurt!"
"Good, I heard you talk about me."
"You were supposed to I heard you coming. For being so small you sure do make a lot of noise." This earned him another slap in the head. "Stop, you hit like a dude."
Her face seemed hurt, "Take that back and all the other stuff." The tone in her voice seemed angry and sad. Lewis noticed but did not give up the fight.
"I shall not." Lisa growled then stepped forward to hit Lewis again. He got up and ran before her fist could strike. I couldn't help but laugh as my new friends ran down the beach water, her after him.
"Come here and take it like a man! What are you scared?" The tone in her voice said she was determined to get him back.
"Never and why would I be scared of a little princess?"
"I don't know you sure are running like a damsel in distress!"
He stopped and turned, Lisa bumped into him before she could stop herself. "Your right why am I running when I can do this..." He grabbed her arms and tossed her over his shoulders. He started to walk to the water to toss her in. I couldn't stop laughing as she screamed and begged to be put down. Her legs kicking him everywhere but he seemed to not notice.
"No, Lewis don't. The water is cold. No, no, no..." Suddenly the clear sky filled with dark clouds and the wind picked up. My head felt dizzy and my eye lids felt heavy. I closed them to catch a glimpse of my sister on the floor. I opened them again but fell backwards and fainted to see an all too clear image of my sister. "No, no, no, please stop." I could hear the pain in her voice as my father bend down to hit her cheek with that damn paddle. "Why should I stop?"
"Please it hurts. Daddy pleases." He didn't seem to care about the tears rolling down her face. I wanted to run to my little sister and stop my father from hitting her again. But I couldn't, I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I just had to watch as this image in my head played along as if I was watching a movie. If only.
The little girl I know to be Annabelle looked in the sky and whispered my name. "Sage please come back and help." The door burst open. Her face lift up but was disappointed to see my mother standing in the door way.
"What the hell are you doing?" My mother ran to my sister and grabbed her face in her hands. "What have I told you? Hit the parts that don't show! I swear I'm living with idiots." My sister found her chance to run to our save place. She ran as fast as her little 7 year old legs would carry her up the stairs and to my old room. She grabbed the door of my old closet and nearly ran inside. Her favorite book I made up for her was sitting in the corner next to her favorite teddy bear and my favorite picture of her and me. "Oh Sage, why did you go? I need you." She wiped her tears with the bear she hugged to her small frame. She grabbed our made up book and turned to the first page. "Once upon a time there was a small little girl who lived in this magical castle with her older sister and evil parents." Annabelle's tears stained the pages of the notebook. "She was so small and so beautiful everyone loved her. So when her parents were mean she didn't understand. Her sister told her it's because they are to evil for someone so pure but she still felt sad. Her sister loved her so much it made up for her parents lack of love." She keep reading the story out loud and running her finger along the pictures we created together. Then she faded to black and I was left to stare at the dark screen.
"Is she going to be okay?" I keep my eyes closed but I could still her Lisa's voice.
"She will be fine." That voice must have been Max's because it is too deep to be Lewis. Where am I? Okay so I'm not at the beach because now I can't hear the waves of the water and I'm lying on a bed. Where am I?
"I just saw Sage's little sister get beat up by her father." Lewis came through doors and was painting really hard. I sat up straight to the new news.
"You're okay!" Lisa was way too excited to see me awake. She even hugged me. I looked to Lewis who was still painting by the wall.
"Is Annabelle okay? Where am I? What just happened to me? Was that a vision?" My voice was fast but everyone seemed to understand what I was saying. Is it me or is everyone asking a lot of questions today? Max was the first to answer my questions.
"You're in the A.E.R. 'The Angel Emergency Room' and your fine. Since you don't know about your powers you got overwhelmed by the power a vision can give you." He then said something I never wanted to hear. "Everything in your vision happens and by the way you shoot up to Lewis' news I'm guessing it was about your sister." I nodded too weak to speak anymore.
Lisa suddenly started to talk before Max could continue. "Yea, this place is for when angels over do things. Like when we are watching a kid and don't eat or sleep for more than a week we faint and have to come here. Or in your case when a new comer uses their powers before reading the book." There that book is again. "Being an angel is hard."
"I'll say" Lewis says from across the room still painting.
"Oh shut up. Sage you had a really powerful vision and you couldn't help but faint. It happens to almost every angel so..." Before she could finish I feel back again to see a vision this one worse than before.
"Please Daddy stop I-I didn't do anything."
"Yes you did you worthless child you caused your sister to die. She was the only thing that keeps you safe and now since she is gone no one is her to stop me." My father hit her again and again with his hands causing the little girl to fall to the ground into a ball and cry.
"Mommy said not to hit me in the face anymore." He seemed angry and throws a glass bottle to her back.
"I don't care what your mother said to you!" My father ran out of the room and left my sister crying on the floor with shattered glass all around her. She sure is braver since I left. Before she use to run behind the couch and cry as she heard me scream at my parents for hurting us and then taking the paddle to the face or the glass bottle to the back. But now that I am gone no one is there to stop them, no one is there to hold her tight as she cry's, no one is there to fix the wound and read her the story. Now that I'm gone no one is there to save this little girl before she is gone off of Earth and joins the afterlife.DescriptionTea will be served at 3:45 pm.AudienceThis program is for the research community.

However, he just posted another comment on NOFOLLOW.
I oppose adoption of the NOFOLLOW attribute, but I know that some people support it. While this topic has been discussed to death in some venues, now seems like a good time for people to share their feelings...on Matt's blog.
Let's see if there is some community consensus on the issue. Say something this week. Pro or con, it doesn't matter.
My personal feeling is that as long as Google and Yahoo! continue to pay the spammers to run ads on their mass-produced pages (and I know some of those folks are associated with SEOMoz), there is no incentive for them to stop spamming the Web. The real problem, in my opinion, is that Yahoo! and Google reward people for creating worthless content that is just there to be indexed and carry advertising.
What do you think? Should the Web community adopt NOFOLLOW as Matt continues to suggest, or should Google and Yahoo! go back to the drawing board?
we have to adopt NOFOLLOW as Matt continues to suggest,".
Sharing the community love, Matt. Seems to be some pretty insightful and intelligent comments on the subject at your blog, too. :) I left you some thoughts about the nofollow value on your site, but I have some more. I think the thing I dislike the most about the "nofollow" value is that there's a "nofollow" value for meta elements, and they don't mean the same thing. Then again, that's what I dislike about the Google Sitemap, too. I'm not sure that you all at Mountain View sometimes understand the extra work that you create for us. Example: Me: It would help to have a sitemap on your site. Client: Is that the thing from Google? Me: That's something else, and we should talk about adding one of those, too. But first, a sitemap is a good idea. Client: Well, why does Google call their's a sitemap if it's not the same thing...
Bill - fantastic points. I get this all the time from clients and the nuancing of terms in SEM certainly does it make it a daunting field to navigate for the beginner.
I think that Aaron (Pratt) brought up some good questions in his comments on Matt's blog. He mentioned up two reasons why I use nofollow: One is for links to sites like Amazon, who really don't need anyone's help, and the other is for sitewide links for someone like a site designer. I want the link to get noticed by people, but not necessarily by Google. Maybe using nofollow on these means very little in the grand scheme of things, maybe it's not what it was intended for, but unless someone says definitely otherwise not to do it.....
Perhaps Google should use a attribute, instead? Instead of simply 'blocking' link credit, it would tell Google that the site owner is not the author of the link, and doesn't necessarily endorse it, so take it with a grain of salt. (but don't necessarily discount it either!)
Why? Because not all user submitted links are 'bad links'. Consider this example:
A company creates a great site that's rich in quality content, let's say it's a site on building your own computer. Another site, unrelated (in ownership) to the first, publishes a blog post reviewing the top ten hard drives of the year. A reader, who frequents both sites, comments on the blog post of the second and links to a similar article on the first site that is both relevant to the post and of interest to the readers of the second site.
In other words, it's a quality link, it just happens to be in a blog comment. So shouldn't 'Site A' get PR credit for the link? After all, the whole idea behind ranking is to reward sites with quality content so that the most thorough, relevant results can be returned to the searcher.
The question then becomes, “How does Google decide whether a "User Submitted" link is good or bad”? The solution might actually be simple. What if Google counted the number of relevant do-follow links, separately from the number of “User Submitted” ones.
Then, an algorithm could compare the ratio between quality/authority site links and the user submitted ones.
If there's 10,000 “User Submitted” links and 1 (or no) authority links, it's most likely a spam bot, and the "User" links should get no PR credit. If it's more like a 1:100 ratio, The "User Links" are most likely legitimate fans of the site, and PR credit should get passed through. (Google should also choose not to penalise links flagged as "User Submitted" pointing to irrelevant sites, even if the ratio is 'non-spammy'.)
Obviously it will need a bit of tuning and adjustment, but allowing site owners to "flag" untrustworthy links as such, instead of simply blocking them outright could help alleviate the amount of spam while still allowing legitimate comment links through.
Assuming Google stops following nofollow links and not just refusing to pass on pr, then spammers still get the benefit of click throughs and secondary/tertiary search engines which haven't caught on yet. The best solution: better program development. Stop allowing people to post links or convert them to span tags with onClick javascript. I know this is going to piss some people off. Why blame the victim? I just believe their is an accepted risk with interactive online programs. You wouldn't drive a car without seatbelts or airbags, why use a blog without moderation and robust spam protection?
"I oppose adoption of the NOFOLLOW attribute ... now seems like a good time for people to share their feelings...on Matt's blog." Wait a tic. You oppose nofollow and you're sending everyone over to my blog to comment? What's wrong with seomoz's fine blog right here? :)
Official Reason: Efficiency, Matt. I know you read SEOMoz, but if I can get a real community discussion going, I'd rather see it mostly in one place (never will happen, but I can try). But the ulterior motive is my own selfishness. I have to run around to all the blogs and forums to see what people are saying. It'd be easier if they all left their opinions (pro and con) in one place. :)..
I don't think it's a good idea. There's as many bad uses for it as good. I think Google and Yahoo should try to recognize guestbook and blog comment links, instead of relying on people to change their websites.
Ideal situation would be for Google to recognize and ignore paid / spam links, but that's easier said than done. Try writing a rudimentary scraping script that you can use to identify paid / spam links on ANY web page.
"My personal feeling is that as long as Google and Yahoo! continue to pay the spammers to run ads on their mass-produced pages there is no incentive for them to stop spamming the Web." I understand the argument here, but strongly believe link spam would exist whether or not Adsense or YPN even existed. A majority of the link spam I see points to pills, porn, casinos and doorways. Rarely do I ever see a MFA or MFYPN site spamming links. (at least not in the same quantity as others) added: In fact, take a look at the links being spammed on the site Cutt's talks about. I clicked the first 10 and couldn't find a single MFA site....
Well, I see a wide variety of spam sites. Most of the pill-and-porn spam I see, though, comes through my email. I'm sure each person sees the problem from a different angle, and I may be wrong to make such sweeping generalizations. But the sites that I have examined in depth which depended the most on linkage were indeed carrying the ads. Maybe I just now see SpamAd Evil wherever I look, and I have blinders on to the other stuff that I have learned to tune out. Take that for what it's worth.
I say keep it. However, does Google/Yahoo still follow the links? Just not spread link popularity? I'm not exactly clear on it all.
I recently came across a site where the link to the sitemap was nofollowed, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to laugh or cry ...
I've seen some people ask in forums about how to use NOFOLLOW on their own pages. This is such a convoluted issue. We really need to do a better job of informing people what it's all about.
i think you should cry.. but maybe he has done it for another perpose.Distance from Rothesay to Thule Air Base

I've cancelled everything except one activity so that he can come home and decompress. School's hard on any kid, add Autism and lets just say this week's been a bit stressful.
Today was the day he completely freaked out. Self combusted, lost his lid, whatever. He melted down over a frigging juice box. In the car.
From the back seat I hear all sorts of sputtering and gagging. Oh Shit.
Apparently I had the wrong kind of juice box. I deviated from our normal brand of juice and he noticed. Fuuuuuuck.
"Mom, MOM!!! I can not drink from this juice box. I simply can not ingest juice that is 66% juice and 34% inert material." He's in the back seat of the car, holding on to the offending juice box, flapping and gagging. Juice going everywhere.
"OK, well hon I'm trying to drive here. Just put the juice box down and I'll take a look at it when we get out. Listen. Listen to me. ALEX, listen. I need you to listen with your ears."
I get an exasperated, "What?" from the back seat and a, "No, mom, NO. I can not simply put the box down. We're in the car. Where am I supposed to put it? I don't want it near me. I can't have it near me. I drank some of it. Mom, I think I'm gonna to puke."
Now if you want to get my attention fast, say those three magic words, I'm gonna puke. Nothing gets a reaction out of me faster. There are very few things in this world I well and truly despise and puke is one of them.
"OK, get the bucket if you have to but I tell you what. I'm not cleaning your puke this time. New rule. If you make yourself puke, you clean it." If I had a dime for the number of times I've cleaned puke in our car, house, pool, where ever, I'd be a bloody millionaire by now. Or if Alex did the math, I'd have at least, $31.20. Whatever.
We have an old bucket/Tupperware container in the back seat for this very reason. We moved from a bucket to Tupperware because of the lid factor. If you've ever sat in a car with puke, you'll know how vital a lid can be. Trust me.
"What?!? I can't clean my own puke. Mom, THAT'S DISGUSTING!"
"Oh yeah?!? Well how do you think I feel every time you puke? Do you think I like cleaning your puke? No, I most certainly do not. I think it's disgusting too."
"Well, if I can't puke, now what? I drank it, I may die. Now what? I'M GONNA DIE." He's writhing in the back seat, I'm watching juice fly everywhere, still trying to drive, and thanking Good God All Mighty that the straps on his car seat are holding.
"No, you are not going to die. No one has ever died from drinking juice. If people died from drinking juice, don't you think the juice industry would be out of business by now?"
That got him, totally got him off of thinking about his juice induced death, he was thinking, thinking. And he was calming down. Just that quickly, he'd calmed back down.
"Well, Mom. People can die from drinking water, you know. There is something called 'water intoxication' and people die from drinking too much water." He's telling me this, juice forgotten. Sure, he's flicking his wrists and still worked up, but he was coming back.
From the rear view mirror, I can see the juice has been launched to the floor of the car. He was looking out the window, still thinking. Quiet.
The rest of the ride was in silence. I turned off the DVD player and we just drove. I kept looking back at him. He was deep in thought and I just let him be.
When we got to where we were going, Alex asked, "Mom, when we get to group, can I throw the juice in the garbage can? And next time? You need to remember the right kind of juice box. I'm very disappointed in you right now."
I watched as the threw the juice into the garbage. I gave him a squeeze and whispered, "I promise to buy the right kind of juice next time. And I'm proud of you, you didn't puke."
He gave me a sigh, a big exasperated sigh, and just that quickly he wiggled away from me.
Don't worry, there's no way in hell I'm going to be buying the wrong kind of juice box any time soon. Anyone want a case of Fruitopia? 24, 2012
That poor juice box didn't stand a chance.
Labels: distress, The Car, Third Grade
Oh my god I love this post so much *I* could puke. But I won't.
Alex is a great kid. Wow.
Thanks and yeah, keep that puke where it belongs.
What a fabulous return from the edge of vomitosis!
I know, right???
good recovery, mom!
Thanks!
Tupperware with lid - vital! Picture of Tupperware looking like it has puke on it?! Is that puke? Reading on my phone - bad eyes- hoping it is not but feeling like this may just keep me from eating and make my goal for weigh in at WW tomorrow!! Thanks Alex!
I've threatened self cleaning too- seems pretty effective. But your understanding of the juice box business - that was gold right there!
No, that tupperware had spaghetti in it at one time and turned the whole thing that reddish color...but it does kinda look like puke now that you mention it....hahaha!
Way to call on the juice industry. Well played, well played.
He totally played it....
Nice to read about Alex's story.Amazing kid!
Thanks. :)
Nice holding it together Alex (and mom)! I don't blame him though. I hate when people switch up my brands.
I do too!!! You know there is nothing worse than those fake poptarts. Gotta have the original. :)
"mom, I'm very disappointed in you" <--- LOVE IT. I'm actually *still* giggling. God, Alex. What a kid!
He used my words against me......
"And next time? You need to remember the right kind of juice box. I'm very disappointed in you right now."
Love this. Stop trying to kill him with 34% inert material!
You are too cool. Love it.
Hahaha!!! I did about die when he use the word inert. I was still trying to figure out the math.
Why haven't I thought of a tupperware with a lid yet? That is brilliant.
I also love that he was disappointed in you. Mini Meerkat has taken to telling me that I need to calm down when I'm trying to get her to do something she doesn't want to do. Haha.
Oh yeah and use your oldest and nastiest tupperware so it can go right into the rubbish bin.
Good job in redirecting Alex's thinking Liz. And I hate it when Jacob pukes in a car. He never tries to puke in a bag or container, he usually just pukes on himself. So every time we go on a trip, we have to bring extra clothes and Shannie sits in the back with him. Oddly enough, my son tried Fruitopia yesterday for the first time. And luckily he didn't puke.
You know, this was 8 years, 8 long years, in the making. He used to puke all over himself and the majority of times he still does but this time I caught him before he self-induced. If he's really sick though? Still lands where ever he is standing.
Tell your kid that I'm 98% positive that my body is comprised of 78% inert material. The rest is water and dead skin cells.
Natural consequences, that's what it's all about. I don't clean up jack crap now. Not that it's easy, spending 20 minutes telling my kid to clean up something correctly, but I sure as hell am not doing it.
Wow! He brought himself back from the brink! That is great! Plus, no puke--ALWAYS a bonus.
I have not had to deal with puke in the car yet, but I am dreading the day...
I am always so blown away by the things Alex says, water intoxication. God that made me laugh. But what I find interesting is that most people, grown ass adults, don't know about water intoxication let alone a little guy. What a smart cookie. you have your hands full for more than autism my friend.
A very smart kid and a tired mom - not always a good combo is it?
But I enjoy the hell out of it Lizbeth!
Peggy beat me to the comment about his comment about water intoxication. Smart kid.
Hahaahaha Still laughing at the cleaning up puke is disgusting. Welcome to our world little man. Welcome to our world. I've decided I'm not cleaning up any bodily matter excreted on purpose that isn't in its intended receptacle. It's amazing how our house is less like a frat house when they have to clean it.
Ha! I can't believe your kid knows about water intoxication! He's brilliant. And I love how he expressed his disappointment. I don't think anyone can quite show disdain as clearly and expertly as the boy with autism. At least my son's very good at it.
Do you think that other kids are also "disappointed" in their parents but just don't dare/think to say it? And this has to be a classic example of how distraction works, I must remember to use it more often :)
Great job distracting! I am very impressed! Hope you find the right juice box so you won't be a "disappointment" anymore.
Lizbeth, this soooo could have been a post from me. I have had a similar argument with Tate. Hubz and I nodded and laughed in solidarity...the puking, the "death by juice box"...etc
P.S. Brilliant idea about lid for puke bucket. I have been using a trash can and yes, the smell is, well, yeah....
[slow clap] You rocked it! You distracted him right where it counts. In the literal scientific place where resistance isn't possible. Brilliant. I can't wait to try it.
Way to use words (instead of yelling) and redirection super score! We, too, have the dreaded Tupperware bowl with a lid in our van. Plus towels. We always know where our towels are. We are frood and hoopy family.
And hey, I'll bet Alex can make sure he has the right juice next time. He is awesome -- way to go, you!
Love it! Love how the discussion and logic helped calm him down. he was still in control but mama won, kind of ;-) And I love his argument AND 'I'm so disappointed in you...'remark! Oh dear, sounds SO familiar!!
xx Jazzy
what a fantastic come-back from madness!! That's awesome!
Good recovery mom! I love the "I'm so disappointed" comment. I hear that too! Lol!Friday, 17 September 2010
Coronation Street fan club in New Zealand
The reason I'm asking this via the blog is that I've received a shed load of emails this week from New Zealand Corrie fans asking if there's a fan club there for fans to join.
If you know of one and can leave details below in the comments box, that would be great. Thank you - kia-ora!
Posted by Flaming Nora at 10:17
Labels: new zealand know that there is a fan site belongs to Shortland Street but we have a thread dedicated to Coronation Street. Try Ferndale Talk :)
Oooh, count me in if there is one!
I'm only over the water in Ireland and I would love to watch the road to coronation street but I just get a message that it's not available in my area. What a pity.
Is there any way around this please?
There is a Yahoo group KiwiCorries which maybe of interest. They talk about 'this and that' but occassionaly Corrie !!!
mj burke, when I was in Ireland a few years ago I could receive it in the hotel room on RTE I believe.
However, can you login to ITV Player as they have the episodes there? There are probably several illegal ways of watching it, but I don't think this blog is the place for that!!
What about Australia?
Dunno about Australia. Can't you share with NZ ?!!

“I don’t know much about rock music. I stopped listening after Elvis!” Mr. Ban quipped during a press briefing. “But this much I do know: bands such as Linkin Park reach tens of millions of people.”

“More than nine million people have seen the ‘Not Alone’ video, which helped our work in Haiti after the earthquake. So it was natural that I should ask them to support my Sustainable Energy for All initiative – another UN effort to build the future we want.”
The initiative was launched in September, and at its core is the vision of achieving universal access to modern energy services, doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency and doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, all by 2030.
Currently, some 1.4 billion people worldwide are estimated to lack access to electricity, with another billion having to deal with unreliable electricity networks. In total, nearly three billion people rely on solid fuels such as coal or traditional biomass for their basic cooking and heating.
“Sustainable Energy for All will help us to reduce poverty, drive economic dynamism, reduce the risks of climate change and protect the planet – all at the same time,” Mr. Ban said.
“We can turn on the lights in every household and turn down the global thermostat,” he added. “Linkin Park can help us spread this message.”
“We want to raise visibility of the issue and we want to help spread the word,” said Michael Shinoda, the band’s vocalist. “We also want to make a difference on the ground. We are enlisting the help of our fans to achieve both.”

Pitfalls of 100K+miles on used SVT Focus?

Pitfalls of 100K+miles on used SVT Focus?
Seeking wisdom from those with experience. I have two '04 SVT's, and I am looking for a 3rd. I love these cars, and I come from Porsche/Audi/BMW history. However, mileage on the used SVT cars are regularly over 100k miles, and often over 120k.
Question: what are most common repair problems on the higher mileage models? I have replaced a clutch at 52K and a motor mount at 85k. Otherwise, my SVT's are rock solid.
I am concerned about head unit problems, clutch, power windows, transmission. Any tips or advice would be appreciated. Conversely, I would love to hear from owners with 150K miles and still running strong.
Thanks. PR

Welcome to the forum [welcome] [ffrocks] [loveff]
The main pitfall is that you didn't get to put the miles of fun on for the first 100-120k mi lol. Most of the problems you run into are the normal problems that we all know about like the t-stat housing leaks, IMRC box problems, and a few other minor things that are easily fixed. Also don't forget the all important t-belt change that we tend to recommend doing at 60-80k mi. Clutches can be bought for cheap at partsgeek.com for a tad over 300 bucks which is a steal compared to everyone else, but most of the factory clutches last a long time, one local member has over 150k mi on his or at least I think it's that much, I forget but I know he has almost the same amount of miles on it as I do on Ole' Yeller (my yellow ZX3 which was my first focus). The transmission seem to be very durable though are getting hard to find and are not rebuildable like other transmissions. I have never seen one with power window problems on here that I can remember but they share the same parts as a normal focus with power windows. The head units do wear out and majority of people just replace them with a aftermarket unit though a lot keep the factory sub and we have How to's on how to do that
HERE
.
HERE
are some sticky threads to read over that can answer a lot of questions and point you in directions with the SVT also.
We have a few members on her that have much higher mileage than what your asking about and I even think there are a few 200k mi ones on here as well.
I'm also glad to hear you like them and are collecting them. So many of them are just parted out now and most of the time cause people don't want to fix them, a lot of times from a broken t-belt or something like that [bigcry]. I personally want to try and save everyone I can but I can't. I was lucky to save the one I have.
HERE
is the thread for mine I made, which will be updated as soon as the all important income tax check comes in.

Thanks for the reply. I'll wait to hear more. I love the Focus SVT, despite the fact the general public has no idea how great the SVT's are. I would just like to know where the repair issues might be down the road. I also collect Lotus Esprit's and F-Gen Camaro SS's, but the Focus SVT is the car that gives me the biggest smile. And this Forum is fantastic.

Here's a quick list of what I've had to replace on my car from between the time I bought the car (about 90,000 miles) to now (114,000 +). Unless I say otherwise, everything was replace because something was broke or truly worn out; I'm an if it aint broke, don't fix it type of person.
Timing belt (routine maintenance)
Thermostat housing (leaking)
One rear bearing (it went from perfect to the wheel wobbling all over within three days)
Parking brake cable (you can thank NYS salt rust for that)
Front struts (more for an upgrade than because they were that bad)
Both front lower control arms (completely worn out)
Sway bar links (One of the joints has popped out so the sway bar wasn't held by anything anymore)
And that all I can remember right now. I haven't had any trouble with the engine and a large part of the stuff listed above was contributed to by the rust we get from road salt.

This was 2 weeks ago at 107k mi. Other than the standing on your head for an hour to get the CMC swapped, its not a hard fix. I also am replacing shocks all around as mine are a week from completly worn out and trying to figure out if the timing belt has been done yet.

Everyone--all great information. Thanks. Keep it coming. It's just so hard to find SVT's with sub-80K miles, and 100k+ seems to be the norm. These cars were enjoyed and not pulled out of the garage on sunny days only.

My SVTF had a bunch of work done on it by the previous owner at around 125k. I'll go check the reciepts in the glove box, but it's at 136k right now and it runs fine.

The renowned Missoula Children's Theatre (MCT) is back at Fairfield University's Quick Center for the Arts for the Center's Summer Children's Theatre Camp. The 19th season opens July 11 and continues through August 15 with performances of five new shows and six different casts.
The Quick Center for the Arts shares MCT's mission: The development of lifeskills in children through participation in the performing arts. During a weeklong residency led by two MCT directors, sixty local students from grades K-12 are cast in roles, learn lines and choreography and rehearse together until they perform at week's end as an ensemble in a full-scale musical!
In addition to the pure fun of putting on a show, the students attain social skills, communication skills, self-esteem and the exhilaration of accomplishment through the rehearsal process and the pinnacle of performance.
The campers also participate in the Quick Center's other camp activities when they are not rehearsing, including, but not limited to, theater movement classes, dance movement, theater improvisation and arts and crafts.
This season's original adaptations of children's fairytales - with a twist - are:
- July 11 "The Princess and the Pea"
- July 18 "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"
- July 25 "The Wiz of the West"
- August 1 "Robinson Crusoe"
- August 8 "The Princess and the Pea"
- August 15 "Hansel and Gretel"
Each year the Quick Center holds a March lottery for the sought-after spaces in the MCT season. Returning campers are the norm.
Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for children and seniors. For further information or to purchase tickets, please visit or call the Box Office at (203) 254-4010. The toll free number is 1-877-ARTS-396.

Vol. 40, No. 292you can print that and send it to him."
The Cougars' offense was...not balanced. Washington State rushed just 12 times for two yards, while Halliday was 58 of 89 for 557 yards passing. From the mid-third quarter on, with WSU down 24, Halliday threw every single time—33 straight passing plays, most of them against Oregon's second-string offense. It continued even into the final minutes, with the game well out of hand. It was clearly an attempt to rack up record numbers (And Halliday set a number of Pac-12 and school marks). Aliotti went off in his post-game press conference, directing his ire at Leach:
"That's total bullshit that he threw the ball at the end of the game like he did," Aliotti said. "And you can print that and you can send it to him, and he can comment, too. I think it's low class and it's bullshit to throw the ball when the game is completely over against our kids that are basically our scout team.
"Make sure he knows that. Because I don't really care."
It's sort of an interesting debate, and a reverse of the usual one about running up scores: Does Aliotti have the right to complain about an opponent padding its stats in a game that's already decided? Probably not, unless you want to say "playing to the whistle" is now against some unwritten rule. It's also not clear who the victim is, besides Oregon's defensive numbers—and in that case, Aliotti's bemoaning Halliday's quest for stats because they threatened his own.
Leach refused to get into a war of words, telling a reporter, "I don’t criticize other teams or coaches. I focus on coaching my team."
After a nice talking-to from Mark Helfrich, Aliotti formally apologized last night. From comments released by the university:
“I'm embarrassed that I got caught up in the moment after the game," Aliotti said in the release. .”
The real loser here? Drew Brees, who saw his old record of 83 pass attempts shattered. But Brees's mark, set in a 1998 game against Wisconsin, might remain more impressive: Despite a then-NCAA record for completions, it took a last-second TD for Purdue to even put up 24 points.By Jeff McDonald, Staff Writer
MIAMI — Manu Ginobili strode to the free-throw line at AmericanAirlines Arena late Tuesday night. The Spurs were ahead by four points. A handful of Miami Heat fans had already begun streaming toward the exits, off to commiserate on South Beach..
“It’s a tough moment,” Ginobili said. “We.
The teams will return to AmericanAirlines Arena on Thursday night, winner takes all.
“They’re the two best words in team sports,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Game 7.”
In one of the defining games of his Miami era, James shook off an uneven first three quarters to take over the game in the fourth.
The Heat star finished with 32 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists for his second triple-double of the series.
His tough basket in the paint gave the Heat a 101-100 lead with 1:43 left in overtime. The Spurs wouldn’t score again..
“We know we can win games that are here or anywhere else,” Tim Duncan said. “We just have to execute for a longer period of time.”
The Spurs were ahead by 13 late in the third quarter, and by 10 entering the fourth quarter, but couldn’t overcome the resurgence of James, the NBA’s four-time Most Valuable Player.
After going 3 of 12 in the first three quarters, James exploded for 18 points in the fourth quarter and overtime to lift the Miami off its death bed.
It was, Spoelstra said, due to “an absolute will and effort” from James that Miami lived to play another day.
Duncan, a former MVP himself, did his part to help push the Spurs over the top, especially in the first half. The team’s 37-year-old captain made his first eight shots on the way to 25 first-half points — his best half since 2007, the year of the Spurs’ last championship.
He finished with 30 points and 17 rebounds, going scoreless while Leonard — despite his crucial free-throw miss — added 22 points and 11 rebounds.
The Spurs could not get enough contributions from anyone else, particularly Tony Parker (19 points and eight assists, but 6 of 23 from the field) or Ginobili (nine points, eight turnovers).
Their last, best chance to end the series on Tuesday came with Ginobili weaving to the basket with 11.3 seconds to go, to be stripped by Allen. Replays appeared to show a clear foul on Allen, which went uncalled.
“It’s a one-game series now,” said Duncan, who was scoreless in the fourth quarter in overtime.
Still, as the fourth quarter sped toward its conclusion, the Spurs were so close to a title they could practically taste the champagne.
They couldn’t close the deal. And now they’ve given a dangerous Miami team new life.
Forty-eight hours might not be enough for the Spurs to recover from the psychological blow they took Tuesday.
“I have no clue how we’re going to be re-engergized,” Ginobili said. “We’re devastated. But there’s no Game 8 afterward. So we’re going to have to play our best game.”
Their season is down to one more game. For the second game in a row, so is Miami’s.
“We have no choice, we have to bounce back,” Parker said. “We can’t forget we have another opportunity to try to win a championship.”

The options:
GML – Geographic Markup Language
This is the OGC’s big, bad open standard.Â This, and it’s smaller cousin, which I’ll get to in a little bit, form the basis for a lot of the XML-based geographic markup formats floating around (including KML), at least when it comes to describing geometries.
That being said, GML is big and complex.Â It can handle the representation of any geographic feature data that I can think of, and you get all the fringe benefits of using XML documents for data exchange.
KML – Keyhole Markup Language
Everyone reading this is probably familiar with KML.Â Best known for its use in Google Earth, which was, as the name would imply, previously Keyhole before that company was acquired by Google.
The geometry markup specified by KML is essentially a dupe of the relevant portions of the GML 1.0 and 2.0 schema (GML 3 adds a different, and incompatible way of specifying some of the geometry coordinate data), although it is completely contained within the KML namespace, and is not included as an extension of those GML schemas.
The main thing KML brings to the table, besides the fact that it’s built into every version of Google Earth, and will be an integral part of the ArcGIS 9.2 product line, is markup specific to things like styling, placemarks, and the like.Â Most of this ties directly in to Google Earth features, but it’s still useful in other applications, and is the sort of thing that would need to be defined in a application-specific GML schema.
There are also some rather nifty additions to KML 2.1, such as support for 3d models, incremental updates, and Regions, which are useful in the incremental or on demand processing of large data sets.
GML Simple Features Profile
In short, the GML Simple Features profile is simply a subset of the full GML spec, which is more suitable for describing, well… simple feature data.
Long story short, this is what you’d be building off of if you wanted to do something like include a polygon description in a standard way in your own XML document without having to order the full GML enchilada.
Other…
I guess this would be things like ESRI’s shapefile, MapInfo TAB, CSV files, punch cards, or whatever else you would happen to think makes a better â€œstandardâ€ way of exchanging geographic information, to the extent that such a thing is possible.

Ok so I haven’t read all 600 or so pages of the GML specification but…
I think that the issue we’re dealing with stems from the fact that GML doesn’t actually compete with shapefiles, or KML. GML describes the geometries themselves while KML describes how to display them. Shapefiles describe, geometries and their attributes.
We really need a standard XML replacement for shapefiles, and that isn’t what GML is. GML provides a standard way of including geographic data in your own schemas, nothing more. Therefore the comment “we support GML” is pretty much meaningless.
ogr and topp brands of gml look something like this:
… schema specific xml that includes a gml fragment …
( — for ogr:
… gml fragment …
attribute_value
)
this is also the same response you get from a wfs getFeature request.
since it already exists and provides free and open software, id say embrace the ogr spec, and try and pressure ogc to include it as a standard way of transporting GIS data.
~mookie
(btw I am an F1er as well, I dont actually enjoy reading OGC specs in my spare time)
It ate my xml so…
… schema specific xml that includes a gml fragment …
( — for ogr:
… gml fragment …
attribute_value
)
]]>
ok whatever here’s the site:
Actually, we’ ve been working with the GML Simple Features profile for almost two years now and have found that it’s a pretty good replacement for many existing geodata formats.
But we work with all the formats listed above, so I don’t have to choose
Regards,
Jeff
The idea that GML does not provide a means to express attributes is simply WRONG. GML provides a simple scheme for encoding a geographic object. The object is an element like say . The children of this element are the properties of the Road —
3
paved
… the coordinates
So GML does provide a perfectly complete, good and extensible replacement for Shapefiles and much more.
GML geometry is no more complicated than that of KML, but of course has many more geometry types since it supports non-linear geometries like Bezier Curves and Geodesics, and 3D solids to boot. Same model in call cases though.
Major thanks for the post. Want more.Babyshambles Sheepskin Tearaway Lyrics

Sponsored LinksShe opened her heart to a tearaway, a sheepskin tearaway
He was covered in scars and full of heroin
Everyone said from the start, not one single thing could ever be okay
She didn't listen anyway
She just opened her heart, and threw her cares away
At night they held on so tight in the dark, he brushed her hair away
She heard him say: "All my life i`v been fighting
and making the best of a really
very bad lot, very bad lot very,
very bad lot indeed."
All your fighting got you nowhere
If nowhere's here with you on my skin
And you could fight forever but if you killed them all you'd never win
So give me your surrender, there are other ways to kill the pain
that stuff will never mend you
It's like trying to dry your eyes in the pouring rain.
She opened her heart to a tearaway, a sheepskin tearaway
All covered in scars and full of heroin
Tearaway, a sheepskin tearaway...

Can you help me setting the height of #container? I tried everything: overflow:hidden, display:block, height:auto..
As you have absolutely positioned the elements in the container you have taken them out of the document flow so the container now has (effectively) nothing in it….so it collapses.
Why are you positioning these divs that way?
So it’s impossible and I have to find other solution? Ok.
It’s a container for a menu content. At first those divs are all with height:0. When I click on the respective button I have an animation from height:0 to height:100%. I have position:absolute to have them at the same position.
>** I have position:absolute to have them at the same position.**
Why? I’m not sure what it is you are trying to achieve.
If each of those positioned elements are going to be list items then there are **much** better ways of doing what **I think** you are trying to do.
Absolute positioning is the LAST layout method one should use if all other methods have failed.
Because if I don’t have position absolute they all get stacked and not at the same position:
Not sure why you would want to do that but if you know which div will be tallest, make that one not absolute positioned…?
As I said…
>I’m not sure what it is you are trying to achieve.
Do you have an example of the effect you are after. The animation will almost certianly have **nothing** to do with positioning.

that affects up to 1.5 million Americans. Because it is not
contagious and does not have to be reported by physicians, the
incidence of the disease is often underestimated.
Parkinson's may appear at
any age, but it is uncommon in people younger than 30, and the
risk of developing it increases with age. It occurs in all parts
of the world, and men are affected slightly more often than women
are..
Parkinson's disease can be
difficult to diagnose. No single lab test confirms Parkinson's
disease, and many symptoms mimic other illnesses. A diagnosis is
made through an extensive review of a patient's medical history,
coupled with an analysis of results from routine lab
tests.I am in love with Vodafone right now, I entered this competition a while back and yesterday Vodafone sent me a message saying that I have won two tickets to London Collections with GQ.Â I will be part of the audience with Dylan Jones, the editor of GQ which will be hosted by Caroline Rush, the CEO of the British Fashion Council.

The house that Jobs built is so highly valued that it is worth more than Microsoft and Coca-Cola combined, according to the 2011 BrandZ Top 100.
Apple's victory ends Google's four-year reign as the world's most popular brand with an 84 percent increase in Apple's value, thanks to products such as the iPad and its nonstop business growth every quarter. Apple, Google, and Microsoft aren't the only consumer technology companies to make the BrandZ Top 100. This year's list is filled with popular tech brands. Is the maker of your favorite piece of technology among the branding elites? Let's take a look.
BrandZ 100 Explained
This is the sixth year for the BrandZ Top 100, released by brand consultancy Millward Brown. The report takes into account each company's financial performance, as well as a database of more than 2 million consumer interviews conducted over the past 13 years with people in 30 countries. That data gets crunched to rank companies in 13 different categories including apparel, technology, beer, cars, luxury items, and so on.
You could easily make an argument for including cell phone carriers, which were not counted as consumer technology brands for this list. AT&T, Vodafone, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, Orange and many other global carriers made the BrandZ Top 100.
Top 10 Consumer Technology Brands
Apple (#1 overall)
Apple was able to take the top spot thanks to the iPad, which many critics believe is already taking a bite out of PC sales. Almost every PC manufacturer is working on an iPad challenger and market research firm IDC said in January it expects tablet shipments to reach nearly 71 million units by 2012 (IDC and PCWorld are both owned by International Data Group).
But tablets won't replace PCs just yet, as more than 70 million computers get shipped every three months. Apple also earned its place at the top thanks to its consistent growth in its quarterly earnings reports. The company increased its spot in the BrandZ Top 100 by 84 percent compared to 2010, with a brand value of more than $153 billion, according to the report.
Google (#2 overall)
Google may have lost the top spot, but it's still a valuable brand worth $111 billion, according to the BrandZ Top 100. The search giant's Android smartphone OS recently overtook Nokia's Symbian and Apple's iOS to be the best-selling smartphone platform.
Android isn't winning just because it's found in smartphones from every manufacturer under the sun (although that certainly helps). Android is also becoming more desirable than iOS devices, according to Nielsen.
Microsoft (#5 overall)
The Windows-maker is having success with Windows 7 recently boasting 350 million licenses sold, and hype is already building around Windows 8, expected in 2012.
Microsoft also has a critical success with Windows Phone 7, but consumers have yet to buy into Microsoft's mobile vision. Microsoft is a dominant force in gaming with the Xbox 360, perhaps more so after the recent and badly mismanaged Sony hack.
But all is not rosy for the world's fifth most valuable company. A recent blog post in Forbes points out that Microsoft is stalling financially with little year-over-year growth, its spending a ton of money to keep Bing afloat and the growing popularity of non-Microsoft mobile devices such as the iPad and Android smartphones may eventually threaten Microsoft's crown jewel: Windows. Microsoft's brand is worth $78 billion, according to the BrandZ 100.
Amazon (#14 overall)
Millward Brown doesn't categorize Amazon as a technology company in its report, but considering the popularity of the Kindle e-reader platform, the retailer's recently released Appstore for Android, its online music and video retail business and rumors of an Amazon-branded Android tablet, it's pretty safe to consider Amazon a technology company.
Amazon is also the top retail brand in the world, beating out Top 100 competitors such as Wal-Mart and Target. Amazon's brand value grew by 37 percent compared to 2010 to hit more than $37 billion.
Hewlett-Packard (#18 overall)
HP has a popular line of desktop and laptop computers, which accounts for its place in the Top 100. But the company's brand value also dropped by 11 percent compared to 2010.
HP made a big bet in 2010 by purchasing the ailing Palm, and the company hopes to enter the mobile device market with a revitalized lineup of WebOS tablets and smartphones. WebOS now has a company large enough to bankroll device development.
But the best WebOS can hope for right now is to battle out for third place in the smartphone world against Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 and/or Research In Motion's Blackberry. The top two spots in mobile platforms will go to Google's Android and Apple's iOS for the foreseeable future.
Blackberry (#25 overall)
Research In Motion's Blackberry brand lost 20 percent of its value in 2011 compared to the previous year.
Blackberry is still a force to be reckoned with in the enterprise, but its PlayBook tablet is getting mixed reviews.
Baidu (#29 overall)
Google's Chinese language archrival in search may not have a presence in the English-speaking world, but with nearly 500 million potential customers in China alone, who needs the West?
Facebook (#35 overall)
Facebook was the fastest-rising company in the BrandZ 100 compared to 2010, jumping 246 percent to come in at #35 overall, and the number 8 consumer tech brand.
Facebook may be heavily criticized for its privacy policies, but users can't get enough of the social network's Likes, pokes and Farmville crops.
Intel (#58 overall)
Intel's brand may be the gold standard for processing power, but the company is struggling to compete with ARM in tablets and mobile devices.
Recent talk is that Apple might fall into ARM's embrace by 2013. Intel's brand power is worth more than $13 billion, according to the BrandZ 100.
Samsung (#67 overall)
Samsung was the first company out of the gate to compete with Apple in the tablet arena with the 7-inch Galaxy Tab.
The Korea-based manufacturer also has a 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab in the works, a sleek, new ultraportable laptop and the company moved quickly in 2010 to produce 3D HDTVs.
Many other consumer technology companies rounded out the bottom of the BrandZ 100, including Nintendo, ebay, and Sony.

Maryland state officials are reviewing how many people may have gotten Medicaid by mistake, the WBAL-TV 11 News I-Team has learned.
Mobile users tap here to watch video
State Health Secretary Joshua Sharfstein confirmed late Friday afternoon that the state is contacting potentially thousands of people who were enrolled in Medicaid to determine whether they really belong on the government health insurance program for people living on lower incomes.
Janice Bond was a perfect candidate for the Affordable Care Act, exactly the reason supporters pushed for the law.
"I didn't have health insurance. I was uninsured," Bond said.
As soon as the new law launched in October, Bond tried to sign up through the state's health exchange website. But like so many others, she failed to get enrolled because the website crashed. Then in late December she found success -- or at least she thought she did.
"I went on the website, signed up, put all my information in and it stated my husband and I qualified for Medicaid. It gave me a case number and everything," Bond said.
Bond had to be hospitalized in early January with a viral illness and racked up a big bill. But when it came time to pay, Bond learned she and her husband aren't Medicaid eligible.
"It was the income. We made too much to start with, so we should never have received notification that we qualified for Medicaid," Bond said.
Gov. Martin O'Malley and Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown have repeatedly used the high number of Medicaid enrollments to claim success with Affordable Care Act sign-ups, even though they fell far short of the goal for enrollment in private health plans. The exchange has been one of the country's poorest performers.
But are the numbers correct?
In February, budget analysts hinted at trouble, saying "there have been issues for Medicaid enrollment in terms of incorrect eligibility determinations and stuck cases ... The system is incapable of handling Medicaid redeterminations" intended to remove people from the rolls when their incomes increase. That, analysts said, could amount to "a total state cost of $30.5 million."
Effective May 1, Bond was able to get enrolled in a private plan with the subsidy the Affordable Care Act provides, but she may be still be enrolled in Medicaid.
Bond said her Medicaid card arrived about a week and a half ago and it appears, as far as the state's concerned, she's still in Medicaid.
Sharfstein said the Medicaid review could take a couple of months. He blames the software the state used to determine eligibility. A big question is whether the state will have to repay the federal government the federal tax dollars to pay for Medicaid.Argentina inflation congress index for March was 1.54% and 24.43% in last 12 months
Despite the efforts from the administration of President Cristina Fernandez that brokered a price freeze for another two months with the main supermarket chains of Argentina, March inflation according to the average of private estimates stood at 1.54% and 24.43% in the last twelve months.
The result which has become a monthly event was presented by the opposition members of the Lower House Freedom of Speech Commission, that work with an average of the estimates from private consultants, who are liable to strong fines if they make public their numbers without the government consent.
The Congress committee announced the 1.54% for March and 24.43% for the twelve months to March.
A year ago the so called Congressional index had reached 2.31% which means consumer prices in Argentina are climbing at a slower pace, mainly food and beverage (Supermarkets agreement) and which represent a significant component for the overall average. It is estimated that over 40% of food and beverage sales are concentrated in supermarkets and thus exposed to the freeze.
However trade union and some provinces stats estimates indicate that during March fresh produce, mainly vegetables, fruit, poultry, dairy and meat did experience some minor changes.
But the main components influencing the March index were education ad clothing. This is traditional in Argentina since it is the month when children return to school and there is additional spending in stationery, uniforms plus the fact it is the beginning of the winter clothing season.
Nevertheless despite the moderation in price increases the overall feeling is not satisfactory according to the March Expectations survey from the Torcuato Di Tella University. In effect the survey shows that inflation for the next twelve months is expected to hover in the range of 30%.
The controversial official Argentine government stats office Indec is expected to release its March inflation index on Friday. In February the Indec index was 0.5% which was less than half the 1.23% average reported by the Congressional index..
crikey.
They are screwed.
and it makes me happy
But the complete apathy by the populace continues to amaze me. If this was the UK there would have been a vote of confidence failure and a new government months and months ago.
It is almost as if they don't blame TMBOA for this fiasco. Ah, it's the Brits, isn't it!
Even still I would love for a CFK supporter to show me ONE EXAMPLE where increasing the money supply so rapidly has had been a good long term solution for an economy,
Just one example
Tax revenue is now about 2/3 of inflation. So they will continue to pump in cash to cover their expenses. What a mess.
My guess is inflation will be over 40% this year
Massive Devaluation is imminent
and
Hyperinflation will take off
No Argentinian ever blamed the British for inflation. All the blame goes towards CFK. It´s just that the people don´t see the current level of inflation to be such a big issue.
Are all the Rgs going to be in a white shirt and flag colored blue pants with a jaunty yellow scarf?
Bahahaha
retards through and through
I get myself all twisted up laughing at these people
That is because the world runs on something called REALITY.
Something that you Mercopress posters have no fucking idea about. You have not only eaten Mercopress's propaganda on Argentina's situation wholesale (which already is histrionic and only publishes all the supposedly negative news stories), but then you people in your comments have that incurable necessity to exaggerate those news stories to the 10th power, just because you are poor cretins with nothing but hatred towards Argentina.
Thus, you all now truly believe that people are starving in mass, that travel is completely banned, that the crime rate is like Central America, Venezuela, or the USA, that there is massive deforestation, no sewers, no running water, and all the rest I have read here.
Thus, you are honest when you say you don't understand why Argentines have not risen up against the image of Argentina above.
That is because, it only exists in your microcephalic heads.
What is the real annual inflation rate in Argentina? This article says it has been about 24%, but posters here have claimed it is really about 40%.
What is the real inflation rate in Argentina then?
You really are telling me you think people that post here are unbiased, fair, and neutral in their comments towards Argentina? Really?
I actually seen most of Arg with the broken streets, the slums, the sewage in the streets, the graffiti on the mountain face, the scams, the crime, the scared population living behind walls with private guards. ALL OF IT.
I have first hand knowledge and most likely know more of Argentina than you will ever dream of seeing.
You think we only read this news site? What about the Int'l press saying the same thing? IMF, US Congress..for goodness sakes!
8. Bush inflation will closely match their increase in money supply it is simple economics when you don't have a reserve currency. It is SO FAR 36% yoy. It will increase as they run out of peso to pay for the HUGE Gov't expansion. Just wait until the end of the year. I am usually not far off.
What would you say is a more realistic description of the current economy in Argentina?
medium-term volatile to market readjustments.
ps - yankeeboy said wait till the end of the year (for the collapse), three YEARS ago.
When does soemoene lose all credibility?
@10
All of what you said are cheap platitudes, you are one dumb ferk. I can also say the USA and it's constant mass killings, the streets smelling of urine, the police brutality, the filthy trailer neighborhoods, the grafitti, the obese population, the police and metal detectors in schools, courts, malls... all of it.
What about the intl' press saying the same thing about the USA and its problems?
I have explained over and over it is very hard to predict WHEN an economy will collapse but not IF.
So far my predictions are pretty good.
I stand by all of them
Next stop 7/1 in 2nd quarter of the year.
What a tosser with no argument.
You keep asking questions for us to answer. When we do our truthful best (Yankeeboy is one of 'us') you dismiss it.
So, what I recommend you do is get on a plane and go to BsAs and when you have seen what you want and experienced it for yourself you can go back home safe in the knowledge that YOU have seen it.
That’s if you don’t get knifed, shot or badly beaten by a bunch or argies after your phone, camera and money just like many other tourists have in the two years (almost) that I have been in Uruguay.
You see, I also came here a year ago and change with an open mind. Just because I didn't toe 100% the 'argentina-hatred' narrative, pathetic characters like the one above tell you to get stuffed.
Believe it or not, there was a time when I was friendly with him, until I found out what he thought of me behind my back.
So now you understsand why I become the most uncomfortable challenging Truth Telling Troll for these haters. They can't stand it that someone would come to their little corner of the internet and spout their propaganda.
And guess what, you will probably NOT get knifed, beaten up, or much less shot at.
This people are just living in an utter opium delusion.
yeah ok
loser
My post at #11 seems as if #10 is being dismissed. But I was responding to #9 and did not know that Yankeeboy had already posted when I submitted my post.
So you are safe in the cesspit known as Argentina? There is only one way to be sure: NEVER go there.

What a retard. So in an age where people can put videos in their blogs, one has to go “see” the place to be able to say what it looks like. hahahaha
EVER heard of 'the camera never lies' OR even simpler than that, was looking the wrong way!
Stupid, stupid boy.
Gosh all those travelers spending $2TRILLION a year are certainly dopes. They could have stayed in their parent's basement and saw it all on their screen.
I love reading the posts from the dumb Rgs. It makes my day.
Its more simple to say CRIME and INFLATION both out of control, and the average educated Argentinian is very worried, worried also that Kirchner will somehow corrupt the october elections and open the way to re election but I think the feeling towards here is so bad this will not happen but the main problem is her buying the uneducated masses like all dictators once in power
Wow what an amazing place!!
bahahaha
It gets worse and worse every day
Let's see what the crowds look like on April 18th.
You are a cesspit, your country of origin and the one you reside in. You fit like a glove. One is a morally vitiated, turpitudinous rotten corpse of human history, whose capital city is often ranked amogst the worst ratholes on the planet by veteran visitors. The other is a country whose capital city is so old and run down it makes the broken sidewalks of BA look like Mendoza.
As putridly boring to boot.
And in both the UK and Uruguay, you still get murders and rapes. Lovely.
You always will look foolish trying to compare 1st world with whatever rat hole Argentina currently is...used to be 3rd but now I am not so sure.
You forgot to mention all the power cuts and the regular flooding!
Whoops, that's not London, that's BA! Silly me!
If you remember when you were even younger than now, I tried to encourage you to use your brain and extend your knowledge beyond the somewhat ludicrous and outdated way of your use of English.
I had great hopes for you because you said the Falklands (no Malivinas for you) belonged to the Islanders, which is true.
Then you went away for a while and when you returned, if indeed it was the same person, your attitude had changed remarkably and it has continued to degrade to this day.
It is for these reasons that others have jumped on you: you ask for it.
Shame really.
They have been brainwashed to believe that whatever is in Argentina is either the same as of better than what is in EU UK or USA. They are firm in their beliefs and nothing will sway them
UNTIL
they get to leave that rat hole and see the 1st World.
The 1st time I went to BA someone took me to Corrientes and said see this is just like Times Square I laughed.
I brought the same person to Times Square and all he had to say was They have no idea
I think it is NPD which makes them feel inferior and jealous when we politely point out the differences and shatter their tenuous grasp on reality, so they get really aggressive and angry and then stop making sense altogether.
Just a theory but I'm pretty sure I am right.
That safe haven of Buenos Aires, 56 deaths already this year as a result of robberies and assault.
It is much much dangerous and there are many more deaths that go unreported.
People in general don't report crime because they are afraid of the Police ( since they're involved in most of it)
What do those links have to do with the corrupt decaying rathole of Argentina?
That is the topic.
If you think I am lying why don't you post a fact to dispute it?
Hmm can't
moron
Oops poverty in USAMex, pretty shocking I should say.
Shantytown in US presented with a quite good English accent.
“If you think I am lying why don't you post a fact to dispute it?”
Why I should do that?
I wouldn’t present facts to dispute hilarious statements like “cow can fly” and you?
I think CFK will have the same retirement party as Ceaușescu. I wonder if it will be televised like his was?
I told you yankeeboy it was a matter of time before you got hit again, and now there you have it. A couple of thousand dollar bombs and now you will have to spend at least a trillion to track down and punish the perpetrators.
Problem is, you don't have even half a trillion now.
I smell a default as terrorism sets in panic across the USA and investors pull their money out.
Silly boy those little things will never stop the USA.
It just makes our resolve stronger.
Didn't last week have 25X more people killed in a little rain?

That's the difference between 1st world and 3rd or 4th or 5th or whatever you are now...

Suppose you are right and the BCRA runs out of USD who do you think will suffer?
I have not holdings of Argentina bonds in USD and you?
While printing machines run party goes on ask US if not true.
Your news for me is like for you knowing that US has ran out of pesos.
Do you understand how in the past are you?
Will you be scared for running out of pesos in US?
I guess not...
Try another one.
Currency is just and instrument to make easy trade at this stage of the financial mess and the possible collapse of the US dollar as a FIAT currency like the Euro, pesos are pretty safe and you get good interest.
I’m adapting myself to the new world order, have you ever heard about it?
I think you should put all available funds in Arg Pesos
This should work out very well for you especially since BCRA is printing 40% more of them this year.
When do you think they start adding extra zeros?
Then they must be even more valuable
It is simple to see why Argentina has a currency crisis every decade.
They are all so stupid!
I wonder why the Prez and cronies are hiring planes to ship pallets of U$ and Euros to switzerland? FOR THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS
That seems odd if the Peso is the way to go.
Doncha think?

True Grit blew my mind when I went to see it. I was stoked when I got it in the mail the other day (I had a nice Amazon gift card that I used on it!)

ctvbc.ca
Published Tuesday, April 10, 2012 3:41PM PDT
A Kamloops resident was nearly billed $5,000 by BC Hydro due to a faulty smart meter.
Homeowner Trevor "Trapper" Cameron almost had to pay $4,800 for a single hydro bill until BC Hydro acknowledged that the meter installed outside Cameron's home was flawed.
"For every dollar we were using, it was five dollars, so [we would have had to pay] five times the amount," said Cameron.
BC Hydro Director of Customer Care Jim Nicholson said it is common for new digital equipment to have glitches, but what Cameron experienced has never occurred before.
"What we're doing is stepping up our vigilance within the field operations groups to ensure that as meter readers are doing regular reads, they're looking for any anomalies that might, in fact, indicate to us there may be another one," Nicholson said.
While Cameron is content that his hydro bill has been revised to $180, opponents to the smart meters are not convinced that this faulty measurement was an isolated incident.
"I don't buy that all," said Brad Thiessen, who has been campaigning to pull the plug on smart meters. "This has been happening in Texas, California, Australia, Ontario…B.C is going to be no different."

Hello!! HTC Magic+ Customers should expect HTC to start rolling out 2.1 OS today, OTA
I’m really hopping that the testing that was done prior to releasing this ROM will mean that we won’t be seeing the same level of bugs that we saw in the E911 update.
You can find more information on the update from leavenodroidbehind.com

I think they actually started the OTA last week, somebody at Rogers was telling me they spit their customers in 2, first half got the OTA last week.

If that were the case, you’d think that we would have seem something about it on some of the forums.

Will anyone be testing whether rooting is possible after the update?
September 8, 2010 at 5:52 pm |
The SPL version hasn’t changed since the E911 update, so the phone should still be able to be rooted. I will try to get someone in the next day or so to try and root it.

how to do this update on a CM6 magic? in setting – about phone there is no update system option.
Also are any changes needed to be done before running updates if one is running cm roms?
September 11, 2010 at 7:15 pm |
You can’t. You have to go back to the stock rom with the correct radio and SPL I believe. Unless there’s a workaround, but I know for sure you need the stock Rogers rom.

Does anyone know a “how to” guide to go back from CM6 to the correct radio and spl for the magic 2.1 update?PHOENIX — Trevor Bauer made an eagerly-anticipated exhibition debut Sunday against the Brewers at Maryvale Baseball Park. It couldn’t have gone much better.
Making his first appearance as an Indian, Bauer, a 22-year-old right-hander tossed two scoreless innings, allowing two hits and striking out two to get the win in a 7-4 victory.
“Facing hitters for the first time in live competition is always kind of weird, but it was fun,” Bauer said. “I enjoyed being out there. Baseball’s back.
“I had no expectations. I was just hoping to throw strikes. It’s nice to have a successful first outing. I’ve got a lot of stuff I’m working on and I thought I did pretty well today.”
Manager Terry Francona agreed.
“He used all his pitches. I actually was kind of impressed,” Francona said. “I thought he looked like he was a little excited that first inning, but he threw strikes. His first couple bullpens, he was scattering balls, and he got in the game and threw the ball much better.”
Part of Bauer’s quirky approach includes a strange warmup routine once he gets to the mound. Starting from behind the mound, Bauer runs toward the plate and does a crow hop before throwing his first warmup pitch with gusto.
“I’ve always done it, just to put myself in the mindset that I want to be aggressive and attack,” Bauer said.
Francona doesn’t have an issue with the procedure, though he would never attempt it himself.
“I think if I did that, my arm would fall off,” he said. “He’s 22-years old and it looks like it comes out pretty good. It’s just something he does. As long as he doesn’t do it when he’s pitching, we’re OK.”
Rocking Raburn
Francona isn’t putting too much stock in Ryan Raburn’s fast start this spring. The bench player candidate hit home runs in each of his first three exhibition at-bats, going 1-for-2 Sunday against the Brewers.
“Every spring there’s always a guy that’s hot, there’s always a guy that’s cold. You can’t figure it out,” Francona said. “I do know that for guys like Ryan, I know we say it’s spring training, but they’re playing for their baseball life.”
Raburn fever is catching on, with Nick Swisher wearing his teammate’s jersey in the clubhouse prior to the split-squad games Sunday.
“Yeah, he was talking about switching numbers and names,” Raburn said of Swisher. “That’s all right, as long as we switch contracts, too.”
Picture imperfect
Proving he is as loose as they come, Francona posted a picture in the clubhouse of himself in an oversized Indians hat with a goofy look on his face. The caption below the photo read, “I demand respect.”
“What’s the saying, we try to take our jobs seriously, but ourselves not so seriously?” Francona joked. “If GQ doesn’t come calling now, they never will.”

About the print:
This piece is titled: Lost At Sea, and That's Fine By Me. It is one of the bigger, more heavily layered pieces that I have made, and was created for my show called "Bright Eyed and Bushy Tailed" - a solo exhibition at Together Gallery here in Portland, OR. The show was heavily based on the curiosity of a cat. I've gotten into sailing recently and have a small sailboat. I love exploring, and the ocean is so huge, that I daydream about being out on my boat at night in the the middle of the ocean - no land in sight, maybe just my cat and sweetheart on board, with the sound of the waves. This piece is about that dream. Someday I plan on sailing around the world with a mini studio on my boat.
The original artwork was made with acrylic and graphite on hand-cut paper. This is a giclée print on 310gsm Hahnemuhle archival matte paper. Each print was signed by the artist.

What has inspired you recently?
I just got home from a road trip to Mt. Baker, WA, which is right on the border of Canada, way up in the woods. I spent a few days in a cabin and up on the snowy mountains snowboarding with friends. Being outside and soaking in the sun inspires, as does looking out and seeing nothing but trees. Portland winters are harsh, and i spend most days hidden away in my studio listening to the rain outside and the hum of freight trains speeding by.
Why did you choose to pair the Kids In Need Foundation with your print?
I chose to pair my print with the Kids In Need Foundation because the youth are the future! For me, school changed my life. I was hooked after the first art class I took, and was lucky enough to go to a school with a great art program. It scares me when I hear that some schools don't offer art and music programs because of a lack of funds, so I hope that we can raise money and get the Kids In Need Foundation some creative supplies and books to educate. Knowledge is power - let's give every kid a chance.
How have you seen art transform the world around you?
Art making has definitely changed my life. I was a weird kid and when i found art and skateboarding, things finally made sense to me. Moving to Portland, I met so many creatives and felt like I was part of a family - everyone collaborating and encouraging each other. Technology weirds me out, so I use the computer as a tool but I feel most comfortable listening to music and painting, and when I'm not painting, looking at a beautiful painting. Portland has an amazing energy because of this - everyone I know is working on something cool: an art show, music, dance, building a teepee.
If you could pick one artist to mentor you, who would it be?
Friedensreich Hundertwasser, the Austrian artist, architect, and all around bohemian, would have been so rad to hang out with and talk about art and living in this crazy world. He was the origin of blurring the line between art and life, living a lifestyle that was basically a work of art in itself.
Who are some artists you think people should know about?
My friends here are very inspiring - peeps like Seth Needs, Mark Warren Jacques, Tim Adam Maynard, David Wien - too many to list, all making and thinking. Oh, Jay Howell is the man, too.

I was in momentary pink heaven. I have never been a pink girl either. Even rebelled dressing my girls in pink. Over the last few months however, images such as these have changed my mind. I'm with you Averill, would love to have a bedroom such as that. I don't compromise much in decorating. Husband is pretty tolerant of my crazy style. I did do a guest bedroom here in Houston with a vintage 70's wallpaper (looks like a Pucci design). It has a bold orchid/pink color in it. I thought my brother in law was going to faint when I showed him his room when he came to stay from Scotland. I won't even get started about that earth shattering walk-in closet. OMG!!!
Averill, this room is one of my all-time faves. I love the way Jamie Drake is fearless with color.
Averill-I heard Jamie Drake speak last week at the Corcoran-quite a charming man. I am as girly as they come and pink is my favorite color. I was smart enough to marry a man who has no interest in interior design and is color blind. Needless to say, I do as I wish. But the only room in my house that is all pink is my dressing room that nobody goes in but me. But in other rooms I use touches of pink. Pink is my beige.
oooh la la! i swear i would keep my closet clean if it looked like the one above! i always tell the boys i am going to get my own condo down the street and just visit them with groceries every few days. if i did, i could have a bedroom like that!.
Two things right now, though: He's not sure about my painting the headboards for Avery's big girl room redo, and I'm trying to figure out a way to get rid of this hideous "pirate trunk" we have from his grandparent's estate without him noticing! ;)
Oh wow, I'm loving all of the pink! And that closet is absolutely amazing! :)
OMG that closet!! Did you notice that the bench fabric matches an outfit that's in the closet? I love that the handbag storage looks like a boutique display. No pink in my house now. Hubby like darks, and I like lights. I've mostly won, but he really wanted a dark room - hence our the tiny brown guest room. Only it looks more like poo than Hershey's! :( He thinks it's cozy, I think it's dark and depressing. More decorating must be done in that space...??
At first glance, I thought all of the pink was overwhelming but, as you pointed out, I think Jamie Drake did a great job giving it a more grown-up vibe with the furnishings. I love that lucite desk chair -- and the closet...wow...put a cot in there and I would live in that closet :).
The way to get your pink fix as an adult is to have little girls! I decorated the room of one of my girls in pink - delicate pink on the walls, a beautiful balloon shade in pink and white toile, a white blanket cover with a big pink monogram in the center, complete with matching euro. She tolerates the whole scheme now, but we have alread painted over the pink on the walls as she decided she did not like it. Oh well!
My husband doesn't give to much guidance on decor choices, but he does have veto power. I keep it fairly neutral. The bedroom is actually more on the feminine side (I am going to do a post on it soon), but because it is done in blues and whites, the color scheme does not translate as feminine, even though the scallops on the blanket cover, the curves on the mirror, and monograms on the pillows are definitely feminine touches!.
Wow that is one gorgeous bedroom and closet. I adore it. I am a sort of girly girl. Okay, a total girly girl - even though my house is decorated as such, because I too am married! I have been given free reign in our guest room though, and it's totally cutesy.
Loved this post Averill!
Each space is delightfully pretty in pink :) I love the touches of gold and lucite, such as the mirror in image 02 -- so decadent against the clean wall behind. The armoire has that wow factor, with a grown-up flair. As for that closet? I don't even know where to begin...if I went in there, I don't think the jaws of life could get me out again...!DOWNEY — An 18-year-old man was killed when the minivan he was in rear-ended a large truck in Downey, police said today.
Four other people were injured in the crash on Lakewood Boulevard and Florence Avenue, which occurred about 10:45 p.m. Friday, according to the Downey Police Department.
A 19-year-old man driving a 1997 Chevrolet Astro Van southbound on Lakewood Boulevard, in the number one lane, veered into the center two-way left turn lane and rear ended a 2001 Great Dane trailer attached to a 2012 Freightliner trailer, police reports indicated. The truck was stopped in the two-way left turn lane.
The driver of the minivan and three of his passengers -- an 18-year-old man, a 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old woman - were rushed to area hospitals with non-life threatening injuries. A fourth passenger, an 18-year-old man from Downey, was pronounced dead at the scene.
The driver of the semi-tractor, a 52-year-old man, suffered no injuries.
Downey police detectives asked anyone who saw the crash to call them at (562) 904-2339.Thanks! Why are you flagging this item?

Sticking to his Story
Peanut butter is the staff of life for many college students—and biographer Jon Krampner ’74 spreads it on thick in a comprehensive history of this all-American food
By Dick Anderson | Photo by Max S. Gerber
“My memory may be playing tricks with me,” author Jon Krampner ’74 begins, “but when I was growing up, I only ate two foods—peanut butter and hamburgers. When I went away to college, my parents said, ‘Don’t take your portable TV, get out and meet people, and try to eat stuff other than peanut butter.’ So I actually went kind of cold turkey. I came out to Los Angeles and discovered Mexican and Filipino and Mongolian food. And throughout the 1970s, I did not eat peanut butter.”
Following a string of bad jobs (“I spent the Carter Administration getting fired from small-town newspapers”), the nomadic journalist returned to L.A. in 1980. Around that time, “a romance blew up on me,” Krampner says. “I started buying big jars of Skippy and consoling myself in peanut butter—and my weight really shot up.” On his nutritionist’s advice, he started going to a gym and swore off peanut butter for a second time. “It wasn’t until I started working on this book that I got back into it again—purely for research purposes, you understand.”
The book in question is Creamy & Crunchy: An Informal History of Peanut Butter, the All-American Food (Columbia University Press; $27.95), published this fall after six years of research, more than 100 interviews, and Lord knows how many jars of peanut butter. Reviews have been largely laudatory—The New Yorker called it “enjoyable and informative”—and so the real question awaiting Krampner is whether peanut butter consumers will nosh on a narrative that seesaws between pop culture (one chapter covers “The Music of Peanut Butter”) and arcane process (such as what hydrogenation does to the molecular structure of the vegetable oils used to make peanut butter). “If you write a book about microbreweries or NASCAR or Abraham Lincoln, there are these people who will rush out and buy it,” Krampner says at his home in Los Feliz. “I don’t know if this will actually be the case, but I was able to convince a publisher.”
Having penned two biographies associated with live television dramas of the 1950s—producer Fred Coe and actress Kim Stanley—the native New Yorker was eager to tackle a subject matter closer to comfort food. “I could not do another five- or six-year hitch on a now-obscure tormented genius,” says Krampner, who calls himself “a writer by profession, teacher by salary” (he has taught English as a second language at night school since 1988). “I approached this project in a celebratory manner, but as I got into it, my journalistic instincts kicked in.”
Whereas the structure of biography is relatively easy—“You have before they were famous, when they were famous, and after they were famous”—a book devoted to peanut butter turned out
to be a stickier proposition. “I worked on this thing for three years before I wrote a word,” Krampner admits. After writing a sample chapter to share with the editor on his Stanley biography, he hit upon “this sort of hybrid scheme that’s both thematic and chronological.”
Krampner devotes a couple of chapters each to the three major brands: Peter Pan (introduced in 1928), Skippy (1933), and perennial market leader Jif (1958). Besides tying Peter Pan’s launch to the Roaring ’20s, he gets into the origins of hydrogenation, which touches on questions of organic chemistry. But “Science was always my worst subject,” Krampner says. “As soon as I got out of high school, I never studied science again.”
To aid his own understanding of the process, he contacted the chemistry department at Oxy, where a secretary steered him to professor Chris Craney. “We had lunch in front of the Cooler to explain the difference between flexible and inflexible bonds in hydrogenated and unhydrogenated vegetable oil,” says Krampner, who majored in English and comparative literary studies at Oxy. “Chris kind of waltzed me around the patio in front of the Cooler to make the point.”
The peanut butter industry was a tougher nut to crack. “The big three were of almost no help whatsoever,” Krampner says. “As the head marketing person for Jif said, ‘Brand management is our thing. So if we can’t control something, we don’t cooperate with it.’” The trade groups proved to be a bit more helpful. Sitting down for an interview with the head of the American Peanut Council in Arlington, Va., “I thought he would just wax poetic about peanuts and how important they are,” Krampner recalls. “And he said, ‘Peanut butter is basically just ground-up peanuts.’”
Other things he learned along the way:
Peanut butter was first produced commercially in the Midwest in the 1890s by George Bayle, a snack food maker in St. Louis. Others insist that John Harvey Kellogg of Corn Flakes fame came first. “They had a sanitarium up in Battle Creek, Mich., and they would grind up peanuts and serve it as a health food. But they boiled their peanuts—they didn’t roast them—so the flavor is really different. “To me, George Bayle is probably No. 1, but to peanut butter enthusiasts, it’s a subject of some controversy.”
There are as many ways to eat peanut butter as there are people who eat it. Krampner eats it two ways: straight out the jar, and in a “sandwich of my own devising, which I call the Simon and Garfunkel. Basically, I put peanut butter of any kind on a whole wheat bagel, add a slice of mozzarella, sauté some mushrooms and spinach in olive oil, grind some pepper over them, put on a slice of tomato, grind up a garlic clove and put that in, and then put parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme on it. Hence the name. Finally, I squeeze a little slice of lemon over it.”
If you eat peanut butter straight out of the jar, be careful. “Believe it or don’t, people have actually choked on peanut butter,” Krampner says. “I actually did a brief interview with Henry Heimlich, and he said when you eat peanut butter you should do it on bread, because by itself it can just get stuck in your throat. And then, even with the Heimlich maneuver, you won’t get it out. When I eat it out of the jar, I eat it a little bit at a time, swirl it around my tongue before it goes down, and I keep some water nearby.”
Peanut butter fanatics are hard to come by. In two of the best-known books on food culture—John McPhee’s Oranges (1967) and Steve Almond’s Candy Freak (2004)—“you come across the most astonishing characters,” Krampner says. “In peanut butter there must be people like that, too. But if there are, I failed to locate them. So if they read this, please contact me.” (And copy us as well.) seriously considering getting the borla dual exhaust system for my 4Runner though (the pipes exit the sides). I think it might keep the exhaust away from the rear window...
No problem so far with mine, but it only has 1,000 miles on it...when did the problem start for those who have the issue?
They designed the cats to work with the fuel the government PROMISED but didn't force the delivery of!
This is why diesels still don't have catalytic convertors the Sulfur in the cheap oil would destroy them fast.
It's NOT just a Toyota thing - I've seen hundreds of complaints on this subject from owners of many brands of vehicles.
mhallack,
The smell was very slight in the beginning. In fact, at delivery I mentioned it and they told me that since this was a ULEV vehicle the converter needed to "break in". I like to think that they were misled as well, but given that their one goal is to get you in the car, I think they intentionally lied to me. It appears to be getting more intense. I hope my hearing goes well.
Consider this. We don't smoke in buildings anymore, right? Why? Because people who don't smoke would be subjected to it. Breathing emissions for 5-6 years can't be good for you. That's apparently why the exhaust pipe is OUTSIDE the car.
Furthermore, I'm a safety enigineer and I do analyses like this daily. Let me educate you. If you smell sulfur on a daily basis, it's dangerous and unhealthy. Prolonged exposure is proven to cause a vast array of cardiovascular problems. I understand that you are some sort of investigator? Before responding, read my previous posts. You'll find links to references that substantiate my claims. Investigate that.
I see no immediate cure for the problem of smelling emissions from vehicles as we drive, especially in close-in traffic.
Just like I see no immediate cure for the problem of smelling the guy's cigarette or cigar in the car next to me.
Considering 4 throat surgeries, I'm extremely sensitive to odors like these, often gagging and losing my lunch over tailpipe emissions or a cigarette - believe me, I "get it".
The only fix I see is beating the smoker with a stick so you don't have to inhale their smoke - unfortunately, it's not the right thing to do and I could get into trouble for it.
I just Toyota's official response to the arbtitration. It's their postion right now concerning the problem. I don't think they even understand the problem. They say the smell comes from the fuel. Well, I think we can all agree the Sulfur is in the fuel. I have explained to Toyota no less that 6 times and even had the customer servie rep write it down as I was saying , then repeat it back. The problem is that the smell is INSIDE the vehicle! I can just see it now....we finally get to the day of arbtitration and the Toyota rep says "ohhh, it's inside the cabin". I'm going to request in writing that they bring all my case documents in from all my phone calls so I can show the guy what's been going on . Toyota is being Extremely evasive. I'm never buying another Toyota.
It's a fuel/EPA issue, not a Toyota issue.
so how is it, then, that we have regressed to bonehead technology that accumulates sulfur from the exhaust and stinks it away under load?
maybe E V E R Y T H I N G !! ought to be recalled that was made with the current technology to be destunk.
A few years later, it seems like 1 in 10 cars smells like that - weird, and nasty.
but I don't think they're doing the job based on the amount of stinkers on the road.
which means they were improvidently approved based on insufficient testing. specifically, the old GM jobs were probably sniffed on the test track, and the new ones aren't. just like the Mack diesel engines about 5 or 7 years ago that were faked up to pass EPA bench testing, and they all blow black clouds like exploding volcanoes when you accelerate under load on those things. it was tricky programming on the injector computer that did it. Mack had to pay a dinky-[non-permissible content removed] fine (some dozen millions or so) and promise their next engines and subsequent rebuilds would pass.
surprise, there was no next engine, they have outsourced engines in the new trucks.
My poor GF following me, immediately smelled the horrible odor, but she didn't know what it was or where it came from. Boy that sucked for her the whole 11mi home.
This was a 3mi new car. In no way was I driving it fast. I was a granny the whole way home.
I'm really hoping this is going to go away soon.
I bought the V6 thinking that everyone said the CLEAN CA gas was not causing sulfur smells. No quite the case.
However, if your windows are up, your air-system is on recirculate and you still have the odor issue, then something is wrong, beyond the presenting symptom.
Keep the rear window closed when you drive.
I just noticed the smell from my car yesterday when I did some highway driving with the tailgate window down. My back seat passengers complained of a really foul rotten egg smell. When I closed the tailgate window, it went away.
Some of you have compained of getting the smell with the windows rolled up. I haven't experienced that problem, fortunately.
But even so, what is the point of having a power tailgate window if you can't use it while driving? If Toyota doesn't do something (i.e. recall or post a TSB), I have to admit my trust in their name will be tarnished.
This was as true of a 1960s station wagon as it is of the 4Runner today.
That is why, on page 29 of the 2003 4Runner's owners manual, there is a big yellow box labeled "Caution" that reads, in part: "Keep the back window closed while driving. This not only keeps the luggage from being thrown out but also prevents exhaust gases from entering the vehicle."
Why does the 4Runner have a power back window? I find it more convenient than the flip-out windows used in some competing trucks.
So does that mean, you can never carry long lumber home from the store, or anything else that needs to stick out the back without smelling rotten eggs?
As well as, people following you smelling it. I follow my friends in their new cars all the time going places. I never smell any terrible smells, as they not smell my 02 GTI.
I didn't smell my friend's 96 4runner with the same open back window, open while driving.
I bought this car specifically for my dog in order to carry her around so she can stick her head out the back. Otherwise, it would have been mdx, or rx300 all the way.
In CA with 03 V8.
Like it says in the manual, roll up the back window when you are driving. Otherwise you will get exhaust in the car. Whether it smells like sulfur or not, exhaust is bad for you.
Yes, CO puts you to sleep and kills you.
My point is why does the 4runner emit so much sulfur smell? I'm a physicist. I can map out the vortex behind a 4runner travelling through the air very well. I understand the low/high pressure situation of the cabin and its relation to the opening of the back window WRT to exhaust coming in or not.
Maybe we should agree to disagree on the issue of whether or not I should be able to drive with the window down.
under no circumstances whatsoever should exhaust get into a closed passenger compartment (he seethed, knowing full well that in traffic, the fumes from every other car in the road are pulled over the hood and into the car by the air intake.)
if you're by yourself on the road and you smell your stinky exhaust, that is a safety problem with your car that the dealer needs to remedy under warranty. again, tell him I HAVE A SAFETY ISSUE WITH EXHAUST GETTING INTO MY CAR and see if they look awake this time. they are supposed to wake up for safety concerns.
Go back and read the rest of this thread. I have the same problem with sulfur entering the cabin with the windows up and A/C on recirc. The fortunate thing abou the sulfur is that is lets you know that something/s wrong with the vehicle (can 't smell CO). I am scheduled to arbitrate on the 9th. Let me know if you guys need help.Business Owner? Add your logo and more…

It means hockey at Allentown's new $234 million hockey complex will start a year later than city officials have been saying, but that didn't seem to dampen the enthusiasm of Phantoms team owners, who formally announced the inaugural year in Allentown to season ticket buyers.When you read this, I should be at the airport checking in!

Losing a loved one is difficult at any age, but it can be especially devastating for young children. A retired teacher and resident of Mastic Beach in Suffolk County, Lisa Ockun’s new book, "Sammy the Tin Man," aims to help kids cope with the loss of a family member.
“Sammy the Tin Man,” written by Lisa Ockun and illustrated by Brandon Coleman, is available at Barnes & Noble and on amazon.com (AuthorHouse; $19.99). Courtesy Authorhouse.
Ockun drew inspiration for her 32-page book from an experience with a former student. Sammy, the book’s 10-year-old main character, is based on one of Ockun's former fifth-grade students at P.S. 162 in Bayside. After Sammy’s father passed away, the boy found solace in performing in his class’s production of The Wizard of Oz.
Sammy gave an outstanding performance that prompted his interest in the creative arts and eventually inspired him to pursue a degree in theater. Ockun, a Queens College grad with 27 years of teaching and 15 years of musical directing under her belt, is an advocate for the therapeutic effects of the creative arts in schools and argues that these programs are an integral part to our children’s education.
“Death is a part of life, and people seem afraid to discuss this subject with children,” says Ockun, who recently lost a parent. “When children face the death of a loved one, they are usually ill-prepared. I feel that music and theater can be great outlets for grieving children.”
Ockun says she hopes the book will teach kids to reach for their goals, cope with loss, and always remember that their loved ones have not completely left them.

The red rover, red rover game is a classic kids party game for children of all ages to enjoy. Make this game the highlight of your party as the kids learn listening and teamwork skills while they play.
Number of players:
8+
Activity:
Divide the children into two equal teams and have each side line up shoulder-to-shoulder and hold hands.
The two teams should be facing each other and about 6m apart.
The team starting the game selects a player from the opposing team and chants "Red rover, red rover, send (insert child's name) right over!"
Then the player who is selected will run and try to break through the hands of a section on the other team.
A successful breakthrough means that player gets to choose a player from the opposing team to join his or her team.
If that player fails to break through, he or she now becomes part of the opposing team.
The teams take turns until there is only one person left on the opposing team.

Comparision of the voice over actors who have been the voice of Hawkgirl with sound clips and images.
Hawkgirl is a main member of the Justice League and in the history of comics, she has been distinguished by two incarnations. Her first being Shiera Sanders, the girlfriend of the golden-age Hawkman, whom both believed were re-incarnated lovers. The second being Shayera Hol, a police officer from Thanagar and wife to Katar Hol, the silver-age Hawkman. Hawkgirl's main weapon of choice was a mace, made of Nth metal.

Special thanks to Jackson_H, Foxwolf, UltimateCharm for additional sound clips.
EDITOR'S OPINIONShannon Farnon, who also played Wonder Woman in The All New Super Friends Hour, also filled in for Hawkgirl. Her voice is actually very fitting for Hawkgirl, perhaps even more so than for Wonder Woman. It's firm, strong, and fits Hawkgirl's police officer persona.
Maria's light accent gives Hawkgirl that kick, to emphasize she's alien from another planet. That accent, along with her no-nonsense, take-charge, femme fatale voice fits Hawkgirl's persona as a former officer/female-wolverine type of character in the series and the character overall.
While both voices are very fitting for Hawkgirl, I have to give this one to Maria.

At the High Court in Edinburgh, Mr Clark, 77, faced questions about why he seemed to have given conflicting accounts of the scene of the crime during the past 28 years.
He told the trial that Elaine's naked body, found just yards from her Greenock home, was covered by a blanket.
But in June 2012 Mr Clark apparently told another detective there was no blanket, leading to suggestions from defence QC Donald Findlay that Mr Clark had been "fitted up" and that his statement had been fabricated.
Mr Clark also admitted that two detectives who took a disputed "confession" about a gang bang leading to the girl's death were quietly sidelined after allegations of intimidation.
Defence QC Donald Findlay challenged: "This inquiry was rotten to the core."
Mr Clark told the lawyer: "Yes, I suppose it was."
John Docherty, 49, now of Hunters' Quay, Holiday Village, Dunoon, denies murder. He claims that at the time he is alleged to have stripped and strangled Elaine he was with his parents. He further denies a charge of attacking another woman, Linda Hargie.
The trial continues..

The soul is drowning in a sea of sweet perfume and
Oh, lest we forget, the soul is human
Oh, lest we forget, the soul is human
What tangled webs we weave from idle speculation
A long, lost friend perceived the depth of her frustration
Beer bottle sweating, she sits peeling off the label

The soul is blackened...
Oh it's been so long
Since she felt this way
Yeah it's been so long
Since she felt anything

She's so deep in it, she cannot hold him too tight
The wheels are turning, she can feel them in the distance
With such sad yearning, hard to put up much resistance

Staff Writer
WINNSBORO — A new sorority of sorts has been created at the Fairfield County Career Center, a group of four girls who are taking courses such as masonry, heating and air conditioning repair, or machine tooling — skills that traditionally were considered men’s work.
These ladies challenge that notion and according to their teachers are doing just as well or better than their male classmates. This article is the first in two-part series featuring these young ladies.
Masonry
Shijetta Henry is a 17-year-old senior at Fairfield Central High School who started the career center to take health science courses. Henry thought she wanted to be a massage therapist so she chose that path. Then she saw examples of artwork that can be made from brick and realized she wanted to try something new — masonry.
“I like art and being creative and I can make things using brick,” she said.
Landscaping, colored brick work, and laying brick with people’s names in it all appeal to her but so does a more practical side to the trade.
“I can help my mom and grandma with our house if something breaks and a brick needs fixing,” she said.
Henry has an uncle who is a brick mason in Charlotte, N.C.
“He was surprised that I could help him,” she said. “He thought it was funny at first but then he saw I was serious about it.”
She said her first option for a career is to be a make-up artist. This young lady enters the career center wearing one shade of lipstick and may leave the center after her classes are done with a different shade.
She changes hair color and clothing and said she is a girly girl when she is not messing with mud, mortar and brick. She said the salary and the skill is what attracted her to masonry.
Henry said her first challenge was building up the strength to carry around the buckets of mortar and the piles of brick.
“I could get it right just like the others but it took time to learn the fast pace,” she said. “Back then I was weak and had not been lifting weights.”
Every day she got stronger as she tossed bricks and lifted barrels to make mortar.
“It’s a lot of work, but just because you are a girl does not mean you can’t do it,” she said. “You just have to encourage yourself and keep on doing it until you learn it. I want to do it because it is fun.”
She is used to working in her free time because she does a lot of volunteering in the community with her grandmother Debra McDaniel and her family, helping with activities like the back to school bash and with Christmas dinners.
“I am very tight with my family,” she said. “But I’m also a completer (meaning she finishes what she starts at the career center and in life).”
She said she became good at massage and learned to cook in culinary arts classes there. Some training came from home though. She said her sense of style and her make-up skills come from her mom, such as her trademark black, blue and purple lipstick. Henry also is considering following in her father’s footsteps and joining the Army.
Welding
Fifteen-year-old Deminic Martin first learned of welding from an older cousin who does underwater welding. But it was demonstrations during an open house at the career center that really piqued her interest in the career.
She saw demonstrations like using a torch, examples of basic welds, and saw how metal pieces can be joined into parts.
“I wanted to learn more about it after I visited the career center and saw demonstrations and the finished product,” she said.
This is not Martin’s first time working with her hands. She likes to fix cars, too, a hobby she does with her grandaddy as they work on an old pickup together.
“When I was really little, my grandaddy and I did hands-on stuff with the truck,” she said.
But, like her four classmates, she said she has been doing more than just working a wrench. She has worked out as a dancer since she was a little girl and has been a cheerleader also.
A sophomore at FCHS, Martin wants other students to realize that they do not need to limit themselves by their expectations or those imposed upon them from outsiders.
“If you feel like it is something you’d like to do, you can do it if you stick to it and are determined,” Martin said. “Some people don’t think girls can do stuff like (welding) but I am here to prove them wrong.”
She said she plans to make welding her career and is determined to show the people in her class that she has the same skill set as they have. “I want to break the mold,” she said.
Two other students, one in HVAC and the other in machine tooling courses, are looking to break the traditional mold, as well and will be featured in an upcoming issue of The Herald Independent.News Release

US Department of Labor announces $13.6 million grant to assist workers throughout Wisconsin affected by layoffs
WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a $13,614,919 grant to assist about 2,817 workers affected by layoffs at multiple companies in Wisconsin, primarily in the manufacturing sector.
"Job creation and economic recovery are this administration's top priorities. We recognize that those goals will not be realized in Wisconsin and throughout the nation until workers who have been laid off are able to quickly gain the skills and services they need to enter good jobs with real stability and opportunities for advancement," said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis.
Awarded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, this grant will be operated by the Fox Valley Workforce Development Board; the Milwaukee Area Workforce Investment Board; the North Central Wisconsin Workforce Development Board; Northwest Wisconsin CEP Inc.; the Southeast Wisconsin Workforce Development Board; the Southwest Wisconsin Workforce Development Board; Waukesha-Ozaukee-Washington Workforce Development Inc.; Workforce Connections Inc.; Workforce Development Board of South Central Wisconsin; and Workforce Resource Inc.
A number of the workers included in this grant also are certified as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance and many others are waiting for a determination on their TAA petitions. For those workers who are found eligible for TAA, this grant will provide access to "wrap-around" and supportive services, such as dependent care and transportation assistance, that are not available through the TAA program. Those workers who are not eligible for TAA will have access to the full array of training and employment-related services under this grant.
Wisconsin has experienced heavy job losses since 2007, particularly in the manufacturing sector. According to a study completed by the University of Wisconsin Center on Wisconsin Strategies, the state lost nearly 140,000 jobs 66,000 of them in manufacturing between December 2007 and July 2009.
Of the $13,614,919 announced today, $5,072,148.Wrong type of Reality TV perhaps hurting a restaurateur......new season of The Real Housewives of New Jersey
So last night the new season of The Real Housewives of New Jersey premiered and there are a few new additions to the cast which are from our neck of the woods. My wife was watching to see who she might know.......so I got "looped into" watching.
One of the new cast member husband happens to be the owner and chef of Angelo's in New York City Little Italy fame. If you are from the NJ/NY area you know Angelo's has been a staple in Little Italy, or Liltaly as it's commonly known now, for several decades. I've been there a few times and would go back if someone I knew wanted to go there.
That was until last night..........just from the one episode and the few scene's this guy was in I took a significant disliking to him. He just came across as an obnoxious, pompous ass which I wouldn't want to support in business. This show was not featuring him in his professional setting but just observing his behavior at a social gathering in a persons home, and he struck me as a jerk.
It's funny because I watch Kitchen Nightmares frequently and outside that one restaurant, Amy's Baking Company, I haven't found many of the owners to be utter assholes. Even if they were obnoxious generally it was self defense mechanism of having your failing business spotlighted on a national TV show.
This guy just seems like an ass and I wonder if any others like myself would see behavior like this and hold it against them and their business?
- re: MplsM ary
(I'm assuming you watched the episode)
Yes I know she made that excuse for him, but I can't believe they didn't know he filming was going to be going on in advance, so he didn't care enough to stay sober for it? While you are correct I don't give him a pass for that, he knew he would be facing the camera's. Just my opinion.
- re: jrvedivici
I am guessing he was really nervous and did not regulate his intake. Liquid courage and all that. He probably thinks he's hilarious when he's stoned. Now he knows better.
- re: jrvedivici
Even if he's a drunken ass at least he's not a prostitution whore.
Here's my Angelo's story....back in the 80s, soon after President Ronald Reagan ate there, I went in with my girlfriend at the time. We were seated right in front of the bar. and never handed any menus. A busboy cam over and filled our water glasses and soon after, returned with some bread. For 45 minutes, not nary another person to stop by our table...however, during this entire time, the Bartender, who was not busy was leaning with his back against the back bar in front of the cash resister and his right foot up on the sink underneath the bar...the classic bartender pose...every time I looked over at him, he stared back at me. I gestured with my head, raised my eyebrows, moved my shoulders and my hands in an attempt to get some service...order a drink and receive a menu....he just stared back at me for 20 or so minutes rarely moving from his pose.
Fed up with the neglect, I called the Busboy over, thanked him for his service, looked over at the bartender and reached into my pocket for a double sawbuck to give to the Busboy. The bartender, upon seeing this raced over from behind the bar and asked me if he could get me anything.....I told him to Fuck Off.

The Housewives franchise (NY, NJ, OC only) has been my guilty pleasure for years now. I can't comment on the owner's behavior because I had to change the channel. The newbies are so obnoxious that even I can't handle watching this new season of NJ.

Yeah, I used to like RHONY and even RHONJ a little but can't stomach any of the RH shows enough now to sit through an episode. Sorry to see the decline of Bravo in general; it started with some fun precepts, IMHO, but ran them into the ground and destroyed them by capitalizing on what they thought sold the shows, e.g., contentiousness among the actors (they clearly are actors).

"We're still looking at the legal requirements, and before we hand out any citations, we obviously want to make sure we've touched all the bases," said Water Superintendent Billy Clayton. "This is not routine for us. It's been 10 years since we've had any type of water restrictions at all. I'm having to reinvent this wheel as we go along."
Mr. Clayton said two water conservation ordinances have been drafted by the county. The first allowed residents with odd-numbered addresses to water outside on odd-numbered calendar days, and residents with even addresses to water on even days. The second water ordinance, however, restricted the hours of watering from 5 to 9 a.m. and 5 to 9 p.m. on odd/even days.
The latest ordinance was approved by the county commission at its July 7 meeting, paving the way for the county's sheriff's department to issue water citations. The citation can carry a $500 fine or up to 60 days in jail. Violators will be given one warning before they are cited. Since water restrictions began May 28, Mr. Clayton said, his department has handed out 1,750 warnings.
"Our intent and our hope was not to have to issue any citations, just to get people to conserve so we could make it through this hot time," Mr. Clayton said, "but the last thing I want to do is drag a bunch of people into court and not be on solid ground."
The extremely dry, hot weather conditions and the increase in the demand for water created the need for water conservation measures. During the aftermath of last week's storms, water use plummeted from 22 million gallons a day to 10 million gallons a day, Mr. Clayton said. But with heat indexes expected to hover around 100 this week, there's no relief in sight.
"They're talking about it getting really hot again this week with a slight chance of rain in the afternoon -- we call it a fat chance," Mr. Clayton said. "That lack of rain and searing heat will bring us right back to where we started. That's why we're not going to back off water restrictions."
Columbia County's water system is capable of handling 22 million gallons a day, and there was one stretch where demand reached the limit for a 17-day period, Mr. Clayton said.
"Our concern is when we get over that 22 million gallon a day limit ... We know that the water restrictions will work in reducing demand if people will abide by them."

Japan, Congress could find themselves at odds with White House
In spite of optimistic official rhetoric from the White House, Japan seems to be the latest speed-bump on the road to the controversial Trans Pacific Partnership trade treaty.
The treaty has been criticised for advocating criminal penalties for copyright infringement, exporting an American “big pharma” agenda on drug patents, investor-state dispute procedures allowing companies to sue governments over local regulation – and for the secrecy surrounding the treaty text.
Late in April, the Obama administration was making optimistic statements about progress on the treaty after negotiations with Japan. In a joint statement, the two countries said they had made “significant progress” on answering Japan's resistance to opening up its auto and agricultural sectors under the treaty.
However, that accord doesn't seem to be lasting. The GlobalPost reports that Japan will consider any agreement with the US nailed-down and not subject to renegotiation, even if Congress refuses to ratify the agreement as it now stands.
That story quotes senior vice minister of Japan's Cabinet Office Yasutoshi Nishimura as saying that Washington has been told “Japan will never renegotiate” the deal.
Nishimura had visited the US during early May to meet with a number of US officials and legislators, the Global Post states.
That refusal to renegotiate could prove problematic, since there are signals from Congress that lawmakers aren't happy with where the treaty now stands. In particular, according to Japanese site Mainichi, the treaty would only win Congressional approval if “if also addresses alleged currency manipulation by Japan”.
Mainichi notes that the deadline for the TPP has been pushed back to an undefined date in 2014. ®

At 33, slowed the past few years by an autoimmune disease that saps energy and hampered much of this season by a bad back, Williams knows by now that such queries are going to arrive, particularly after results such as her 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5) loss to 56th-ranked Zheng Jie on a wet Wednesday. It is the third year in a row the two-time champion is out after two rounds.
"If I didn't think I had anything in the tank, I wouldn't be here," said Williams, ranked 60th. "I feel like I do, and that's why I'm here."
On a day rain began falling in the early afternoon, jumbling the schedule, Tampa resident James Blake's career ended shortly after midnight with a five-set loss to Ivo Karlovic of Croatia, 6-7 (2-7), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2).
"I don't know when it's going to hit me," said Blake, 33, who announced this week he would retire after the U.S. Open. "I don't think I'll be sleeping much tonight."
Defending champion Andy Murray did not play his first point of the tournament until 9:55 p.m., making for the third-latest start to a U.S. Open night session. But he wasn't on the court long, beating unseeded Michael Llodra 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 in about an hour and 40 minutes.
Murray's match began in Arthur Ashe Stadium only after 2009 champion Juan Martin del Potro wrapped up a contentious 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) victory over 74th-ranked Guillermo Garcia-Lopez that stretched more than four hours.
Del Potro was irked by his opponent's repeated calls for a trainer to treat his left leg, and Garcia-Lopez kicked a towel and got into an argument with the chair umpire over a ruling to replay a point in the closing tiebreaker.
With men playing in the first round and women in the second, rain delays caused eight women's singles matches to be postponed, including defending champion Serena Williams' match against Galina Voskoboeva.
Venus Williams acquitted herself well for stretches, erasing deficits until she simply ran out of solutions against Zheng, a former top-15 player and twice a major semifinalist.
"I just kept trying to fight," Venus said.
The matched lasted for 3 hours, 2 minutes, tying for the fifth-longest women's match since 1970 at the U.S. Open. The third set alone lasted 11/2 hours.
Near the finish line, Venus faltered. On the final two points, she missed a volley, then a return. She wound up with 44 unforced errors in all.New Orleans -- The waiter pours an inch of Blackstone Napa Merlot into a plastic cup and offers it to me. I swish it around. "Very good."

When my Goodreads Book Update came via email (with the big headline: You’ve completed 0 books of your 25 book goal for 2013) I felt book readers everywhere mentally stone me for my laziness. Fortunately its summertime which just feels like book-reading season (you would think wintertime would be, but I’m using summertime as my excuse to make it look better, is it working?)
For the past 3mos. my Women’s Bible Study group at my church has been studying Beth Moore’s, “A Woman’s Heart: God’s Dwelling Place”. It’s super-hard to do an actual “book report” over this because it’s a study-guide (like a text-book) & very personal, full of devotion’s & questions for you to answer about your own life & where you are on your walk with Christ. I wasn’t sure how to review this study, but in the end the only way I know how to review it is by (trying) to put into words how this study has changed my own personal view on specific things.
Beth Moore opens the study by letting you know that she prayed for you! Y.O.U. (and me) she prays that God pours His Spirit onto those going through this study & that He meets us where we need him too. I’ve done devotionals before, but this is the first time I’ve ever read that the author PRAYED for its readers, right away I knew this was going to be a rough study to get through. It consists of 10 sessions with 5 Days in each session; every night you’re supposed to read a “day” & answer the accompanying questions. Then at the end of the sessions, there is an hour long video viewer guide where Beth Moore wraps up all 5 sessions into a lecture (sermon-style). Its certainly a lot of work! Upon completion I felt the same accomplished feeling I got when I finished an intense semester of college!
She takes you through the story of Moses (post-freeing the Israelites) into the building of God’s Tabernacle & why that is the foundation of God dwelling inside all of us. Based in the study of Bible Scripture (mostly in the chapters of Exodus) she guides you step-by-step through the idea (the Garden of Eden), Moses’ building the Tabernacle, the hierarchy of leaders appointed, the fallout, the birth of Jesus-his life & death, the tabernacle in present times & ends the study by how the book of Revelation views the future of the Tabernacle. In case you’re unfamiliar with what the “Tabernacle” is, in a nutshell: its’ God’s Dwelling Place! His “home” on Earth.
Heavy stuff!
Like I said earlier, I can’t break the study down because its very individualized. What stood out to me is going to be different than what stood out to another person doing the study. What was apparent throughout this study, however, was that God met us where we needed to be met.
For me, there was two very big chapters that stood out to me. The first one was Session 6, The Heart of a
Servant; the outside structure of the Tabernacle had been built & now the decorating of the inside has begun (of course a chapter on “decorating” would naturally be one of my favorites!
). The Altar of Incense is introduced in this session. I’m going to try to explain this in the easiest way that I’ve come to know what it means: the altar of incense signifies intercession. It signifies Christ (who hasn’t been born yet) interceding our prayers to God on our behalf! It’s about offering up prayers, fragrant worship, unto God. It’s about getting past “issues” & asking for help. It’s about knowing & fully believing that God hears our prayers, that’s what the Altar of Incense is, it symbolizes prayer. One of the biggest lessons I learned in the viewer’s guide session was when Beth Moore said, “Don’t think your prayers are unanswered, they are never unanswered. Your prayer is answered the second you pray for it, but the time for the answer to be revealed to you will be in God’s timing when you’re ready to see it.” It hit me hard because the night before I watched this session I had wrote down in my journal that I was “giving up”on a prayer that had been on my heart for awhile. And just that morning the word, “Obedience” kept ringing through my head when I was dragging ass about going to Bible Study because I felt so defeated & was racking my brain to come up with an excuse why I couldn’t make it to class. That message was for me that day, that message was what God wanted me to hear to let me know my answer will be revealed (probably when I quit whining about it!).
The second session that really hit me hard was (coincidentally) the following week (I guess God was really telling me to pay attention those weeks!). It was
Session 7: A Heart that Intercedes.This chapter was about the leaders, the priesthood, that God appointed for His Tabernacle & how Jesus Christ is the ultimate intercessor, the ultimate great-high priest. I had never thought about Jesus as an “intercessor” on my behalf before, how he actually talks to his father (God) about me! How awesome is that! To think that my silly little prayers are being discussed about & a plan is being shaped to answer prayers that I’ve prayed. I can just picture me in my bedroom praying for something that’s weighing on my heart, Jesus is hanging out at the sports bar with God, drinking some Guinness (because you know they’re dark-beer drinkers) watching some Ohio State football & says, “Dad, Carey’s bugging me about this…again! How do you want handle it? Seriously, she’s getting on my nerves. Let’s make this happen…soon!” I just love that! LOVE THAT! To think that God puts thought into EVERYTHING concerning my life & nothing is made in haste, no decision, is ever made in haste when it comes to the fulfillment of God’s plan for my life. That even the times I’ve screwed up, that I expressed free-will on my own life, God still allowed that mistake to happen if it fit into his greater plan for my life. I don’t know about you, but that makes me look at some of my past mistakes & think, “yeah, that sucked. It was painful, it was a tough lesson, but it really will get me to a greater destiny.”
So there ya go! That’s my review on Beth Moore: A Woman’s Heart, God’s Dwelling Place. It was a little jumbled, a little all over the place, at times painful to get through…but so worth it. I learned a lot through this Bible Study on God’s relationship with those he holds in high esteem & to think that I’m one of them, that’s kind of a cool thought. It would be a tough Bible Study to get through if you wanted to do it on your own because so much is geared towards discussion points & getting insight from others, but you could do it. I definitely recommend getting this Bible Study going in your own home church (or even if you want to start a Bible Study with friends…try this one out!). It’s so worth it!

There are so many things wrong with this system. The reality is 1) teacher prep programs can't really prepare their graduates to do the job because you only figure it out in the crucible of the classroom 2) most new teachers will admit they more or less suck, but improve their practice with time and experience and 3)99.9% of teachers are caring people who want to do a good job.
The observations are largely meaningless because the observer "sees what they want to see," and slants the observation accordingly. Furthermore, people don't learn in conditions of fear. Although there are now four categories (ineffective, developing, effective, and highly effective) teachers categorized as developing are at risk of losing their job. The reality is that most new teachers are "developing." What they need is support: a strong curriculum, professional development, and chances to collaborate with more experienced peers in order to improve their practice. Furthermore, the observations tie up the principals and divert them from management of the school.
Our principal has told us he does not want to hear the "o" word. We are all overwhelmed.
The debate on whether it is fair to use student test scores to evaluate teachers should be ended by acknowledging the fact that student test scores are not an accurate indicator of teacher effectiveness. The American Education Research Association and the American Statistical Association have both issued statements saying that using student test scores to assess teachers is neither valid nor reliable. You can only compare teachers on the basis of student scores if every teacher has comparable students, which is impossible. Student scores are affected by home background, what was learned in earlier grades, each student's temperament and ability, the school's resources and atmosphere, and a host of factors beyond the control of the teacher.
This principal is going above and beyond, spending more than two hours in this classroom in order to make a thorough evaluation. But principals/administrators are required only to spend 15 min per observation, and that's what most will do. That seems patently unfair to teachers -- how likely is it that a teacher will be displaying competency in all 22 (or 8) criteria during those particular 15 minutes? It's also worth taking a close look at the 8 criteria -- do they actually describe what makes for effective teaching? Do these criteria allow for the fact that different teaching approaches can be equally effective, depending on the teacher and the students? Follow up, please!!!
Isn't it more correct to say, "The number of criteria ... is overwhelming," rather than "amount of criteria"?Programs of Study Home | Programs of Study | Transferring Credits | Transfer Guides Transfer Guides Transfer guides with other institutions Institution Guide Link Specific Information Ashford University Transfer Guide Bellevue University Transfer Guide Bryan College of Health Sciences Transfer Guide Academic Programs Chadron State College Transfer Guide College of St. Mary's Transfer Guide Concordia University Transfer Guide Doane College Transfer Guide Kansas State University Transfer Guide Transfer Student Calendar and Checklist Equivalency Help Midland University Transfer Guide Nebraska Methodist College Transfer Guide Nebraska Wesleyan Transfer Guide WebAdvisor Click OK.

Born on January 10th to six-time mom Mandara, the newborn appears to be doing well. In these timely pictures (first shot and video courtesy of the Smithsonian Institute and Sarah Taylor, second 2 pics by Jonathan L. Kang) the precious babe is seen snuggling in beaming mom's arms.
On January 10, a western lowland gorilla
was born at the Zoo's Great Ape House to 26-year-old Mandara and
16-year-old Baraka. The newborn represents the seventh successful
gorilla birth for the Zoo since 1991. Both mother and baby appear to be
doing well.
The newborn joins siblings Kigali, Kwame and Kojo, as well as group member Haloko at the Great Ape House. All of the Zoo’s gorillas will remain on exhibit.
This newborn is the sixth offspring for Mandara. The baby’s sex has not yet been determined. More photos and updates will be posted as they become available. A video is available below.
The gorilla birth is significant for the Zoo. Western lowland gorillas, which are native to tropical forests of West and Central Africa, are listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching. The Zoo participates in the Species Survival Plan for gorillas, in which North American zoos collaborate to encourage the development of a self-sustaining zoo gorilla population that is both genetically diverse and demographically stable, helping to ensure the survival of this endangered species.![endif]-->
Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Days before Arizona's controversial law targeting illegal immigration takes effect, demonstrators are finalizing their plans to descend upon the state capital to show their support for or opposition to the measure.
The protests will include busloads of labor union members from Los Angeles who oppose Senate Bill 1070 because they believe it promotes racial profiling,
They plan to dare law enforcement in Phoenix, Arizona, to put SB 1070 to the test, according to Maria Elena Durazo, one of the organizers of the rally.
"We will not be carrying 'papers,' " said Durazo, of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. "We will let them know we are coming, and we will tell them: Arrest us for being brown or black, arrest us for being suspicious."
The protesters include immigrant students, religious leaders, day laborers and members of several unions including the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the Teamsters and the Utility Workers of America Union.
But not all Latinos oppose Arizona's law, which takes effect Thursday.
Poll: One in four Americans angry over illegal immigration
Jesse Hernandez is a member of the Arizona Republican Latino Association, a group that supports SB 1070 and opposes the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit challenging it.
Hernandez said Arizona's law does nothing more than federal law already allows. He believes Durazo and her "left-wing" supporters are simply misinformed.
"They throw out this verbiage, racist, discrimination, Nazis -- they're just trying to drum up fear among the public," Hernandez said. "We live in a society that doesn't read anymore, that is spoon-fed by TV. That's why I'm challenging them to pick up the law and read it and not believe the rhetoric that is coming out from the left."
iReport: Tell us what you think
Section 2 of SB 1070 states that law enforcement cannot stop a person for the sole purpose of determining immigration status. An officer can inquire about immigration status only if a person is stopped or detained on suspicion of another crime, and if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is in the U.S. illegally.
Many, like Hernandez, believe that section guards against racial profiling.
Read what others think about immigration reform
But immigrant rights activist Angelica Salas dismisses that, citing the aggressive and controversial immigration enforcement by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
"We're telling you about what we know, we've seen it over and over again," said Salas, who represents the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.
"Don't tell us what's true and what's not when we know what we have seen and the consequence of racial profiling in Maricopa County for years," she said.
"And what Sheriff Joe is doing is now sanctioned by the state of Arizona."
Arpaio -- who calls himself "America's toughest sheriff" -- has ignited controversy for his sweeps of illegal immigrants using a federal program called 287(g) that allows local law enforcement to be cross-trained by the Department of Homeland Security and work in immigration enforcement.
Salas will be heading to Phoenix along with Durazo and the other busloads of protesters this week.
There have been three court hearings to consider challenges to the Arizona law, including one from the Department of Justice. To date, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton has yet to rule on the law's fate.

Re: FCC Opens Public Comments On State Laws Banning ...
I guess my question is... why AREN'T municipalities allowed to start up or expand their own broadband internet service offerings? The only possible argument I can see against this is that a municipality is then competing with a corporation and this is a conflict of interest. This is laughable, given that the likes of Comcast, TWC, and others do their damnedest to kill any competition and actively go out of their way to avoid each other, winking and nodding from across their boundaries as they split up the country. Guess when the shoe is on the other foot, they don't find it quite so amusing.
Re: FCC Opens Public Comments On State Laws Banning ...
For the same kind of reasons why they aren't normally allowed to open up their own gas stations or grocery stores for the public to purchase product from them, to prevent the local/state/federal government from impeding on private business competitiveness.
Of course, companies like Shell, Walmart, Comcast, and Starbucks kinda took out their competition and thus the need to be competitive themselves without the government's (direct?) help. And they need, whether they think it or not, someone to come into the picture to give them a reason to offer better services and jobs.
Edit: also, on top of the reason I gave, companies have managed to convince politician to get laws enacted that prevents any sort of loopholes that the government could say let the towns have the power to run their own service. It isn't like they're going to beable to compete in terms of speeds that companies like Comcast and what not could be offering. Though if a town does manages to do that, either
A, the town has a lot of money to be spending on this kind of thing. Or
B, maybe the companies aren't respecting the customers enough to get them up to speed for modern times.
Eitherway, this is something that can be used as a form of competition for those companies that hold a monopoly in areas, that have no desire or incentive to expand the area's capabilities. live in one of the poorer counties in north Carolina and just before that stupid law was passed the town was working on free broadband for the neediest school kids in the county and of course they get fucked over by whorish politicians selling their votes to corporations.

Sherlock BBC Fanfic
Molly had always known that there was very little she wouldn't do for Sherlock Holmes. She'd known it even when he'd informed her of Jim being gay, and she'd known it at that horrible Christmas party months later. It wasn't just her hopeless crush on him. It was loyalty.
John Watson had made conscious effort to bring those few people involved in Sherlock's life together. Molly was, to her own surprise, glad of John's friendship. Truth be told, she had been quite jealous of him at first – still was in some ways. She'd been there for Sherlock for years without any appreciation, but John waltzed into his life without any preamble and immediately became his friend. Molly had been more than a little envious of the seemingly instantaneous bond he'd formed with the Consulting Detective.
But John had been perfectly gentlemanly about the whole thing. The Christmas party, however atrocious Sherlock's behavior had been, had served almost as an induction into a group that spent their lives around Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson was such a sweet old lady, endlessly patient with Molly's bumbling attempts at conversation. Detective Inspector Lestrade – who insisted she call him Greg – was very quickly becoming a good friend. He was quick to supply sarcastic comebacks for Sherlock's typical bluntness, and was surprisingly quick at welcoming Molly into the small family of officers at Scotland Yard.
She had a feeling John'd had something to do with that, but she didn't mind. For the first time in a long time, she had friends beyond Sherlock. Anderson of course was rather condescending on a girl with a crush on Sherlock, and Sally was almost annoying in her attempts to warn her away from Sherlock, but the rest of them were at least tolerant of Molly, if not outright friendly. Lestrade, Dimmock, Gregson, and young Stanley Hopkins were particularly close friends to Molly in the months after that Christmas party. As coroner for most of the Yard's cases, Molly was able to win their respect professionally and on a personal level, and for the first time since grade school, she found herself feeling comfortable in a group of friends.
And then there was Sherlock. For all that Molly's life had changed, some things stayed the same. Sherlock was still insufferable, rude, and blunt, and Molly still felt herself stammering like an idiot around him. But something had changed between them. Molly had, with John's help, began to actually get to know the detective. She learned who he was past his emotionless mask. Maybe he didn't appreciate her any more than before, but Molly was there for him anyway. If she couldn't be his girlfriend, then at least she would be his friend, even if he never knew. Loyalty was all she could give him.
Which is why, when he came to her, a fugitive accused of murder, she didn't hesitate.
Greg kept telling her not to let Sherlock walk all over her. He seemed to think that she did what she did for Sherlock out of hopeless romantic devotion. That wasn't entirely true. If there had been any doubt in her that Sherlock wasn't innocent, she would have turned him away, crush or no crush. But she knew him better than that. She knew he was innocent, he was scared, and he needed help. It didn't matter that he was rude and obnoxious. He was, underneath it all, a good person. So Molly would help in any way she could.
After all, that's what friends were for. Laura, Sammy, and Missy had taught her that.
She gave him what he needed for his faked suicide, and afterward she helped him get set up in a small flat near her own place. Molly wasn't sure how long he was planning on staying there or what his plans were for his unusual afterlife. All she knew was that she'd keep on helping him as long as he needed it.
That job didn't come without its consequences. Sherlock had affected more lives than he realized. Mrs. Hudson put up a brave face whenever Molly happened by, chatting away about things that had nothing to do with Sherlock, as if that would make things better. Lestrade, for all his gruffness, seemed very subdued after his consultant jumped. His smiles didn't quite reach his eyes anymore. The rest of the Yard was of a mixed mind about the whole thing. The general consensus seemed to be yes, he was a pain in the rear, but things almost seemed too quiet with him gone. Even Sally didn't take any pleasure in being "right" about Sherlock's lies. The first time Molly saw her after the fall, Sally had looked at her with a quiet expression, pity replacing scorn in her eyes. "I'm sorry," was all she said. As she looked at the sergeant in surprise, Molly realized that through all those times Sally had warned her to stay away from Sherlock, the officer really had been just trying to help her from being hurt.
It was the start of an unusual friendship, but one Molly was glad for, as Sally was one of the few friends Molly didn't feel bad about lying to.
Then there was John. Molly couldn't even look at the man anymore. The doctor was trying to pass off as being fine, but his eyes had taken on a permanent look of utter, soul-crushing grief. It was almost chilling how broken he was. The man who had first insisted on Sherlock's friends becoming acquainted now avoided them as much as possible. Molly was almost grateful for it – every time she saw him, saw how hurting he was, she very nearly gave into the urge to tell him everything. But she couldn't. It was too dangerous.
Molly was alone in her flat a few weeks after the fall. She was enjoying the sound of the rain pouring heavily outside when her front door opened without a warning. She nearly jumped a foot in the air at the unexpected creak it made. In waltzed a lean figure in a rain-soaked coat and scarf that Molly almost couldn't imagine him without.
The coroner relaxed now that she knew she wasn't about to be murdered by one of Moriarty's men. "Oh, Sherlock. Um, hi. What are you...?" She let the question trail off as she got a proper look at the detective. His face was gaunter than usual, his high cheekbones casting almost frightful shadows on his too-pale face. The coat seemed to hug his frame more tightly than before. Molly had to physically stop herself from gaping. The Consulting Detective's health had depleted alarmingly fast. "Are... are you alright? Er, do you need anything?"
Sherlock impatiently brushed his wet locks out of his face. "The question grows tiresome, Molly," he snapped in an uncharacteristically sharp tone. Sherlock was always blunt, but never sharp. He flung his sopping wet coat on the ground near the closet, stormed over to the chair opposite the couch where Molly sat, and flung himself down into it with an almost childish slouch. "I need to talk to you about the fake grave. You're sure no one will realize I'm not in it?"
Again? It wasn't like Sherlock to harp on details he was already sure about. "Oh. Um, well I've been keeping an eye on the hospital's records, and no one seems to have..." She trailed off as Sherlock's expression grew increasingly irritable. Molly leaned forward hesitantly. "Um, Sherlock? We went over this already." She let her tone ask the question she didn't dare to ask. Why are you really here?
Sherlock glared at her for a few moments before slumping back in his chair. "'M bored," came his muffled response.
Molly almost wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all. Bored? What'd he want her to do, juggle? Taking care of him in his destructive boredom had been John's job. She definitely hadn't signed on for this.
The coroner sighed. "What about all those books I brought you?"
"Dull." Sherlock groaned. "I finished them all. Next time, I'd appreciate if you left out those useless romance novels."
"There has to be something on the telly or online or... something." Molly had absolutely no idea what Sherlock was expecting from her. She'd never had to play Entertain The Detective before – most times he came to her was when he was being entertained by a case. Her admiration for John for putting up with this on a daily basis was growing steadily.
Sherlock lifted his head and glared at her with the sullenness of a child in a tantrum. "Please use the head on your shoulders before you speak. I cannot use the internet since both my phone and my laptop were confiscated by Moriarty's people, nor would it be advisable seeing as any activity online would immediately be noticed."
Most people would be fighting back by now, but Sherlock's swift speech always left Molly kind of dazed. "Oh. Er, right." She looked around her flat as if that would give her the inspiration she needed. "I don't know, what do you and John normally do?"
Sherlock flinched at the name of his flatmate, and Molly finally understood. Ohh... "Is this... are you here because you miss John?" she asked gently.
The Consulting Detective let out a contemptuous snort that didn't really have any feeling behind it. "I don't miss anyone," he articulated, his expression
Molly noticed the weariness in Sherlock's face and knew she was right. Quietly she asked, "Have you seen him recently?"
Sherlock turned away, not meeting Molly's eyes. "This morning," he admitted in a flat tone. "He... didn't look good."
The coroner remembered how John had looked when she'd last seen him and couldn't argue with his assessment. "Have you considered telling him you're alive?" When Sherlock turned to look at her she quickly tried to backtrack. "Not, you know, directly, I know how dangerous that is, but maybe just give him a hint? I don't know, maybe leave him a secret note or something?"
Pain flashed in the detective's eyes. "I can't. If Moriarty's men get any hint I'm alive, or see any change in John's behavior, they'll kill him. I... can't let that happen." Sherlock seemed scared of his own declaration, but there was no mistaking the steely look in his eyes when he'd mentioned John being killed.
Molly had never been entirely sure of what the bond was between Sherlock and John. Now she realized that Sherlock wasn't sure either. All she knew was that it was killing Sherlock as much to simply be apart from John as it was killing John to think Sherlock dead. There was nothing she could say or do to ease the detective's grief over losing his friend.
Molly got to her feet. "I'll, uh, go make some tea then, shall I?" Nothing she could do would really do anything, but maybe some warm tea after coming in from the rain would at least make things feel a little brighter.
It took exactly two minutes for Molly to realize her mistake. Footsteps sounded from the living room, leading into her bedroom. Oh shit. Leaving Sherlock alone in a room was practically invitation to let him wander wherever he wanted. The coroner rushed hurriedly to her room. "Wait, Sherlock, don't..."
It was too late. Sherlock was standing by her dresser, where she put her skates during the week. One white leather skate was sitting out innocently on the wood surface. The other was in Sherlock's hand, undergoing the detective's scrutiny. Oh god, why didn't I put them back in the bag? Molly berated herself.
Sherlock turned to face her, his expression a mix of frustration, surprise, and perhaps even a hint of anger. "You're an ice skater." It was a statement, not a question, yet it seemed to be asking one all the same. iHow did I not know?/i
Molly shifted uneasily. Her skate was being balanced precariously on its back on the palm of Sherlock's hand. All too easily she could imagine it tumbling to the ground, it or whoever its blade hit getting hurt in the process. "Sherlock, could you-" The skate wobbled and her temper flared. "Just put that down!"
Surprise flared in the detective's eyes at her unusual show of anger, but he set the skate down without protest. He opened his mouth to say something, but Molly cut him off. "No, just... just listen, okay?" Something in her tone made Sherlock listen for once. "Don't you dare say anything. I know how you feel about sports and things, but just don't. Alright?"
Her burst of anger and self-righteousness was faltering. Defensive now, she crossed her arms over her chest. "I started skating when I was nine. I was pretty shy, but I found my first friends at my local rink. Skating's important to me. It's the reason I know how to be a friend, and most of my favorite memories are of being on the ice. I was really alone before I found skating." She took a deep breath, the truth of her own words steeling her for what came next. "I know you don't really care about sentimental things like that, but if you make fun of my sport, I will throw you back out in the rain." She meant it. There was a lot she could take, but if he was willing to make fun of something that important to her, she wasn't going to stand for it.
Sherlock looked almost dumbfounded. His gaze flitted over her in his customary, information-gathering scan. The slightest hint of a grin twitched on his lips. "Wouldn't think of it." He turned back to the skates, picking one up with far more care. "Leather worn, at least one year old, with more creasing around the ankle on this foot, so clearly it bears more weight than the other, so presumably it's the foot you land on for jumps. Scuff marks around the toe suggest..."
The detective continued with his deductions, but Molly hardly heard him. All she felt was relief. Sherlock had found out about her skating, and he hadn't made a single derogatory comment, despite his usual contempt for sports and dancing. In fact, he seemed almost fascinated with what he was learning from Molly's skates. Something to distract him from not being with John.
Molly leaned against the door frame, allowing herself a relieved smile. Her two worlds had crossed over and n catastrophe had taken place. Sherlock had accepted it, so why not her other friends? She could invite Greg to skate with her sometime. It's be worth it to see the normally competent leader slipping and stumbling while she glided past. Or maybe John'd find some of her old figure skating injury stories funny. Heck, maybe Sally would like coming to the rink sometime. The point was she didn't have to live two lives anymore. She had one whole, worthwhile life. Friends, family, and a sport she loved. All of them together.
Maybe I could call up Sammy, Laura, and Missy,/i she thought to herself. Maybe we won't ever be as close as we used to be, but that doesn't mean I never have to see them again.
As she listened to Sherlock's deductions, Molly resolved to do just that.
This chapter turned out way, way longer than I meant it to, but whatever. So another story finished. I promised it would be a short one.
So, as you could probably guess from the story, I am both a Johnlock and a Hoopstrade shipper. I tried to hint at both relationships without actually going into them. Mostly because I want this story to correspond with canon. That's why I made the mentions of how Sherlock faked the Fall and what he did after it as vague as possible.
I find the idea of Molly being kind of adopted by Scotland Yard adorable. And somehow I could see her and Sally being friends. Odd friends to be sure, especially whenever Sherlock's in the room, but still friends.
And does anyone else find the idea of Molly skating rings around a wall-clinging Lestrade utterly adorable?
Also, writing dialogue for Sherlock is way harder than it really should be.Co.Design
BMW's DriveNow App Outsmarts Zipcar
Everyone loves ZipCar, that handy service for urbanites who need to rent a car for quicky errands rather than whole days at a time. But just like every other damn thing, Europe seems to do this idea slightly better. BMW just launched a service in Munich called DriveNow, which is just like ZipCar — except instead of trundling to obscure garages, you can pick up and drop off the cars anywhere on the street. Oh, and every car is a BMW or Mini Cooper. Check it out, and prepare to be jealous:
Zipcar users know that the main irritant is having to schlep to the nearest garage that houses the vehicles — and having to go all the way back when you're done, which drastically limits how you can use the cars. (No commuting, and forgetting getting from A to B; instead, it's A to B to A.) With DriveNow, you just pick your Beemer up off the street, and when you're done, leave it wherever you happen to be — no "returning" necessary. And, of course, you find your DriveNow car in the first place the same way you find everything these days: via a dedicated location-aware smartphone app. That way, wherever you are (in Munich, that is), you can fire up the DriveNow app and find the nearest "ultimate driving machine" to help you get your grocery shopping done or whatever. Thus, if you're ever stuck in a situation where you unexpectedly need a car, you can get one.
BMW has also cooked up some small but innovative additions to car-sharing business as usual. First, the fact that a DriveNow subscriber can convert their normal driver's license into a digital "key" to unlock the DriveNow cars is total genius — that's one less extra card to worry if you have with you whenever the urge to motor strikes. Second, not only is fuel included, but parking is free in city limits, too. (In Munich, it pays to be one of the city's largest and most famous companies.)
According to GOOD, the initial fleet of 300 cars should be enough to keep Munich residents motoring, at a better-than-taxi rate of 29 cents per minute. (Don't forget: that includes parking. Sweet, sweet parking.) If this pilot program goes well, maybe BMW will port it over to the U.S. Hell, if I'm going to make a run to the Fairway Market (New Yorkers: you know what I'm talkin' about), I might as well do it in a luxury car that I can dump anywhere on my block when I get home!

When low on gas it is recognized by DriveNow and the Service will refuel it.
Customers may refuel, too with the included paycards. They get free minutes for refueling.
what happens when you drop the car off low on gas? is this recognized by DriveNow and the car made unavailable?
amazing nonetheless...Jonathan Glashow

This is a question new media creators are going to have deal with. Filming and streaming live without disclosing it is not cool. Alpha Geek called the Justin.TV folks and asked for advice, seems form the call that they did not have much advice to give.
Alpha geek made a make-shift sign that said he was recording and streaming live. But this does not solve the problem that people are still being recorded without their knowledge and when people have paid to go to a private event and their conversations are being recorded then this is a real issue.

any word on finalist for the WBB job at NDSU?
No finalists yet, Gene Taylor said on Monday still trimming the field down.
This question was asked like 5 times in the chat. Read please
Tell me more about Evan Wessenberg and Jake Showalter ? Size, weight, position and where from.
Wesenberg is 6’7, 190 lbs; Showalter is 6’2, 175 each from Germantown, Wisconsin
weight doesnt matter
I am wondering why NDSU didn’t recruit Tanner Kretchman? He is a steal for MSUM. Woodside was small so his being under 6′ shouldn’t count against him. I heard Saul never talked to him, Local talent is always a great draw for better crowds and Tanner can flat out shoot! Big mistake by the Bison Coaching staff.
How many times does this need to be discussed. Old news, Kretchman is going to MSUM. NDSU has a couple of 6′ plus all-state guards from Wisconsin that signed way last fall.
Winning brings people out to the games.
Unfortunately the Bison are pretty set with guards and the need is for big’s. Just the way it is when you only have 13 spots.
If Kretchman was D-I talent, why isn’t he going to GF or Brookings or Vermillion?
Doesnt mean we didnt have interest in him. We already have been on these guards for a few years
Does anyone connected even know if Mike Jewett HAS interest in the NDSU job? I get that he’d be an ideal candidate but, and this tells you how far our gig has fallen, a the top assistant for a very good mid major, he might be able to do better. That and if Minnesota has a chance to get Johnston I’m sure he’d rather stay and get promoted to a program that’s far better right now.
I agree if Johnson goes to UM he will either take Jewitt with him or Jewitt would be promoted to HC at SDSU. Not real sure if he’d be interested in the NDSU job anyway. I think Dorn is a real deterrent to a quality coach. Her handling of some of the recent situations does not instill confidence in me and I’m sure candidates are seeing the same.There is a $2 off One A Day Vitamins, any printable coupon available that should make for a good deal on vitamins.

Under an exchange agreement established with the University of Passau in Germany in 1986, USA is able to grant to a qualified student the opportunity for study abroad during each academic year (November-July) and to provide a similar opportunity for a visiting student from Passau.
QUALIFICATIONS AND APPLICATION
Although the exchange is open to all full-time South Alabama students regardless of major, priority will be given to German majors. The successful applicant will have a cumulative G.P.A. of 2.5 or better, proficiency in German equivalent to two years of college study, and U.S. citizenship. Additional information and application forms are available from the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, HUMB 322 (460-6291). Completed applications for the upcoming academic year should be submitted to the Head of the German section (Dr. Roddy) by February 15, and the winner will be announced by April 3
CREDIT GRANTED TO USA STUDENTS FOR WORK DONE IN PASSAU
A. Students must complete the degree requirements for general education and their major and minor as outlined in the appropriate bulletin. Since the curriculum at a German university is quite different and the transfer of equivalent courses difficult, students are advised to complete their requirements (except in German) before going to Passau, or they should plan to spend at least a semester at USA upon their return. Whenever possible, students should also complete university residency requirements for upper-division course work before going abroad.
B. Before leaving for Passau, students should fill out a Transient-Student approval form. If the course schedule for the next semester at Passau has not yet arrived, students should nonetheless fill out an approximate plan which can be modified once precise courses are known. This process is also required in order to have financial aid approved for the year in advance. Students should meet with one of the German professors at USA as well as their advisor to plan their study abroad. At mid-year they should also contact these professors for additional advice.
projects, and/or tests; and various other types of classes. Instead of a transcript maintained by the registrar's office, German students receive a Schein (certificate) from the instructor of each seminar and certain other types of courses which they present when they are ready to register for their intermediate or final comprehensive exams (after approximately four or eight semesters).
To get credit at the University of South Alabama for work done at Passau, students should save all Scheine that they receive (be sure to make additional copies, but bring the original back for presentation to the registrar here). For courses that do not issue such statements (and even for ones that do), you should have the instructor fill out and sign USA's form (headed Universität Passau or University of Passau). If the instructor fills out the German version, the Department of Foreign Languages can translate it. The registrar would like to have the instructor submit the form directly to Dr. Harry Roddy in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.
In addition, students should save all syllabuses, course descriptions, work that has been submitted in Passau as part of the course, notes taken for lectures, and any other pertinent material. They should also make lists of readings done for courses, especially lectures. This will aid the Foreign Language Department and the Registrar in evaluating the work done. The orientation course in German as a Foreign Language may also be eligible for credit, so the appropriate materials should be collected for this course as well.

Such a failure, however, is no cause for complacency. CEDAW matters. The American ratification of CEDAW has been decades in waiting and in such time the global relevance and importance of CEDAW has increased. Reports, statistics, and news articles on CEDAW abound, and the overwhelming conclusion is positive. CEDAW is the single most comprehensive human rights tool that outlines the full spectrum of women’s equal rights. It has also proved practical, translating into concrete change, be it legal, political, social, or cultural, in countries all over the world.
The US has not forgotten CEDAW, as is has proven itself pivotal in bringing about landmark change for the betterment of women and girls all over the world. CEDAW passed through the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994 and again in 2002, both times never making it to a vote in Senate Treaty No. 96-53. November 2010, marked the first time CEDAW had a Senate hearing scheduled in eight years. The witness testimony one can read online shows resounding American support for CEDAW. President Obama, Vice-President Biden, Secretary of State Clinton, and Senator Boxer, to name a few of the many CEDAW supporters in the Administration and Congress, have been public CEDAW advocates.
CEDAW matters in advancing the full recognition and protection of women’s and girls’ human rights. This has been recognized by the current Administration and select members of Congress, and so what about you?
Senator Kerry, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), has yet to schedule a SFRC hearing on CEDAW. The scheduling of a SFRC hearing would allow for CEDAW to come up for a vote in the SFRC, bringing it one step closer to ratification. We need an SFRC hearing on CEDAW now, as the longer CEDAW remains invisible without a hearing the less likely is its passage this congressional session.
What you can do as a belated Mother’s Day gift is to share CEDAW:
- SIGN THE PETITION calling for CEDAW to be ratified in the United States.
- Learn more about CEDAW at the CEDAW Taskforce website
- Don’t let this be the last time you think about CEDAW today. Read about it, talk about it, write about it, blog about it!
- If you are a student, visit “CEDAW: Students for U.S. Ratification,” on Facebook and learn about what other students are doing to raise awareness about CEDAW in their communities.
CEDAW matters and Mother’s Day is an occasion to remember that and to act on behalf of the all the women and girls in your life by calling for CEDAW ratification in the US!

Since June of 2010, American University students and administrators have been working on a grant application that, if accepted by the Department of Justice, would provide $300,000 to go towards resources for preventing sexual assault and supporting survivors. Seventeen campus offices, three community organizers, and the entire undergraduate senate approved this grant and all of its provisions.
Part of the proposal provided for mandatory sexual assault prevention trainings for all new students. Students would have multiple opportunities throughout their first semester to complete the training. If they failed to complete the training by the end of this period, a stop would be placed on their registration until they fulfilled the requirement.
Although this enforcement is required by the DOJ for grant approval, Vice President of the Office of Campus Life, Dr. Gail Hanson took issue with mandating educational programming (because that’s not what college is all about, or anything), and refused to sign the grant. According to committee members and students Quinn Pregliasco and Leigh Ellis, Hanson had expressed concerns over the stops in October, but had given her approval and urged the committee to move forward. Her refusal to let the proposal go forward came just days before the application deadline (March 31st).
As an American University student and a survivor of sexual assault, this is a crushing blow. It seems as though Dr. Hanson is valuing the comfort of some students, those who do not wish to complete the training, over the safety of others.
I am encouraged by the support our community has demonstrated in the wake of this news. Last night, around 50 students met to discuss the situation. Hanson attended the event and continued to discourage students, stating that there was no way she would change her mind on the grant.
Our community refuses to let the administration sidestep the issue and avoid acknowledging what we all know: sexual assault is real, it happens frequently, and students need advocates. We have decided to continue pushing for resources and programming on sexual violence, regardless of whether this grant application goes through.
Tomorrow, at 11am, students will assemble for a rally on the main quad to demonstrate their frustration and solidarity. Students and D.C. residents are encouraged to attend wearing black and holding signs. You can find information about the event on our Facebook page.

"WAM! It Yourself"
The conference will be led by activists, educators, journalists, and media-makers, giving attendees some insight on why gender justice in the media is so crucial. With technology quickly changing and evolving, media in all its forms has become an important tool for activism, education, and entertainment. The conference will touch on important issues dealing with intersectional identities, body image, beauty, online media, and much much more. The conference will give a second look at the pervading messages media gives us and stress the importance of having a diverse, inclusive, and real representation of gender. Check out this video!

WAM! It Yourself is happening in Los Angeles this weekend at Santa Monica College and the West Coast Campus Team will be tabling at the event on Friday. On Saturday, our colleagues at Ms. magazine are hosting a workshop about feminist online media and giving their reflections on the first year of the Ms. magazine Blog.The conference will have video presentations, lectures, workshops, a poetry slam, discussions, presentations, and lots of information that will keep your feminist heart beating.

One Year Later: Feminists Stand By the Affordable Care Act
When the Act’s full provisions take effect in 2014, it will make incredible headway in promoting gender equality in healthcare by ensuring that women can not be charged higher premiums, nor will they be denied coverage due to pregnancy or other gender-based discriminations often considered to be pre-existing conditions..
I was fortunate enough to network with young feminists (both men and women) from all over the country who are working hard at their campuses and in their communities to advance equality.
For the first time in my life I was completely surrounded by others who, despite our geographical differences, were just like me. They were just as passionate and aggressive for issues like affordable and accessible birth control, equal pay and pro-choice.
One thing that was thoroughly emphasized throughout the weekend and is also an issue I strongly believe in and advocate for is that we need more women in leadership and political positions.
In order for women to get elected to political positions or promoted to leaders of companies, they need to develop their skills at an early age. It’s critical that we encourage young women in high school and college to run for student government.
During elections there is always one winner and one loser. Women are less likely than men to run again even after they’ve lost. For example, Casey Steitler, President-Elect of ASUN ran last year and lost but he didn’t let that faze him. He kept very active in ASUN and ran again for president and ultimately won.
We need to make sure women don’t feel defeated or worthless and can pick themselves up and try again just like Mr. Stietler.
The conference opened with a panel of pioneers and heroines of the second and third-wave (First: Get the vote Second: Get the choice Third: Modern inequities) feminist movements: Feminist Majority Foundation President Eleanor Smeal, National Organization of Women President Terry O’Neill, the chief of staff to the First Lady and the Director of the Committee on the Status of Women and Girls Tina Tchen.
These women have paved the road for the next generation of feminists to take over the steering wheel. While their fight will never cease to exist, it’s up to our generation of women and men to continue the fight for an equitable society.
Another panel of women who specialize on international women’s rights and health reminded us that it is our generation leading the revolutions in the Middle-East and that women, despite their lack of publicity, are leading the way.
In fact, last year, male Iranians wore scarves in solidarity with Muslim women during Iran’s revolt against their dictator. Middle Eastern women are leading the movement everyday; they’re risking imprisonment and their lives to speak out for freedom.
Closing the conference Sunday evening was Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis speaking to a room with more than 500 feminists. She is the first Latina appointee in a president’s cabinet and works everyday for sex and racial equality in the labor force.
“Women, no matter how highly educated are, are still discriminated against,” Solis warned.
The NYFLC inspired me beyond words. I heard first hand from international and American feminists what they are doing to advance women’s rights.
My favorite line from the conference was during the general assembly by Ellie Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, regarding President Obama. I volunteered on the campaign to elect Barack Obama for nearly eighteen months. I always believed he would be elected and I remain a strong supporter and advocate of the president’s policies and goals.
I sat in the front row, directly in front of Ellie and sensed she was talking directly to me as she proclaimed, “You are the generation that gave America its first African American president. You will be the generation to lead a revolution.”

The Zambian international, currently plying his trade with Swiss top-flight outfit BSC Young Boys, was more than happy to make time for an interview with FIFA.com: "No problem, let's go."
Mayuka has every reason to be cheerful. Indeed, the 20-year-old's fledgling career has developed swimmingly at both club and international level, with Zambia making excellent progress in their bid to reach the 2012 CAF Africa Cup of Nations and Young Boys well on course to qualify for next season's UEFA Europa League.
Success comes naturally to the young striker, who first caught the eye as a wide-eyed 16-year-old at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2007. His performances in Canada not only impressed the many travelling fans, but also FIFA's Technical Study Group (TSG), who remarked at the time: "Agile, pacy midfielder. Good dribbler with great stamina."
Their expert opinion was soon confirmed. After just one year as a professional with hometown club Kabwe Warriors of the Zambian Premier League, the 17-year-old Mayuka was snapped up by Israeli giants Maccabi Tel Aviv. A daring switch, as much for Maccabi as Mayuka himself, considering neither could be certain of how the young prodigy would settle so far away from his family and friends.
But as Mayuka told FIFA.com, his two years in the Mediterranean metropolis proved a wonderful experience: "Tel Aviv is fantastic, one of the best cities I've ever been to. When I first moved there, I tried not to think too much about home. I knew that football was my chance at making a good career for myself. I had to be mentally strong to achieve my goal."
Mayuka's excellent displays in the Israeli top flight, which he puts down to "a good character and a strong belief in God", soon attracted interest from various other European clubs, among them Young Boys of Berne. It turned out to be a match made in heaven
Faced with the daunting challenge of filling the boots of former Young Boys goalgetter Seydou Doumbia, the 5'9 frontman soon repaid the Swiss club's faith in him. In 27 Super League appearances so far this term, Mayuka has bagged a respectable nine league goals.
"My team made it very easy for me to settle in," he explained. "I enjoy living and playing football here. No matter where you move as a player, you always have to adapt to different cultures. It's part and parcel of being a footballer."
Despite his tender years, Mayuka is fully aware of what it takes to assert oneself in a foreign country with a fresh culture and new language. It is this mix of international experience, confidence and coolness which give the 20-year-old the conviction that he can one day achieve his ultimate ambition.
"It's my dream to play for Manchester United. Ever since my childhood, I've always been fascinated by the way they play. It's an ambition which I won't stop striving for, but at the moment I'm fully focused on Young Boys, with whom I hope to reach the Europa League by winning each of our remaining league games."
Mayuka's recent performances in the Swiss top tier and with Zambia have already convinced many experts that the talented striker is indeed capable of realising his Premier League dream. Nonetheless, there is plenty of hard work ahead for the nimble attacker, for both club and country.
The 22-time international is optimistic about Zambia's chances of making it to the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon next year and fondly remembers his goal in the important 2-0 qualifying victory away to Mozambique in late March. "It was great. The win was enormously important to keep us in with a chance of reaching the tournament. I'm happy I was able to help the team." Zambia face the same opponents in the return fixture in June.
"We're expecting a difficult match, but football is the absolute No1 sport in Zambia and we know we can rely on our fans. Qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations would mean so much to the whole nation," said Mayuka to conclude the interview, before tucking in to some well-deserved lunch. We could sense he was hungry for more.Sentence delayed for Sister Megan Rice and friends
Sentencing delayed for Duluth nuclear protester, Duluth News Tribune A judge has delayed a sentencing hearing for a Duluth man and two other protesters for breaking into a nuclear weapons plant in Tennessee. By: Associated Press staff,, 16 Sept 13 A judge has delayed a sentencing hearing for a Duluth man and two other protesters for breaking into a nuclear weapons plant in Tennessee.
U.S. District Judge Amul Thapar granted a motion last week from defense attorneys asking to postpone the date.
The sentencing, which had been scheduled for this month, was reset for Jan. 28 in Knoxville.
Defense attorneys said they needed more time to prepare for the proceeding.
The defendants — Greg Boertje-Obed of Duluth, Sister Megan Rice and Michael Walli — letters,” Thapar wrote in the order postponing the hearing.

[…] Sentence delayed for Sister Megan Rice and friends (nuclear-news.net) […]After a string of sartorial and award show victories, Australia’s unofficial figurehead has finally been dealt a harrowing blow – at the hands of Photoshop and Vogue Australia.
Cate Blanchett was shot by photographer Steven Chee for the magazine’s February 2014 cover. At least we’re told it’s Cate Blanchett. The forums aren’t entirely convinced it isn’t the equally phenomenal but much older Helen Mirren, leaving a little perplexed as to why Blanchett’s alabaster skin has been ravaged by a few too many trips to the digital sunbeds.
“This would have been nice and fresh but what the hell did they do to her face,” asks UrbanStyling of the weird tan she definitely doesn’t have in real life. “Oh my god, what did they do her skin and hair?!" adds commenter t-rex, while jmrmartinho thinks she looks sunburned.
We can’t help but agree with DelicateFlower that maybe Vogue Australia’s retouching team got their January and February briefs mixed up.
“Last month Jessica Hart looked like a ghoulish water creature, now they make Cate Blanchett look ordinary? Very disappointing run of covers. What’s happened to the creative flair that Vogue Aus USED to have, cover-wise anyway?”
The cover is getting slammed even harder over on the magazine’s Facebook page.
At least the clothing is beautiful, Blanchett was styled by Jillian Davison in a bronze suit from Gucci’s Resort 2014, which is perfect on the actress and against the ocean background. The accompanying editorial is equally great.
Let this be a lesson not to mess with Australia’s spirit.Jun 18, 2012

Nicki Gilmour, founder of Evolved Employer, a workplace consulting firm focusing on diversity and inclusion, says it’s up to top executives to take a stronger stance and publicly admonish employees who make derogatory remarks.
A top executive at a Fortune 500 company, which she declined to name, recently told her he was in a meeting when an employee asked about the “business case” for gay-friendly policies, she says. The executive responded: “If you’re still asking that question, you shouldn’t be at the meeting.”
“It’s about not tolerating bad behavior, and recognizing good behavior,” Gilmour says. “Someone’s always not going to like it.”
Data shows more companies are seeing the case for accommodating workers in same-sex relationships: Last year, 52% of all employers offered domestic-partner benefits, up from 31% in 2010, according to a survey of 3,000 employers by human resources consultancy Mercer.
The increase is driven mainly by competition to recruit and retain talent, says Deena Fidas, a deputy director at Human Rights Campaign.After nearly one month of silence, Ben Affleck finally talked about being cast as Batman in 2015’s Batman vs. Superman.

It's a bit of an understatement to say that Universal Audio's 710 Twin-Finity mic pres are a big hit among many of today's top studio engineers. It takes a 310V single-ended Class A triode tube preamplifier and a completely separate Class A FET preamp circuit and lets you blend the two signals together straight from the source. From 100% tube to 100% FET, you can dial in the solid-state bite you love, the ultra-fast response you want, and the even-order harmonic tube warmth you need, all with a single Tone Blending knob.
What could possibly be better? Answer: the Universal Audio 4-710d. The 4-710d combines four 710 Twin-Finity circuits together into a single unit that costs less than three original 710s. But that's not all. While they were at it, Universal Audio also added a simple 1176-based compression section to each channel, limiters on all eight digital outputs, and AES/EBU and S/MUX digital output. Now, it's even easier and more cost effective than ever to add a set of these fantastic hybrid preamps to your studio.

The retail and publishing giant announced at industry event Writer.ly that a quarter of the best performing books from the week preceding the event on the Amazon store were self-published, either directly or via the author’s own imprint publisher.
Although these figures aren’t reflective of overall revenue, they are absolutely reflective of a marketplace that is increasingly receptive to author who go outside traditional publishing channels.
The ease with which authors can now upload content they themselves have created and distribute it to a readership base that either may not have heard of them, or that they’ve built up already in niche online environments has already been given a huge amount of treatment already and doesn’t bear repetition. What’s key about this particular piece of news is that it underscores how successful Amazon’s own predatory market-share capturing initiatives have been.
Traditional publishers have of course already responded with self-publishing initiatives of their own to reach out to independent authors, but it’s worth mentioning that Amazon’s omission of any indication about the revenue these independent books have accrued is probably due to the fact that big name traditional authors, who work within the boundaries of traditional publishing contracts, are probably still the most profitable segment in fiction-publishing and that self-publishing’s difference to the bottom line, outside of (arguably anomalously) hugely successful self-published novels is slim.

I have a DVD under the DUCK YOU SUCKER title, which is how I saw it in the theater on it’s origianl release.
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 10:03 am
Randy, the US DVD uses the original release title on the cover – I guess that’s the one you have.
I have the UK special edition from MGM that uses A Fistful of Dynamite, although the US title does appear for the end credits on the film itself.

I have always loved “A Fistful Of Dymamite” since I first saw it in the late 70s. As an avid soundtrack collector, with a particular interest in Italian film music, it was also one of the first soundtrack LPs I bought. You’ve discussed it very well Colin and overall, I agree with what you have to say. Not with everything though. I suppose that the Special Edition DVD is the best version overall but I wouldn’t call it ‘definitive’. Recently, I re-bought the older MGM UK release of the film (which I had foolishly sold upon acquiring the Spec.Ed version.) because it presents quite a few different aspects. The differences between the various versions are many and too complicated to get into here but there were much more obscenities used in the older MGM release (as in the 90s laserdisc). I am not a film watcher who revels in the use of obscenities for their own sake but, here, they did add a certain punch to some scenes. Don’t worry Colin, I won’t lower the tone of your blog by quoting specific examples! :)
This business about Sean’s name, I’m not so sure about. I remember the documentary where it’s posited as a theory but I always felt that “Sean Mallory” is the Coburn character’s real name and that his use of ‘John’ is just another sign of his distancing himself from his previous life in Ireland.
I wouldn’t call myself a huge fan of Italian westerns but I do like many of them…and not just Leone. Tessari, Sollima and Corbuci have all produced some fine work too. However, I do keep the spaghettis in a separate compartment to American westerns in my head. They seem to exist in a parallel western universe and, provided I approach them in that way, I often enjoy them.
As regards the film’s title, there was another Leone documentary (I forget which) where Peter Bogdanovich, who worked with Leone briefly during the film’s early preparation stages…and who is, of course, a superb mimic, gave a hilarious account of their discussion on the “Duck You Sucker!” title. It seems that Leone was strangely convinced that ‘Duck You Sucker!’ was a well-known American slang expression which was in common usage in the U.S. Despite all attempts by Bogdanovich to convince him otherwise, Leone wouldn’t change it. Bogdanovich’s telling of the story was very funny!
One of the quotes from the screenplay I always remember is when Mallory tells Villega.. “When I started using dynamite I believed in many things….finally, I believed only in dynamite.”

Hi Dafydd. I used to have that old DVD as well, and either sold it or gave it away – can’t remember now. I suppose I should have kept it to have the different versions, but I think it can still be found if you look around.
I’m not 100% sure on the name business myself – the Sean/John business is, I think, left deliberately ambiguous. Being Irish myself, and being familiar with the interchangeable nature of the two names, I didn’t give it a lot of thought on first viewing. However, once I heard the theory that Sean might really be the friend, and then noticing the way Leone cut that scene, well I thought it was possible – maybe.
And I recall that anecdote about Leone being convinced that “Duck, You Sucker” was common parlance and therefore determined to use it.

January 18, 2013 at 9:11 pm
That’s really interesting about versions Dafydd – I’ve got the Laserdisc too but otherwise only have the 2-disc edition that MGM put out about 6 years ago – I hadn’t picked up on the language differences – thanks for that info (even if it is really frustrating). One thing though, surely Coburn’s character is definitively identified on screen as ‘John H. Mallory’ in the newspaper clipping early in he film. Based on that I always felt that Mallory is thinking of his friend Sean on the soundtrack, haunted by the betrayal and sense that his life really ended with his friend’s – but is in a way the slight ambiguity suggests a melding of the two together in his mind, his guilt slowly but surely taking him towards death to meet his old friend/rival
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 9:32 pm
Coburn is most certainly identified as “John Mallory” in the clipping that Juan finds among his belongings. As I said, my initial reaction to Coburn briefly calling himself Sean before correcting himself was that he was just using the Irish variant of the name. Dafydd’s idea that his dropping it signified a desire to distance himself from the past is plausible in that sense. However, the fact that he’s haunted by that past, and knows deep down that he can’t really escape it, returning repeatedly via flashback, draws me away from that interpretation.
Cavershamragu
January 18, 2013 at 9:45 pm
It is fascinating how it’s not something that really seems an issue the first time you see it (or at least wasn’t for me) but once it has been pointed out, and you see how subtly Coburn plays the scene when he seemingly gets the name wrong. and the emphasis that is given to the whole business of his name, that is just adds this wonderful extra shading.
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 9:58 pm
Absolutely; the more familiar you become with the movie, the more you notice it. My last viewing, just a few days ago, really brought home to me the artistry involved – the understated playing of Coburn and the expert way Leone shot and cut the scene.
David Arrate
January 18, 2013 at 2:22 pm
Like yourself, Colin, I love westerns yet I’m not a big fan of this subgenre. However, besides Once Upon a Time in the West (and perhaps three other Euro-westerns NOT directed by Sergio Leone, though I do like For A Few Dollars More a lot), I am fond of this film. Excellent review.
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 8:21 pm
Thanks David. I have tried hard to get into spaghetti westerns, and own a considerable number but, like Dafydd said, I see them as almost a separate species – the look and feel is totally different to the classic US variety. I do think Leone comes much closer to that classic form though, especially in his two greatest achievements – this movie and OUATITW.
Cavershamragu
January 18, 2013 at 3:23 pm
Terrific review Colin – I reckoned if there was one Leone film that might appeal then this one, with its strong connections to Ford and Ireland, might be the one!
I agree that the long cut is the only way to make sense of the film, though it also, as you say, adds even more layers of confusion especially the John / Sean overlap. In one of the documentaries Glenn Erickson (aka DVD Savant) constructs an elaborate and fairly persuasive theory about its meaning and about the theme of betrayal extending beyond politics to the personal in terms of the love triangle. I don’t buy it 100% but it certainly make emotional sense even if rationally it is a bit porous. Like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST the truth is to be found in a dream / nightmare remembrance and one can certainly see how Leone moved from this to the even more convoluted structure of ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA with the sense of guilt leading to a confusion of identification and even identities.
Of the potential English title I think ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE REVOLUTION is probably the best though the Italian is impossible to translate (it’s derived from the phrase, ‘Giu la testa … coglione’, which is very Roman and should be more or less be translated (pardon my ahem French) as ‘Get your head down … dickhead’).
Great stuff mate.
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 8:38 pm
Hi Sergio. The film really is open to multiple interpretations in my opinion – I’ve heard so many posited and some seem more persuasive than others. The name business is fascinating though – not to mention the additional link to Ford and The Informer by having David Warbeck’s character credited as Nolan. In a way, I like the fact we can’t be completely sure about anything.
Regarding the title, Once Upon a Time in the Revolution does have a certain attraction with its allusions to his previous movie.
Cavershamragu
January 18, 2013 at 9:02 pm
THE INFORMER sort of has the same function as PURSUED does in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST in terms of character development. I grew up with spaghetti and spaghetti westerns (ho ho) and so its built-in to my viewing DNA I suppose but this does feel very different from most of the films that the success of FISTFUL OF DOLLARS spawned. The reason I find it so effective is because we see this progress toward this strange, melancholy, oneiric style that completely overwhelms the nostalgia of ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, which is an incredible movie, a real masterpiece in my view, but also incredibly hard to take. Here the ambiguity seems to suit the complexity of the subject matter in terms of our relationship to stories about revolutionaries / freedom fighters / ‘terrorists’ so in that sense the French title ONCE UPON A TIME … THE REVOLUTION (according to Frayling it did well in France) seems especially appropriate – but for years I only even saw it in English as FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE and I still liked it in the shorter version.
The sequence in which Steiger’s family is found murdered in the caves, which has an echo in GOOD, BAD AND THE UGLY, immediately evokes the Fosse Ardeatine incident in which the Nazi killed over 300 people as a reprisal and I still find that very powerful and is not really something you could have in a plain shoot’em up that’s for certain (the incident was filmed directly as MASSACRE IN ROME by Cosmatos the following year).
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 9:23 pm
Yes, I’ve seen Massacre in Rome and the allusion to the incident depicted, while I missed mentioning it, is indeed a strong one.
In a sense, I grew up with spaghetti westerns too – I’d seen this film and the Dollars trilogy at a fairly early age. At that time, spaghetti westerns and the classic US variety were all just cowboy pictures to me. It was only as I got older that the difference became more apparent. In some chats I’ve had with Blake Lucas a very interesting point was raised, namely the contrasting attitudes of the US and spaghetti westerns in relation to violence and killing. Generally, the Euro westerns have taken a more amoral, casual approach to killing and what it means to the victims and perpetrators. It’s an aspect that I’m not that fond of myself, and I think that’s why I find myself drawn to Leone more than other directors. In Once Upon a Time in the West and A Fistful of Dynamite in particular there’s a very different feel to the violence. It’s seen to have consequences for all concerned, and isn’t especially glorified. That, as much as anything, forms a closer connection between Leone and the classic Hollywood directors for me.
Cavershamragu
January 18, 2013 at 9:30 pm
I agree completely Colin – there’s no question that they Spaghetti films were generally much more violent and cynical too – downright nihilistic a lot of time in fact! And it’s a strength of this film that it tries to deal with the end of violence
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 9:39 pm
I think it shows Leone’s maturity as a filmmaker, his acknowledgement that violence for its own sake, or simply the sake of entertainment, shouldn’t be seen as an end in itself.
If the movie was deconstructing the myth of revolution, then Leone was deconstructing the myth of the spaghetti western, and by extension his own myth, here too.
Cavershamragu
January 18, 2013 at 9:48 pm
I think Leone really wanted to move on – it’s interesting that between this and his final film he pretty much just produced (very popular) comic films made by Carlo Verdone, which are well above average but are very modest films none the less (Verdone is a huge star in Italy but only there I think).
Colin
January 18, 2013 at 10:02 pm
I think it’s just something else to admire about Leone – his desire to avoid simply retreading the same ground. Whilst a part of me wishes he’d directed more films, another part is happy that he stuck to his guns and tried to develop as far as possible.

When this film was first released here, it was marketed as a comedy-western and the accompanying poster/advertising material appropriately confirmed this ; local critics that I respected, were amblivalent about it; I was not overly impressed by Rod Steiger’s uneven performances in films; and when I discovered the alternative title was “Duck, You Sucker”, I was certainly turned off.
From your enthusiastic review of the film, it would appear that there is a lot more to the film than at first glance.

Rod, I can see how the film may have been marketed as a comedy western. The US poster certainly comes close to encouraging that view –
Also, as I mentioned, the first half of the movie is much lighter in tone before taking a serious turn in the latter part. I have found Steiger problematic at times, lacking subtlety when it was needed, but he’s good in this film and really produces the goods as the story wears on. If you haven’t seen the film, then I heartily recommend you check it out. Bear in mind though that it takes some time to hit its stride – but it’s worth the wait in my opinion.

Colin, I share your appreciation for A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE. The film never receives the attention it deserves and your perceptive review goes a long way toward correcting that. Personally I think Rod Steiger relishes his role and gives the best performances of his career. It’s an operatic performance, not unlike Leone’s direction. They should have worked together again. I’m fond of this film and I think as highly of it as you do for all the reasons stated in your review.
If you like A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE consider watching films made by the Mexicans about their revolution. Their preoccupations are very different from American and Italian versions, which I find infinitely more interesting. By the 1930s, the Mexican Revolution had become a film genre in that country. The genre has many of the attributes of the American western, but it is not limited to that. A good place to start would be Fernando de Fuentes’ historic Revolution Trilogy: El Prisionero trece / Prisoner 13 (1933), El Compadre Mendoza / Godfather Mendoza (1934) and Vámonos con Pancho Villa / Let’s Go with Pancho Villa (1936). These early talkies were made by people who either fought in the Revolution or lived through it, and they knew whereof they spoke.
One of Mexico’s greatest directors, Ismael Rodríguez cast Pedro Armendariz as Pancho Villa in Así era Pancho Villa (1957). Instead of trying to do a definitive biography by compressing a life into a short narrative film, Rogriguez decided to recreate different circumstances and events in the life Villa allowing for gaps in the narrative, which taken altogether opens up the Revolution and highlights others in his orbit. So successful was this widescreen, Technicolor epic that Rogriguez and Armendariz followed through by turning it into a trilogy with two more episodic films, Pancho Villa y la Valentina (1960) and Cuando ¡Viva Villa! es la muerte (1960).
Long before he became known as M’Apache in The Wild Bunch, Emilio Fernandez had fought in the revolution with Villa. He fled to southern California and started working in films before a change in government enabled him to go back. As a director, he became the John Ford of Mexico, making films about social injustice and the rural poor, with great playwrights and novelists like B. Traven and John Steinbeck collaborating with him on the scripts. Rodriguez made several films about the Revolution.
One film that must have surely influenced Sergio Leone is José Bolaños’ La Soldadera (1967). For this story about the women soldiers, Bolaños’ worked from Sergei Eisenstein’s notes and storyboards for an episode of Que Viva Mexico! (1932) that Eisenstein was unable to film. Bolaños shot in you-are-there docudrama style like Huston’s Red Badge of Courage.
In contrast, spaghetti westerns dealing with the Mexican revolution seem more preoccupied, understandably, with the European experience than with the Mexican, but anyone who can relate to the masterpiece A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE will find the Mexican films equally rewarding.

Good to hear from you Richard, and thanks very much for that detailed response.
I will have to admit that I am shamefully ignorant of Mexican cinema outside of references that I’ve come across when reading round the subject of westerns. I am of course familiar with Emilio Fernandez as an actor, and I have seen references to his early life. I was aware, again through reading, that he is highly regarded as a director but I’ve never had the opportunity to sample his work.
Thanks again for offering so many pointers and recommendations for where to start with Mexican filmmakers and their take on their own revolution.

Colin, this is definitely one of your very best pieces–I can’t think of one that I have liked more. You evoked the film that I too love with so much insight as well as feeling that it moved me just to think about it and maybe encourage another viewing soon as I haven’t seen it in awhile now.
I’m very much in harmony with what you say and what others have said. I too am not much of a fan of Italian Westerns though I have tried. Recently, the release of DJANGO UNCHAINED prompted a local theatre to a run of the original DJANGO (1966?) directed by Sergio Corbucci so I grabbed the opportunity to see it as I’d always wanted to–it was in Italian and subtitled, which I thought helped, and Corbucci is plainly a talented director, but I wouldn’t say anything about it was especially brilliant and it had the same mix of extreme violence and high body count with simplistic politics (however much I may sympathize with those politics) that characterize so many of the films. Leone is much more complex. But I will say that over time I’ve become less enamored of the Dollars trilogy and am glad he could find a more serious tone in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, the present film, and then in ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, which on first release I thought even surpassed those two earlier works though I’m not so sure about this now. By the way, I prefer the title I originally saw it under on first release here–DUCK, YOU SUCKER (or GIU LA TESTA) as I believe it was opportunistically renamed A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE after initial tepid boxoffice in hopes that a reminder of the director might be good for a few dollars more.
Can’t add much to what you wrote. Re the two main characters, I don’t think it’s too much to see them and their relationship as so well-realized that Leone can be credited with a genuinely beautiful variation and reimagining of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, which he surely had in mind. And you are right about Rod Steiger–he is so often an immoderate actor and hampers my view of him somewhat (he himself seemed aware of it–in an interview once, he said, kind of proudly “He gave a restrained performance–they don’t say that about me very often”) but he can change registers and does play both in this movie and to great effect, very amusing in the comedic parts early on and also playing well the quiet deepening of Juan later. By contrast to Steiger, James Coburn is an actor I generally do like, though how could he could be is really measured best by these two movies made close together–this one and PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID, in both of which he is superb. Sean (will get to the name in a moment) is a more sympathetic character than Pat, though they both encourage a very complex response and an inwardness in Coburn he did not have enough opportunities to display. I do think of Coburn as especially soulful here, though he doesn’t play Sean sentimentally. But either performance could be considered his best; it would be very close for me, as those two films–genre standouts in unhappy times–also are.
That’s allowing DUCK, YOU SUCKER is a Western. One may think of it that way, though its two non-American heroes in Mexico make it a touch marginal to the genre, much as one might say of, for example, WAY OF A GAUCHO. I’d tend to claim these for the Western poetically.
I especially enjoyed the discussion here of the scene in which Steiger asks Coburn his name and he first says “Sean.” I think you are right about the way Coburn plays it. I think Sean is his name and he wants to distance himself from it, as it is the more Irish version of the name so ties into his past, given that Sean and John are interchangeable as you say. This is indeed one of the superb moments of the movie. There’s a tremendous, beautifully modulated buildup to that first flashback with Morricone’s wonderful music with the film now well along–it so powerfully changes the movie’s tone and shows Leone at his peak, I believe.
I don’t think the friend is named “Sean.” I think “Sean” in the music refers to Coburn. Guess it could be argued but the friend is never identified by name at all. By the way, a problem with the film (though I won’t say it’s a weakness). On original release the full final flashback was not there so I spent years thinking the friend was the girl’s brother as well as Sean’s friend. Now, with that scene restored, we need to read the back story a little differently and it was hard for me to make the adjustment when I saw it, though you are right it makes the back story even more complex.
Anyway, mainly wanted to say how much I enjoyed this piece on a richly deserving movie.

Blake, thanks very much for that comprehensive, and extremely complimentary, response.
I remember, as a youngster, being thrilled by the Dollars trilogy – the cool nonchalance of Eastwood’s performance and Morricone’s distinctive and very unusual scoring. I still enjoy those films but not the way I did back then. Like Django that you mentioned, I think they’re very well made and entertaining but, despite moments where there is something deeper touched upon, they don’t draw much of an emotional response from me. A Fistful of Dynamite and Once Upon a Time in the West, on the other hand, reveal new layers on each subsequent viewing and this marks them out as truly great works. It’s interesting too that neither film, nor Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid which you mentioned, opened to universal acclaim yet saw their reputations rise over time.
I guess you’re right that a purist perspective might lead one to say A Fistful of Dynamite isn’t a western according to the strictest definition. However, regardless of the setting and origins of the characters, in theme, tone and at heart it must surely be included in the genre.
Blake Lucas
January 21, 2013 at 12:04 am
What you said about the Dollars trilogy is what I feel. I saw them in reverse order so the best of the three THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was the first one I saw and felt like it was a breath of fresh air for the genre and enjoyed Eastwood for the same reasons you did. And I still think this one especially is an excellent movie, just not so great as I thought it was then. In the same way, I’m more ambivalent about Eastwood and you’ll remember I said this commenting on your top Western stars piece, that I wouldn’t have voted for him even though I acknowledge he is the dominant star of the post-classical Western. I’m frankly glad it was Bronson in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and Coburn in DUCK, YOU SUCKER instead of Eastwood.
Despite my reservations about Italian Westerns, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST has remained my favorite Western post-1962. I do believe Leone carved out his own path in cinema, more than simply being the best of Italian Westerns, even if he made his way in them.
Colin
January 21, 2013 at 8:06 am
Frankly, and this is no criticism of his three roles for Leone, I couldn’t imagine Eastwood in either Once Upon a Time in the West or A Fistful of Dynamite – I think his presence would have resulted in very different films.“I just wish my students cared more.” Most teachers—first-year and veterans alike—have said or at least felt like this at some point.
But consider for a moment how subjective “care” is. What does a student who cares even look like? Care is an ambiguous goal, one that needs to be translated to concrete behavior if we are going to help our students become more motivated.
To help your students become more invested in your classroom, we’d like to share four tips from Robyn Jackson’s book, How to Motivate Reluctant Learners.
4 Ways to Motivate Reluctant Learners
The Investment Must Be Specific
Very often what looks like resistance is actually confusion about our vague requests. Consider the difference between the following:
- “Will you try harder to pay attention in class?”
- “During class, I want you to keep your head off the desk, keep your eyes open and on me, and have all of your materials out on the desk.”
You’ll notice how the former not only lacks specific instructions, but does not give the student a clear picture of what you expect from him or her. Always give your students concrete steps for making the investment.
The Investment Must Meaningful
It’s frustrating when our students miss class or don’t do their homework. If only they knew how important attendance and homework were, we think to ourselves, they’d change. Wrong.
It’s not that students don’t think these things are important; it’s more likely that they don’t share the same value system as us. As Jackson suggests, “Unless we identify an investment we want that is meaningful to them, they will choose not to invest.”
So how do we determine whether or not the investment we want them to make will be meaningful to them? Ask yourself the following two questions:
- Does the investment provide students with a way to use the currencies they have to get something they want? The investment should involve them using something they know and can do to accomplish a goal, acquire new and useful currencies, or solve an interesting problem.
- Does the investment provide students with a way to use their currencies to satisfy a need? The investment should involve them using something they know or can do to meet a need for safety and survival, connection and belonging, power and competence, freedom and autonomy, play, enjoyment or fun.
The Investment Must Be Observable
We all want our students to care, to want to learn and to try, but stop right there and consider what these three things have in common. They are all emotions, which means that they are intangible. You can’t touch boredom, irritation or passivity and very often you can’t even see the physical manifestations of these emotions.
To keep ourselves from being frustrated, Jackson urges teachers to “couch the investment we want students to make in terms of observable behaviors” rather than emotions.
If you want your students to try harder, you must be able to articulate what “trying harder” looks like. Otherwise, you have no tangible way of knowing whether or not your students are actually trying.
Consider the difference between the following:
- “I want you to try harder.”
- “I want you to turn in all of your work according to the set requirements on the rubric, attempt to answer questions—even when you are unsure if you have the right answer—ask for help when you don’t understand, and revise your essay according to the standards we discussed last class.”
Unlike the former statement, the latter gives you a concrete way of determining whether or not the students see “try harder” in the same way you do.
The Investment Must Be Realistic
Most students respect teachers who challenge them and maintain high expectations, but pushing students beyond what they are capable of can lead to disengagement, hostility, even mutiny.
Ask students to commit to something that is achievable, but not insultingly simple. To find an achievable investment, Jackson suggests that teachers “pay attention to what the students are investing in already and then select and an investment that is similar but perhaps one step beyond—something achievable with support.”
Thank YouAll I ever wanted to be was a "punk rocker," hair spray painted a glittery purple color. My parents considered being a "punk rocker" to be a crime on the same level as hanging out at the mall or behind gas stations, buying "Like a Virgin," eating sugar cereals, or watching "Dukes of Hazard."
I went as a hobo.
HALLOWEEN: 1986
I wore a red hockey jacket with the name Jeff stitched on the left breast. Breezers and thigh-high hockey socks, stripped with black and red. A fashionable red hockey hat, styled the the Copenhagen hats that were all the rage, on top of my short, shaggy hair. Eyes blackened like I was a talentless goon. Stitches drawn across my cheek.
"Am I a boy or a girl?" I asked at every single door in a new development near our neighborhood.
A man studied me. I was standing in the lobby of his house with about five friends, waiting for his wife to dump candy in my pillow case.
"Boy?" he said.
My friends and I cheered. In those days, I loved being on the receiving end of gender confusion. Of course, this abated when I got older and any gender confusion was directly related to my concave boob spots.
HALLOWEEN: 1988
The first major event of a newly minted junior high student at St. Pius X was the Halloween dance. The first time in 12 agonizing years that we would encounter sanctioned touching and swaying.
And in 1988, a big effing deal was made of this rite of passage.
The dance would start with a "snowball." A few couples doing an awkward knock-kneed bumbling under a disco ball, herky jerky movements in a strobe light, until the DJ called "snowball," at which point the couples would split, each grabbing a new partner from the partner patch lined up against the wall.
Rumors of people pairing up for the first dance started circling sometime around the Fourth of July.
One of the school's most notorious teachers, Mrs. Pista (no relation) was a task master when it came to junior high dances. Starting in September, she herded seventh-graders into the music room for a half hour of dance lessons every few weeks: Fox Trot, Waltz, and The Hustle.
She also gave us a very serious list of rules, including: You had to dance with everyone who asked you to dance. You didn't have to dance with that person twice. But definitely once. Including Shawn, in his baggy gray sweatpants that tapered at his ankles. (I remember knowing that sweatpants were the wrong thing to wear to a dance, but not knowing why. I now suspect that Shawn probably thought sweatpants were exactly the right thing to wear to a dance, but didn't know why).
And then there was Chris, who led with his pelvis, his chin on your shoulder.
That year I wore a cardboard box, decorated like a pair of dice. I placed in the costume contest.
HALLOWEEN: 1989
Fannie and I went as Pebbles and BamBam. I lucked into Pebbles since Fannie had terrible hair. The kind of mess that would be seen below the belt in a shower scene from a 1979 horror film.
I'm pretty sure we just wore pillow cases. Let me say that again: At some point my body fit into a pillow case.
Around this same time, we used to go to an annual Halloween party at my friend Dong's house. Inevitably, the night would end with about 10 of us sitting on his basement steps while two couples played horizontal kissy face on various surfaces of the rec room while listening to the Steve Miller Band.
When they finished, we'd go back inside and eat more Doritos.
HALLOWEEN: 1998
Ma Pista (related) had a vintage purple suede skirt that she passed on to me from her era as a fashionista working at an upscale boutique while she was in junior college. This skirt was awesome. I wore it all through high school, until the seam ripped and then the staples I used to fix that bent and then rusted.
The last time I wore this skirt was when I went as Daphne from Scooby Doo. This was probably my best costume, paired with my worst boyfriend as Fred. We spent the holiday in Shawano, Wisconsin. Why would someone go to Shawano, Wisconsin, you ask. Good question. But I remember leading a conga line of strangers through a bowling alley to the song "Barbie Girl."
HALLOWEEN: 2004
My first experimentation with wearing rollerblades in a bar. First the Pioneer, then Norms Beer and Brats in Superior. I liked it enough to try it again a few years later.
HALLOWEEN: 2005
A men's white T'shirt, no pants, high heels, smeared lipstick and messy hair. I was a "walk of shame." I felt very liberated, all night, getting away not wearing pants in public.
HALLOWEEN: 2006
I dyed my hair purple, using a temporary dye from target, for my vampire costume. My hair remained a plumish hue well past Thanksgiving. Temporary my ass.
HALLOWEEN: 2007
Roller girl. A shirt red jersey dress, and my inline skates. We went to Pizza Luce. Chuck got us beers, and on his way back caught a glimpse of my exposed butt cheeks. I later almost came to fistacuffs with a girl who was dressed like Oscar the Grouch. She was incessantly playing the lid of a garbage can like a tambourine against the side of the garbage can. When I complained about her on my blog, she saw what I had written and told me she wished she had pushed me over on my stupid skates. Oh, internet.
HALLOWEEN: 2008
Chuck went as David Foster Wallace. It. Was. Awesome. Not as much "too soon" as "no one knew who he was, even though he lugged around a copy of Infinite Jest." I went as a jazzercizer, which was far less inspired. We started at Carmody Irish Pub, and worked toward a darkened Pizza Luce.
A transformer had blown downtown, rendering Pizza Luce worthless. We went to RT Quinlan's and nothing happened of note.
PRESENT DAY
I already miss Halloween, and I haven't even decided yet on which no-pants, mega-lipstick, dirty-pillow puckering, fedora-pimping costume I'm going to wear tonight. This is truly my favorite of all the holidays, in recent years even surpassing my birthday -- which is probably the most selfless thing I've ever said.
I love the collages of wet leaves on the sidewalk and how our TiVo lit up with a half-dozen horror movies. The scattered kiosks of candy corn, and pumpkin recipes. Haunted houses, vampire fangs, fake blood, and grapes peeled to feel like eyeballs.
Unfortunately, I don't have a costume idea. This means that, like most favorite holidays, this one will probably be anticlimactic.Bus Fremantle - Melbourne

The presence of Halal products within THAIFEX – World of Food Asia has been growing across various segments of the show. More than 50% of our food & beverage exhibitors supplies Halal certified products.
In view of the growing market for Halal products and to make it easier for buyers to source for these products, Halal-certified producers will be presented by ways of:
1) A specially designated Halal product zone in Hall 1.
2) Standees to highlight that Halal products are available at the booth.
3) Products from Halal-certified exhibitors at THAIFEX – World of Food Asia will be showcased prominently outside the hall. Buyers will be able to see all Halal-certified food and beverage products available at one glance.
4) The World of Halal seminar remains a key event at THAIFEX, to address the challenges and key issues of the Halal food industry in this region.
The Global Halal Market
There are 1.6 billion Muslims in over 112 countries (2006), creating substantial marketing opportunities for halal food products. While developed countries are seeing declining populations with shrinking families, Muslim nations are seeing rapid growth and large families. Islam is the second-largest religion in the world (after Christianity) and the fastest-growing. As of 2006, about 25% of the world population was Muslim; this is expected to climb to 30% by 2025.
The global market for halal products is estimated at US$580 billion a year. Global halal trade is approximately US$80 billion or 5% of total trade of agri-food products..
Key Markets South East Asia and West Asia. There is also strong demand for halal products in a number of non-Muslim countries. These markets include India (140 million Muslims), China (40 million Muslims), United States (8 million Muslims), Philippines (6 million Muslims), France (6 million Muslims), Thailand (3.2 million Muslims), Germany (3 million Muslims) and the United Kingdom (1.5 million Muslims).
Thailand
Today Thailand is the sixth largest halal food exporter in the world. The domestic halal food market in Thailand grows around 20 percent a year. Out of 30,000 food factories in Thailand now, 8,000 are involved in halal food production.
Thailand has encouraged production and export of halal products and foods to Muslim consumers around the world. The current global market value of halal products and foods is around 100 billion dollars a year. There is potential for Thailand to export more halal food products – and have a greater share of the world food market – considering the country’s strengths in the agricultural sector. Thailand is also developing Pattani, one of the southern border provinces, into a halal industrial center.
Apart from food, other products and services with halal certification have also experienced higher growth. For instance, many people from the Middle East have sought healthcare services in Thailand. Tourism and hotel industries have also benefited from the halal growth.: +66 2 664 2076pattaraporn@expolink.net

The Red Sox designated hitter has just six hits in 44 at-bats against lefties (.136), with not a single walk.
Not even at was perceived to be his low point against southpaws, throughout the 2009 and ’10 seasons, was it this bad. In ’09, when he finished the year with a career-worst .212 clip against left-handers, Ortiz only dipped below .200 for two games the entire season. And a year later, when the troubles led left his average vs. lefties at .222, his low point was .175 in early June.
As former Red Sox hitting coach Dave Magadan remembered Wednesday, those were the days of panic for some predicting the downturn as the beginning of Ortiz’s end.
“If you remember, there was a clamoring of should we release him, is he done,” the current Rangers hitting coach said. “There was a lot of talk about that. They were talking about his bat speed and all that. But I remember distinctly telling him, ‘David, you take BP with guys throwing 50 mph. If you didn’t have bat speed you couldn’t hit balls where you do in BP and we’re going to look back at this moment and we’re going to laugh. We’re going to use it to make you better down the line because this is going to make you a better hitter, a better player. As tough as you are, it’s going to make you’re tougher.’ He ended up proving all the doubters wrong.”
Ortiz evidently took the pep talk to heart, going on to hit a combined .293 with a .889 OPS over the last four seasons.
But the first 40 games of this season has offered an uncomfortable reminder of what happens when the production against left-handers comes to a halt.
Now Ortiz finds himself searching for the same kind of solution Magadan helped the DH uncover five years ago.
“It was showing old video. Showing him what he did against left-handers, how he used the field,” Magadan said. “A lot of his troubles back then was that he was using half the field. And it was more trouble with the relievers than it was the starters. Lefty starters he was still getting his hits, but it was the guys coming out of the pen who are paid to get lefties out he had a little too much of a pull approach. Then it was when he started opening up the left side of the field is when he got going.
“You can say it about any lefty hitter, these guys coming out of the pen who are paid to get lefties out usually have really good breaking balls. And if you’re up there worried about getting the head out and pulling the ball ‘¦ Most of the time they’ll flash you inside to get you going away, so that flash got him leaning away and then they would come with the breaking ball.”
Ortiz has seemingly made a conscious effort of returning to an opposite field approach against left-handers, at least when elevating the ball.

But one noticeable trend this season has been an inability to hit the ball on the ground to the left side, as is evidenced by not a single ball hit on the ground to the left of second base against a lefty hurler.
There might be a reason: unlike five years ago, the balls he is putting in play are coming on pitches on the inside part of the plate.

Here are the 13 hits Ortiz had managed against lefties by the time May 20, 2011 rolled around …

“When he started hitting the ball the other way, taking his base hit over there, it changed the way they were pitching him,” Magadan remembered. “They started throwing more fastballs on the inner-half. But he needed the pay back of hitting balls over to the left side, keeping the defense and the pitchers honest for it to flow from there.”
Evidently, it’s time for another adjustment from Ortiz.
Pablo Sandoval
Hitting from the right side has been painful for Pablo Sandoval, but a Sam Freeman fastball took the agony to new heights.
With the count 0-1 and one out in the seventh inning, the Texas reliever uncorked a 94 mph fastball that hit Sandoval in the left knee. The Sox third baseman immediately crumpled to the ground, lying face down until manager John Farrell and the team’s medical staff could reach him.
Sandoval would be helped off the field with Brock Holt coming on to pinch-run.
After the Red Sox‘ 4-3 win over the Rangers, Sandoval said he believed the issue wouldn’t be serious.
“So far, so good,” he said. “It’s going to be sore for a couple of days.”
“He’s sore. You take mid-90s off the knee, it’s going to be a little sore,” Farrell said. “There’s no, structurally, he’s already had a scan. Everything is clean as far as that goes. Likely, he’s going to be sore. We’ll check him when he comes in.”
It marked the fourth time this season the switch-hitter has reached base against a lefty pitcher, coming into the game 2-for-41 with a walk (.041) vs. southpaws.
Prior to the at-bat, Sandoval had notched one hit in three at-bats, all coming against Rangers righty starter Yovani Gallardo.
The Red Sox were carrying a 4-2 lead at the time the Sandoval injury.
Blake Swihart
So, why weren’t the Red Sox interested in striking a similar deal?
According to a major league source, the Sox didn’t view Castillo — who was serving as Chicago’s third catcher after Miguel Montero and David Ross — as a fit. With 23-year-old Blake Swihart getting the majority of the playing time, the team didn’t view it necessary to bring in another 20-something backstop as a complement.
The right-handed-hitting Castillo, who recently turned 28 years old, played in 113 and 110 games, respectively, the last two seasons for the Cubs. This year he has managed just 24 appearances, batting .163.
The Red Sox currently seem content in letting Swihart develop with Sandy Leon as the backup. Part of the approach is due to the organization’s confidence that Ryan Hanigan (broken knuckle) will be back in July.
Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington noted during the team’s series in Oakland that the team has expressed to Swihart that his offensive production is viewed as secondary and most of the catcher’s attention should be on managing the pitching staff.
Swihart is hitting .179 with a .456 OPS, striking out 14 times and walking once. The switch-hitter has, however, seemingly made some strides recently, looking more comfortable at the plate while notching hits in his last two games.
Yoan Moncada
Why should you have taken note of Yoan Moncada playing for the Greenville Drive Monday night? There were a few reasons.
First, was the good fortune the Red Sox had to possess such potential. As one executive for another club passed along, “The Sox got a very good lottery ticket here, albeit an expensive one.”
In his first game wearing No. 24 for the Drive, Moncada went 0-for-3 with a walk and two runs, while making a few above-average plays in the field (along with an error).
“Compared to when he first came to Spring Training, he has made some significant strides defensively,” Greenville manager Darren Fenster told reporters regarding Moncada “With his swing, it’s more under control from both sides.
“We broke camp here the first couple days in April, so it’s been about a month and a half since we saw him. It just looks like everything is a little bit more under control than when he first signed, and that’s a huge step and a testament to the staff we had down in extended spring training that was with him every day and got him to the point where everybody felt like he was at the point where he’s ready to be here. I don’t see any reason why he can’t continue to progress on the same path.”
With the Major League Baseball amateur draft a few weeks away, it seemed appropriate to poll some big league executives regarding where Yoan Moncada might fit if lumped into the annual event.
It was principal owner John Henry, after all, who proclaimed that one of the reasons he had no problem allocating $63 million to signing the 19-year-old was because the club viewed Moncada as the equivalent of a No. 1 pick.
According to the consensus of those asked, Henry isn’t far off. Every one of the decision-makers asked said Moncada would have definitely been in the top five of this year’s draft, citing the switch-hitter’s possession of the rarest of skill-sets these days — the ability to impact a baseball. (One executive identified Bryce Harper as the last draftee to possess the kind of overall offensive punch Moncada carries, of course without the same opportunities to display his stuff to scouts leading up to his arrival.)
Watching Moncada man second base, it is easy to compare his presence and stature to Seattle’s Robinson Cano. He’s already that big. But whether or not he remains at the position, the payoff figures to be the aforementioned power potential.
The Red Sox have 19-year-old Rafael Devers as a third baseman who could provide future power. And many in the organization are high on first baseman Sam Travis, the second-round draft pick last year who looks to be the type of player who could supply pop.
But there’s a reason why the Red Sox were proactive when committing to Hanley Ramirez. Finding players who can routinely hit the ball with authority is simply the most difficult feat there is when building today’s baseball’s teams.Xander Bogaerts was supposed to be one of those players, yet he has yet to display the kind of 25-30 home run potential many predicted.

Rick Porcello
If you’re going to try to make people notice a trend, beating the best isn’t a bad way to go.
Rick Porcello was the latest Red Sox starter to excel, allowing just two runs (a pair of solo home runs by Brad Miller) over 6 2/3 innings. The end result was win for the righty, besting Mariners ace Felix Hernandez in the Red Sox‘ 4-2 victory over Seattle on Saturday night at Safeco Park.
In the last four outings, Red Sox starters have totaled a 1.32 ERA, allowing just four runs over 27 2/3 innings.
For Hernandez, it was his first loss of the season in seven decisions. He came into the contest with a 1.84 ERA.
Doing the initial damage against the big righty were David Ortiz and Pablo Sandoval, who each went deep.
But, thanks to Miller’s homers, the Red Sox couldn’t break things open for Porcello until the sixth inning. The two-run frame might have been aided by Hernandez seemingly tweaking his already injured ankle while going after a Sandoval foul ball.
After the Sandoval at-bat, Hernandez didn’t seem the same, walking both Xander Bogaerts and Daniel Nava. (The starter came into the game with just eight walks and 50 strikeouts.) Blake Swihart then supplied the eventual game-winner with his second hit of the night, a double into center field.
Brock Holt added an insurance run with a run-scoring ground out down the first base line.
SWENSON GRANITE WORKS ROCK SOLID PERFORMER OF THE GAME: Porcello. The starter lowered his ERA to 4.26, totaling a 2.88 ERA in his last five starts.

Ben Cherington
OAKLAND — When Ben Cherington showed up at O.co Coliseum Monday, all kind of theories regarding his presence started swirling, including that the Red Sox general manager was scouting A’s starter Scott Kazmir for a potential trade.
It is a rite of passage, after all, to raise some eyebrows when any decision-maker shows up somewhere other than his home park. (A notion solidified in the movie “Slap Shot” when Charlestown Chiefs GM Joe McGrath jumps aboard the team bus.)
But, as Cherington points out, the real reason for his presence isn’t nearly as intriguing as some would hope.
“You try to do it about once a month and I tend to take all the New York ones, because it feels like it’s the right thing to do,” he explained. “Personally I think it’s probably best the GM isn’t there all the time.”
As for the notion that trips like this one have a specific purpose, Cherington said, “I know a couple of people do [think that], but I never know why. It’s just part of the schedule.
“If something is going I need to be there for I’ll go, but 99 percent of the time it’s just what is scheduled. As GM, I don’t remember ever being with the team on the road where it just hasn’t been part of the schedule.”
So, why go at all?
The team almost always has a representative from the front office at each road series, with assistant GM Mike Hazen having joined the team in Toronto and scheduled to link up with them again in Seattle.
“It’s a little easier on the road to have conversations with staff and players because at home there’s just more going on,” Cherington said. “Everybody is in the same place on the road. It just depends on what’s going on. I’m trying to support the staff, talk through things and touch base with players.
“You can pretty much do this job from anywhere. You just need a laptop and a phone no matter where you are.”
Besides making the current trip to the West Coast, this time of year Cherington and other general managers) will have to hit the road a bit more than usual due to the June amateur draft.
But, as he explained, even the GM’s presence when watching potential draftees can be overstated.
“Somebody will make a deal of me being somewhere to see an amateur player. It’s almost never about seeing that player, but rather that’s the opportunity to go spend some time with your scouts and connect with them,” said Cherington, who will go out about 10 times a season to watch amateurs. “I’m not sitting in the draft room and saying, ‘I saw this guy on May 13 and this is what he did.’ I’m just not doing that.”

En casa de Colin, hemos pasado unos hermosos días junto con mi esposa Mónica, siendo siempre amablemente bien atendidos.
Nuestro alojamiento fué perfectamente ajustado a la descripción del anuncio, o sea, no nos sorprendió nada diferente a lo que esperábamos.
El departamento de Colin está situado en un barrio que tiene todos los negocios que uno necesita para abastecerse de lo que haga falta para pasar un buen descanso (comidas elaboradas, lavanderias, peluquerías farmacias y mucho más)
Si alguna vez vuelvo a Nueva York volveré a lo de Colin sin dudarlo.
Fué todo tal como lo imaginamos.
This was our first ever stay with an Airbnb host and we couldn't have asked for a better experience!
Colin made us feel very welcome right from the time we made the booking and patiently answered all our questions. He also had very helpful tips and suggestions on how to spend our time in New York.
The room was very spacious, neat and clean. Colin took very good care of us while we were at his place and I'd surely recommend Colin's place for anyone looking for a safe, comfortable and accessible stay in New York.
It was a really comfortable place, quiet and warm, its just 5 blocks away the metro station line number 1. Neighborhood is safe and you have grocerie stores nearby. Collin and his Mom have been amazing hosts, they provide me help to discover things on NYC. The room, bathroom and other areas are clean and you have enough space for everything.

The big benefit that really interested me is the teeth whitening because I have super sensitive teeth and cannot use any conventional whitening products (even those that claim they won’t cause sensitivity make me cringe with every inhaled breath).
After only a week of doing this, not only are my teeth noticeably whiter, but the side benefits are almost better – it gets rid of all the plaque, my teeth are smooth like after a cleaning and polishing, it has anti-inflammatory benefits on the gums, and it gives you good breath. And one major life saver (I am not going to lie, I needed this badly last weekend) – it gets rid of hangovers!! Okay, it doesn’t make you feel like you can go run a marathon, but it definitely takes the edge off so you can function like a normal person. That was HUGE! I didn’t think it could possibly help me, but the basic concept of oil pulling is that it is a detox. The oils adhere to everything, including all the topical toxins in your mouth (plaque, stains, bad breath), but also pull toxins from your system, thereby adding to a list of benefits I am including at the end of the post.
The process sounds kind of awful, so I was not looking forward to doing it. But the reality is not at all that bad. You take organic coconut oil – about one tablespoon worth – and put it in your mouth. Depending on the brand you use, the strength of the coconut flavor will vary. Spectrum has little to no flavor. Now, if you ever use coconut oil, you will know that it solidifies at a very high temperature, so at room temperature it is solid. The first time I put that straight in my mouth, it was gross – like chewing on fat. That gave me the total heebie jeebies.
The next time I knew to melt it in the microwave for five seconds. DO NOT MAKE IT TOO HOT OR IT WILL BURN YOUR MOUTH. Depending on your microwave, five seconds may or may not be enough, but I would rather it be too cold, and if you use a spoon and stir it around, it will continue to melt. As long as it is not chunky, your mouth will quickly melt it down to where it won’t gross you out. Then you swish it around your mouth getting it in between your teeth, and keep it in your mouth for 20 minutes. That sounds like a lot, but you will be surprised how quickly that goes by when checking FaceBook and playing Candy Crush. But of course, I recommend reading all the latest stories on Snob Essentials 😉 I do have a problem accumulating a lot of spit during this process, but it isn’t bad enough to make me gag or feel like spitting it out. The time really does go by fast, and you want to keep it in for the full 20 minutes. When the timer beeps, make sure to spit it in a bag and throw it away in your trash, NOT down the drain. It will clog your plumbing and cause serious problems. You will see how quickly it solidifies after spitting it out.
I promise, you will immediately see and feel the difference in your mouth. I have only been doing it for a week but from everything I’ve read, it is supposed to help with issues listed below. I will update this post with additional benefits I have found, but trust me, you will be thanking me for the teeth whitening right away (and not that anyone should be drinking, but the hangover is a big one).
Benefits of oil pulling:
• Arthritis
• Gastrointestinal issues
• Eczema, acne, psoriasis
• Kidney function
• Detox of the entire body
• Insomnia
• Allergies
• Sensitive teeth
• Cavities and Gingivitis
• Sinus
10 thoughts on “Benefits of Oil Pulling: Reviving an Ancient Remedy”
which coconut oil do you recommend. I ask because ever since people have started to rave about it, more and more jars of it are showing up from different companies.
Make sure to use organic 100% coconut oil. I like the Spectrum because it has the least taste and is easily found.
How often do you do this?
I use the organic from Trader Joe’s…recommended on some blog. I’ve put it on my hair as a deep conditioner for an hour then wash. Started using as a makeup remover and its really good nondrying then wash my face. I’m looking for a good coconut oil soap. I’m going to try on my teeth this morning thanks for the tip.
I would not heat in the microwave as that destroys the healing components of organic coconut oil. I don’t microwave anything.
Ahh, totally true. I will put it in a bowl in boiling water, it’s how I melt chocolate. xx Tina
There is no such thing as a “detox,” stop spreading this lie. It’s so irresponsible! Oil pulling works the same way swishing anything wofks : you mechanically move things around, dislodging plaque. That’s it. Don’t attribute any magical properties to it, that’s dangerous.
But it does in fact have it’s merits and benefits. Its, not it’s.
Just want to note the importance of swishing or “pulling” the oil from front to back. Also, the quality of the oil makes a difference. Even if your oil is organic, if it is expelled pressed or refined you may not be getting the full benefit of the oil. Cold-pressed, unrefined oils have a higher nutrient value and are not treated with hexane. I personally love coco oil and use if in many different forms, but for those women who are afraid of the fat/calories, get the best quality oil and make those calories count.
FYI, I use Nutiva. Here’s a guide a friend shared with me a few years ago
Thank you, will try this. I did pull from front of teeth to back and vice versa. How can you tell if the oil is refined? Am slightly confused. I bought organic from Wholefoods. xx TinaEruption

October 16 , 2006 06:20:23 to 08:00:22
(2 hours 19 minutes and 59 seconds -- 1 frame per minute)
The feature seen here is called a shatter ring. It is a circular rampart of broken rock that forms over a lava tube when lava pressure in the tube repeatedly exceeds the strength of the overlying rock. Repeated flexing of the lava-tube roof breaks the rock around the edges of the mobile area. This shatter ring was active from late September to mid-October 2006, and, in this sequence, was about 55 m long and and 2.5 m high. The center of the shatter ring, which is not visible here, was about a meter lower than the lava surface outside the shatter ring. Thus, the center of the shatter ring uplifted about 5 meters during this event. Lava emerging from the base of the shatter ring is evidence of the overpressurization of the lava tube.

Volcanoes National Park.Hawaii Five-0 Review: Honor Thy FatherJim Halterman at . Updated at . Comments
Some shows do a holiday themed episode.
But if you’re a Hawaii-based series like Hawaii Five-0, honoring the December 1941 attack of Pearl Harbor works, too.
And work Hawaii Five 0 Season 4 Episode 10 did. With just the right elements of sentimentality, drama, mystery and even some backstory for our own Steve McGarrett, the episode was a winner.
First off, the opening was quite impressive and cinematic (see my interview with Peter Lenkov and Ken Solarz, writers of the episode, for more on the filming of it) with the recreation of that awful day that changed so many lives. The special effects were solid and if the show wanted us to feel like we were there that day, job well done!
But there’s also a story to the episode. Post-flashback, we’re at a Pearl Harbor ceremony on the actual site and, bonus, we get McGarrett in his Navy whites.
Catherine is here... and so is an elderly Japanese man aiming to kill one of the vets from the ceremony. Steve, not letting his whites slow him down, takes the man down and we’re off to 5-0.
The man is David Toriyama (the awesome James Saito) and he feels like he’s met Steve before (or maybe a McGarrett... hmmm??). David was seeking revenge for Ezra Clark (the vet) killing his father in 1943. So, yes, we have a case!
We’re going back to the 1940s where David is a young boy with an older brother, Kenji (Conrad Pratt), who lived on the island with their parents at the time of Pearl Harbor.
At first, it’s a bit jarring that we’re spending so much time in this past story, but Lenkov and Solarz’s writing draws you in quickly and, like the opening, you feel as though you’re getting a piece of history we haven’t seen before. (And a shout out to director Larry Teng, who did great work in making this episode feel less change-of-pace but a fitting piece in the H50 series.)
After Pearl Harbor, we’re shown how the Japanese residents (even if they were American citizens) were unjustly taken from their homes by the government and put into intermittent camps. David’s backstory even says it felt like they were POWs, which is exactly what I thought in watching these scenes.
(Yes, we’re learning history here, folks, and it doesn’t suck!)
David contends his father was murdered but it was covered up because he was Japanese. Truth or not? 5-0 will find out! McG and Cat meet up with the cranky old coot, Ezra Clark, who at first seems like he could be a racist but – shocker – he had a Japanese wife and daughter!
One of the best scenes of the episode takes place between Chin and David. Chin wants to shake his hand for what he’s been through and for being a soldier. Chin reveals he had an Uncle who was also at the camp and there’s a nice understanding between the men. David urges him when he has a family to pass on the story of Pearl Harbor so it’s a story we never forget. (Which is exactly what this episode is doing. Thumbs up!)
The investigation continues with David being taken back to his home where he goes through old pictures and – WTF?! – Steve recognizes his grandfather – who was in the Navy and died during the Pearl Harbor attack - in one of the photos.
(See what they did there bringing the McGarrett lineage into the story?!) We also find out Kenji was killed in Italy during the war and David still misses his brother. McG is going to see if he can help David get an ancient sword back.
Danny is confused. That is all.
Wait. There’s more: Danny (confused by the case) kind-heartedly gives Steve some flack for being a softie and keeping on this case, which Steve says he’s investigating out of honor. The guys show up with Chin at an old storage space where they find some old files from 1943. They do find an old witness report where Ezra Clark is the witness, not the offender but this could still be a cover up!
We get a nice scene where Steve looks at old family photos to see if there’s a David connection and there’s no sign of the sword either. The team takes David out to the site of the intermittent camp to jar his memory on some details. It works and David remembers when his father was killed…and David contends it was Ezra Clark….but evidence from the paperwork show that the cop who may have covered this up was George Rigby.
We go to the Rigby home where his daughter shows them to more old files and there are some twists and turns in the story that leads the team to needing to find the bullet that killed David’s father. And, hey, it’s Max (Masi Oka), who we haven’t seen in awhile! Hi, Max!
In short, they resurrect the body, find the bullet, do some testing and we find out the murderer was not Ezra Clark, they get the sword back (from the now-dead murderer’s Grandson, who had no clue what it was), return it to David, who apologizes to Ezra Clark.
The final button on the episode is Steve back at the USS Arizona and David is there. Turns out Steve’s Grandfather was someone David knew and they even played catch, and David gives Steve the baseball mitt. A nice moment bridging the past and the present and we’re done.
Bravo, 5-0!

This episode was an emotional winner.
That was really amazing and emotional episode with unusual and interesting cold case - to find a killer from 70 years back and a stolen katana. It touched difficult topic of Japaneese attack on Pearl Harbor (impressive opening scene) and the following persecutions of Japaneese Americans - still very hurtful memories for David whose family lost everything. All he was left with was to find the truth. James Saito was fantastic as David and he actually stole the show. There was also a nice reference to Steve's grandfather - now we know who our comander got his first name after. Yes, Steve does have big heart despite his sometimes controversal ways of work.
Danny will have more episodes coming up later in the season, lets stick to the great episode of last night, and not ignore it by bringing something else up. This was done beautifully, by all actors, including Scott Caan. It was a wrong done to fellow Americans that should never be forgotten. Loved the way they tied everything together very neatly. The writing this year has been excellent. James Saito, should get an award, he did a perfect portrayal. Probably the best episode they have done. Not one misstep one this one. Looking forward to the rest of the season and Kono's return.
This is an opinion site. Everyone is just as entitled to their opinions/comments/questions as you. Thanks.
And I expressed my opinion of how people who watch an entire episode, and all they come away with is a knock one of its stars, who did absolutely nothing wrong. Thanks
"James Saito should get an award, he did a perfect portrayal". Absolutely, "probably the best episode they have done". Absolutely. Thanks for expressing what I found so hard to put into words.
I agree also!
agreed
Agree with the earlier comments, episode was well doneand very meaningful.
As far as saying Danny was confused, so am I, about his role. What exactly is he there for anymore? I am not a Danny hater, but I can see where non-Dan-fans are coming from, his character has become, basically, irrelevant.
What's the jig Scott Caan?. Peter Lenkov & Ken Solarz and Larry Teng did a terrific job and must be proud that this episode will air for a year on the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Habor.
WOW, well done, well done. Why not five stars? This episode was most definately perfect. The visual, the mystery, another thank you to the best generation, a thank you to the american japanese and all their efforts to be recognized as good Americans and their horrible treatment by our government and a McGarrett connection. So much going on in this episode. Thank you, I learned alot.I used to be a pretty avid player myself, but sold all my good cards years ago.

I wouldn't trust him with anything really good, though I might be tempted to trade a GU or nice rookie for a Jinzo (he likes machines) or Mirror Force (which i would sock away in case he's still interested when he's a little more able to take good care of them).
Anyway, PM me if you've got cards lying around and tell me what baseball or football you collect. I have much much more good baseball base...My Nonprofit Reviews

COLLEGE PARK, Md. - The 17th-ranked University of Maryland wrestling team competed in public for the first time this season, participating in the annual Red & Black Wrestle-Offs exhibition Friday night at Comcast Pavilion, with the red team defeating the black team, 22-13.
While several projected starters sat out, nationally-ranked wrestlers Steven Bell, Eric Medina and All-American Hudson Taylor all competed.
Junior Brendan Byrne got the black team off to a good start in the opening 125-pound match, taking an 8-3 decision against Lou Ruland, giving the black team a 3-0 lead. Bell then evened the score at 3-3 with a 12-7 decision at 133 pounds against redshirt freshman Matt Bogusz.
Freshman Brian Marcoux put red on top for the first time, winning a 6-2 overtime decision in an exhibition against fellow freshman Mike Hromada.
The 141-pound match figured to be a good one with redshirt junior Alex Krom, who was ranked as high as 13th in the nation two years ago, took on ACC champion Jon Kohler. Krom was impressive in the match, winning a 16-4 major decision to give the black side a 7-6 lead.
Sophomore Eric Medina then won a 9-1 major decision against fifth-year senior Steve Fehnel to put red back on top, 10-7.
The 157-pound tilt was arguably the most important of the evening, as redshirt freshmen Kyle John and Matt MacLean are in a fierce competition for the starting job. The match was tight and low-scoring, with John eventually posting a 4-0 victory, tying the overall score at 10-10.
The red team took the next two matches, with freshman Danny Bichner winning an overtime decision against freshman Shawn Mazzarone, 3-2, followed by a major decision for freshman Corey Peltier, 16-2, against sophomore Patrick Klenkel.
Freshman Owen Smith won a 7-3 decision against freshman Chris Lloyd at 184 pounds, putting the score at 17-13 for the red team heading into the final match.
Taylor put forth an impressive effort against redshirt freshman Tommy Sitar at 197 pounds, winning by technical fall, 18-2, nine seconds into the third period.
The Terps begin the regular season next Saturday at the Fighting Scot Duals in Edinboro, Pa. Maryland will compete in a trio of duals against Army, Findlay and Edinboro.

4. Orlovsky regained whatever ground he last last week as the backup with a real nice game.
5. Ebron and Van Noy both had very good games and made big plays.
7. Fairly looks like a tub of lard. I tried to focus on him. Twice I saw him get handled easily by the Oakland 2nd stringers.
8. Broyles has been playing great. If he stays healthy he's going to help our team.
9. Bush & Bell have two RB slots locked up. I'm guessing we'll keep 4 half backs. Seems like Riddick and Wynn are probably in the lead for those.
10. LMAO at Oakland playing their starters through the end of the game.
BookmarksDeath of the Salesmen: The Geeks Did It
- 04/24/2012
- Business Intelligence
- 1
The history of business is marked by innovations meant to reduce the dependency on salespeople.
In the medieval era, when traveling peddlers risked robbery and murder on lonely roads, enterprising souls hosted fairs as a way of drawing customers to a central (and presumably safer) location. But those oh-so-convenient fairs also rendered it more difficult for your average peddler to make a living, if he insisted on sticking with his travel circuit.
Centuries later, the rise of mail-order catalogs—and then e-commerce—ended the careers of many a traveling salesperson. (Willy Loman never stood a chance, in any case.)
And now, in the first years of the 21st century, a combination of Big Data, predictive analytics and social networking might make salespeople (at least as we know them) obsolete once and for all.
Traditionally, salespeople identify potential prospects and induce them into consuming a particular item or service. As social networking evolves, it’s become a lot easier to apply analytics software to the treasure trove of Big Data repositories in a way that not only improves the identification of potential customers, but also what the latter will actually buy.
As a result of that, marketing organizations (which have an affinity for analytics software) are not only taking over the task of identifying potential prospects; they’ve become more adept at identifying which customers are likely to buy or upgrade a product or service at any given point in time. Marketing organizations then pass on the data to customer service representatives, rather than salespeople.
According to Esteban Kolsky, principal and founder of the market research firm ThinkJar, the end result of that shift is marketing and customer service quickly taking over more of the responsibilities traditionally handled by salespeople, sharply reducing the latter’s numbers.
Vinay Iyer, vice president of global marketing at SAP, takes that proposition one step further by suggesting that, at some point soon, the need for salespeople could disappear entirely: “As predictive analytics gets better, the whole lead generation process will be transformed.”
To help facilitate the transformation, SAP will soon release SAP Account Intelligence, an application that analyzes internal and external data about customers in real time using the SAP High Performance Analytics Appliance (HANA) in-memory computing platform as a cloud computing service.
SAP Account Intelligence allows companies to aggregate all customer information inside one data source, which the user can leverage (via automated recommendation engines) to determine what goods and services that customer will need next. Applications such as SAP Account Intelligence herald a new era of customer experience management that will redefine business roles across the entire organization.
Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst at the Altimeter Group, thinks the transformation will take some time to play out, but that eventually the shifting of responsibilities will concentrate more power in the hands of companies’ chief marketing officer. It could very well spark the fundamental restructuring of business operations as marketing, sales and customer service functions continue to converge.
“The rules are changing as companies embrace more strategic approaches to managing customers,” he said.
Furthermore, companies are becoming more adept at leveraging social media and other sources of data to create “social graphs” that not only identify all the relevant decision-makers within an organization, but also their interests and locations—and ultimately the best “moment of opportunity” to reach out to them. That information, Owyang added, is utilized to create relationships with potential customers that have much more context than most salespeople, trying to drive a specific transaction, could ever possess.
Larry Augustin, CEO of SugarCRM, a provider of open source customer relationship management (CRM) software, believes it’s already pretty clear that CRM software is necessarily evolving into applications that aggregate all the information related to managing the customer experience. “CRM will evolve into an application category that will go way beyond being a tool for managing the sales staff,” he said.
Of course, the transformational pace depends on the rate at which marketers in various vertical industries become more IT savvy, as well as how closely they can work with their IT colleagues. That aside, new IT tools will surely alter the way sales are both conducted and managed. The only question is whether the Willy Lomans of the world will resist the shift, and for how long.

For example, Bush was not supposed to return punts in his first game back, Payton conceded, and the Saints paid dearly for having to use Bush in that role after wide receiver Lance Moore had trouble with the lights in Cowboys Stadium. Bush fumbled a punt in the third quarter, and the Cowboys ensuing touchdown pulled them within 3 points, 23-20.
"We'll get him more and more work as he progresses," Payton said Thursday.
After practice Wednesday Bush said he feels, "great."
The picture for the Saints three days before facing the Bengals in Cincinnati appeared to indicate a bigger role for Bush would be welcome, as running back Ladell Betts remains out of practice and running back Pierre Thomas, though more active than he has been in weeks, remains limited.Keith Primeau is one of those athletes that one watches when they want to learn about the nuances of sport. Tall and sinewy like a forward in basketball, it’s plain to see that Primeau will do almost anything if it means that his hockey team will win one more game. Whether it’s his off-ice preparation spent with hours on the stationary bike in the team’s training room, or with lap after monotonous lap up and down the bleacher steps in the Wachovia Center after a game, count on Primeau doing the work. Don’t exclude the team-bonding grunt work, either. As the Flyers’ captain, Primeau takes on the responsibility of helping a new teammate find a place to stay and showing him around his new town. He also organizes the team parties, gauges the team’s mood and acts as an intermediary with the coaches and team brass, and has the thankless task of being front and center for the press every day. “I learned a long time ago that my job is not just to perform on the ice,” Primeau said in an interview a few years ago. “So much more goes into your professional being as a hockey player. Media relations, public relations – I accept this. If I can deflect some of the attention away from the younger guys and allow them to play, I’ll do that.” The same goes for the intangibles on the ice, as well. In that regard, Primeau is one of those players whose true worth is not seen in the every day box scores. Maybe he’ll block a goalie’s view by positioning himself just so in the slot so that Simon Gagne can blast one. Maybe he can deliver a check that pries the puck loose in the offensive zone to set up a goal. Or maybe he can sense that the team needs a pick-me-up and gets into a fight. One instance of Primeau picking a fight that stands out more so than any other was the little tête-à-tête with the Devils’ Randy McKay in Game 2 of the 2000 Eastern Conference Finals. During the second period where New Jersey was skating circles around the Flyers and were on the verge of taking a 2-0 lead in the series, Primeau took the bumping with McKay as an invitation to do something. So before the crowd at the First Union Center (that’s what the building was called back then) knew what happened, Primeau dropped his gloves, rolled up his sleeves, checked to make sure his helmet was fastened and called McKay out. It wasn’t important whether or not Primeau beat McKay. The message was loud and clear. “I thought our team needed a spark,” Primeau said at the time. But that scrap came barely a week after Primeau suffered a concussion in a game in Pittsburgh. Though he was carted off the ice on a stretcher and rushed to the hospital after taking a big hit from Pittsburgh’s Bob Boughner, Primeau missed just one game and envisioned his wife. “I’m a father and a husband, but at the same time I’m a hockey player… “ Maybe that’s why Primeau has merely decided to put his career on hold six years and at least three head injuries later. He is a hockey player. In fact, Primeau still had not decided whether he was going to shut it down for the season just a day before his emotional press conference last Tuesday. Primeau says he is sitting out with the hope of prolonging his career, which is a great. It’s hard not to root for a man like Primeau. But when he admitted that he still had post-concussion symptoms from the head injury he suffered last Oct. 25, maybe the writing is on the wall. In fact just the term concussion softens what the affliction really is – medical people call them traumatic brain injuries. Needless to say, multiple brain injuries could result in the most of dire circumstances. Still, we hope that Primeau can recover in time for training camp next September, and we hope to see him back out there on the ice real soon. But not at the expense of being a father and a husband.Ferris State University’s Local 1609 American Federation of State,

Roseman was also issued citations for the traffic violations and a summons to appear in court on the possession of marijuana charge.Halloween is a great time to explore dark subjects, and plague is certainly a dark subject. Bubonic plague or "black death" ravaged Europe and killed off nearly half of the human population of Europe during the middle ages. There were so many dead that they were buried in huge pits.
Plague still exists today but can be cured with antibiotics. Scientists wondered whether the modern plague is the same as the one that ravaged Europe or some milder form. Since flu is constantly mutating, they wondered if plague does the same - and whether it could return some day with devastating consequences.
Using skeletons unearthed from a mass grave of British plague victims, researchers were able to extract DNA of the plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis) from victims' bones and teeth. From this they were able to sequence the genome and found that the plague that exists today is almost completely unchanged. That means that if antibiotics had existed six or seven hundred years ago, millions of lives could have been saved.
Plague is spread by the bites of the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopsis. Without treatment, bubonic plague will kill about half of all infected people within days. Rat fleas are found not just on rats, but also on other rodents including mice, prairie dogs, chipmunks and ground squirrels.
When a flea bites an infected rodent, it picks up plague bacteria, which multiply in its digestive tract until the flea's stomach is blocked. The flea gets hungrier and hungrier because it cannot digest, so it bites its host animal more and more. It takes in host blood, and bacteria enter the blood. Since the flea's stomach is blocked, the flea regurgitates the blood back into the host animal. When this happens, the rodent is infected with plague and soon dies.
Ordinarily, rat fleas prefer to stay on rats and other rodents. However, when large numbers of rodents start dying off, the fleas move to other animals that are handy, including humans.
During the Middle Ages, people lived in generally filthy conditions, particularly in cities. Conditions were crowded, and sanitation was nonexistent. There were open latrines and garbage was tossed everywhere. This was a perfect environment for rats.
Something else was going on during this time as well. For whatever reason, years before the plague even appeared, religious leaders were arousing the public against cats, calling them servants of the devil. Possibly this is because cats are independent and like to wander around and yowl at night.
Many unmarried women who lived alone practiced herbal medicine, and they often kept cats for companions. They, and their cats, were frequently accused of witchcraft and killed. When the plague appeared, these women usually were not infected because their cats kept rats away from their homes. Of course, that made superstitious people even more sure that they were practicing witchcraft, so even more so-called witches and their cats were killed. This lead to the slaughter of much of Europe's cat population. Many dogs also were killed during this time. With the lack of predators, even more rats thrived.
Plague outbreaks come and go in waves. Weather is a factor, as is the death of host animals. There is always a certain percent of rats that are immune to plague. They carry it in their systems and keep it going for years until conditions are right for another outbreak.
There have been several large outbreaks of plague in various parts of the world over the years, including a widespread epidemic in China and India at the close of the 19th century. There was a plague outbreak in Los Angeles in the 1920s.
As recently as last year, a campground in Los Angeles County was closed because a ground squirrel tested positive for plague bacteria. About five to 10 cases are reported in the U.S. every year, usually in the southwest. Plague has not been found in Austral- Elementary Art Exhibit @ Grand Blanc-McFarlen Library (May 22, )

I’m a proactive, integrative wellness veterinarian.
Proactive medicine is the practice of medicine as nature intended. It involves identifying and removing lifestyle and health obstacles before disease occurs.
Unfortunately, the majority of veterinarians in the United States are trained to be reactive. Their approach is to:
Integrative veterinary medicine recognizes healing as a process that is different for each animal. There’s no such thing as effective “cookie cutter” medicine.
The beauty of the integrative approach is it embraces the art of medicine. It recognizes your pet’s body as unique, and the goal of the practitioner or veterinarian is to identify what form of healing best resonates with your pet.
Believe it or not, the concept of wellness in veterinary medicine is quite new.
It’s important to keep the following in mind:
Wellness is not just the lack of symptoms or lack of disease.
Wellness is making key, consistent, lifestyle choices that improve the quality of your pet’s well-being.
I hope you’ll think of me as your proactive, integrative wellness veterinarian on the internet.
I look forward to partnering with you to create abundant health for all the animals in your life.

Comment deleted violating the aspect of our terms of use(Newport Beach, CA) -- A 1956 Topps Jackie Robinson card is now part of marketplace history. On March 9, 2004 it was registered as the seven millionth sports card graded by Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), a division of Collectors Universe, Inc.
The card is graded PSA NM-MT 8, and the historic serial number, 07000000, is printed on the encapsulation holder's insert.
The milestone was reached about a year after PSA recorded its sixth millionth card, and a little over 12 years since the company received its first sports card submission in July of 1991.
"This is an amazing landmark for PSA and it confirms PSA's position in the marketplace as the leader in 3rd party authentication and grading. When PSA first started, it took some time before dealers and collectors realized the benefits of 3rd party involvement. When they did, the demand skyrocketed. We reached our one millionth card in 1998 and have graded another six million cards since. The consumers have made it abundantly clear that PSA is here to stay and we appreciate all the support we have enjoyed during our nearly 13-year run," said Joe Orlando, President and Editor of Sports Market Report magazine.
"We think the card market is a better place now for consumers because of third-party grading, and we're glad we were a big part of the revolution. Peace of mind is what we provide and, without a sense of security, it can be a dangerous place for prospective buyers. Our success is based on credibility and trust."
The milestone card, a 1956 Topps Jackie Robinson card (#30) was submitted by Doug Diggs of Freemont, California.
Orlando personally contacted Diggs to surprise him with the news that his card was something extraordinary for the company and to share the significant achievement with him.
Orlando believes the milestone underscores the strength of the high-quality sports collectibles market as well as third-party grading.
"The market for high-quality sports collectibles is excellent. Even when the economy fluctuates, the premium items never seem to have a problem finding a home because of the inherent desirability associated with them. Quality has always been the key. We are currently authenticating and/or grading over 100,000 collectibles per month, which includes the grading of cards and game tickets as well as the examination of autographs and game-used bats," he said.
Among the seven million cards submitted to PSA over the past 12-plus years are several of the world's most valuable sports cards, including the finest known T-206 Honus Wagner card (PSA Near Mint-Mint 8) which set a record at a MastroNet auction in the summer of 2000 -- selling for $1.265 million.
PSA estimates the total declared value of the seven million cards submitted to be nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars.

In my defense, I was tired.
Now, I know I had just blogged about exercising and watching what I was eating.
But, it was late (well, not night owl late, but late, nonetheless). I had just gotten home from choir where my voice had single-handedly shattered three stained glass windows.
I was sitting at the computer, and without thinking, reached for the can of whipped cream. I just needed a little dollop to quell my craving for sweets.
So I squirted some out of the can and popped it in my mouth.
And, that’s when it hit me, this was not whipped cream. That’s still in the refrigerator.
This was …

SEPT. 28, 2007--Geology professors, students and teachers from Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin will convene at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls Oct. 5-7 for the 68th Annual Tri-State Geological Field Conference to explore a range of geologic topics spanning the Phanerozoic Time.
Participants will observe several lower Paleozoic rock units and discuss stratigraphy, weathering and paleokarst features. They will also visit an interesting structure present within pre-Wisconsinan glacial deposits in a gravel pit. The use of the on-campus stream valley as a hydrogeology teaching laboratory will be presented. A special car-caravan field trip will take participants to the Rock Elm Disturbance, an ancient extraterrestial (meteorite) impact structure located southeast of River Falls.
In addition to the conference, UWRF is combining the Rock Elm trip with their biannual UWRF geology alumni field trip.
Kerry Keen (above, right), UWRF geology professor and co-chair of the conference, says that hosting an event such as this is a win-win experience for both students and faculty. "It's also a give-and-take experience where the visitors will share other perspectives and ideas that will broaden our understanding of geology," said Keen.
UWRF students gain valuable experience in assisting with conference preparations and have the opportunity to engage with participants from other institutions, says Keen.
The conference rotates between the three states each year and provides the ability to see the similarities and differences between rock units across the Midwest. "It's critical for our geology students to get out and explore geology in the field," said Keen. "The university has one of the best representation at these conferences, and Mike Middleton and I chose to host the conference because of all the benefits we have received from attending past conferences."
Conference attendees will also view the new University Center, where the non-field events will take place. Keen said hosting it at the UC will align with the plan to introduce the idea of sustainability and green initiatives for the tri-state conferences by taking steps to reduce waste, recycle more, and re-use items connected with the field conference wherever possible.
For more information about attending the conference, please contact Sue Freiermuth in the UWRF department of plant and earth science at 715-425-3345.

PRESS RELEASE: Direct from Environmental Education Association of South Carolina
TreesGreenville was honored today as the Non-Profit Organization of the Year by the Environmental Education Association of South Carolina at the organization’s annual summer conference, held this year at Seabrook Island.
EEASC works to support both formal and informal educators across the state in bringing environmental programming to students and communities. At their annual conference, awards are presented to Environmental Educator of the Year, Green Business of the Year, Non-profit Organization of the Year, Legislative Official of the Year, and Outstanding Youth. Past honorees include Upstate Forever, Naturalist Rudy Mancke, and Rick Huffman, founder of the South Carolina Native Plant Society.
TreesGreenville was selected as Non-Profit of the Year based on the organization’s extensive education outreach, which includes a standards-based companion curriculum for use in elementary, middle and high school classrooms, the Play in the Shade program, and hands-on plantings at schools throughout Greenville County.
TreesGreenville has planted trees at more than 35 Greenville County schools, with the vast majority being educational tree plantings conducted during the school day with the help of students and parent volunteers who are taught the importance of trees and how to properly plant and care for them.
Tree gardens were installed at Fountain Inn Elementary, League Middle, Sevier Middle and JL Mann High School. These outdoor learning centers were designed to serve as models for schools throughout the district, region, and state interested in encouraging teachers to take their class outside.
“The more students are sitting in front of laptops and texting instead of talking, the more important it is to get students outdoors to learn the importance of good clean air and clean water and how man can easily upset the balance,” says Mary Lou Jones, retired educator and founding board member of TreesGreenville. “We found that getting students outside and teaching them directly using the environment dramatically impacts the amount of learning that goes on. Students don’t forget those lessons.”
To further enhance the educational impact of these gardens, TreesGreenville developed a companion curriculum available to all teachers throughout the county seeking to incorporate the environment into their lesson plans while still adhering to state standards.
Recess is another important component of the school day for young children, but the dangers of overheated playground equipment and the increased incidence of skin cancer among children often leads to keeping kids indoors on extremely hot days. TreesGreenville’s Play in the Shade program addresses the dearth of shade trees on playgrounds in Greenville County, having planted more than 2,400 trees at parks and schools since the initiative was launched in the fall of 2008.
TreesGreenville supports the Greenville Council of Garden Club’s Urban Forestry education program aimed at third graders in Greenville County schools by providing a tree and educational planting to each school that sponsors the program for its students. More than 50 trees have been planted at local schools through this partnership.
The.
TreesGreenville is a membership based nonprofit founded in 2005. Their mission is to plant, promote, and protect trees. TreesGreenville volunteers have planted more than 3,000 trees in parks, schools, and neighborhoods throughout Greenville County. For more information visit their website,Yesterday was a really big day. Not sure if my partner was more nervous than me or the other way around. I think he might have been given he was the one going ‘under the knife’.
We’d waited a few weeks, Peter had done all the tests required and finally the day came for his stent operation. We headed off early for the Medical Centre which is over an hours drive away. An easy drive ’cause we managed to miss peak hour traffic plus finding a car park on site is not a problem and reasonably cheap. Even if it was costly, I’d pay for the convenience, though.
We literally walked in the door and Peter’s phone rang. It was the hospital saying the op had to be postponed until next Monday. There must have been an emergency. It does state in the notes that this can happen and you pray it doesn’t, but….it did. But really, just as we had arrived? Arrgghh! What a let down. There’s a lot of anticipation & angst around any sort of op but particularly one relating to the heart.
The irony was that Peter spoke to someone from the hospital when we were only half way there and She apparently should have put Peter through to someone else. Communication breakdown.
Peter turned around to leave for home straight away, but I had just driven all the way there and suggested a coffee so we sat down and drank what must have been the worst coffee I’ve ever had. It seemed silly to waste the day especially when we rarely have time together without Charlotte so I suggested we go shopping for spices in the local Asian stores.
Perfect thing to do! It lifted our spirits somewhat. There were so many spices at dirt cheap prices to choose from and I
think we purchased from most of the stores. The other great thing was the Op (Opportunity not operation lol) shopping.
One of my passions. By the days end even I was Op shopped out but not before some great purchases were made and I was surprised at Peter’s enthusiasm for the Op shopping, too.
Despite feelings of being incredibly let down and it came in waves throughout the day for me, we managed to make the most of our time together. Events took a bit of a nosedive later in the day, but balanced out again in the evening.
One of the things that helped me overcome the disappointment was knowing that postponing Peter’s appointment meant someone with a more serious problem may have filled it and a life may have been saved.
So we now wait to go through the angst again next Monday and this time we’ll phone the hospital prior to leaving. Of course emergencies can still happen but we’ll be more prepared for the possibility next time.
NB : Op shops here in Australia are called Thrift stores in other countries.

Coming to grips with the contraception kerfuffle; and Colvin v. DSK

Mr. Cushing: Like many, I am really tired of your constant attacks on the Christian faith, and in particular, on the Catholic Church. I am sure you purposefully picked today, Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, for your latest attack on my religion. Shame on you.
Your comment, "Who really represents the Church on this issue?" is ridiculous. The Church rules are set by the Bishops and Vatican officials, and our core values and dogma are not changed weekly by popular vote, like some type of reality show.
Fact is, it is offensive for President Obama to try to force his liberal agenda on our religious beliefs and practices. Approximately 20% of all hospital patients in the U.S. receive care from a Catholic run hospital, and millions of hospital employees work for Catholic run hospital. President Obama is trying to force us to abandon our religious beliefs and practices by funding programs and coverages that are in direct opposition to our religion.
I am proud to be Catholic, proud of my religious beliefs, and tired of your hateful rants. I think this very issue may push many Catholics into voting against President Obama in the next election, as he underestimates how important this matter is to us.
By the way, do you have any idea how many students in the U.S. attend Catholic schools, that are funded 100% by the Catholic Church, with no funds coming from the government? The public schools are so overcrowded, so underfunded already, can you imagine how worse off they would be if they did not have the Catholic Schools to greatly reduce the public school population for them?
Do you have any idea how many catholic run charities, orphanages, senior centers, my church funds in the U.S.? Once again, if it was not for my Church, the government would be saddled with even more expenses and debts to try to manage.
But instead of ever writing about all the fantastic things my Church does, you pick Ash Wednesday, to take a cheap shot at my religion, and for my Church standing up to President Obama's attack on our religious practices.
More than ever, on Ash Wednesday, we can only hope, that your columns of hate "are dust, and to dust they shall return".

I used to look to the Express for local news which I felt more closely reflected the differing and varied views of our area, both conservative and liberal. I am convinced that the Express is also going the way of the "main stream" media and that the editorial staff is promoting a liberal agenda. I too am a Catholic and deeply committed to our faith. I am so tired of being attacked for my faith. I think it is time for a new local publication to be started. One that accurately reflects all views of the area, not just those on the Left.

In the 20th Century we are arguing about the necessity for birth control? This must all be a bad dream. Aside from the obvious need to limit population growth, don't social conservatives realize that with absolute certainty there is an inverse relation between the amount of birth control practiced and the number of abortions performed?
Are religions that promote harmful social agendas, set among others by "Bishops and Vatican officials" still thoroughly stuck in the middle ages, to be immune from all criticism? The Founding Fathers must be rolling in their graves.

Dear Editor and Tom,
We must wonder if commentators read Tom's presentation or simply reacted to the questioning of purpose of points of view. As is often the case, commentators respond to that which was not said.
Certainly, presenting history of religion and birth control can illustate the difference between doctrine and actual practice. Such is fair illustration. What must be decided is the rights of women under our constitution without consideration of religion as separate for matters of state.
A quite simple answer is availability of services without religious restriction. A woman's body is her own decision within her own relationship with the spirit that guides her and the medical professionals that service that guidance.
Is that not just that simple?

I fail to see how this article or the latest issue on contraception is an attack on religion or specifically the Catholic Church. Contraception is a choice, just as religion is a choice. Neither is mutually exclusive for the individual. No church or individual who subscribes to a religious belief is being forced to endorse contraception, only that it be provided for those who choose it. The Catholic Church does a lot of good in the world, without question. But that does not give it the right to dictate its terms or religious beliefs to any individual who chooses not to accept them. If a church wants to do good, as a business, as a hospital, even without tax benefits, the legalities and choices of the individual are not subject to the religious dictates of a church or a religion. Religious belief cannot be enforced and choice for contraception or anything that is legal, is a freedom cherised by Americans not an attack on religion or an enforcement for it to change its beliefs. Perhaps more simply put, priests are not being asked to hand out condoms. Hospitals and health services are merely being asked to provide a chosen health option that all similar institutions legitimately provide.

The Catholic Church is not preventing anyone from buying contraceptives. If you want the pill, get a prescription, go down to Walmart and buy it. Isn't it really that simple?
I do not subscribe to any religion and certainly cannot understand how anyone can possibly believe in Christianity, let alone the Catholic Church.
On the other hand, do we really need the Federal government telling us what should and should not be included in our private medical insurance contracts?
What's next? Will the federal government tell us that all health insurance programs must now on cover free broccoli for everyone, as eating broccoli will reduce healthcare costs?

Those that are staunchly Catholic have a real bone to pick with the current administration as they see evil and attacks everywhere when none exists. Taking on an issue such as birth control is so patently ridiculous as to be laughable. It just points out how organized religion and hypocrisy go hand in hand. It takes men to decide what women really need and want so just sit back and take it? OUr constitution provided freedom from religion as well so I don't want the Catholic Church or any right wig evangelical group sticking their nose in my life and business.

Based on the vehemence of commenters 1 and 2, I thought some introspection might be in order. I ran a word-check on these 32 Raucous Caucuses, containing about 25,000 words. The word/root "Catholic" appears four times, three above and once in praise of JFK's brilliant speech to the Houston protestant clergy. Check it out here: Web Link (text), or here: Web Link (youtube). If you run a similar search on this website as a whole, there are more than 500 such references by others. Presumably, many of those were complimentary.
Also, when I am critical of religion -- which I respect, participate-in and also fear, it is never to suggest that others shouldn't believe whatever they want, and govern their lives accordingly. But when religion departs the spiritual realm and enters the public policy sphere in an organized way, then to debate the merits of tenets it seeks to impose on others is (very) fair game, in my view. Important, too, that it not get a special hall pass in that regard, as it is just another Interest Group in the hurly burly of politics. Contraception policy and Prop 8 are two such instances; they evoke my fear.
As to the provision of counterpoint material, ANYone can post to this Town Square forum. I am guessing that Madame Editor would be happy to host such a regular blog in response to my musings, or just on topics of concern to many who sit to my right. It's a big internet -- fire away!
Finally, the blog posted on Wednesday because that's the day it's due. I did not consider yesterday's parochial significance. In candor, it would not have made any difference, as explained above.

Tom, you are so funny.
Catholics and their charities were minding their own business when suddenly out of nowhere the Obama Administration starts dictating the terms of what can and cannot be included in their private health insurance contracts.
Catholics objected and you characterize that as "imposing their views on others" and entering "the public policy sphere."
Isn't just the opposite occurring? Isn't the Obama Administration imposing their views on contraception on the Catholic Church and their charities?
Everyone is free to buy all the contraceptives they want. It's easy and cheap. The Catholic Church isn't stopping that.
Why don't you "big government" supporters stop imposing your values on others?

spcwt, you are so funny! What you describe as "suddenly out of nowhere the the Obama Administration starts dictating..." has been the law in California for over a decade. No one is imposing views on the Catholic Church (by which you mean the male hierarchy of the church, as opposed to its members.) The law simply prevents the top management of institutions like hospitals and colleges - all of which receive government funding, directly or indirectly - from imposing their views on people who work in those institutions and may not share those views.
Why don't you religious zealots stop trying to impose your values on others?

Dear Huh?,
This is the first time the Federal government has dictated that private employers like the Catholic Church and its charities must provide contraception coverage to employees in their healthcare plans. They gave no warning that they were going to impose this policy.
The Catholic Church isn't imposing their views on anyone. As I said, people can go to Walmart and purchase all the contraceptives they want. No one is stopping them.
Finally, perhaps you didn't read the posts above. I'm not religious.

Requiring the inclusion of an Option -- one sought by 99+% of the relevant customer base, should not be confused with an actual big government imposition on anyone.
Your limitation of your statement to the "Federal" level of government is also instructive. In the year 2000, the State of New Hampshire (motto: "Live Free of Die") enacted an identical requirement for all health plans offered in their state. The legislation was sponsored by (get this) Republicans in the Legislature, and signed by the (this, too) a Democratic Governor! NObody thought to complain about it -- nobody.
Despite this (1) horrible imposition on religious freedom, and (2) ugly display of bi-partisan cooperation in the public interest, neither Judgment Day nor the apocalypse has ensued.
That's Some war.

Tom,
The apocalypse never came because it's never going to come. Newsflash: Jesus was just a man. Get over it.
The "culture war" is partly a subset of the bigger question of how much power you want to give Washington DC to manage our daily lives.
You Democrats generally want to give Washington ever expanding amounts of power to regulate our lives. Fortunately, only a minority of Americans (31%) consider themselves as Democrats.
The vast majority of Americans dislike big government, particularly Washington. We don't like being told what to do.
So, while we may think Catholics' views on birth control are irrational, we believe their views should be respected so long as they do not prevent people who want to get contraceptives and abortions from doing so. Live and let live.
a resident of Danville

You continue, studiously methinks, to confuse an option with an exercise of power. Unless you are a health insurance plan (are they people, too?), nothing, repeat not-a-thing-at-all is being required of you. You, as a living, breathing sexual being may still buy your contraceptives at Walmart, if you so choose.
Please note, Chicken Little, that the sky did not fall on New Hampshire, either.

Tom,
Not clear what you mean that I "confuse an option with an exercise of power."
The Federal government told the Catholic Church and its charities that the health insurance plans they provide their employees must include free contraception coverage.
In other words, Washington DC told the Catholic Church what to do.
How is that not an exercise of power by the Federal government?

This issue has less to do with religious freedom than it does with economic freedom. What right does the government have to order a private company to provide a good or service "free of charge"?
Our President must think we are nation of morons to believe this policical spin. Insurance companies have, by definition, no money except what they collect from their policy holders.
The President's dicate that all policy holders must pay for birth control whether they personally use it or not is just plain wrong. Regardless of whether you think it is morally wrong, this is an unfair imposition on the American people.
No one should be forced by our government to pay for something they do not wish to purchase.

SPCWT: I am not a "religious nutjob", but rather a proud Catholic, who loves my religion, my faith is very important to me, and I am tired of the Tom Cushings of the world who think it is acceptable to write his hate piece about my faith on Ash Wednesday. Cushing reminds me of a liberal professor I had at Santa Clara Law School over 20 years ago, who complained that there was a crucifix on the wall at this Jesuit, Catholic University.
First, the government thinks they can mandate that Catholic run institutions must offer health insurance that covers services that are directly in opposition to their core religious beliefs. When they challenge this, the Tom Cushings of the world attack them, and attack their actual religious beliefs, with his flippant comment about "who actually speaks for the Church".
What is next, is the government going to tell us that we can not allow the blessed wine sacrament be given during mass to anyone under the age of 21? I am sure Mr. Cushing would jump into that fray, writing a piece, maybe on Easter, attacking Catholics for challenging the government. After all, apparently Mr. Cushings believes that our founding fathers had no concerns about government interfering with our right to practice our religion, and our right to religious freedom, without government intrusion.
But, SPCWT, appreciate the Amicus Curiae brief. Reach same decision, for different reasons.

Darn it -- just when the mood was lightening up a bit...
I'm aghast that we're entertaining this conversation on the Feast Day of St. Modestus. That said, I can assure my fellow Danvillain that I am neither a plural, nor a strawman on whose positions he is free to speculate. I'll find me-own words, thanks. There'll be enough there with which he may take issue.
I do, for example, think it's worth considering whether a doctrine that is honored in the breach by the entire flock, less 1%, should be considered a "core religious belief" of that group. The Bishops may believe it, but they have isolated themselves on this issue, with a few amici and other fellow travelers who have their own reasons. I am very confident that the 99% will vote their actions, in the booth and in the pharmacy.
I also think that since these health plan requirements have been around at the state level for more than a decade, there is something other than piety that drives the current indignation. Folks are welcome to self-examine on that score.
a resident of Danville

I actually don't view this issue as being primarily one of religion. The underlying core issue is whether the government can force organizations to behave as the government wants, and be forced to pay for things that the government decides are "good for us".
By requiring health insurance companies to offer ONLY policies that include/cover contraception, the government is effectively forcing anyone who wants health insurance to also pay for contraception coverage. It is one thing to require health insurers to offer at least some plans that include contraception. It is another thing entirely to require that ALL plans include contraception. This basically takes away our freedom of choice.
If the government can require that ALL health plans provide contraception coverage, then there are all sorts of other things that they could require health plans to do, such as:
- require rate discounts based on weight or body-mass index
- ban coverage for smokers
- and, dare I say it, require coverage for abortions.
All of the above may well make sense for an insurance company to offer as options, or to offer plans of various types, with and without specific coverages. But to require ALL plans to behave in a certain way represents a huge attack on personal freedom and liberty.

I see that C.R. Mudgeon is using the slippery slope argument. I believe that the "government can force organizations to behave as the government wants, and be forced to pay for things that the government decides are 'good for us'".
The United States is a republic, in which it's power to govern, is exercised by representatives chosen directly by its citizens. Once upon a time, our over reaching government required auto makers to install seat belts (it took years to do so). We, the people, were given the opportunity to voice our opinion on such a requirement, through the ballot box.
I think that on November 6th, the people will render their verdict. I believe that the vast majority will conclude that this is a contraception issue, which has little to do with first amendment rights.
Rick Santorum brags, "One of the things I will talk about is, I think, the dangers of contraception in this country...Many of the Christian faith have said, 'Well, that's okay.' It's not okay. It's a license to do things in a sexual relm that is counter to how things are supposed to be." To which I take notice and say, "I also believe in the slippery slope argument."
I lament that the cultural war that is being waged by Senator Santorum is a war I thought was settled on this particular issue. I thought it was settled when the Brits dropped the big one on us, the 1964 invasion of the Beatles. Now, it's 1956, all over again, and the cultural crusaders want us to listen to Pat Boone records.
If you want to come to the public arena of healthcare, the affiliates of the Catholic Church have to play by a different set of rules. And this is coming from a proud Catholic, who values contraceptives and the power of the ballot.

I love Mr. Cushings comments in this fairly entrenched right wing Republican community. I also love to see the few liberals incense the Catholic flock that rush to defend the right of the minority to inflict it's biased and religiously based ideology on the rest of us. They don't want separation of Church and State that want the religious folks to tell the rest of us how to behave, how to control our bodies and what place a women should have in our society. The Santorum supporters in this community are about to crash and burn.

Regarding Mark Patrick Brown's comment on my post - I understand your point that laws are passed all the time that limit choices, with seatbelt laws being one example. And you're right - this is to some extent a "slippery slope" argument. A strict Libertarian (which I am not) might argue that seat belt laws are also an infringement of personal liberty. But there ARE significant differences between this situation and seat belt laws. 1) Seat belt laws are state law(s), and there is nothing in the US constitution that would allow the federal government to impose a seat belt law. (Which of course is also part of the argument against the federal government's involvement in many areas...) 2) One of the legal arguments in support of state seat belt laws is that they are only applicable on public roads, and therefore it is OK for the state (or local govts., for that matter) to establish rules related to use of those roads. You cannot be forced to wear seatbelts while driving on your own private property.
Tom Cushing keeps trying to say that this is only about requiring the OPTION of contraceptive use. But of course that contention is missing the point, and is misleading (whether he is intentionally choosing to mislead, or doesn't understand the issue fully, I don't presume to know). Sure, individual employees are free to decide either to use, or not use, the option of contraception. But the real issue is that by requiring all insurance companies to include free contraception as a benefit in ALL of their offered plans, they are effectively forcing the Catholic Church to pay for the benefit. It would be different if the law only required insurance companies to offer at least one plan that included free contraception (although arguments could also be made against even this, more limited law). Then market forces would decide if insurance companies would offer a "without contraception" versions of their plans, to organizations such as the Catholic Church that have objections. Once again, the folks who claim to be about "choice" want there to be only one choice - theirs....
For the record, and not that it is anyone's business - I am not Catholic, and my spouse and I have used various forms of contraception throughout our lives, several of which are/were not acceptable to the Catholic Church. I say this only to avoid the inevitable comments about wanting to "force my religious views on others"....Glaciers online

Hosted by MetanetMr. Jones said he found Maj. Weirick to be “a man of integrity” and asked whether the commandant had reprimanded Mr. Hogue for his “slanderous comments comparing Maj. Weirick to the Navy Yard shooter.”
“Sir, when I look at what has happened, both in the James Clement situation and having talked to Maj. Weirick on numerous occasions over the past five months, it is disappointing that the integrity of this Marine — and I would include Capt. James Clement as well — have had to take the attacks that have come out of the office, whether it’s you or people around you, that they’ve done everything they could to destroy two — the integrity of two Marines,” the congressman said.
Mr. Jones asked Gen. Amos for a written reply to a series of questions within six weeks.
Top Pentagon civilians, including Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, have vouched for Gen. Amos.
“A lot of committee members commended Gen. Amos for his service, and I want to say that it has been one of the high honors of my life to serve with Jim Amos as the commandant,” Mr. Mabus, the Navy secretary, said after the hearing, according to the Marine Corps Times. “I think he is a man of absolute integrity.

The Women of Homer
Built of Books: How Reading Defined the Life of Oscar Wilde
1.
When asked what he intended to do after finishing at Oxford, the young Oscar Wilde—who was already well known not only for his outré persona (“I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china,” etc.), but for his brilliant achievements as a classics scholar—made it clear in which direction his ambitions lay. “God knows,” the twenty-three-year-old told his great friend David Hunter Blair, who had asked Wilde about his postgraduate plans, and who later fondly recalled the conversation in his 1939 memoir, In Victorian Days. “I won’t be a dried-up Oxford don, anyhow. I’ll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist. Somehow or other I’ll be famous, and if not famous, I’ll be notorious.”. But to some of those who knew him at the time, Wilde’s emphatic rejection of the scholarly life must have come as something of a surprise.
He had, after all, shown a remarkable flair for the classics from the start. At the Portora Royal School, where he’d been sent in the autumn of 1864, just before his tenth birthday, he won the classical medal examination with his extempore translations from Aeschylus’ Agamemnon (the tragedy he loved above all others) and the Carpenter Prize for his superior performance on the examination on the Greek New Testament. Later, at Trinity College, Dublin, he took a first in his freshman classical exams and went on to win the Berkeley Gold Medal for his paper on a subject that was, perhaps, not without augury: the Fragmenta comicorum graecorum, “Fragments of the Greek Comics,” the great scholarly edition by the early-nineteenth-century German philologue Augustus Meineke. (According to his friend Robert Sherard, he occasionally pawned the medal when he needed money, but managed always to redeem it, keeping it until the end of his life.)
After transferring to Magdalen College, Oxford, in the autumn of 1874, Wilde scored highest marks on his entrance exams, and finished by taking a prestigious double first in “Greats,” the relatively recent, classics-based curriculum officially known as literae humaniores. Always attentive to his image, he liked to imply that these successes came easily—“He liked to pose as a dilettante trifling with his books,” Hunter Blair recalled—but in fact put in “hours of assiduous and laborious reading, often into the small hours of the morning.” Whatever his taste for lilies and Sèvres, he was a “grind.”
Wilde’s activities immediately following his departure from Oxford suggest, if anything, a certain unwillingness to abandon the domain of “dried-up old dons.” While scrounging for ways to keep himself employed, he wrote his old friend George Macmillan, of the publishing family, offering to take on projects that would have daunted full-blown classics scholars twice his age: a new translation of Herodotus, a new edition of Euripides’ Madness of Hercules and Phoenician Maidens. He applied, unsuccessfully, for an archaeology scholarship; he had a hand in an 1880 production of Agamemnon that was attended by Browning and Tennyson.
Because he did indeed end up traveling down the path he announced to David Hunter Blair, we can never know what the mature work produced by this “classical” Wilde might have been like—the Wilde who could easily have gone on to do a D.Phil. in classics, Wilde the don, Wilde the important and perhaps revolutionary late-nineteenth-century scholar of Greek literature and society. Of that Wilde, the extant record affords us only a few tantalizing glimpses: a university prize essay, an unsigned review article, journeyman’s pieces that nonetheless reveal a characteristic bravura. This partial view has occasionally been enlarged over the years by the publication of fascinating bits of juvenilia (“Hellenism,” a fragmentary set of notes about Spartan civilization, was published only in 1979). Now we have The Women of Homer, a substantial although unfinished paper on Homer’s female characters that reminds us once more how strongly Wilde’s classical training underpinned the sensibility that would make him so famous.
2.
Wilde’s copy of the Nichomachean Ethics, dated 1877, contains this suggestive gloss on the text: “Man makes his end for himself out of himself: no end is imposed by external considerations, he must realize his true nature, must be what nature orders, so must discover what his nature is.” At the time he was beginning his studies, the tradition of secondary and university instruction in the classics did not necessarily encourage a profound examination of what one’s “true nature” might be. A great premium was placed on proficiency in the languages: students were expected to be able to translate passages from the classical languages into English—and from English into Greek and Latin prose and verse. While still at Trinity, Wilde was asked on one exam to translate a fragment of a text about Odysseus into Elizabethan prose, and then was required to translate selections from Wordsworth, Shakespeare, and Matthew Arnold into Greek.1
Luckily, Wilde, whose linguistic abilities were certainly formidable—years later, a former Portora schoolmate recalled his ability to “grasp the nuances of the various phases of the Greek Middle Voice and of the vagaries of Greek conditional clauses”—was to fall into the hands of the right professors. His Trinity master was the Reverend J.P. Mahaffy, a distinguished classicist who had a special interest in later Greek antiquity, and who was, too, a celebrated wit—a quality that must have appealed to his young student. (Informed that the current tenant of an academic post he coveted was ill, Mahaffy replied, “Nothing trivial, I hope?”)
In an 1874 book called Social Life in Greece, Mahaffy argued for a vision of the Greeks and their civilization as something more than a mausoleum of culture, “mere treasure-houses of roots and forms to be sought out by comparative grammarians.” Among other things, he showed a refreshing willingness to dust off contemporary attitudes toward one Hellenic institution that would have had a special if secret resonance for Wilde: homosexuality. “There is no field of enquiry,” Mahaffy wrote in Social Life in Greece, “where we are so dogmatic in our social prejudices, and so determined by the special circumstances of our age and country.”
Mahaffy’s advocacy of a living engagement with the civilization of the Mediterranean—still somewhat of a novelty at the time—would land the young Wilde in trouble. In the spring of 1877 he accompanied his former professor on a trip to Italy and Greece; after returning to Oxford several weeks late in the term, Wilde was “rusticated”—forced to leave university for the duration of term. The irony of being temporarily expelled from his classics curriculum for having immersed himself in the Greek world was not lost on the future master of the epigram, who observed that he “was sent down from Oxford for being the first undergraduate to visit Olympia.”
The Oxford that punished the unrepentant Wilde had, in fact, been shaking off the old ways, transformed by the energetic reforms of Benjamin Jowett, Regius Professor of Greek, Master of Balliol, and translator of Plato. It was Jowett who insisted that Greats include important currents in contemporary thought (as a young man he had been devoted to Kant); who saw, indeed, the classics as a natural conduit for modern liberal thought. Instrumental in shifting the emphasis of the curriculum from Roman to Greek authors, he made Plato central to it; not coincidentally, the philosopher’s dialectical method was embodied in the intimate one-on-one tutorial system (which occasionally fomented Platonic passions of a less intellectual variety).2
The special Platonic emphasis at Oxford was clearly what animated Wilde’s later, admiring characterization of the curriculum as one in which
one can be, simultaneously, brilliant and unreasonable, speculative and well-informed, creative as well as critical, and write with all the passion of youth about the truths which belong to the august serenity of old age.
Here, perhaps, is the root of the characteristically Wildean taste for entwining ostensibly incompatible qualities. His work encompassed, sometimes uneasily, what he saw as his “Gothic” and “Greek” sides, veering between a grandiose Romanticism and an astringent Classicism, the fusty nineteenth-century melodrama of most of his theater and the crisp modernism of his critical thought.
Mahaffy and Jowett weren’t the only Hellenists advocating a profoundly engaged approach to the classics during the latter half of the nineteenth century. During Wilde’s time at Oxford the literary critic and poet John Addington Symonds was publishing his two-volume Studies of the Greek Poets (1873, 1876). While their earnestness and dogged effort at comprehensiveness may have been exhaustingly typical of mid-Victorian criticism, these volumes were particularly celebrated (or derided) for their unusually passionate, personal, and florid style: a style that hinted at a more than purely academic degree of investment in the subject, and suggested, once again, that the Greeks could have more than a “dry as dust” meaning for the present day. Symonds, like Mahaffy, urged his readers to visit the Mediterranean sites in order to be able to feel the still-living connection to ancient civilizations. In 1874 he published a three-volume collection of travel pieces, Sketches and Studies in Italy and Greece.
One secret reason for Symonds’s engagement is by now well known. Like certain others of the “Oxford Hellenists” of the mid-nineteenth century—including Walter Pater, another figure whose work Wilde would admire extravagantly—Symonds was a secret homosexual who sought, through readings of the Greek classics, to find both expression for and justification of his own sexual nature. Indeed, Symonds later wrote in his memoirs that he had virtually discovered his sexuality through a reading of Plato’s Phaedrus and Symposium: the night he read their “panegyric of paiderastic love” was “one of the most important of my life.” In time, he would go on to write explicitly about Greek homosexuality in A Problem in Greek Ethics, a text that was circulated privately for ten years before its eventual publication, in 1883, and is now seen as a foundational document of modern homosexual studies.
However flowery his style and whatever lip service he paid to conventional condemnation of “paiderastia,” there were those who were able to read between the lines of Symonds’s work—especially the lines of the final chapter of the second volume of Studies of the Greek Poets, with its controversial defense of Greek rather than Judeo-Christian morals, which he dismissed as “theistic fancies liable to change.” (Phyllis Grosskurth’s 1964 biography of Symonds retells an amusing anecdote about a “shocked compositor” who, after setting the type of Symonds’s book, wrote an outraged letter to the author.) The critic and sometime watercolorist Richard St John Tyrwhitt fulminated against Symonds’s book in a lengthy article that appeared in The Contemporary Review, warning that Studies of the Greek Poets advocated “the total denial of any moral restraint on any human impulses.” As a result of the controversy surrounding the second volume of his study, Symonds reluctantly withdrew his candidacy for the Poetry Chair at Oxford.
Small wonder that Wilde’s friend Frank Harris later recalled that Symonds’s Studies of the Greek Poets was “perpetually” to be seen in Wilde’s hands. And all the more interesting, too, that when during the summer holiday of 1876 the ambitious undergraduate turned his hand to reviewing Symonds’s latest volume—the text now published as The Women of Homer—the chapter to which he directed his critical attention was not the scandalous final one, with its implicit defense of male homosexuality. Instead, Wilde wrote about a chapter in which Symonds treated a subject that was all too clearly a delicate one for the author, an unhappily married homosexual, as well as to his eager young reader, another secret homosexual who would marry one day: women.
3.
The Women of Homer now takes its place as the earliest of several youthful classical writings that amply display a precocious intellectual and critical aplomb. A disjointed mass of notes and paragraphs that Wilde produced in about 1877 was edited a century later into a misleadingly finished-looking “essay” called “Hellenism.” However unoriginal this account of Spartan culture often is, it sometimes betrays a shrewd and crisply unsentimental appreciation of the Greeks and their qualities—such shrewdness and lack of sentimentality being the very qualities that mark the “Greek” facets of Wilde’s own work. Not the least interesting of its assertions is that the Greek city-states’ “selfish feeling of exclusive patriotism, this worship of the πόλις [polis, city-state] as opposed to the πάτρια [patria, homeland]”—the quality with which the nineteenth-century admirers of Rome typically reproached the squabbling Greeks—was, in fact, the key to the Greek cultural achievement. It was this “selfishness” that, as Wilde saw it, saved the Greeks “from the mediocre sameness of thought and feeling which seems always to exist in the cities of great empires.”
In an 1879 essay called “Historical Criticism in Antiquity,” composed for the Chancellor’s Essay Prize, Wilde strikingly rejected the prevailing Victorian appreciation of the classical texts as exemplars of “serenity and balance,”3 advocating instead what today we would call the decadent strain in Greek culture—what he celebrated as “that refined effeminacy, that overstrained gracefulness of attitude” to be found in the later poets and sculptors. Mahaffy’s insistence on the living relevance of the Greeks bore fruit in this essay: Wilde goes on to observe, provocatively but shrewdly, that the late nineteenth century, like the late fifth and the fourth centuries BC, was an age of “style” (in implicit opposition to the lofty “substance” of an earlier era).
To the severity and gravitas of the high classical tradition, of which Sophocles has always been the supreme representative in dramatic literature, Wilde prefers Euripides, as he does the Hellenistic sculptors and other poets and artists who “prefer music to meaning and melody to reality.” Here we detect the first stirrings of an argument about aesthetics and society, the provocative elevation of “style” over “substance,” that would find its final form in mature works such as “The Decay of Lying,” “The Truth of Masks,” and Wilde’s critical writings.
At virtually the same moment that he composed the Chancellor’s Essay, Wilde contributed to the Athenaeum a long, unsigned review of Sir Richard Jebb’s entries on Greek history and literature in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The twenty-five-year-old blithely took the professor of Greek at Glasgow to task for either denigrating, or omitting altogether from his article, authors or texts that were unconcerned with “serenity and balance.” Among the former was the notoriously effeminate tragedian Agathon, whom Wilde celebrates as “the aesthetic poet of the Periclean age.” Among the latter was a bizarre Hellenistic poem called Pharmaceutria, an idyll about a love- maddened witch that, Wilde asserts, “for fiery colour and splendid concentration of passion is only equalled by the ‘Attis’ of Catullus.” The admiring reference to the Roman poem—a lengthy work about a handsome acolyte of the goddess Cybele who castrates himself in a transport of religious fervor—is itself worthy of note. Barely out of university, the young Wilde’s taste for extreme gestures, in literature as in life, was plain.
The authority and highly defined taste, the willingness to attack established scholars and to propose startlingly original interpretations, that distinguish “Hellenism,” the Chancellor’s Essay, and the Britannica article of 1879 are evident in The Women of Homer, which Wilde began when he was not quite twenty-two. It is remarkable, not least, for standing in refreshing contrast to the platitudinous moonings of Symonds himself, who is unable to see the preeminent female characters in Homer—Helen, Penelope, and the maiden Nausicaa—as anything but cartoon figures representing conventional types of femininity.
As a product of the “Aesthetic” era, Symonds is good on certain features of Helen. (He gets just right the curious and striking way in which Homer’s Helen “is not touched by the passion she inspires, or by the wreck of empires ruined in her cause.”) But while he is capable of appreciating the Iliad‘s Helen as the abstract symbol of beauty’s sheer force in the world—his evident preoccupation—he has no feel whatever for the subtler Helen of the Odyssey, of whom he states, with disastrous obtuseness, that “the character of Helen loses much of its charm and becomes more conventional.”
Here Symonds is referring to Helen’s appearance in Book 4, in which Odysseus’ young son, Telemachus, comes calling on Helen’s husband, the Spartan king Menelaus, in order to obtain news of his long-lost father. It would, in fact, be hard to find a more unforgettable and less conventional scene in all of Homer. As Helen and Menelaus regale the awestruck youngster with tales of the war, ostensibly to share memories of Odysseus with the son who never knew him, their exchange suggests, with brilliant subtlety, that this marriage is still riven with tensions long after the wayward Helen has returned home with her husband. Symonds ignores all of this—and, bizarrely, makes nothing of the fact that Helen has drugged her guests’ wine with a kind of tranquilizer before the storytelling begins: not at all what you’d call “conventional.”
His reading of Penelope, the long-suffering heroine of the Odyssey, is similarly trivializing. For him, the “central point” of Odysseus’ wife is “intense love of her home, an almost cat-like attachment to the house.” In her famously clever ruse—the nightly unraveling of the shroud she claims to be weaving for her father-in-law—he sees not an impressive canniness but only a pat “parable” about those “who in their weakness do and undo daily what they would fain never do at all.” For him, Penelope is “far less fascinating than Helen.”
Symonds waxes ecstatic only about Nausicaa, the virginal princess who so memorably, and with such aplomb, rescues the shipwrecked Odysseus when he washes up on her island home—“the most perfect maiden, the purest, freshest, lightest-hearted girl of Greek romance.” In this appreciation, as in so many of his interpretations of Homer’s women, Symonds seems trapped by a mid-Victorian fantasy that says more about his own anxieties about women—about his desire, perhaps, to encase them in manageable caricatures—than it does about the literary characters in question.
Wilde’s reaction to Symonds’s text reveals the same astringent rigor that characterizes his attack on Jebb. He begins with an impatient scholarly complaint, criticizing Symonds’s failure to include all the relevant texts in his discussion of Helen (not least, the speech by the classical sophist Isocrates known as the “Encomium of Helen”). What makes Wilde’s essay really fascinating, though, are the flashes of his own distinctively sharp and original interpretative acumen.
In his discussion of Helen, Symonds had argued that a lost trilogy about her by Sophocles would have presented her as “a woman whose character deserved the most profound analysis”—an assumption wholly in keeping with the contemporary assessment of that playwright as the master of character. To this Wilde retorts, startlingly but with some justice, that “profound analysis” is not necessarily to be expected of the great Athenian dramatist in the case of Antigone: “I hardly think that the drawing of Antigone in the play of that name justifies the expression ‘profound analysis.’” And he is right: the Theban princess, while a powerful figure, is not a subtle one. The Women of Homer offers a number of such bracing zingers.
By far the most arresting observation that Wilde makes in his response to Symonds’s catalog of Homeric women is one concerning Penelope, the character about whom Symonds shows himself to be the least perceptive. Wilde remarks on what he calls an “extremely subtle psychological point” that Homer makes about her personality, one that “shows that Homer had accurately studied the nature of women.” Rather than being the placid homebody that Symonds insists she is, Penelope, Wilde understands, is in fact strangely liberated by her famous dilemma: the interminable courtship of her by the suitors during Odysseus’ absence awakens and sharpens in her the very qualities that make her an ideal mate for her husband. (Symonds simply finds her acts of cunning irritating: “provocative of anger.”) Those twenty years without Odysseus may have been lonely, but by the same token they place Penelope squarely at center stage. “Though his return was the consummation,” Wilde writes, with a psychological insight that would be remarkable in someone much older and more experienced than an undergraduate in his early twenties, “yet it was in some way the breaking up of her life; for her occupation was gone.”
Homer, if not Symonds, clearly recognizes this, giving Penelope a number of scenes that show that she is in many ways ambivalent about the suitors—whose attentions, the poet hints, she unconsciously enjoys. In Book 19, for instance, Odysseus’ queen famously takes the mysterious beggar—actually Odysseus in disguise—into her confidence, telling him about a dream she has had in which a mountain eagle attacks twenty tame geese she has lovingly kept: there is no question that the geese are meant to represent the suitors, and the eagle, Odysseus.
Wilde bewails the failure of Symonds and so many other contemporary critics to recognize this conflicted aspect of Penelope’s character:
It is entirely misunderstood, however, by Mr Symonds and, indeed, by all other writers I have read. It shows us how great was her longing, how terrible the anguish of her soul, and it makes her final recognition of [Odysseus] doubly impressive.
The private desire behind the public repudiation, the anguished dissolution triggered by a long-awaited “consummation”: Wilde’s ability to discern, beneath the attitudes imposed on women by society, the sharp and surprising contours of unexpected emotions is what would make The Importance of Being Earnest the most original and most artistically successful of his works.
“Entirely misunderstood…by all other writers I have read.” The breathtaking self-assurance of this pronouncement suggests why Wilde’s long-forgotten text is intriguing, for reasons other than the glimpse it gives us of the road not taken by a significant cultural figure. The confrontation between Wilde and Symonds is, in the end, a confrontation between two eras. In Wilde’s dismissal of Symonds and the rest, you can already hear not only the voice of the mature writer, blithely dismissing the intellectual and social conventions of his age, but the voice of an as yet unborn criticism, one particularly willing to question prevailing assumptions about style, canons, and gender. Like the best of his mature work, this juvenile piece seems to leapfrog forward from the late-nineteenth to the late-twentieth century.
4.. (“His sayings are telegraphed all over the world,” the Pall Mall Gazette bemusedly reported of Wilde’s American visit.) If he invoked the Greeks at all in his American interviews it was to compliment a local poet:
Whitman is a great writer…. There is more of the Greek residing in him than in any modern poet. His poetry is Homeric in its large pure delight of men and woman, and in the joy the writer has and shows through it all in the sunshine and breeze of outdoor life.4
But as we know, it was in Wilde himself more than anyone that the Greek spirit resided. If no one today seriously wishes that Wilde had become an Oxford classics don, it’s at least in part because his own “Greekness”—the deep understanding of the rhetorical uses of style, the taste for piquant syllogism, the ever-evolving aversion to sentimentality (which reached its apogee in Earnest), and, in the end, the tragic understanding of the meaning of suffering—made itself felt so strongly in the work he produced as a poet, writer, and dramatist.
There is, however, one unwritten text that we might legitimately covet. Reading The Women of Homer, it’s almost impossible not to wish that we might instead possess a review of the chapter in Studies of the Greek Poets that was likely to have had greater personal meaning for him than did Symonds’s musings on Homer’s women. I refer of course to the scandalous final chapter, with Symonds’s coded defense of illicit desire and rejection of conventional morality—the very subjects and positions that Wilde himself would take up so sensationally, to his credit and to his cost. But then, you could say that the whole of Oscar Wilde’s life and work soon after he laid aside the unfinished essay—everything he did after abandoning Oxford for London, philology for fame—was a commentary on that unmentioned and unmentionable chapter of Symonds.On 2/2/06, Phillip Rhodes <spamsucks@rhoderunner.com> wrote:

Don't electrical goods need to be inspected by an electrician before being resold?
AFAIK that's only if they're sold through eg a charity shop, not if it's a private sale.
Maybe not. Doesn't seem to stop ebay and high street re-sellers of used goods
No inspections necessary if the crap is sent to the US.
Might be good for cheaper items not worth wasting your time on ebay, but $122 trade-in value for an unlocked Google Nexus One. They ebay for over twice that easily. Appears to be same for other items like Ipads. I may be wrong, but I see this disappearing after a time in a puff of smoke.
Maybe because it is something called overhead. If Amazon paid you what they were selling for on eBay, how would they make any money off of it. If you want market price, sell it on the market. if you want to get rid of it by using a broker, then don't expect market prices.
The fail is all on you.
I'll concede the "fail" icon doesn't necessarily apply here. And yes I understand the concept of overhead. I was simply saying I don't think there is enough demand for this sort of service for it to continue long term. In my experience, when someone has been willing to let go of an item for %50 or less of market value, they very often sell/give it to a friend or family member for that amount, or sell to a pawn shop where they get immediate cash-in-hand instead of waiting for a gift card.
So Amazon UK are denying knowledge? What's this then?
I can understand going for the immediate and guaranteed gift card grab. It's definitely not for me, though. Looking at the prices they're offering and what the going rate is on a lot of that stuff, I'd much sooner go ahead and flog the merchandise on Amazon's own marketplace and make a significantly higher amount of actual money.
Now, that takes some more time, isn't a guaranteed sale, and involves doing a bit of customer service on occasion, but I want my money, not a gift card. Meeeh?
Paris, 'cause she don't take Amazon credit, either.
The same could be said for pawn stores. They give you a fraction of what it is worth as they need to make a profit. You pay for the convenience of selling it now with little to no hassle. Is it for everyone? No.I haven’t added this to my profile yet

Forum RulesSouth Padre Island Restaurants & Nightlife
Best South Padre Island Restaurants
We spent a week on South Padre Island and were impressed with the choice and quality of the restaurants and their reasonable prices, the active and fun nightlife, and all the other fun things there are to see and do on the Island. South Padre Island has just about every kind of restaurant and cuisine you could want to satisfy you pallet - Italian, German, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, Cajun, and lots of great fresh seafood restaurants. Plus you've got sports bar and beach bar food, fast food, and not so fast food. And all within 5 miles of each other. You can find a restaurant with a great view of the Gulf of Mexico or a spectacular sunset over Laguna Madre Bay. We thought that for a resort town, the restaurant prices were very reasonable in 2010. And Port Isabel, which is just across the bridge leading to South Padre Island also has some great restaurants. I was in dinning heaven during our visit and I'm now paying the penalty and trying to loose all of those calories.
Here were some of the best South Padre Island restaurants and our favorites:
- Pier 19 is a must for breakfast or lunch and we imagine it would be just as good if not better for dinner with a sunset - and keep an eye out for the pirate and the attack of the Black Dragon Pirate Ship and Blackbeards's consistently gets good ratings
- In the entertainment district along the shoreline of Laguna Madre Bay, you've got a couple of the better known restaurants like Amberjacks and Louie's Backyard - we enjoyed 25 cent oysters and a sunset at Palm Street Pier
- Several of the locals recommended Jake's and we loved it - good Mexican food and a variety of tasty items in a sports bar atmosphere with lots of friendly locals and very friendly service
- Wanna Wanna has an ok burger and good margaritas if you're looking for a beach bar
- Sea Ranch has the gourmet reputation and is pricey
- Tom & Jerry's is known for the best burger on the Island
- Shrimp Haus as you might expect is known for serving a variety of shrimp dishes
- Padre Rita Ville has ok food but we really enjoyed the music
- Gabriella's was our favorite with excellent Italian food
- Daddy's Seafood & Cajun Kitchen was excellent with lots of big well cooked and tasty Cajun seafood dishes
One of favorites was Pirates Landing in Port Isabel. Reasonable prices, lots of choices, excellent service, great view of the Bay, and very tasty entrees and desserts. The pasta was fantastic, the fish was fresh and the etouffee was delicious, and the sushi grade tuna was excellent - and then the desert came and even though we were stuffed, we found room for this huge scrumptious desert. Pirates Landing is pretty cool and as you would expect, it is decorated with a pirate theme with old model ships, weathered wood, wharf-like posts and railings, several life size pirates, and myriad pictures of briny buccaneers doing their thing. Make sure you wander around and check it out. Just outside the entrance to Pirates Landing are some vendors selling some interesting wares and a couple talking parrots who would love to sit on your shoulder and have their picture taken. Make it a day and sail with some lively and rowdy pirates on the Black Dragon and then try The Thriller high speed boat ride across the Bay, after which you'll be ready for a big meal.
Also in Port Isabel is Pelican Station where we had a superb lunch while enjoying the view of the bay. If you like Italian, there is Marcello's - we hear it's good for dinner but we can attest to some excellent appetizers and good Bloody Mary's. And we heard from a couple people that Manuel's is excellent but only open for lunch or dinner and they have a breakfast taco and burrito made with home made tortillas that would feed four people, or at least one hungry person!
Best South Padre Island Nightlife
Not only is South Padre Island home to some great restaurants, it also has a very active nightlife scene. On any given night you should be able to find some live music or at least a DJ or some interesting karaoke or a cold drink and a stunning sunset. You can find some upscale more yuppie (is that still a current term?) nightclubs, sports bars, bars with fantastic sunsets, nightclubs for the older crowd, and plenty of bars where the locals hang out. We particularly enjoyed the entertainment district which has 5 bars/restaurants along the shore line of Laguna Madre Bay.
Here are some of the best South Padre Island bars, nightlife, and places to hang out during your South Padre Island vacation:
- Gulf of Mexico Beach Bars - Wanna Wanna (our kind of beach bar - burgers, cold beer, and right on the beach) , Boomerang Billy's, and Palm's Cafe on the Beach (a little too foo foo for us - attracts the affluent condo owners)
- Live Music - Louie's Backyard, Amberjacks, Quarterdeck (really good bands on holidays), and Padre Rita Ville (loved Michael's range of songs and voice)
- Entertainment District- Louie's Backyard is huge and multi levels with music, a younger crowd, and good food; Amberjacks (a tad pricey) is more upscale but it has a fun upstairs bar and a good restaurant downstairs, Coconuts is funky, fun, and laid back; Palm Street Pier is laid back and when we visited they had 25 cent oysters; and Tequila Sunset is a good mix of Amberjacks and Coconuts - all the preceding are on Laguna Madre Bay and next to or within a block of each other and there are several others that not on the Bay but are close to or considered part of the Entertainment District, like Coral Reef with karaoke each night,
- Sunset Watching Bars - any of the ones along the Bay will provide you with a stunning sunset, for a start try the Entertainment District bars or Pier 19
- Local Hangouts - Jake's Bar & Grill, Tom & Jerry's (known for food, fun, and the best burgers), and Coral Reef (the last call)
Check out the this website which has a list of most of the nightlife locations.
Have fun, drink and eat responsibly, and enjoy South Padre Island. Return to our South Padre Vacation article.Technical Cooperation/Nuclear Applications
You have before you the Agency´s Technical Cooperation Programme for 2010, as recommended by the TACC. This is the second year of an unusual three-year TC Programme cycle, implemented to align the Technical Cooperation Fund and Regular Budget cycles. The aim is that the programme cycles for TC and the regular budget should be synchronized from 2012. As part of the one-house approach, this would enable the technical departments to align their programmatic activities to provide support for the TC programme.
The TC programme continues to evolve to address pressing challenges in a range of areas. Human health, food and agriculture and nuclear safety remain the top three priorities for Member States. Let me mention a few examples of how the Agency is helping to improve lives for people in developing countries. In Yemen, the country´s first Nuclear Medicine Centre at Al-Thawra Hospital, established with the help of the Agency, has been fully operational since July 2008. It treats thousands of patients per year and also serves as a national training centre. In Latin America, the Agency is using isotopic techniques to provide tools for the diagnosis and evaluation of obesity in children. In Algeria, the Agency provided data that has enabled the country to develop national guidelines for the optimal exploitation of water resources.
The Agency has been focusing on improving quality across the full TC programme cycle. Our approach emphasizes full involvement by recipient countries in the preparation of the TC programme, as well as monitoring, self-assessment and independent evaluation. Special efforts have been made to increase the number of Country Programme Frameworks. Work to increase alignment with UN activities was reflected in the signing of six new United Nations Development Assistance Framework agreements since May 2008.
The Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) has become a well recognized programme in the global battle against cancer. This was illustrated in May this year by the signature of the joint WHO/IAEA Programme for Cancer Control. PACT and its partners have already implemented missions to 20 Member States. PACT has mobilized $24 million for cancer control since 2007, which is an impressive achievement. Seven PACT Model Demonstration Sites are now in operation. To date, 71 Member States have requested Agency support through PACT. I hope more funds will be forthcoming for this programme, which aims to save lives that would otherwise be lost unnecessarily.
Nuclear Energy
I have spoken often of the increased interest in nuclear power and the growing number of requests for Agency assistance from countries considering or launching new nuclear power programmes. I have spoken about our coordinated one-house approach, about the milestones we developed to provide guidance on the development of national infrastructure for nuclear power, and about the Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) service. The first INIR mission took place in Jordan in July and proved a significant success. The second mission is underway this week in Indonesia and the third will take place next week in Vietnam.
INIR missions are an important new service of the Agency, but I believe we could and should do more to help so-called newcomers to nuclear power. We have therefore circulated GOV/INF/2009/11 on Strengthening Agency Support to Member States Considering or Launching Nuclear Power Programmes. As some Member States have expressed a willingness to consider additional extrabudgetary contributions to the Agency for such a purpose, it is important to start a serious discussion of how best we might broaden and add to the existing services we provide States considering or launching nuclear power programmes. This would enable interested Member States to obtain objective advice from the Agency at cost.
Nuclear Safety and Security
There is increasing demand for the Agency´s support in safety and security infrastructure development in newcomer countries. We continue to refine the existing set of safety standards, security guidance, peer reviews and advisory services, and knowledge networks to better meet the needs of newcomers. However, plans by some countries for rapid development or expansion of nuclear power are proceeding more quickly than their plans to establish the necessary safety and security infrastructure and capacity. This is an issue not only for newcomers, but also for the expansion of existing nuclear power programmes.
Nuclear Verification
Conclusion of Safeguards Agreements and Additional Protocols
You have before you a draft additional protocol for the Kingdom of Bahrain. Since the Model Additional Protocol was adopted in 1997, you have approved additional protocols for 136 States; such protocols are, however, in force for only 93 States. I therefore reiterate my call on all States that have not yet done so to bring into force additional protocols, as these are central to the Agency´s ability to provide credible assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities.
Despite some encouraging progress over the last twelve months, there are still 24 NPT non-nuclear-weapon States without comprehensive safeguards agreements. For these States, the Agency cannot draw any safeguards conclusions. It is therefore essential that these States bring into force their required comprehensive safeguards agreements. I also ask those States with small quantities protocols that have not yet done so to amend their SQPs.
It is my hope that all these agreements, which are a prerequisite for the Agency to carry out its verification mission in a credible manner, can come into force in conjunction with the next NPT Review Conference in May next year, which hopefully will strengthen our efforts in non-proliferation and agree on concrete steps on nuclear disarmament.anan´s failure to notify the Agency of the existence of this facility until September 2009, rather than as soon as the decision to construct it or to authorize construction was taken, was inconsistent with its obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement. Iranan´s nuclear programme. My understanding of Iran.
Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Syrian Arab Republic
Essentially no progress has been made since my last report in clarifying the outstanding issues relevant to the implementation of safeguards in the Syrian Arab Republic.
Syria has not provided the cooperation necessary to permit the Agency to determine the origin of the anthropogenic natural uranium particles found in samples taken at the Dair Alzour site. Nor has Syria provided information or access that would allow the Agency to confirm Syria´s statements regarding the non-nuclear nature of the destroyed building on that site.
The Agency is investigating whether particles of anthropogenic natural uranium of a type not in Syria´s declared inventory, detected at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) in Damascus in July, may be due to experiments Syria says it carried out at the MNSR with materials containing uranium. The materials and certain experiments should have been reported earlier to the Agency. The Agency took additional samples at the reactor on 17 November, the results of which we await.
The Agency will continue its efforts to verify Syria´s statements within the authority available to it. Without Syria´s cooperation, or access to information that may be available to other States, including Israel, the Agency will not be able to progress much further in its verification efforts.
The agenda for this meeting contains a proposal by the Russian Federation on establishing a low enriched uranium (LEU) reserve for the supply of LEU under Agency auspices to Member States. This nuclear fuel assurance mechanism was described initially in my report GOV/2009/31 last June. Since then, the Russian Federation has continued consultations with the Secretariat and a draft Agreement has been prepared to be concluded between the Russian Federation and the Agency in this regard, as well as a draft Model Agreement to be concluded between the Agency and a Member State requesting LEU from the reserve. The proposed Agreements generically follow the Agency´s project and supply agreements.
The initiative is fully funded by the Russian Federation. It would guarantee the supply of LEU through the Agency for eligible Member States, in accordance with predetermined criteria to be approved by the Board. It would complement the proposed Agency LEU bank, if and when approved, by making more material available to the IAEA.
I remain convinced that some such mechanism - which is clearly envisioned in the IAEA Statute - is essential as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy. Our ultimate goal, however, should be the full multinationalization of the sensitive parts of the fuel cycle - uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing - as we, hopefully, move towards a world free from nuclear weapons.
Regarding the proposal to establish an IAEA LEU bank, as described in my report GOV/2009/30 last June, I am pleased to note that the Nuclear Threat Initiative has once again extended its offer of a financial contribution of $50 million by another year through September 2010. I remain hopeful that an IAEA LEU bank can be set up during the coming year.
2010 Budget
My views on the inadequacy of Agency funding are well known. I recently circulated GOV/INF/2009/10 entitled The 2010 Budget: Effect on Programme Delivery which details areas where the reduction in the approved regular budget as compared with our initial proposals will have significant impact on programme delivery. It will be felt most in the Agency´s efforts to respond to requests for assistance from Member States considering or launching nuclear power programmes. I earnestly hope that Agency funding will finally be put on a sustainable basis in the coming years.
It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as Director General of the Agency for the past 12 years. I am grateful to you for placing your trust in me and I thank all the staff of the Agency for their professionalism, hard work and dedication. I wish Director General-elect Amano every success in the future and I sincerely hope that Member States will give the Agency all the support it needs to remain an effective and credible partner in creating a safer and more humane world.2014 Technology ResolutionsPosted in Technology & Social Media, by Blog Contributor on January 2, 2014
By Scott Newman
Technology is changing our lives – and our industry – on a daily basis. And as they say, you’re either with the times or behind them. With that in mind, I wanted to roll out three New Year’s resolutions I’m asking my agents to adopt when it comes to technology in 2014 and I’d love to see you implement them into your success plan for 2014 and beyond.
1. Let’s See That Beautiful Face! Every slogan and catchy phrase that can help you sell more homes in 2014 has already been plastered on a billboard somewhere at some point in the past. No matter what you say, and how well you say it, there are simply limitations to the things you can convey through pen and paper. Instead, turn to video. For $200 we purchased an “iPhone film pack” for use with pretty much any smart phone (and you can too from any number of online retailers, like hdhatstore.com). The kit comes with a clip-on and boom-style mic, tripod adapter mount, and a magnetic camera lens that fits over the phone’s camera to give a wider-angle view.
With this kit, we can now shoot video both in the office and out in the field with a maximum 3-minute set-up time. Think of the possibilities: neighborhood reviews, client testimonials, and interviews with local business owners, etc.
The sky is the limit with video, and the added benefits (increased SEO, higher click-through rates, etc.) make this a great way to distinguish yourself from the crowd.
2. Never Forget. If you don’t use a digital method for keeping track of your clients, contacts, and communication, then you have let business – and a nice commission check – walk right out the door.
If you own a smart phone, you can download any number of CRM/task apps for either free or for a couple dollars a month at most. The bottom line is you should be writing down every communication, task, reminder, or tidbit of information in one central place that syncs automatically across all your devices seamlessly.
Information is power, and those who control it will continue to see their sales volumes rise.
3. Show Your Hipness. People love to work with sales professionals who they feel are “in the know.” What does this means for you as an agent and how can you capitalize? Simple!
Make it a point to use technology in a highly visible way to reinforce positive behaviors in your clients and their networks.
The best example of this is Facebook’s “gifting” function. Rather than having to go down to your local Starbucks, pick up 50 gift cards, hand-address the envelopes, write each person a note, and mail them out for $.45/stamp and $2/stationary piece you can now do all this through Facebook with much better results.
I constantly give people small gifts through Facebook, and it’s made a huge difference in the amount of referrals I get from my network since I started. Whether they are a soon-to-be client, or they have bought from me in the past, or they are a good referral source, I will make it a point to send them a gift on their birthday and/or anniversary. A $5 Starbucks card or a free ride from Uber goes a long way towards keeping you top-of-mind when it comes time for them to recommend an agent to someone who needs one.
Further, their entire network sees the gift, which gives you instant – and free – recognition as their cool agent who is always up on technology and ahead of the pack. Oh, and by the way, you save hours of your time and a couple hundred dollars on postage. Use what you save to buy that video set up I mentioned earlier in this post!
The bottom line is this: Technology is going to continue to play a huge role in the success of those agents who plan to remain in this industry long term. As with many things, the devil is in the details, and by mastering some simple but highly effective technology strategies, I know you can make 2014 your best year yet!

In MW3 all playlists outside of the standard Core one is completely different from what it was on release day and everything that has been added is all because of input from the community, these added playlists include money in the denk (after a week of complaints about this they changed the game rules), infection (they also changed settings in this to satisfy the community), 3v3 and HC 3v3 face-off (if I remember rightly it was only 1v1 and 2v2 to start with), MW3SOME, HCDOM, all or nothing plus Richochet got added because of complaints from certain parts of the community as well.
With Treyarch though, the only things I can remember being changed from the WAW days were Flags and Bombs being added to the HC playlist (and while a lot of people would love to see the WAR mode come back that is also ignored) in place of HCHQ/HCCTF and last stand giving the kill to the guy who put him down in the first place, any suggestions to Treyarch are always shot down with BS excuses like we cant add to playlists/change game rules etc. If IW can change settings and are more than willing to do so then why cant Treyarch, its as if there saying you either lump it or like it and to me, that is the worst possible attitude, anyone have any idea why they have this sort of attitude because as of now it really is wearing thin and most noticeably in the HC community?
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?devidog_kyle Mar 28, 2013 8:50 PM (in response to CR4IG)
You know, I have the same feeling day after day. when you hear people day to day suffer from honest issues in the game, or make suggestions that would truely benifit the game go unheard, yet I get an update for dlc camos. That was when my mind was truely made up that they just aren't interested in us just the fat cash.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?NoLifeKing29 Mar 28, 2013 8:55 PM (in response to CR4IG)
Maybe because the community has terrible ideas? Infected was stupid, MITB was stupid, Drop Zone was stupid, Face-off was stupid, Ricochet (not a community idea) is the worst thing to ever happen to HC. With stupid ideas like that, I'm glad they don't take heed to most of the community. HCDOM was a launch list with MW3 btw. All Treyarch needs to do is add a few more HC modes, and the playlists will be fine. We don't need boosting modes to return.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?CR4IG Mar 28, 2013 9:09 PM (in response to NoLifeKing29)
What you say there applies to you, those game-modes were added because a big percentage of the paying customers wanted them and whether they are dumb or not it shows they care, as of this minute the message of the day on MW3 is "what gamemode would you like added to the faceoff playlist, post your request on twitter @infinityward", but with Treyarch when the new game comes out its almost like they drop support instantly.
The only community move by Treyarch since this games release that I can think of is Vahn asking us what HC mode we should drop to add a new one.
As for HCDOM being there from the beginning well that may be true but a lot of other things in the advanced playlist are different from release day based on input from the community.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?NoLifeKing29 Mar 28, 2013 9:13 PM (in response to CR4IG)
Of course a "big" percentage wanted those game modes, because they all wanted to boost legally.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?CR4IG Mar 28, 2013 9:20 PM (in response to NoLifeKing29)
Get over the boosting thing already, boosters will boost regardless of the gamemode.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?NoLifeKing29 Mar 28, 2013 9:24 PM (in response to CR4IG)
Uh no, its not dismissed so easily when game modes are specifically designed to boost. Thats all Infected was. Had they disabled XP and challenges in those community playlists, far, far fewer people would have played them. But IW has never possessed any foresight or common sense.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?CR4IG Mar 28, 2013 9:35 PM (in response to NoLifeKing29)
Gamemodes designed to boost is not IW specific, take any party gamemode in Blackops 2 or the most common one, sticks and stones, 8 people can join TOGETHER in a party and boost for every killer calling card + the nuke one and an infinite amount of unstoppables medals, I know this because 2 people have done it on my friends list and have still not been banned in the 4 months since it happened because nobody else was in the game with them even though they have been reported by at least 20 guys that i know of.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?NoLifeKing29 Mar 28, 2013 9:39 PM (in response to CR4IG)
Calling cards are less significant to most people. You get next to no XP from the party games.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?CR4IG Mar 28, 2013 9:45 PM (in response to NoLifeKing29)
At least get your facts right before you post, every single medal you get in one of those games gives xp plus every calling card you get gives up to 10,000xp, you can literally get the same amount of xp in these games if you are decent due to the medals that you would get in any other mode, you know, skewers, double kills, hail mary, super kills, ultra kills... the list goes on.

Hell yeah, war was the dogs bollocks of WAW but to be the fair the map sizes and design were perfect for it, the original Blops could have pulled it off but it would never work in this one, would still love to see it though.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?xdemonthekiller Mar 28, 2013 9:36 PM (in response to CR4IG)
I agree but they did add the Bonus -> Chaos mosh pit because of they were so idiotic they tricked us in thinking it was permanent but as they said "Only ment for special events" As treyarch put it which is the most retarded sentance any game company could possible say since they didn't say anything about Nuketown 2025 only being for special events.
Black ops was great
Black ops 2 Thumps down :/ They decided to take out HARDCORE free for all because they are peny pencers, Since i read "hardly anyone plays HCFF" but that is wrong, I played it in previous game and i did wish to play it in black op 2.
But after it was removed people got angry and returned their games, Why would treyarch do this? Because they just want to sasitfy their fat pockets besides the needs of the gamers who play there games such as IW did in sasifying the gamers as he stated above.
The new DLC of camos and features is a load of bull crap but only the set up is the only one i can agree with. They made that DLC why you may ask? Not for the gamers but for them.
I reccond treyarch should release something which takes time and effort to make for the gamers, I got the season pass and i honestly don't care about that dlc but seriously? they have benefited this game since its release? they have only made minor changes and patched glitches which make the game fun as hell. People agree and disagree with glitches but honestly, If you can't use them in public then why not allow them in private? Treyarch has messed this game up good but we try to the make the best out of this rubble.
That is all but i could of said more.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?NoLifeKing29 Mar 28, 2013 9:38 PM (in response to xdemonthekiller)
The decision to remove HCFFA and replace it with HCKC was a brilliant one. The decision to include FFA at all in the launch list was poor. The playlist population differential attests to this.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?CR4IG Mar 28, 2013 9:42 PM (in response to NoLifeKing29)
MW3 has 6 HC gamemodes with both FFA and KC included so there is absolutely no reason why it had to be removed, just because YOU don't like it does not mean others didn't.

Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?CR4IG Mar 28, 2013 10:16 PM (in response to NoLifeKing29)
The numbers should not have been an issue and that's what I'm getting at here, they are either being stubborn or they have some other agenda, example, I have been a fan of the mercenary mode, been playing it since the original Blops and in 3 years have never seen more 2,000 (usually less than 1,000) in the playlists but have always been able to find games on par latency wise as a gamemode with say 20,000+ players, I just don't understand why they are being like this.

I didnt ask for your personal opinion on whether or not league play should/would be removed. You dont work for Treyarch and have zero knowledge of which playlists will come or go. Who said the league playlist would get dropped anyways????
I simply pointed out that league play is a minimally populated playlist and that going off of player counts.... doesnt mean sweet FA!

3arc does not do ricochet for hc they never have and never will they use 3 tk kick and always have and always will. So that one is a moot point. Just because IW uses ricochet does not mean that 3arc has to because some get but hurt about being kicked after killing teammates too many times. Ricochet ruins HC, it does not improve it. For with it you can just tk all you want and never worry about it.
3arc does not have to add things just becuase the community wants them to, it is there game, they decide what is right for the game not the players. Players are too fickle and always want things changed all the time and this forum and its community is the worst of them all when doing that. When the rest of the players may not want the changes at all.
WAR is not compatabile with this game and the size of tthe maps and it had its own problems and was a fluke that it worked so well in WaW. The only reason it did was the map design on some of the maps worked with it. The majority if not all of the maps in this game would not work well with WAR and how it was played because of the size of them. WAR required long maps, and the only map in this game taht really fits that is Turbine Most of the rest are too short for it.
The kill should go to the one that makes the kill not the one that puts them down. Finish the kill or only get assist points.. for a kill is not a kill until they are dead. Just because you did 100 damage does not make it a kill...because they had last stand.. so the kill was not earned even if 100 damage was done.. how it is now is how it should be and how it always should have been. When they changed it in BO people would just put someone down and then walk away becasue they knew they would get the kill for it. So there was no reason to risk finsihing them off and maybe getting killed. Used to see it happen all the time.
HC is a smaller community than core. So HC will always come second to core in what they get in the game. Until HC is as big as core in numbers alone it will always be the bastard child of core and always take second place when it comes to playlists.
Plus the general player aka causal player plays core not hc and this game was marketed for general causal players and not just hc die hards that feel that hc is better when really it is not.

I did not say Treyarch should do ricochet, was just pointing out the fact that MW3 started without and it was changed because the community asked for it, everything else I have said are just examples that IW have done so much more for the community than Treyarch have, not my opinion's on what should or should not have be done.
As for WAR if you read down the thread you will see I say the exact same as you.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?trialstardragon Mar 28, 2013 11:04 PM (in response to CR4IG)
Roght but that is what IW does when people complain they toss on Ricochet as a blanket band-aid fix for the problem. Which in turn makes the game worse not better at that point. 3arc's 3tk kick is better for it gets rid of the problem player unless they are host.
Did not read all the replies until after I posted where you did mention the same reasons.
I do agree that there are issues with the game, but really there is nothing we can do about it. Either play or not and that is it, for complaing here does not mean they really have to do anything about it. For we are sheep and they know this. It is there game and as long as the majority of players are willing to play even with the problems there is no reason for them to fix them just becuase a few do not like them.

I absolutely hate ricochet and love the 3tk rule, it is proper HC, I also loved the change to second chance and this is not a complaint thread, just me asking the question as to why Treyarch are so stubborn compared to IW, the examples I have given make it absolutely clear that they do have some issues with taking input from the community, IW act almost instantly whereas Treyarch, well that 2nd chance thing didn't come into to effect till what, 4 months before the end of the games cycle and me missing out on at least 1000 kills, it was more like a sweetener to act like they were listening and make sure we bought the next game instead of a change because we asked for it.

COD2013 needs to have big freaking maps(MW2 sized). I don't mind some small ones like "Dome," but every map cannot be the same size as dome and have limited path ways and no flanking routes.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?Foxhound-Pro Mar 28, 2013 11:23 PM (in response to CR4IG)
Here's my take.
Treyarch wants a product that is solid and will deliver the expected experiences. I think this is why they're a bit more rigid when it comes to making changes. That's not nescesarily a bad thing, but it does give off an appearance that can be perceived as negative like here.
All of the additional game modes that MW3 offered, including community generated ones and the immature MW3SOME title, aren't enough for me to justify that they "care" or are more "connected" than Treyarch. It simply shows that they are different.
There's more that I would like to expand on, but I can't at the moment. I'd also like to say that for the record they are not ignoring WAR. They know people want it, but they've stated that it does not fit and have actively tried to bring it back.
I also think that it is perfectly fine for a game to be "either you like it or you do not." This is their game. It's their park.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?CR4IG Mar 28, 2013 11:51 PM (in response to Foxhound-Pro)
To be completely honest I have never played that MW3SOME mode as it does seem very childish and only played that infection thing a couple of times as well.
And just for the record, I am without a doubt a Treyarch fanboy and seeing the stuff IW do for there fans makes me wish we had the same love from our devs but... very good to hear that WAR has been considered even if it could never work in this game, if they could make it for the original Blops I would be the happiest guy in the world because as we all know WAW is a no go zone with all the hackers, I'm smart enough to know that it will never happen though.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?vims1990 Mar 29, 2013 1:54 AM (in response to CR4IG)
I'm a huge supporter of the game mode "War" but since maps seem to get smaller with each COD iteration, I doubt it'll ever return. Vahn even mentioned a while back that War wouldn't have worked in BO1 as well:
I know a lot of folks are unhappy about this. I knew you would be. What can I tell you. Sometimes I wish the fans would trust us a little bit. We didn't take War out to annoy you. War is a notoriously difficult game mode to make fun. In all honestly, it's a ball ache to set-up. Especially the spawning. It's the most complex game mode we've ever had (design, script, map requirements, and more).
It works so much better on larger maps. I know not everyone agrees with this point of view and that's ok. War is the kind of game mode where you wish you were the kind of game that only ever had to worry about one or three game modes, instead of 12+. We didn't bring it back because it wasn't playing as well as needed to in this game. It's not like we don't like War. We like it so much that we aren't going to do it if it's not amazing.
End of story.
David 'Vahn' Vonderhaar
If the community weren't so much about wanting more small maps (i.e. Nuketown, most of BO2 maps) and allow devs to design larger maps for game modes like "War" and possibly provide Ground War players with more maps in their playlist, it'll be so much better.
Instead, most of these maps seem to be catered towards those players who probably want to play Nuketown all day.
I'm hoping COD devs will one day balance out the maps. Stop designing so many small maps, provide some larger maps to support game modes like War.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?ab36 Mar 29, 2013 2:12 AM (in response to vims1990)
I agree. The small maps are fun sometimes but there's basically little to no room to actually need to plan anything or play tactically. I think it's best one there are maybe 2 or even 3 maps that are small like Nuketown or Hijacked, but the rest should to be medium to large sized maps, so there's more space, and SMGs/shotguns won't be basically at an automatic advantage just because the maps are so small.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?ab36 Mar 28, 2013 11:59 PM (in response to Foxhound-Pro)
Maybe they could bring it back in a DLC pack with maps built to better suit the mode... I think War would play well on Array from Black Ops 1, and obviously the WaW maps. I think they should bring back some Black Ops 1 and WaW maps, even if it's separate from the Season Pass. I'd pay for it. It'd be a fun way to end this generation of Call of Duties.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?SitRepPro Mar 29, 2013 1:56 AM (in response to Foxhound-Pro)
I guess 3arc are against having maps specific for game modes? You need not one game mode apply for one map as there are usually overlaps in the dynamics of different game modes but, with so many game modes IW and 3arc have done, it's hard to make a map that plays well in all of them.

Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?trialstardragon Mar 29, 2013 2:30 PM (in response to zombyeslayer87)
They do know how to do their job right, just people here are too fickle and want everything the way they think it should be and that is never how it will be ever in this game. The smaller maps is becuase of listening to people here too much who complained about large maps and campers. So if you want to complain about map size, than point the finger at the community and those that cried about all the bigger maps.
Plus why should they listen much or do everything that the community wants? There is no reason, this community does not really know what it wants nor can it ever really come to a consensus on what is good or bad about the game.
Ruhsers want small fast paced maps, tactical players want larger maps, Snipers want even larger maps. People want easy game modes to boost for exp to gain levels quickly like infected... They cannot within the limitation of the current gen console make everyone happy and give eveyrone what they want all the time.
Some people are just going to have to be disapointed becasue they cannot ever make even 95% of the players happy, let alone ever try to make 100% happy and give everyone what they want. But the players and forum goers here never understand that because they do not want to. They are to damn entitled and think the game has to be tailored to their ever changeing whims about what game modes should or should not be in, and how each and every little thing should work against each other. Which means if they did those things the game would never be stable or balanced, for every player has a different view of balance and stable or fun game play.
But those people who then get upset that they were not treated like kings and queens then come here and make an arse of themself, which gives 3arc plenty of reasons to not want to change much or add things. Plus in the end it is their house, their game, their rules, they decide how the game is and not the players ever. Dont like that? Go find another game, or learn to make one of your own and then see just how hard it is to make all the customers happy about every little thing that is complained about. It cannot be done ever.
It is people like you and your manner of reply that make them be how they are in some respect. I know for sure if you were in my house complaining about something I made and allowed you to use about how it was not exactly waht you want. I would just either ignore you or say gtfo, go cry somewhere else.
No one here is entitled to have the game be exactly how they want 100% of the time ever and they never will be.
Re: Why are Treyarch so stubborn compared to IW?maccabi Mar 29, 2013 5:27 AM (in response to CR4IG)
when you're quick to add things (gamemodes) like IW did , you are more prone to missing potential problems (even ones that the community pointed out beforehand). This isn't always a bad thing as it's nice to see things implemented quickly from our point of view. A good example of this is infected which we all said would turn into a boosters paradise and the ignored suggestions that leveling was turned off in the community modes playlists. Wierdly this is something i've recently just discussed elsewhere but anyways, I think Iw got a good balance when it came to community involvement in changes made to the game, this time round Treyarch are really dragging thier heels (the ongoing more hard core modes being the prime example )
As for War there are a ton of gamemodes that got made for bo2 that never made it into the game , theres a variation of war called world domination that (and i'll try to find the tweet) Vahn when questioned about did say it was unlikely would make it into the game for a few reasons. I like many am a little surprised about the lack of a war tye mode as it was always a fan favourite and something we have all asked for to return often. It's a shame the map sizes we have now dont really work for it, who knows maybe we might see a few large maps in a future dlc that could caterto a war like mode i hope so.
Also i just want to mention richochet in mw3, what alot ofpeople dont know is when it was added as a knee jerk reaction there was alot of behind the scenes discussion about removing it both from us to iw and inside iw itself. While i dont agree with richochet at all i do understand why it remained and respect iw's honesty and reasoning for keeping it. It's just a shame they didnt fix the issues adding richochet caused though.
While i do agree there is a rather large disparity between how the two dev studios do things and this time round community interaction is woefully lacking and the emphasis seems to be more on competitive /leagueplay than anything.. you have to remember Vahn has come onto the forums once since the game has come out and that was to discuss hardcore, something he has already said he will be getting back too soon. I'd rather something is done right and doesnt piss off people than its done hurriedly and causes more issues.

GREEN.Unfortunately, Russia is not as clever as China
The decisive and tough position of the Kremlin on the situation around Ukraine was no surprise to the West. Throughout 2013 Russia has demonstrated independence and consistency in defending its national interests. Diplomat Alexander Panov discussed the events of last year in a conversation with the chief editor of Pravda.Ru Inna Novikova.
"I read an opinion of a well-respected expert that the success in Crimea in March of 2014 was based on the successes in Russia's foreign policy in 2013."
"Indeed, it was quite a successful year for the Russian foreign policy. This has to do primarily with the fact that we managed to reduce the risks, the crisis, in the sense that there has been no armed open clash in Syria. It was Russia that had an impact on the Syrian leadership that convinced them to choose chemical disarmament. It was Russia that has become the guarantor that would ensure that the disarmament of Syria will not make it vulnerable to a threat of external forces. Of course, this was a success."

"Was it Russia or Russia and China that played a decisive role in this outcome of the Syrian crisis?
"China was involved to a lesser extent. China is a rather clever state."
"We are clever, too."
"Unfortunately, not really. I believe that we are often too direct; if we want something, we go ahead and do what we need in a rush. The Chinese think in terms of a bigger picture, long term. When they are increasing their presence in global affairs, they are doing it gently, slowly, without sticking out too much."
"Therefore, Syria was Russia's apparent success?"
"Certainly, and it has to do with the fact that Russia timely saw the situation where both the U.S. and the EU were debating whether to fight or not. Obama, generally, was more inclined not to fight. Indeed, why would the Nobel Peace Laureate suddenly start a war?"
"They were paid by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and this is openly discussed."
"I think that the sheikhs paid France, this is why Hollande was so vocal. He was paid more, he has very close relations with Saudi Arabia, and the United States is a wealthy enough country to not depend on Saudi money. France had to work for this money to the fullest. Obama, of course, had doubts, and he hesitated for a long time. Then we realized that through the initiative to destroy chemical weapons, Russia will help to break the impasse. Obama jumped at it. "
"This, I think, was the first time when the Americans abandoned the idea of a declared military strike."
"If the U.S. wanted to fight, they would have hit regardless of Assad's actions. There was a skillful, subtle and brilliant game by the Russian diplomacy. Putin, when he met with G8, clearly and firmly made a proposal that everyone agreed with. Even the fact that when Crimea was annexed to Russia the U.S. has frozen the diplomatic relations with Syria (which, incidentally, is quite a shallow and inconsistent decision) cannot erase our success in Syria."
"Syria was the second victory, because before that there was Snowden, and I think his information was successfully used by our diplomacy ..."
"I have some doubts regarding Snowden. I believe that he was given us by China. He also came to China and likely wanted to stay there. The Chinese have worked with him, but Beijing is now building relationships with the United States, and so Snowden was told to go wherever he wanted. We were in an ambiguous situation, and I think that granting him asylum was a controversial decision."
"What were the risks for Russia?"
"This could have led and did lead to a certain deterioration of the relations. On the other hand, unfortunately, now we do not have the best relations with the United States. I believe that under Obama we could have had more constructive and productive relations because there is no guarantee that the next U.S. president will take a constructive approach towards Russia. Maybe it will be the opposite. We have seen how the Republican candidates generally speak against Russia. There are only two years left until the next election, we'll see. However, the relationship with Obama is not getting better.
"Look at a photo where Putin and Obama are sitting next to each other, their poses send a clear message that these are two people who do not even want to talk to each other. Now take the U.S. and China. The Chinese leader visited California last summer. The two leaders talked for eight hours. Of course, they talked not so much about the economy or contradictions. They talked about something else, and now it is clear that certain agreements on the delimitation of interests have been reached. We do not have any high-level dialogue with the United States."
"This is a strange situation ..."
"Perhaps this is a question for both leaders. It happens at times that there is no relationship between the leaders, no desire or willingness to talk and negotiate."
"But they have to understand that they represent their countries, regardless of personal feelings ..."
"Of course, but in this case for a number of reasons it has not happened. In politics, personal factors are very significant. Remember when Germany was under Schroeder Putin had great relationship with him, and with Merkel it is not all that smooth."
"Let's go back to the successes of our foreign policy. I think that the main success is in the fact that in the hot spots Russia has successfully resisted tough and selfish policy of the USA, this empire that no one contradicted in the last quarter of a century, with the exception of maybe China, sometimes. Everything worked for Washington."
"I agree. But we must admit that now there is one empire, the United States, albeit peculiar, soft, so to speak, but it defines the international climate policy as a whole. We should remember though that empires do not last forever. This is a topic for a separate discussion."

YADKINVILLE — A stolen vehicle smashed into a Yadkinville church resulting in more than $30,000 in damages.
The incident happened on July 16 at about 4 a.m.
According to the pastor of New Bethel Pentecostal Holiness Church located at 2242 Caudle Mill Road, he was awakened by police who said a pickup truck smashed into his church.
Pastor J.P. Sizemore said, “I got a call at 4 a.m. that a truck had been reported stolen. The truck hit a light pole and the car slammed into the sanctuary. It’s pretty extensive damage.”
The Yadkinville Police Department responded to the scene and identified that the vehicle was stolen from a residence up the street. The case was turned over to the North Carolina Highway Patrol.
Sizemore said if he had a chance to speak to the person responsible for the melee, he would have some words with the suspect hoping to turn the person into conducting good actions instead of destruction.
“I think what’s mostly notable here is not what crime happened, but the tremendous amount of support from good Samaritans,” said Sizemore.
Such actions described by the pastor were Covenant Builders of The Carolinas Inc. of Elkin, who arrived at the church to help secure the structure. The Mitchel Chapel Methodist Church of Boonville assisted with a love offering of more than $200. Others are calling the church offering support.
“The Lord has been good to us. We felt we needed to do what was needed,” said Bobby Osborne, who owns Covenant Builders of the Carolinas with partner Todd Scearce. “We dispatched people to the spot to help conceal things as best as possible so people don’t damage the church further… There’s not much more we can do because insurance companies want to see all of the damage. You can’t even clean up.”
“The adjusters have not provided a definitive number. The bricks are smashed and seven pews were crushed. The carpet is ruined because all the anti-freeze spilled on it,” said Sizemore.
“I’m personally thanking all for their acts of kindness,” said Sizemore.
North Carolina Highway Patrol said the case is still being investigated.

We started off as less than 10. We’re now boasting a group of more than 60 food bloggers (yes, all in the UAE). I didn’t know anyone’s faces very well last year. I now greet them as old friends. FooDee didn’t exist last year, even though I was food blogging. Now I have my own identity here. I was in a great place personally last year. I’m in a great place professionally this year.

The one thing that has remained constant though, has been the support system in the group. I may get along with some better than others, but there’s always the group. It’s not one person that makes the group, it’s not one or a few that keeps us together… it’s all of us. I can count on all of them to rise up to my side if I need them to.

You’d think…60+ food bloggers…that’s a lot for one place. Don’t we trample on each other’s toes? No. Everyone – and I cannot stress this enough – has their own personality which shines through their blog and the way they write. Some are personal, some are casual, some are detached, some are very expressive and some write in more than one language. Either way, we get a veritable hot pot of cultures, nationalities, personalities, writing and more. Any way you look at it, we’re treated to culinary treasures we may not have found by staying in our comfort zone. I certainly would never have learned how to use chopsticks.
On September 23, 2011, those of us who could, gathered together at Tea Junction, each of us bearing cake, to celebrate a year of this melting pot.
I’d like to think I was doing such a great job of taking photographs and staying behind-the-scenes, that no one noticed I didn’t get to speak to the group like everyone else did at the beginning of the party and introduce the cakes I bought. To make up for that oversight, I’ve written so much here instead of getting to the point. Now you know what you should’ve done (remembered me!) to make me cut down on the flowery text here.
Anyway…I didn’t want to simply throw pics out there – I always do that. I spoke to as many bloggers as I could, and jammed it all together (like a hot pot) for your viewing pleasure. Have 15 minutes?

I’m so touched. I have this big fat lump in my throat every time I listen to the video. It’s like someone suddenly cracked open something, and out emerged this little strand of a thought, reinforced by so many members, that this group has and continues to mean so much to each of them. Thank you for doing this for all of us who attended that day Dee. Thank you.
Thank you Arva (@inafryingpan)… I’m glad you liked it. As you’re one of the co-founders of the group, I was hoping it would be a good birthday present! I’m glad with the video I could contribute with giving the group a more coherent voice. I’m hoping if any other food bloggers in the UAE see this, they’d be convinced to join…and if other bloggers in other countries see it, they’d be inspired to create a group of their own.The Mahal collection features beautiful reproductions of traditional Persian designs.

Photo: Jason Borg
Just under 100,000 people donated to L-Istrina yesterday with eight donations per second being received at peak times, President George Abela said this afternoon.
Addressing a news conference held after a record €3,294,997 were raised in the annual fundraising event, the President said that taking Malta's population into account an average of €8.25 per person were donated.
L-Istrina yesterday, he said, showed the true qualities of the Maltese people who sent a message to everyone including politicians that they wanted the focus to be on the people, especially those who were suffering.
The Maltese were the most generous nation, the President said, as he went into specific anecdotes such as that of the couple who asked for contributions to L-Istrina instead of gifts for their 50th wedding anniversary.
Dr Abela said that more than two kilometres of real hair, which would be used to make wigs for cancer patients, were collected.
He said that he did not want the sentiment of unity shown during yesterday’s event to be lost in the electoral campaign and politicians had the duty to nurture this sentiment.
Major Mark Mallia, who coordinated the event, thanked volunteers for their time, including in the run up to the event.
The time people gave was just as big a gift as the money, he said.
Major Mallia said he was amazed by the response from the corporate sector with many companies which said they would be giving the event a miss this year because of the economy showing up with an even biggerApril 8, 2024 — Total Solar Eclipse — Toronto, Ontario, Canada

And the answer to that question, as we've seen from every Android tablet is that there's no good reason. The only tablet that has managed to get traction in the market other than the iPad is the Kindle Fire, and that's because Amazon went after a cheaper segment of the market while covering a decent set of consumption use cases.
Sure, Windows tablet will sell some. There will be vertical segments or some enterprises that have IT departments forcing crap down users' throats, but in the mass consumer market it's going to be challenged to claw out 5% share. And I'm being very generous with that value.- Product Information

The 60th anniversary of Israel's founding has given rise to a vast tranche of American journalism about the occasion, all following one of two tropes: Can Israel Survive? and Let's use the anniversary to settle old scores!
The archetype of the former genre is without question Jeffrey Goldberg's recent Atlantic cover story, in which Goldberg ties the old question — 60 years old, in fact — of Israeli survival to current Israeli political and cultural fissures, and to stark demographic realities, which he suggests are mutually reinforcing.
On the one hand, if present demographic conditions continue, Jews will make up less than half of the population "between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea" by 2020, which means it's simply a matter of time before it becomes unintelligible to speak of a Jewish State. On the other hand, the Zionists' profound success in creating and defending Israel, the vast shift in opinion (at least in the west) away from antisemitism, and the quiet but precipitous Jewish overthrow of WASPs as the dominant force in the American economy and society — all these cry out for a reevaluation of the merits of Zionism and its relevance to the contemporary world.
Left-wing Zionists are caught up in a fairly shallow and ahistorical effort to recast Zionism as some kind of shiny, impotent hybrid of Mandela-ism and tikkun olam, while right-wing Zionists pretend to relevance through fantasy stories about the possibility of a Holocaust in the US (as Ehud Olmert did in interview with Goldberg) and the occasional bloodletting of the nearby Arab population.
Goldberg has no sanguine proposal for how to navigate between those unappealing poles, only the wisdom of Benny Morris, the most profoundly Israeli Jew in history, to share: "We are tired of being courageous, we are tired of winning, we are tired of defeating our enemies. We want that we will be able to live in an entirely different environment of relations with our enemies." Which might, in the end, mean that the Israelis are tired of Israel.
Christopher Hitchens gives explicit voice to the dour conclusion Goldberg keeps implicit: It confounds imagination to think "that a Jewish state in Palestine will still be in existence a hundred years from now. A state for Jews, possibly." Hitchens comes at the problem as an erstwhile pamphleteer for the Palestinian cause who found out late in life that he is, under the Law of Return and the Nuremberg Laws, a Jew. More recently still, he's moderated his views on the Israel-Palestine question (but remains a self-described "non-Zionist.") A more urgent question of Israeli identity, he argues, is "whether…Israel should be defended as if it were a part of the democratic West…to which Israelis themselves have not yet returned a completely convincing answer."
Moving from tragedy to farce, other Israel-at-sixty articles trot out barely reheated ancient talking points. Leading the pack here is Charles Krauthammer, whose Washington Post column today commences with a trumpet blast about "the return and restoration of the remaining two tribes of Israel — Judah and Benjamin, later known as the Jews — to their ancient homeland." Is it too much to ask that a Likud cheerleader get basic facts of Israelite history right?
There is scant purpose to Krauthammer's piece apart from bashing Palestinians. Sure enough, after reciting an alternate world history in which the dispossession of the Palestinians was solely the consequence of their rejectionism in 1948, without the slightest assist from the seraphic Israelis — do consult with Benny Morris on that one, Charles — we get to the crux: "One constantly hears about the disabling complexity of the Arab-Israeli dispute. Complex it is, but the root cause is not."
That's wrong, not to mention completely backwards. The root cause is exceedingly complex, thanks in part to the obfuscatory efforts of Krauthammer and his ilk (he has a surfeit of counterparts on the Palestinian side to be sure). Whereas the dispute, or at the very least, the nature of the only possible resolution, is simple as can be: Either a two-state solution, or the indefinite perpetuation of the status quo until Israel quietly ceases to exist.
For the sake of bipartisanship, let's take a look, lastly, at The Nation's commemoration of the occasion, consisting in a pair of articles by Oxford professor Avi Shlaim and Ben Gurion U. professor Neve Gordon (a piece by erstwhile Barack Obama acquaintance Rashid Khalidi, "Palestine: Liberation Deferred," completes the troika).
Shlaim's piece, a funhouse mirror inversion of Krauthammer's, begins with a stirring appreciation of the flawed but flourishing Israel that really exists, as opposed to the concoction of fantasists. It proceeds the the well-known but always worth repeating point that "[t]o its credit, the Israeli public has never been as implacably opposed to an independent Palestinian state as the politicians of the right."
But Shlaim gets carried away reveling in self-criticism, and succumbs to an equal and opposite departure from reality versus his opponents on the right. "The Palestinians learned from their own mistakes," he writes, "they put rejectionism behind them, moderated their program and opted for a two-state solution." Really? It's that simple? If for no other reason than they'll need to if they want to make the peace process saleable to the Israeli public, leftist Zionists really ought to come to grips with the fact that it's not social inequality, but people — specifically, Palestinian people — on the giving end of those Kassam and Katyusha rockets, and those people have a religious and political agenda. Firing rockets isn't just the sublimated expression of their desire for self-determination; they will ratchet up the violence the closer they get to self-determination.
Gordon, on the other hand, offers up an unintentional classic of saccharine flower power Zionism. Did you know that Zionism is really a universal humanism for the whole world? And that its core value isn't anything religious, but social justice? This, apparently, is what happens when the folk-guitar-playing kids at summer camp grow up. Still, though Krauthammer and Gordon's visions of Israel and Zionism are deeply unappealing in countlessly many incommensurate ways, I can't help but think that the world would be a better place if Gordon's ideas had the purchase that Krauthammer's actually do, and vice versa.Olay Regenerist Thermal Contour and Lift Reviews

My Reasons for Reporting This
There are, it turns out, more types of people in the world than we could have dreamed of.
There are mere mortals like you and me, the kind of persons who come into this world, red-faced, kicking and hollering and then exit again, usually a few score years later. To lawyers and the supreme court, we’re known as “natural persons”.
Then there are corporate persons.
British jurist William Blackstone defined these folks back in the mid-18th century, when he was grappling with the fact that rights and duties attach to organizations, and not just mortal human beings. Yes, he concluded, there’s a need for “artificial persons”, who can enjoy “a kind of legal immortality”.
I find myself wondering just how rapidly the eminent Mr Blackstone’s body is turning over in its crypt in Wallingford, England, in the wake of the supreme court decision on the Hobby Lobby case this week.
It seems that now it’s possible for the “natural people” who own the chain of craft stores, to transfer to the “artificial person” (the corporation that they control) their thoughts, convictions and emotions.
What that means in practice, the justices ruled 5-4, is that the company doesn’t have to provide or pay for a health insurance policy that includes some forms of contraception, even though it would be required to do so under the terms of Obamacare.
Their reasoning? Since the company’s controlling shareholders operate their business along religious lines, and they argue that paying for these forms of contraception would violate their religious beliefs, providing the insurance plans represents a violation of the corporate citizen’s rights.
Or, depending on how you parse it, the natural person’s rights, conflated with those of the artificial person.
The Hobby Lobby decision probably won’t send us skidding down the slippery slope toward the end of democracy as we know it. But it tilts the scale still further in favor of artificial people – corporations – a trend that constitutional scholars on this side of the Atlantic have been warning about for decades.
In a 1933 decision, supreme court justice Louis Brandeis cautioned that corporations, granted too many of the rights normally reserved for human beings, can end up dominating the state.
Some were sounding the alarm even before the Citizens United case (in which the supreme court ruled that campaign contribution restrictions limited the free speech rights of these corporate citizens) in 2010. The SUNY Buffalo Law School convened a daylong panel in 2005 revolving around the theme of “Planet of the APs”, making a play on the shorthand for artificial persons. The subtitle: “Are corporations and other artificial persons taking over the legal system?”
Here is the dilemma. We need corporations to have some of the same rights that “natural persons” do. It’s not just a convenient legal fiction, but a necessary one. Without it, you’d have no one to sue when your defective product malfunctioned or your bank defrauded you. You couldn’t sue your employer. If the Guardian or the New York Times didn’t have legal status as corporations, the freedom to insist on publishing what is clearly important for our readers to know would be meaningless.
Giving corporations status as “artificial persons” gives them the ability to stand up in a court of law on behalf of their own interests and customers, to enter into legally-enforceable contracts, and to be held accountable for their misdeeds. Those, we’d all agree, are good things.
The problem is when corporations push the envelope. True, no artificial citizen has yet to demand the right to vote (although I did once catch an April Fool’s Day episode on National Public Radio in the wake of the Citizen’s United Decision to that effect – it briefly had me wondering.)
But the Hobby Lobby decision, I think, has us all teetering on the brink of corporate anthropomorphism: just how natural can an artificial citizen get in this era of artificial intelligence? How many of its owners’ ideas, emotions and convictions can we legitimately ascribe to it?
For the corporations-are-people-too reasoning to work, it needs to feel logical to the rest of us – the sentient part of the population, who breathe, sleep and do all the stuff that corporations don’t (including die). Somehow, a democracy just doesn’t feel, well, democratic, when the potential exists for a big, privately held corporation is a major player in the economy and dominates its industry. It doesn't seem right for a corporation, comprising tens of thousands of people, to claim that it has religious feelings about a law that make it impossible to comply with that law – regardless of what those thousands of employees, its customers, or the elected representatives who passed that law believe. What company am I talking about? Well, take your pick. It could be a business like Cargill, a giant player in the agricultural industry; Bloomberg, a dominant force in journalism and finance; or Koch Industries, the second largest private employer in the country, according to Forbes.
About 90% of the companies in the United States may qualify as closely-held businesses. They may now have a right to express religious feelings, and to have those taken into consideration should they find complying with a law unpalatable.
This issue becomes more significant when we stop and think about the most important way in which we can’t treat a corporation as an individual. Yes, when a company misbehaves, the Justice Department can file criminal charges. But often, that’s a last resort, rather than the automatic action that it is in the case of individuals who run afoul of the criminal justice system.
Then, too, what punishment can be levied against a company? There’s no perp walk for corporate citizens. Yes, there’s reputational harm, but compared to what happens to an individual who has been accused of, say, downloading child pornography, or even drunk driving, it’s chicken feed. Artificial persons don’t have emotions and don’t feel shame. If their name loses its power, they can re-incorporate under another one.
That leads to another pesky question: what to do with corporate malefactors? Credit Suisse just pled guilty to criminal charges of tax evasion and agreed to pay a record $2.6bn fine. But the bank hasn’t been marched off to jail. BNP Paribas pled guilty to conspiracy charges and will pay a $8.8bn fine that equals one and a half years of its profits. That’s not a terribly effective solution anyway, as it leaves thousands of innocent bystanders – employees not involved in the wrongdoing – unemployed, as we saw in the case of Enron.
The supreme court opened the door to viewing artificial people as slightly more human in both the Citizens United and Hobby Lobby Cases. Let’s hope they realize the risks of their anthropomorphism before they step across the?)Article Preview

(2006) Aggregation with clay causes sedimentation of the buoyant cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. Aquatic Microbial Ecology, 44, 165-174. ISSN 0948-3055.
Official URL:
We investigated whether the attachment of clay particles can result in sedimentation of the buoyant cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. For this purpose, we measured aggregation of clay to Microcystis spp. in field samples as well as in laboratory cultures of isolated strains. We focused on how the aggregation of clay to Microcystis spp. is affected by (1) the concentration of suspended clay particles, (2) the type of clay and (3) the stickiness and extracellular polysaccharide composition of these cyanobacteria. Our results show that aggregation of clay to Microcystis spp. is largely driven by mass action. The aggregation rate is proportional to the concentration of suspended clay particles. Experiments in a Couette chamber showed that aggregation of bentonite clay to Microcystis spp. is 15 to 22 times more efficient than aggregation of kaolinite clay. This reflects the difference in cation exchange capacity between these 2 clay minerals. Stickiness varied by more than 1 order of magnitude among different Microcystis strains, and showed a significant positive correlation with the amount of extracellular uronic acids in the slime layer of Microcystis spp. This indicates that uronic acids play an important role in aggregation, presumably through the formation of cation bridges. Our results imply that these buoyant cyanobacteria may undergo high sedimentation rates in lakes with high concentrations of suspended clay.

Training A Donkey
If you have a donkey (or if you're thinking of getting a donkey), you need to read this: Donkey Training: Part One.
Training
a donkey is not difficult. They are intelligent and learn quickly once they
understand what you want them to do. Donkeys communicate using body language and
with a little practice you can learn what their different postures mean so you
can talk to them with a human version of their donkey language.

Scary Movie Formula
Press Release: Mathematicians declare The Shining perfect scary movie.
How'd they come up with that decision? By using a formula:
(es+u+cs+t) squared +s+ (tl+f)/2 + (a+dr+fs)/n + sin x - 1
For example, es represents "escalating music," tl stands for "true life," and n is the number of people.

Presumably, the algo-master was not previously long 3 million shares of AWF...so once again, a clear example of Naked Short Selling (illegal).... which of course, doesn't actually exist and is just a paranoid delusion.
Agreed - I highly doubt the seller even had the shares to sell such a quantity. I highly doubt they preborrowed that amount either.
Now we also must question -- Who the hell would jump in and backstop that trade with that quantity of buy orders? No market maker will back AWF that much -- its way too much risk on their books. This whole thing is a fraud.
Bring back the Uptick rule. But since the SEC is owned by the algo trading firms, it will never happen.

What's funny is the conclusion in that video is to not use Stop orders and they should of had a panic off switch? So, most have known for a long time not to use market orders and now (actually for some time) don't use stop orders.

My visual is JPM trading desk A is selling xyz stocks to JPM trading desk B, the bid and ask both from JPM and both created out of thin air. As they push the xyz up and down, maybe getting creative and trying to trace patterns out of the zig and zag, at the end of the day JPM has not gained or lost unless some fool comes along to buy xyz stock, then they HFT that dumb ass at what ever the fake trading level is for the day and on and on as ever fewer clueless dumb asses are around to throw their hard earned savings into the wood chipper.

- Apr 27, 2009There is no overarching ban on photography, nor is their likely to be. Yet, as a new Manifesto Club report by gallery director Pauline Hadaway outlines, there is growing regulation of citizen photography, with touchy subjects now ranging from policemen to transport facilities, from children's nativity plays to football matches.
This is a model of how liberty is lost today: often not with a blanket draconian law, but through incoherent and creeping restriction at a local level, with rules drawn up by community safety wardens, private security guards and other self-appointed "jobsworths".
Leaving aside the headline-grabbing misuse of counter-terror laws, it is the restrictions on photographing children that perhaps have had the most devastating social impact. A generation of kids is growing up with gaps in the family photo album: no first-swim photos, no videos of the school play, no shots of football matches or swimming galas. If I flick back through my childhood photo album, about half the photos would now not be there.
One of the first restrictions on photographing children came in 2002, with Edinburgh city council's ban on photography in nativity plays and concerts. Such photo bans are now the norm. The National Association of Clubs for Young People advised its membership to remove pictures of children receiving trophies or playing sports from club websites. The Child Protection in Sport Unit suggests that sports clubs consider using illustrations of children rather than photos.
Some organisations have resorted to pixelating out kids' faces, giving a nine-year old footballer the treatment normally reserved for criminal suspects. One representative from the Churches Conservation Trust complained to me that in its brochures it could only show the "backs of children's heads", asking: "Who wants a photo of the back of the head?"
Where there is no explicit ban, there are often contorted and bizarre restrictions on the kinds of photos that may be taken. Some organisations require that parent photographers have explicit permission – signed and dated forms – from any young tennis or football players who feature in photos of their child's match. One school demands that parents only picture their child "against a wall/fence/hedge where they are sure that no other child is in the photo". Some child protection officials even prescribe which particular parts of a child's body may be photographed. The Child Protection in Sport Unit recommends that photos of children swimming are shot "from waist or shoulder up". Given that swimming is based on the arms and legs, a "shoulder up" photo is not ideal.
Such restrictions are justified on the basis of implausible scenarios – including that football match photos could be "adapted for inappropriate use", for example pasted on a child pornography website; or that paedophiles could use the match photos to identify children to target for "grooming".
This is not about the paedophile, but about a new view of the citizen. The gaze of the citizen is presumed to be malevolent, and anyone who takes photos gets the question "Why are you taking photos?" As Hadaway says, "looking becomes itself identified with predation". Worse, this is a view internalised by many citizens themselves. One teacher stopped taking photos of his nursery school's events when a parent commented, "Likes his photos – probably got an ulterior motive."
Nursery photos might not seem like the forefront of the fight for liberty, but these are strange times and regulation works in strange ways. We need to shift our frame accordingly, and defend the citizen photographer at football matches and nativity plays?)3:18PM EST November 16. 2012 - Florida has gotten within a clutch jumper of heading to the Final Four in each of the last two years.

Review: HUGO
I was disappointed with Martin Scorsese's HUGO. I was ready to love it, too. I don't know why so many are saying this is the director's most personal film, just because half of it deals with the title character's last-minute love of movies. Scorsese's A PERSONAL JOURNEY THROUGH CINEMA already did that (meanwhile, MEAN STREETS and THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST are also infinitely more personal, for more complex reasons). I'm baffled, too, because HUGO bears few hallmarks of a Scorsese movie; Thelma Schoonmaker's editing seems flabby and the mere presence of kind, well-balanced children makes it a strange entry into Scorsese's ouvre (the only kids I can remember in previous Scorsese movies are the mouthy Alfred Lutter and Jodie Foster in ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, Foster's teen whore in TAXI DRIVER, the minature gangster wannabe Henry Hill in GOODFELLAS, and the very young, nude Howard Hughes in THE AVIATOR's first scene). Plus, Scorsese's postcardy 1925-era Paris feels more like Dickensian England. (Scorsese's connection to Paris is tenuous. Everyone in the film has a British accent. Are French accents too much at ask for? Oh, yeah, this is the company that changed the film's name three times, from the book's title THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET, to HUGO CABRET, to the Franco-scrubbed HUGO; the studio would prefer, obviously, to downplay the French thing). Some are saying that this is Scorsese's try at a Spielbergian statement, but it feels more like lazy late-80s Chris Columbus. (If Scorsese's name weren't connected to this film, would it seriously be given as much leeway as it has with critics and movie fans? At press time, the audience has spoken and this $170 million film is a resounding box-office dud.)
The first hour of HUGO is pure set-up and 3D tricks, with the orphaned title character winding his way through the innards of the Gare Montparnasse, the Paris train station he calls home (he lives inside of, and runs, the station's huge, many-cogged clock). Hugo, as a character, never really gets under our skin because he's written so thinly by screenwriter John Logan (who doesn't skimp with the plotholes, either); Hugo has two unpleasant settings: harried and hurt. Asa Butterfield, the actor playing Hugo, doesn't help matters: his palpable lack of facial expressions eventually became somewhat disturbing to me (he does have big, blue, blank-staring eyes, though I never had any idea what they were saying). The one scene between he and Jude Law as his father wasn't enough for me to sense any sort of demonstrated connection between the two characters, and certainly not enough for motivation to drive this story (Law is dispatched early, with only five or six lines, mostly about the admittedly nifty wind-up robot that plays a central role in the tale; by the way, Hugo's mother is never mentioned). Sasha Baron Cohen, as a constantly frustrated train station gendarme who's after the thieving Hugo, plays the sort of now-cliched Frenchman that Peter Sellers had a much better time with in the 60s and 70s. He's totally wasted here, and doesn't even get to do a reDACulous Far-ench accent.
In HUGO's busy-work first half, there're a lot of essentially boring scenes strung together with dizzying camera/computer tricks, gorgeous art direction (by Dante Ferretti, who can polish up his Oscar speech now), and never-exciting chases. After all of the set up with the father dying and Hugo's adoption by a drunken uncle (Ray Winstone), we're then never given any hint of Hugo's real relationship with his clockwork-training uncle because, like Law, he disappears from the film so quickly. Hugo's love interest, played by a usually-reliable but here struggling Chloe Moretz, injects a little life into the movie, but their flirtations eventually fizzle out mightily (I was left at the film's end wondering how Hugo felt about his instantly-changed relationship with Moretz, which I imagined was met with resounding crash). About an hour into the film, Scorsese's main point--that silent films are awesome--comes into play as a sidebar when the cantankerous toy shop owner that torments Hugo (Ben Kingsley) turns out to be film pioneer George Melies.
HUGO perks up for a while with this diversion from Hugo's own story, mainly because Melies had a fascinating rise and decline, to which Scorsese's film is faithful. But, you know, though it would have been a harder sell to the studios, I would have preferred Scorsese tackling a whole movie about Melies' life; as it stands, this film history lesson/plea for film restoration seems shoehorned into this rather somber kid's film, and effectively works as a sort of bait-and-switch for the audience. Kingsley's performance is not particularly memorable, but I do love the remarkably colorful Meiles' shooting set recreations--in fact, everything in HUGO that deals with film history is fun (it was a welcome relief, actually, to see all the silent movie clips here--everything from the Lumiere's WORKERS LEAVING A FACTORY to Harold Lloyd's SAFETY LAST, but no NOSFERATU or SUNRISE; also, it's interesting to eventually see the flat Melies images transformed into 3D). However, this section of the movie shoves Hugo way into the background of his own story. By the time we come back to his world, we hardly care what happens to him, and you can sense Hugo's an afterthought for the filmmakers as well. In the end, the most interesting character here is the taciturn automaton (another Ferretti creation) that drives the film's plot. The device's enigmatic face is the film's single lasting image, which is pretty sad to say, considering HUGO obviously wants to move us to tears.
Look, I adore Melies as a filmmaker, and I'm glad that HUGO tries to educate kids about the charms of silent cinema by his inclusion here. But, honestly, that's no reason for me to love this movie (by the way, the kids sitting in front of me at the theater spent the first hour distractedly trying to grab at the 3D snow and steam and once the Melies story commenced, they began seriously squirming in their seats). I will handily admit HUGO's steampunky rust is beautiful to look at (forget the 3D, though; it's impressive, but unnecessary). But all the way through, I kept wishing Scorsese's film had the overpowering emotion of, say, Carroll Ballard's THE BLACK STALLION, another visually striking film about an isolated boy who, instead, happens to be funny, clever, talented and easy to care for. THE BLACK STALLION does everything HUGO wants to do; it conjures up REAL magic while restoring the lovable main character's self-confidence and connection to a charismatic father. But, instead, HUGO is nearly in toto a humorless, charmless affair. Though it's constantly searching, it fails to find its heart. It's a broken machine.
FINAL NOTE: In case you loved HUGO and want to call me an unfeeling curmudgeon, you should know that I went to see THE MUPPETS right afterwards. I forgave that movie for its faults, because the Muppets themselves--as always--captivated me. Lotsa laughs in THE MUPPETS (but maybe too much focus on the human characters and only one good song; Paul Williams was apparently unavailable) . But, for sure, it was much more fun than HUGO.

Thanks for the picture Mike, I’ve never been inside the building but I did know of the overhanging projection box.I had wondered if it may have been the extension on the right (although it’s not in the centre) I had no idea of the length ot the auditorium and although the slate roof comes down the other end it has to be longer than that. I’d like to go inside, but Blaenau is not a town I often visit,because it’s not a place you have to go near when travelling from Pwllheli to other places. if you know what I mean,I’m sure it’s still unused.
I have loaded a picture of the Empire showing the overhanging Projection Box
Guys, Enough is enough of this personal squabble. The last 10 comments have nothing to do with the Empire Picture Palace, so please get back onto subject.
Then why do you seek to tell people your version as though it has to be believed as you are telling it? and if you are not on the site to throw insults why do you? I went out of my way to pleasantly tell you of your mistake over the projection box only to get insulted! And this by someone who had never been to the cinema!
We went to the archives in Caernarfon when we celebrated the cinema’s 75th aniversary in 1986, I was also there for the 50th in 1961. Why so hostile with words such as ‘pontifcating'I’m sure you will want to answer this again, so I’ll let you have the last word as I will not be carrying on with this matter.I’m not on this site to throw insults at people we’re all here to help each other,correcting contributor’s is fine but not through belittling people.It’s also supposed to be against the sites rules
You really should do more research before you pontificate! Try looking back at old issues of the Caernarfon & Denbigh Herald as I have done for the TRUE facts instead of imagining what you think you heard in the dim distant past! Also lots of cinemas only registered under the act long after they had opened.
Also one surely cannot class halls as being cinemas just because of the odd travelling film show,any hall could have held these,& as I stated before Pwllheli is celebrating it’s centenery as a fully registered cinema this year.
I Was not writing about any Neuadd Goffa, but Neuadd Dwyfor Pwllheli,which you yourself stated quite rightly on the appropriate page opened in 1902.I worked longer in this building than any person living or now dead, and please no quips that I must have been there in 1902 ! !.
Afraid you have your facts wrong! Neuadd Goffa opened in 1900 and played host to several travelling Fil shows prior to having permanent lessees, cinema wise.
Neuadd Goffa was the host to several travelling film shows prior to 1910, prior to it permanently hosting film shows!
Neuadd dwyfor did not start until 1911, It will be celebrating it’s centenary as a cinema this year.
The 1909 act dealt only with the need to isolate the box from the audience so that any fire could not spread from the inflammable film into the auditorium, it did not specify the size of the box. Because of the problem of building ‘new'boxes in existing venues owners took advantage of this. Remember that Neuadd Dwyfor preceeded that act as a cinema!
Being a projectionist I of course know all about the old fire regulations, which were still enforced for many years after the demise of the highly inflammable nitrate fims, and yet the present isolated box at Neuadd Dwyfor Pwllheli was not built until 1930, to accomodate the advent of sound equipment (2 projectors etc)
The strange thing is that the projection booth during the silent days was at the back of the stalls under the balcony, it looks no bigger than a telephone kiosk and certainly not as high as one. I’ve often wondered how this was legal.
The original projection box had nothing to do with the length of throw, but the 1909 cinematograph act that required the projection box to be seperated from the audience in case of fire! One of the Wrexham cinemas had a similar overhanging box, I can’t remember which offhand.
I wasn’t disputing Capelmawr’s comment’s, I was just explaining that I thought it could have been the projection booth, as I did not know the length of the building from the road to the back.
It would be nice if he could send the picture on to this site, although I’m myself am having difficulty inserting them since the Cinema Treasures changed it’s format.
If Mr Evans lets me have his e-mail address I will send him a copy of my photo with the box in place so he can see for himself!
Like I said I was only wondering, and from the picture the building looks long enough,It’s not possible to see the length from the road to the back without visiting the site, which Capelmawr has done.
There are cinemas with the main doors on the side of the buildng, such as the former Luxor Menai Bridge.
Mr Evans is mistaken, the overhanging projection box was , as stated at the front of the building “overhanging the street” not at the side of the building. If it was the latter it would be the only cinema where films were shown sideways to the audience.
I was just wondering what the overhanging extension on the google picture was,my statement was that it looks like it’s still there,why the sarcastic remark ?
I am surprised to hear that the overhanging projection box was still in situ. It had definately gone in 2009 asnd when I passed the former cinema a month ago! Has Mr Evans rebuilt it?1-800-818-8394

MOBILE, Ala. – Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten will now be heading to his ninth career Pro Bowl.
Witten was added to the 2014 NFL Pro Bowl on Sunday to replace Broncos tight end Julius Thomas, who’s now Super Bowl bound.
Wide receiver Dez Bryant and Tyron Smith were initially the only two players selected to the Pro Bowl from the Dallas Cowboys, but Jason Hatcher (and now Witten) were additions this week. Witten’s ninth Pro Bowl appearance ties him with Randy White for the fourth-most in team history, behind only Bob Lilly, Larry Allen and Mel Renfro.

BOYS BYE-WEEK BREAKDOWN: All tight ends, including James Hanna should be more involved in the offense
Dallas Cowboys Tight Ends Breakdown
This article is part of a series. To see all related posts, click HERE. Enjoy!
Top Performer: Jason Witten
It’s no surprise that Jason Witten continues to play at the level that he has. Despite all the battles that this veteran has seen, there still is that skill when it comes to route running and securing the ball when it is thrown in his direction. What all these seasons in the league has done for Witten, it has allowed him to become crafty of a player. When it comes to the ins and outs of offensive football, Jason Witten would be that guy to ask. He has such an outstanding working knowledge of what teams are trying to do to him and how he needs to combat them.
Jason Garrett has told us many times, there is nothing new of Witten having to fight through these defensive schemes that are trying to take him out of the game. Where Witten has been at his best, is when he does get those opportunities to work against single coverage and find that space. These offensive coaches, are working the ball to Witten in the red zone. It’s never a bad situation to put your best player in when it comes to catching the ball in tight spaces. Jason Witten has proven, he can consistently deliver in that role, which he has all season.
Need More From: James Hanna
Offensive coaches need to get James Hanna more involved in the offense but doesn’t appear that will be the case. Like Lance Dunbar, there are things that Hanna can do to help this offense in the passing game. For example, more routes up the field, instead of those chances that he just gets in the flat. If Hanna is not going to be used in the passing game, then expect more from him at the point of attack in the running game.
On DeMarco Murray’s 35-yard run against the Saints, Hanna had an outstanding kick-out block on Kenny Vacarro that allowed Murray to sneak inside of him. Jason Witten sealed the edge that got Murray to the 2nd level and off to the races. Where Hanna has had his struggles is when he hasn’t been as powerful as he needed to be and he gets compressed into the backfield causing the ball to be stopped for no gain or even for a loss. Where this offense needs to take advantage of Hanna is allowing him to block on the move like he did in the Saints game. He is a much better player when he can attack a defense this way because of his athletic ability to stay on his feet and run with his man. Regardless, this offense needs more from James Hanna on the edge.
Six-Game Forecast: Tight ends are a safe, high percentage tool for extending drives
These games down the stretch are going to be tough and tight which requires your players to be at their absolute best when it comes to executing plays. The safest route when trying to control or finish games is how you use your tight ends in certain situations.
Despite the fact that we have really only seen Jason Witten as that go to guy. James Hanna and even Gavin Escobar are going to have to make some tough plays down the stretch. All three of these tight ends have the ability to get down the field and secure the ball when it is thrown in their direction. You use your tight ends, when you want to make simple, easy throws. We understand that their “11” and “01” personnel groups might be their best packages when it comes to moving the ball, but there will be a game or two where this “12” personnel group will be the difference in the outcome in the game.
There is just too much talent with these tight ends not to fully take advantage of their ability. These final six games will prove that to be the case.
BOYS BYE-WEEK BREAKDOWN: All wide receivers should benefit from Miles Austin return
Dallas Cowboys Wide Receivers Breakdown
This article is part of a series. To see all related posts, click HERE. Enjoy!
Top Performer: Dez Bryant
The ultimate compliment to a player is when opponents focus their entire game plan in an attempt to take you out of the game for that day. There is no question when you study these games that defensive coordinators are determined to not allow Dez Bryant to take over a game.
Kansas City has been the only club this season that tried to play Bryant with single coverage and that almost got them beaten. The numbers say that despite all this attention, Bryant is still finding ways to continue to make plays, but I will also say that it has come at a price. Bryant has had to fight his rear off every snap to try and find space.
It hasn’t been easy for him and at times it has been frustrating, but these are the situations that the top receivers around the league have to deal with every day. There has never been a question of Bryant’s ability to go get the ball, but where he needs to improve his game is his ability as a route runner to work those routes against the various schemes designed to take him out of the game.
There was a time early in his career where he had no shot — now at least he has an understanding of what he needs to do to give himself a chance to succeed. Bryant is also going to need the help of the coaching staff to put himself in a better position to make plays, as well.
Need More From: Miles Austin
The medical staff made the determination to shut Miles Austin down after the Philadelphia game and attempt to get him ready for these final six games. If ever a player needed to step up on this offense and make a difference, it is Austin.
With no disrespect to Terrance Williams, Cole Beasley and Dwayne Harris, the reason that Dez Bryant and Jason Witten are seeing the type of coverage that they are is because there is no threat on the outside. In regards to Williams, teams are making the rookie to have to fight playing through press coverage all day, and he just doesn’t have the knowledge of how to beat that with any consistency.
At least with Austin in the lineup, Jason Garrett and Bill Callahan can pair Austin with Bryant on the same side of the field and that will draw coverage away from Bryant. They can also use him in those bunch formations along with Witten and make teams have to play man against it or take their chances in zone.
Understandably, there is not a great deal of confidence in how well Austin’s health may hold up these last six weeks and beyond, but right now, it is the best option this offense has in trying to help them move the ball with more consistency, convert third downs and finish drives.
Austin is back on the practice field at his normal spot at the “Z,” and from all reports he’s made it through without any issues.
Six-Game Forecast: More weapons mean more pressure on defenses
We have seen some games this season where these receivers have been clutch, but also some times where they have been completely shut down.
As this offense goes, so do the receivers. Getting Austin back for this group is a huge step in the right direction in terms how it will help take coverage away from Bryant and Witten.
The more potential weapons they have on the field, the more opportunity to see them put pressure on these defenses to have to defend the entire offense. Dez Bryant is still the best option here and should continue to be, but he needs help.
That means Austin, Williams, Beasley and Harris need to step up their games as well. When this group is on, it can be hard to deal with — like it was in the final drive of the Minnesota game. For these next six games, these receivers need to find a way to be a nasty, play making group, because their postseason lives are on the line.)
CHANNELING THE X-FACTOR: Jason Garrett has talk with Dez Bryant; team appreciates his passion and emotion (Special Feature). That’s what we want from all of our players. The great players have that, the great teams have that, but you just have to focus it and channel it. He understands that.”
Since Bryant received national headlines for his behavior on the sideline Sunday, including criticism from analyst Brian Billick during the telecast, the Cowboys repeatedly have defended Bryant, insisting his emotional outbursts are not a distraction.
TV cameras twice caught sideline rants by Bryant. In the third quarter, Bryant appeared to be expressing his displeasure at not getting the ball more. Tony Romo targeted Bryant six times in the game, with Bryant catching three passes for 72 yards and two touchdowns.
After the Lions scored with 12 seconds left, Bryant had a heated exchange with teammates Jason Witten and DeMarcus Ware, who said they were trying to calm down Bryant and get him focused for the final play.
“I know everybody wants to read into Dez’s emotion on the sidelines, but contrary to popular belief, he’s not as negative as you would think over there,” Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said on his radio show on KRLD-FM 105.3. “He’s not every time that happens, saying, ‘Give me the ball! Give me the ball! Give me the ball!’ He’s encouraging in his way. Obviously, everyone has their opinion, and they’ll have that. But Dez will be fine.
“…It’s not an issue. The only thing Jason Witten was telling him, ‘Get your mind right here. We may have to get back out and try a Hail Mary.’ …Dez is highly competitive. He really wants to win the game. Winning is important to him.”
Editors note: Bill Billick was selected in the 11th round of the 1977 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers but was cut by the 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys, and never played in the NFL. Billick coached for the Minnesota Vikings from 1992-1998, and was the head coach of the Baltimore Ravens from 1999-2007.

Jason Garrett: “Dez is a very passionate player. He is a very competitive player. He gets a lot of attention from the opposing defenses. He wanted the football. We want guys who want the football. Dez has never been a distraction to our team. He is a really positive asset to our team on the field and off. The way he works. The passion for the game. That is good stuff.”
Jerry Jones: “That’s emotion and I don’t place any issue on his demeanor or his sideline activity. He’s a very emotional player and this was a tough game for him to compete in because he wanted to really contribute and do everything he could for the team and to win.

SILVER AND BLUE DEBUT: Dallas Cowboys take in AT&T Stadium aura at homecoming
ARLINGTON, Texas – The practice was very much the same, but the venue could not have been more different.
The Cowboys went through the Silver and Blue Debut on Thursday night – the final full practice before Saturday’s preseason home opener. But while the past month’s practices have taken place on humble practice fields in Oxnard, Calif., and Valley Ranch, Thursday’s show took place on the grand stage of AT&T Stadium.
“It’s fun, you know, it really is. This is a great building,” said Cowboys coach Jason Garrett. “We all feel very fortunate to be able to play and coach in it. It’s probably as good a stadium as there is on the planet. To be able to come here to practice and play our games here is really special.”
It was a typical practice for a team that’s 48 hours away from the toughest action of the preseason – the second-to-last preseason game is typically referred to as the dress rehearsal. The Cowboys practices in shorts and shirts with no pads, working primarily on timing and fine-tuning.
But pregame, non-contact practices don’t typically take place in front of such a crowd. Over10,000 fans attended the event, not to mention a plethora of Cowboys alumni from Roger Staubach and Mel Renfro to Larry Brown and Jay Novacek.
The opportunity is one Garrett said the Cowboys need to be mindful of.
“A couple of years ago we had training camp here for a couple weeks, and I think the guys really, really enjoyed being here,” Garrett said. “It’s just a fantastic facility, and I think every time you go out there you just remind yourself how fortunate we are to be a part of it.”
Despite the routine nature of the workout, the atmosphere amped the anticipation up a bit. Even tight end Jason Witten, with 10 years and four seasons at AT&T Stadium under his belt, could feel it.
Witten said a practice in the home stadium lets him know the season is almost here.
“It always knows it’s just right around the corner when you’re here,” he said. “You see the excitement in the fans and the alumni, and you get that feeling. I think every year, as a player, there’s always that time when you know you’re getting close. This is kind of the kick off for that.”
It wouldn’t be the NFL if there weren’t some competitive advantage to something as routine as a practice. AT&T Stadium had a new turf field put down during July, and Garrett said it was nice to give the team some experience on the new carpet before game day.
“It’s good for us to be able to get out there, run around a little bit and have a real football practice instead of just walking around on it or jogging around on it before the game,” he said. “I think that’s a good thing for our team to be able to take advantage of.”
The full opulence of AT&T Stadium wasn’t even on display for the Silver and Blue Debut. The stadium staff was still working on game mechanics, and only the building’s lower level was filled.
That said, Garrett noted the value of an in-stadium practice before the Cowboys kick off against the Bengals – especially the team’s newcomers.
“One of the real positives of coming over here today is that they get a chance to see it, and some of the awe factor goes away a little bit,” Garrett said. “When they come back on Saturday, they’re ready to go to work and play a ball game – that’s an added benefit of practicing here tonight.”

SCOUTS OPINION: Cutting FB Vickers won’t affect DeMarco Murray; might help him
It was very clear that the direction that this Cowboys offense was going in this off-season with the drafting of Gavin Escobar and the signing of Anthony.
Bryan Broaddus | Football Analyst/Scout
THE ONE-TWO PUNCH: Young Gavin Escobar and James Hanna gives the Dallas Cowboys multiple two-tight end offensive packages
Gavin Escobar, one of the best receiving tight ends in college football the past two seasons, joins Jason Witten and James Hanna in the tight ends room. All Witten did was set the single-season record for receptions by a tight end in league history.
So are there enough balls to go around?
“I’m just ready to have them in the game if they call their number,” said Wes Phillips, in his first season as the team’s tight ends coach. “I would imagine taking a young guy who is as talented as Escobar and having James Hanna along to complement Witten, we can get into some different packages in 12 [one running back, two tight ends]. Each of those guys can play to their strengths.”
The Dallas Cowboys could use two tight ends more this season. Dallas didn’t use much last season with John Phillips as its second tight end, running only 195 plays with its 12 personnel..
The Cowboys believe Escobar is a better offensive weapon than Bennett or Phillips, who left for San Diego in March as a free agent. Escobar caught 122 passes for 1,646 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons at San Diego State.
“We used some resources to draft him,” Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. “We used a second-round pick, so we think a lot of him, and we want to give him every opportunity to acclimate him to our offensive system.
“What we have to do as coaches is decide who our best 11 guys are, what our best personnel groups are and try to shape our offense accordingly. You know we’ve used a lot of two tight end offense in the past. …So we want to keep attacking defenses a lot of different ways. We’ll do it with different personnel groups and with different guys within those personnel groups.”.
Witten, who played 1,112 plays last season, caught a tight ends record 110 passes for 1,039 yards and three touchdowns. Hanna had eight catches for 86 yards, and Phillips caught eight passes for 55 yards and a score.
DON’T KILL THE MESSENGER: It’s about execution, not who’s calling the plays
Jason Garrett might give up play-calling duties to Bill Callahan. Then, again, maybe he won’t. Both Garrett and Callahan spoke to the media this week, but it remains a mystery about who will actually call the plays for the 2013-2014 Dallas Cowboys.

gnap-dev@l.g.o mailing listFoodies around the world have clamored for a taste of Ferran Adrià’s cooking at El Bulli, the restaurant he’s worked at since 1984 and that he’s transformed into a palace of modern cuisine, particularly in recent years as his fame has grown to international proportions.
Despite the $650 price tag (not including wine or plane tickets to Barcelona) experiencing the formal, hours-long tasting menu there became the holy grail of the food-obsessed, and never more so since Adrià announced that the restaurant will be closing next year to focus entirely on lab experiments in molecular gastronomy.
On January 12th, however, he revealed the first of two restaurants that will take its place: 41 Degrees, a tapas bar in Barcelona serving cuisine far beyond the usual gambas al aijillo—think crisp mangoes with tagete flowers, crunchy tomatoes with basil butter, cornets of salmon roe with egg yolk, and black-olive cake—for a price similar to American tapas.
We’re waiting with bated breath for Tickets, the other restaurant scheduled to open next door, to reveal it’s secrets later this year as well.FIND LOCAL:

Las Vegas 11, Salt Lake 6
Rafael Montero got roughed up early, but he eventually settled down and went 5 innings, giving up 5 runs on 6 hits with 1 walk and 6 strikeouts. Ryan Reid, Chase Bradford, and Gonzalez Germen all threw a scoreless inning. Allan Dykstra was 4 for 4 with a solo homer. Andrew Brown was 2 for 3 with 2 walks and a 2-run homer. Kirk Nieuwenhuis was 3 for 5 with a 3-run homer in his Vegas return. Josh Satin was 2 for 5 with a double and 2-run homer. Taylor Teagarden had 2 hits and 2 RBI’s.
Binghamton 6, Trenton 1
Greg Peavey let up 1 run on 5 hits over 8 innings while striking out 7, continuing his mastery of AA. Darrell Ceciliani had 2 hits and 2 RBI’s. T.J. Rivera and Brian Burgamy also had 2 hits each. Jayce Boyd hit a solo homer. Dilson Herrera had a surprising 0 for 5 day, while Brandon Nimmo was 1 for 4 with a walk.
Augusta 5, Savannah 2
Ricky Knapp took the loss after giving up 4 runs on 8 hits over 6.1 innings. Dominic Smith was 1 for 4; his single was 1 of just 5 hits for the Gnats.
Vermont 5, Brooklyn 2
Octavio Acosta scattered 10 hits over 5 innings, allowing 4 runs and taking the loss. Michael Conforto was 2 for 4 with a double and RBI. Tyler Moore also had 2 hits and a double. Jhoan Urena was 1 for 3 with a double and a walk.
Burlington 3, Kingsport 2 (Game 1, 10 innings)
Yoryi Nuez started but went just 4 innings, giving up 2 runs on 2 hits. The bullpen threw 5 shutout innings, until Bryce Beeler gave up a run in the bottom of the 10th. Ivan Wilson doubled and drove in 2 runs.
Burlington 7, Kingsport 2 (Game 2, 7 innings)
Andrew Church let up 6 runs (4 earned) on 7 hits over 5 innings. Wuilmer Becerra was 2 for 3; his season line is up to .313/.349/.525
GCL Marlins 14, GCL Mets 1
This one was ugly, with Adrian Almeida lasting just 1.2 innings, allowing 7 runs (4 earned). The bullpen didn’t fair much better, but the team committed 5 errors, including 3 from Alfredo Reyes. Dionis Rodriguez provided the only 2 hits of the game for the Mets, a double and a homer. Wilfredo Tovar made a rehab appearance, going 0 for 2 with a walk.In springtime, when the world awakes,
I shoulder shovel, hoe, and rake
To till my garden’s rich brown earth
And plant the seeds that bring new birth.
The sun will coax the seedling out,
And rain will quench the thirsty sprout.
And if I keep the weeds away,
I’ll harvest vegetables someday.
I’m like a tender plant, I know.
I need much care if I’m to grow.
The rich soil of eternity.
As sunshine helps the sprouting seed,
My parents’ love is what I need
To help me firmly fix my roots,
Imbedded in the gospel’s truths.
I must pull out the weeds of sin
So gospel light may enter in.
And as leaves stretch to touch the sun,
My spirit yearns to know God’s Son.
My good works are the fruit I bear,
A harvest rich for all to share.
Celestial glory is my goal,
With God, the Gardener of my soul.

"He dropped his hat, glasses, and some of his money when the dye pack blew up on him," said Montclair Police Chief David Sabagh.
Police swarmed the neighborhood surrounding the Bloomfield Avenue bank minutes after the 10:15 a.m. robbery, hunting for a middle-aged suspect. He passed a note to a teller and did not show a weapon, police said.
The cash was found in the adjoining parking lot, police said.
"We're going to see if we can catch him in this area," Sabagh said.
The "hat bandit," is blamed for 13 heists in suburban Essex, Morris and Union counties.Advise clients on financial plans utilizing knowledge of tax and investment strategies, securities, insurance, pension plans, and real estate.

Sarah Frater • London • 14 Aug 2009
1. It stars Doreen Wells, aka the Marchionesses of Londonderry, and one-time Royal Ballet dancer
Given her many loyal fans who'll be queuing for tickets, getting Wells to perform is a huge coup for Marney. He’s much too young to remember Wells’ appearance at the last minute at the Spoleto Festival in the 1960s when Margot Fonteyn was injured off and she danced with Rudolf Nureyev. However, it’s part of dance lore, as is Wells’ second life in musical entertainment, where she worked with Harry Secombe, Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa in a BBC Christmas Extravaganza, plus appeared in On your Toes, 42nd Street, and the 1985 Royal Variety Show. In Hotel Follies Wells plays an older dancer with more than a few tales to tell. Joining her are dancers from Rambert, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, including “Tamara Rioja”, and Northern Ballet Theatre.
2. It’s the work of up-and-coming Christopher Marney
There are lots of good omens for the young Marney. He trained at the Central School of Ballet and worked with Matthew Bourne in his all-male swan version of Swan Lake. Marney has also danced with the Ballet Boyz, Michael Clark and Will Tuckett, plus he's created some small-scale choreography at the Bridewell Theatre, Gothenburg Ballet and Ballet Central. Now comes Hotel Follies, his first evening-length piece, with able dancers, nice costumes and live musicians. It also has a strong idea, which shows Marney understands the importance of theme and story-telling. It’s early days of course, but all bodes well for the 30-year-old.
3. It includes live music and good costumes
Both are rare in small-scale dance, where tiny budgets make pre-recorded music and modest costumes all but inevitable. Marney admits he’s been lucky with funding, but it also shows he has a good eye, and good ear, and appreciates that it's better to do something small and well than big and scrimp.
4. It features excerpts and re-interpretations of famous dance scenes
This will please dance fans who like old favorites as well as discovering new ones. On offer are an interpretation of Moira Shearer’s solo from the Powell-Pressburger classic The Red Shoes, a pas de six of macho bravura set to La Bayadère, plus a little seen work from Matthew Bourne. This alone makes Hotel Follies worth seeing, although Marney’s new choreography also sounds good fun.
5. It’s the only thing on
This isn’t intended as faint praise, but an accurate description of how the London dance scene hibernates in August – The Royal Ballet is away, Sadler’s Wells and the Southbank have long-runners you’ll already have seen, and it’s two months until Dance Umbrella. Happily, Hotel Follies looks strong, so it shouldn’t waste your time.

This is fun, thank you for putting it together.Having sold more than 10 million albums, it is Steven Curtis Chapman’s massive sweep of awards that draws one’s attention.
He has, for example, released 46 No. 1 Christian radio hit songs.
Chapman earned five Grammy Awards, but it is the Gospel Music Association that has revered him most. His music has earned 56 Dove Awards, more than any other artist, and his seven Dove Awards for “Artist of the Year” also are an industry record.
One wonders if each award means as much these days.
“I can honestly say they don’t mean any less,” he began, and he has not forgotten the importance of his first.
“You get your first nomination and you can hardly believe you’ve been recognized,” said Chapman during a telephone conversation this week.
When he won his first Grammy Award, he remembered, “My wife, Mary Beth, was standing up on her chair, cheering. Bonnie Raitt was sitting right behind her.
“We were both huge Bonnie Raitt fans, and I’m not sure what was cooler: Winning a Grammy, or my wife getting to talk to Bonnie Raitt.”
Having been honored, he said, “That’s when you’re the new guy, and then you don’t know how long it will last. You work harder and hopefully make better music. Every record represents something significant in your life.”
Finally, there arrives that “sense of accomplishment.”
On the other hand, he added, “But I’m human. I have a pulse.”
Meaning that it is only human nature to hope for one more victory, which is why he put so much effort into his new album “The Glorious Unfolding,” which arrives in stores Tuesday.
“I’ve had a lot of singer-songwriter-type moments, more intimate times with an audience,” he noted.
Although his younger features hide his age well, the 50-year-old veteran is ready to go all-out. He is touring with a full band, and plans on squeezing everyone — event the light show — into his Sunday concert at Lubbock’s First Baptist Church.
“My new album has an epic feel to it,” he began. “The music is bigger, and the songs are more anthemic. It’s been too long since I have used all these elements.”
He chose the title because, “God is an amazing story, but there are a lot of chapters in that story. If you just open any book to such-and-such chapter, it may be the hardest chapter, when everything goes bad. You would be deceived to think that is the whole story.
“So I see this unfolding of God’s story to be something that is really great.”
He stressed, “And I don’t say that flippantly. I’ve walked through dark chapters myself. But then this incredible unfolding comes, when we are really with God.”
Chapman elaborated, “This record is different; I produced it to reflect the season I am in at this point. After losing Maria Sue, I made a record called ‘Beauty Will Rise’ because I needed that music to feel organic and under-produced. But now is a celebration of new seasons and new beginnings.
“I have a grandbaby, and a newly married son. So I wanted music to sound fresh and new, exciting and fun. My family is laughing again. That’s what I set out to reflect.”
Chapman is very devoted to family. He and his wife, Mary Beth, have five children, including two girls adopted from China: Shaohannah “Shaoey” Hope Yan and Stevey Joy Ru.
A third adopted child, Maria Sue Chunxi, died in a tragic car accident in 2008. Chapman’s youngest son accidentally struck her when driving his vehicle into the family’s driveway.
It was a time, recalled Chapman, “when my faith was tested and shaken to the core. My wife and I had a long, long fall and, for a while, did not know if we would ever hit bottom. I remember her opening her eyes one morning and saying, ‘Well, I made it through another night. Here I am, facing another day.’ ”
It was a black hole of despair and devastation.
“But there was a bottom, and that bottom was solid! We held on to the foundation of God’s promises, and he promised that we will see our daughter (Maria Sue) again. That’s not a fairy tale, not wishful thinking.
“For us, that is reality. Holding onto that sustained us.”
These days, Chapman also is having fun experiencing a new title: that of Grandpa.
A baby girl, Eiley Eliza Richards, was born to his daughter Emily and her husband, Tanner Richards, in Ireland in November 2011.
“Most things are oversold,” began Chapman, “like when friends tell you that you have to read this book, see this movie, visit this vacation spot.
“I also heard people talking up grandchildren. One person told me they are so great that you’ll wish you could have them first.
“Now I can honestly say that there is no experience in the world like being a grandparent. Not only to watch and be amazed by your grandchild, but also to watch your children become parents.”
He laughed, and added, “And yes, it’s true. You do feel a bit of sinister, evil pleasure, knowing it is your child’s turn to have all the sleepless nights.”
Chapman is indeed in a much happier place as he begins this concert tour.Search Results | "free fridays #" [...]Continue reading...

(Beckett walked one and struck out eight in six innings.) Veteran lefties Scott Schoenweis (two hits, two walks, two runs in 2/3 of an inning) and Alan Embree (two hits, three earned runs, two walks in 2/3 of an inning) struggled.
“Your game plan might be overexposed, but you always have to make adjustments against guys during the season. Pitching one time against them in spring training is not that big of a deal.” — Josh Beckett, on facing divisional rival Tampa (Globe Notebook)
Nick Cafardo has a nugget on the on-going contract discussions with Beckett as well: “The Sox do not want to make a six-year commitment to Beckett. They would like to structure a contract along the lines of the deal the Phillies gave Roy Halladay, who signed a three-year, $60 million extension with a hard-to-earn option season. It doesn’t appear the Sox are near the $20 million per season figure, but they could be north of the $16.5 million per season they gave John Lackey. The key element for the Sox remains protection in case Beckett has a shoulder injury.”
Sean McAdam has his own report, noting: “This much is known: The Red Sox will not guarantee a fifth year for Beckett, and Beckett is insistent that he be paid more than new teammate John Lackey. However, each side is comfortable with the stance of the other and the stipulations are not mututally exclusive. … The Sox, a baseball source said, aren’t worried about protection language in the conract because they believe they can get their own insurance on the deal, absolving them of some liability in the event that Beckett goes down with a shoulder problem.”
AND ABOUT THE OFFENSE: “You’ve got to take that for what it is. We lost Jason Bay, who is coming off a great year. Teams just do things in different ways in different years. I think we have a more solid lineup when you throw Scutaro, Cameron, and Beltre into the mix. … I think the core of our lineup is still there.” — J.D. Drew, on Boston’s offense as part of a story discussing three of the biggest worry spots: Adrian Beltre, Mike Cameron and David Ortiz (Globe)
“That lineup we’ve used so far this year, 7-8-9 have been right-handed and 5-6 have been left-handed. I don’t know that that sounds perfect. At the same time, there’s other things we’re trying to account for, also.” — Terry Francona, continuing to discuss the bottom half of his batting order (ProJo)
PITCHING PAINS: “Compared to my last outing, I felt I was able to get more on every pitch. I definitely think it was a step forward.” — Daisuke Matsuzaka, who threw 62 pitches and fanned six batters in a rehab start; the Sox said he needs at least three more such starts before he can think about joining Boston’s rotation (ProJo Notebook)
“He went through a normal offseason, didn’t have any issues, came into spring training, went through every outlined throwing session that we had and there were varying degrees of tightness or discomfort at different points.” — Pitching coach John Farrell on Junichi Tazawa, who met with Dr. James Andrews on Monday to discuss elbow issues he’s been struggling with (Globe Notebook)
“I can still throw so I don’t feel that terrible, but at the same time I’ve had an examination and there seems there is some injury to a ligament.” — Tazawa, who said surgery is “part of the discussion” with where he is, though nothing is in stone yet (WEEI.com)
“He’s like, ‘Dude, I just want you to go in there and get that fiery attitude back that you used to have. He wants me to get that attitude like you’re going out there and nobody’s going to touch you. … I’m almost there. Today was really big. Farrell said not to change anything, pretty much. I hope it just carries on to the next time I throw.” — Manny Delcarmen, who hit 93 mph pitching in a simulated game on Monday (Herald)
“The groin’s not fully 100 percent, but it’s getting better.” — Boof Bonser, who threw 56 pitches in a simulated game, but who looks like he’ll start the year on the disabled list (Herald Notebook)
LOWELL NEWS: “Ron Washington’s patience is growing thin. He had hoped one of the Rangers’ young players would have stepped up by now to fill the role of backup first baseman/third baseman on a team with championship aspirations. … The Rangers scouts, one team source said, keep coming back to Boston’s Mike Lowell.” – ESPN Dallas, while others have a Texas scout at Monday’s game, where Lowell went 2-for-3 and cleanly fielded his only defensive chance
“I don’t know what they think are quality at-bats. Maybe yes, maybe no. I honestly have no idea. I don’t know what they feel is adequate or not. … I’m going to get a bunch at-bats this week. I think then I’ll be able to make a better assessment. A lot of times it just clicks. You see the ball for a couple of good swings and you’re right where you want to be.” — Lowell, on where he feels he is; he had just 10 spring at-bats entering Monday’s game (WEEI.com)
OTHER STUFF: “The guy with the exclamation-point build is a giant question mark heading into the season. Buchholz is either another cog in general manager Theo Epstein’s player development machine or the ultimate talent tease. Either way it’s time to find out what Clay is made of. No more hiding behind the prospect label, no more caution, no more trips to Triple A, unless it’s a rehab start. He is a big-league pitcher for better or worse, whether he stays with the Olde Towne Team or ends up being trade bait worthy of Bass Pro Shops.” — Chris Gasper, Boston Globe
I’ll give Gasper this … he’s definitely got the “cram witty one-liners everywhere you can” part of big-time column writing down. He’s good for cramming something in there every couple of paragraphs, for better or worse.
“Obviously, the addition of defensive studs Adrian Beltre, Marco Scutaro and Mike Cameron will provide the bulk of the projected 87-run improvement in the defensive runs saved category, but Lundblad warns not to ignore the effect of moving Jacoby Ellsbury from center field to left.” – ESPN Boston discusses how Boston’s defensive improvements will translate in the win-loss columns
Admittedly I’m biased, but I felt like my analysis earlier this offseason of how things worked in Seattle did a pretty good job in this camp.
.” — Sox CEO Larry Lucchino, on the unveiling of Boston’s yearly improvements to Fenway Park (RedSox.com)
Among them? Spinach and mozzarella stromboli. No word on whether that vegetarian concession option will be termed “The New, New Green Monster.”
NUGGETS OF NOTE: It would seem there’s still a chance that Josh Reddick could break camp with the team, as Jeremy Hermida is two days away from playing due to some hamstring issue. … The weekend discussion in the ProJo about Tug Hulett and Kevin Frandsen battling for a roster spot was quickly resolved, with Frandsen being optioned to Triple-A on Monday. What that means for Hulett, we’ll see.
TUESDAY’S GAME: Casey Kelly returns from minor-league camp to lead Boston’s squad in Port Charlotte today against Tampa (1:05 p.m.), followed by Daniel Bard, Ramon S. Ramirez and bullpen contender Scott Atchison on the mound.Wilmington, NC, USA < change city >

I definitely understand why he did it, now that we've talked. Ultimately I think it was the honorable thing to do. He could have come down to the studio and given a real halfhearted performance. Then we would have been in real trouble. But I think it was cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have the passion for the band anymore and couldn't deliver. It was probably a difficult thing for him to do."
Still, with the new lineup and the acclaim for Francis Mark's acclaimed side project Biology, the group feels like they have moved in a dramatically different direction:
Part of me is hoping that some people can look at this as a new band and not draw too many comparisons between this record and the past three, because I feel like it's kind of a new beginning,.
ooh burn!
lol frats
post of the day.
silly, frats only drink lots of beer, smoke weed, and rape girls. coke is reserved for the IV leagues
Stereotyping is cool.
Also, coke is certainly not reserved just for IVY league schools.
seriously. i was never in a frat. hell, i never even graduated from high school...and i still manage to do plenty of coke. quit being so closeminded.
How was what I said close-minded?
i was agreeing with you!
i don't think you need to be a member ivy leauge to enjoy the splendors of doing lines of coke off a hooker's ass at 5:30 in the morning. the idea that i can't comb over and over the same spot looking for the last imaginary flake of blow because of my education is just another form of classism.
Haha, gotcha. Well said. I thought you were responding to my comment before.
I can tell by the misspelling of "quite" that you didn't graduate high school. That has nothing to do with stereotyping or being close minded. Most frat guys don't do coke, but they were smart enough to get into college. People who do coke are morons.
dust the sand off your taint and learn to take a joke, Sir Wordsworth McSpellcheck.
i lol'ed
4 people care
oh sirens, always giving bands too much credit.
only 2 people care about your post, so the band is still cooler than you
you
stupid
shit
pwnt
Excellent i'm up for another round of weak ass mtv emo.
MTV emo? Have ever listened to From Autumn To Ashes? You might want to before making silly-ass comments like this.
oh i'm sorry what is it, weak ass mtv metalcore.
What's MTV metalcore and MTV emo? Is that somehow different than just plain old metalcore and emo? Is that some new category I don't know about?
Nope Mtv metalcore is the same as metalcore, but what i'm trying to say is they hoar themselves out on tv constantly. As for MTV emo and "plain old emo" totally different things, rites of spring, real emo, My chemical Romace, not.
genuis...not!
I'm a firm believer that the only good piece of music this band has ever produced was that song Short Stories With Tragic Endings.
Correction:
That song, when listened in place of the whole album, is okay, because the rest of the album (and indeed, the entire catalogue from these douches) but if you were to listen to that song on its own, you would agree that it's shit.
Band is just a PTW wannabe.
says the lonely board poster
"?
true, line ups change all the time, but when it first happened, it was played out like some big soap opera. but everything is resolved now and the story is straight
Please leave your personal opinions out of this as I am only curious......is he still doing the drum duties as well? Or is somebody else taking that position so he can front?
new drummer
yeah, new drummer but he recorded all the drums on the new album right?
Yes.

He was nicknamed "Bud" because of his tendency to call others by that name, but it is unclear why he chose to go by the last name of Fowler. He grew up in Cooperstown, N.Y., learning the sport of baseball in its mythological birthplace a full 70 years before the establishment of the Hall of Fame.
Some have even made the case that Fowler belongs in his hometown's renowned baseball shrine, although he did not make the final ballot in this month's upcoming Negro and pre-Negro Leagues Hall of Fame vote. While Minor League statistics of the 19th century are spotty, all evidence points to the fact that Fowler was a very gifted ballplayer.
Researchers have found the box scores for 465 games in which Fowler appeared, wherein he compiled a .309 batting average and swiped bases at a prolific clip (as many as 46 in a season). And while his primary defensive position was second base, he played at every position on the diamond at one time or another, including 33 starts on the pitcher's mound. Yet, despite his baseball acumen, Fowler was never able to gain solid footing in the world of white professional baseball, doomed to a peripatetic existence that makes modern-day baseball nomads such as Todd Zeile and Mike Morgan seem like homebodies in comparison.
In a sprawling career that spanned from 1878 to 1904 (including stints in semi-pro leagues and barnstorming Negro teams), Fowler, by his own account, played on teams in 22 states and Canada. He competed in at least 13 professional leagues, stopping in exotic locales such as Pueblo, Colo., Keokuk, Iowa, and Guelph, Ontario, along the way. Some of Fowler's wanderlust can certainly be attributed to the uncertain state of professional baseball at the time, as new teams and leagues, many on unsound financial footing, were popping up all over as the sport attempted to establish a grip on the country's imagination. But, of course, the primary reason that Fowler had such a hard time gaining security in the world of baseball was his race. Historically, professional sports have rarely been kind to black athletes, and in the 19th century circumstances were particularly rough.
Fowler was the first of at least 30 black players to crack the white professional leagues between 1878 and 1899 (including one, Moses Walker, who appeared in the Major Leagues a full 63 years before Jackie Robinson). It was a time in our country's history when it was still possible to dream of a fully integrated America, before Jim Crow laws and the Plessy vs. Ferguson "separate but equal" doctrine effectively mandated segregation and legitimized discrimination in the eyes of society at large. Professional black players in the 19th century faced the scorn and derision of fans, opposing players and, often, their own teammates, but they were not barred from competing altogether.
It was in this context that Fowler made his professional debut on May 17, 1878. He had been pitching for an amateur team in Chelsea, Mass., when the nearby Lynn Live Oaks of the International Association lost their ace hurler to an illness. Fowler was brought in as a replacement, and he responded by pitching the Live Oaks to a 3-0 victory over the Tecumsehs of London, Ontario. He subsequently appeared in two more games with the Live Oaks and lost both of them. Nonetheless, with this modest beginning, Fowler had officially broken the color line in organized baseball.
In 1879 Fowler appeared with Malden of the Eastern Massachusetts League, but there is no documentation of him playing anywhere the following year. Then in 1881 he materialized with the Maple Leafs of Guelph, Ontario. He didn't make it through the season, though, as several of his teammates protested his presence on the team and he was summarily dropped. This led the Guelph Herald to remark, "We regret that some members of the Maple Leafs are ill-natured enough to object to the colored pitcher Fowler ... He has forgotten more about baseball than the present team ever knew."
Fowler, in a display of the indomitable spirit that defined his career, simply packed up and moved on. He finished the season with a team called the Petrolia Imperials, about which little is known.
In 1884, Fowler surfaced with Stillwater (Minn.) of the Northwest League. The league was one of the country's most competitive, and represented a chance for Fowler to prove himself among some of the game's best players. The 1884 season was Stillwater's first, and the fledgling team had to compete with more established franchises in large cities such as Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Stillwater's board of directors was desperate for talented players, and situations like these enabled black players to make their way into leagues that would have otherwise turned a blind eye.
Stillwater would have given the 1988 Orioles a run for their money. The ball club dropped its first 16 games before Fowler, who had been logging time as a catcher, infielder, and outfielder, came through with a complete game victory in his first pitching appearance of the year. As a reward for earning the first win in franchise history he was presented with $10 and a new suit of clothes (he had to give the $10 back the next month, however, when he made a two-run throwing error that led to a Stillwater defeat). Stillwater then won their next five games, with Fowler recording the victory in four of them. He continued to play other positions as well. As Sporting Life magazine noted, "The Stillwater club has a colored player named Fowler who pitches, catches, and plays left field in good shape."
But despite Fowler's contributions, Stillwater continued to struggle, both on the field and financially. The team was losing money at a rapid clip, and finally disbanded in August. All told, Fowler compiled a 7-8 record while batting .297.
The next year, Fowler spent time in five cities, starting in Keokuk, Iowa, and moving westward until he hit Denver. Sporting Life once again made note of Fowler, this time during his brief stint with Keokuk in the Western League, which collapsed on June 15. The magazine stated that "those in the know say that there is no better second baseman in the country." Yet he still had trouble finding a team that would take him. In Denver, he made his living not with baseball, but by giving running exhibitions, logging a 4:56 mile in the high altitude, at a time when the world record was still over four minutes.
Fowler was on top of his game in 1886, as he hit .309, led the league in triples, and solidified himself as a second baseman while playing for Topeka of the Northwestern League. The following season he signed on with the Binghamton Bingoes. Fowler relocated to Montpelier, Vt., where the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that he was a "favorite of the spectators and was greeted with applause every time he stepped to the plate."
Regardless, Fowler's troubles in Binghamton underscored just how difficult it was for black players to compete in white leagues. On July 14, less than two weeks after Fowler was forced to leave the Bingoes, International League directors agreed to no longer issue contracts to Negro players, a direct result of white player revolts throughout the league. This was the first time that any professional league drew an official color line. It was a harbinger of things to come.
As if to underscore the changing racial climate in baseball, another significant event took place on July 14. On that day, it was announced that the Chicago White Stockings, a precursor to the Cubs and one of the National League's most popular clubs, would play an off-day exhibition against the International League's Newark Giants on July 19. Scheduled to pitch for the Little Giants was George Stovey, a black player whose 34 victories in 1887 still stand as an International League record. However, Hall of Famer Cap Anson, the White Stockings' player-manager, demanded that no black players be allowed to take the field against his ballclub. The Little Giants, aware of the money they would lose if the game did not take place, caved in to Anson's demand. Neither Stovey nor his catcher, Moses Walker, appeared in the contest. Anson's aggressive racism set the tone for how professional baseball would deal with black players for the next 60 years. off-season. In only one of those years (1889) did he spend the entire season with a single team. In 1892, while playing in the Nebraska State League, he got into a scuffle at second base with a runner who collided with him on a close play. It is remarkable that this is the only recorded fight in Fowler's career, as he was subject to cheap shots on the playing field at every turn. In fact, Fowler is credited with the invention of shin guards, which he fashioned out of wood. The shin guards were his method of defending himself against particularly vicious take-out slides. An unidentified player told The Sporting News in 1889: "He [Fowler] knew that about every player who came down to second base on a steal had it in for him and would, if possible, throw the spikes into him. He was a good player, but left the base every time there was a close play in order to get away from the spikes."
Fowler spent 1893 and 1894 with an independent team in Findlay, Ohio. It was there that he and Grant "Home Run" Johnson, a black teammate known for his prodigious power stroke, decided they would put together a traveling team, the Findlay Colored Western Giants. When the duo was unable to find financial backing in Ohio, Fowler took their idea on the road and found a willing supporter in white businessman J. Wallace Page, president of the Page Woven Fence Company, a manufacturer of barbed wire. And so 1895 saw the debut of Fowler's brainchild: the Page Fence Giants.
The Page Fence Giants were athletes and showmen. Exclusively a traveling team, the Giants were equipped with their own private railroad car, which featured a sleeping area and a private chef. After arriving at their destination, team members would bicycle in uniform through the town to generate interest in the game. Most of the team's opponents were inferior local white clubs, so, in order to maintain interest in the often-lopsided contests, the Giants would often resort to clowning and comedy routines.
Not all of the Giants' opponents were inferior, however. On April 13 and 14, Page Fence played the Cincinnati Reds in a two-game exhibition set. The Reds won both contests, by scores of 11-7 and 16-2. Fowler played in both games and collected one hit in eight at-bats, the only time he ever competed against a Major League club. The Cincinnati Enquirer remarked that the 37-year-old Fowler was "as spry and fast as any man on the field."
The Page Fence Giants went 118-36-2 in 1895, turning a tidy profit in the process. Perhaps not surprisingly, Fowler -- a ramblin' man, if there ever was one -- did not last the entire season with the Giants. On July 15, he left the team he helped create to join the Adrian and Lansing clubs of the Michigan State League, where he hit .331 over 139 at-bats. This was to be Fowler's last gasp in white professional baseball. All told, 10 seasons of his career had been spent in official Minor Leagues, four more than any other black player. The Page Fence Giants lasted three more seasons, finally disbanding after their 1898 campaign.
Fowler returned to Findlay, Ohio's semi-pro club in 1896, and remained there until July 1899. That month, his teammates insisted he be removed from the squad. As The Sporting News reported: "The white members of the Findlay ball club have drawn the color line and have demanded of Dr. Drake, their backer, that Bud Fowler, colored, be ousted from the team. They will quit if their demand is not heeded."
In fact, by 1899 the color line had been drawn throughout all of professional baseball. Outfielder Bill Galloway appeared in 20 games for Woodstock of the Canadian League that year, becoming the last black player in white baseball until Jackie Robinson's debut with the Montreal Royals in 1946. Fowler continued to make his living within the sport until 1904, playing with semi-pro teams in Pennsylvania before finishing up his career as a player-manager for traveling Negro teams such as the All-American Black Tourists.
Not much is known on Fowler's life after baseball. In 1909 an article in The New York Age mentioned that he was ill, and that a benefit game was being arranged for him. Apparently, though, the game was never played.
Fowler died on February 26, 1913, at his sister's home in Frankfort, N.Y., succumbing to pernicious anemia -- a rare disorder in which the body produces an inadequate amount of red blood cells. He was 54 years old.
Upon his death, Fowler was buried in an unmarked grave in the Frankfort cemetery. In 1987 his final resting place received an upgrade, when the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) unveiled an engraved headstone at a ceremony attended by 200 people. This small act of kindness was a step in the right direction, as Fowler deserves wide recognition as a true baseball pioneer. A gamer in the truest sense of the word, Fowler's career was one of the most improbable in baseball history, characterized by an absolute refusal to give up or settle down. Perhaps one day, as more and more people become aware of his accomplishments within the sport, Fowler will achieve immortality in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Cooperstown's native son will have finally returned..
Minor hockey leagues have precious few stats, so when analysts feel the need to quantify the play of a defensive defenceman, they look at his penalty minutes. Only big, tough, defenders get penalties, anyway, and I guess it's good to be big and tough? It's fun information for poolies to play with as well.
But minor leagues count only penalties taken and not the player that draws the penalty. Take last night's game, where Ryan Kesler, Andrew Alberts and Bo Horvat are all charged with minor penalties but Matthew Nieto, Tommy Wingels and Jason Demers don't get any sort of credit for drawing the penalties beyond the boxscore. The NHL doesn't officially record the data, but Behind the Net does. If you take a look at a list of league leaders in drawn penalties over the last three or four years you'll find some very familiar names: players like Dustin Brown and Jeff Skinner and Darren Helm and Ryan Callahan. Eric T. at Broad Street Hockey has mentioned penalty differential as a "hidden talent".
For our purposes, it would be fun to see how the Canucks stack up in this department. By using the data at Behind the Net for ice-times and penalties drawn and taken, I looked at qualified players and assigned a "replacement value" for penalty differential based on a player that is 70% as good at drawing penalties as the average player, and takes 130% more. I've seen "70% of average" thrown around on baseball forums as a quick means of calculating replacement-level, and the reason I'm not using the average is because I want to give an average player some value.
The table here is the player, position, penalties taken per 60, drawn per 60, overall differential per 60, and rate versus the replacement. A replacement forward gets a differential of -0.36 per 60 minutes and a defenceman is -0.61:
What should immediately stick out here is that David Booth is not just the best on the Canucks, but he's in the top 40 in the NHL over the last three seasons, his contributions to the cause in Florida during the 2010-2011 season were probably worth about a point in the standings. It takes about seven or eight drawn penalties to have enough accrued that any powerplay could score a goal. Over three seasons, he's drawn 45 calls and taken just 22 penalties. The overall difference, 23, divided by 8 is worth very close to three. According to hockey's 3-1-1 rule (3 goals is worth a point in the standings and is worth one million dollars) on drawn penalties alone, Booth is worth close to $1-million.
If he stays healthy, of course.
The full list of Canucks is up there as well. Brad Richardson should do some spot duty while Mason Raymond, who would have been third on the list at 0.86 above replacement, is off the team. For all the abuse Keith Ballard took when kicking around Vancouver, he drew over one penalty per 60 minutes of play—1.03, while taking 0.89—meaning his differential is quite high when compared to a replacement and he'd have been the second highest defenceman, well-above Dan Hamhuis.
A difference of 0.4 on this list should be worth about a powerplay goal, assuming a player plays 72 games and 15 minutes a night (since these are per 60 rates, ice-time matters as well).
What may be concerning is that Henrik and Daniel Sedin score pretty poorly by this. They're elite possession players and play-drivers, but don't draw a lot of penalties. Alex Burrows, who takes a bundle of penalties and is perceived as having a target on his back, scores quite well considering he, and Ryan Kesler, draw more than they take.
Furthermore, if you look at the Canucks bottom pairing, I imagine that Andrew Alberts' ability to take dumb penalties washes out most of Chris Tanev's value, which is that he can play long stretches of games without taking a minor penalty. He doesn't draw an awful lot, but he still comes out well ahead.
Here are some of the recently deposed Canucks. Raymond, Ballard, and Cody Hodgson (!!) do well by this metric. Manny Malhotra does somewhat, but you can take Max Lapierre. He was a pretty terrible diver compared to Kesler and Burrows:

"The million dollar (or more) question is: how can the Canucks improve by this metric over-all?"
Move the franchise to Boston...
September 25 2013, 04:26PM
The Sedins don't draw penalties, or the refs don't call penalties on the Sedins?
(Kidding)
((Except in the playoffs))
September 25 2013, 05:38PM
@Peachy
You forgot about trading for Milan Lucic.
But seriously, it might be interesting to count the potential "missed calls" during a season, because even though I feel like the Sedins are subjects to a ton of grabing, hooking, and holding that goes uncalled on a regular basis, I have no data to support my hypothesis. And I'm definitely not going to go out there and do actual work to prove/disprove it.
September 25 2013, 06:58PM
I like this idea.
Although once Vancouver acquires Keith, he would almost instantly be tainted and subject to the same laws as all other Canucks...
September 25 2013, 07:00PM
@Lemming
Who is going to count these potential "missed calls"?
If it's going to be done by Canuck fans, I suspect I know what the data will tell you...

September 25 2013, 03:36PM
That picture threw me off...but nice article! Interesting...
September 25 2013, 03:47PM
But seriously, I read the article.
The Sedins aren't too surprising. One thing the top penalty-drawing players generaly have in common in speed. The Sedins don't have that.
The million dollar (or more) question is: how can the Canucks improve by this metric over-all? Changes certainly won't come from the same personnel. It'll have to be systems play.
September 25 2013, 04:27PM
Stupid ambiguous language. I mean the refs don't call penalties when the Sedins are subject to penalizable play.
September 25 2013, 05:18PM
Man, if we were to do that AND somehow trade for Duncan Keith, we'd be immune to penalties AND suspensions!
(I'm half serious. Keith's suspension history is a travesty of justice.)
September 25 2013, 06:02PM
Since referee decisions are subjective and not objective, it's pretty tough to do that.
September 26 2013, 05:16AM
I did do a little research on last year's officiating, and the numbers show that the Canucks drew an average of 3.44 PPs per game, and were shorthanded 3.52 times per game.
I then compared these averages to those of the teams the Canucks played in the regular season to get the average PP differential, which I compared to the actual results.
Everything worked out pretty much as expected, with no drop off in differential toward the end of the season. Taking San Jose as an example, the season averages would have predicted a differential of 0.27 PP/game in San Jose's favor, and the actual results were 0.39 PP/game in San Jose's favor.
Then the Playoffs happened, and the numbers went screwy. Vancouver went from a 3.44 PP/game average (3.3 in the last 10 games of the season) to a 2.5 PP/game average, while San Jose went from 3.52 PP/game to 6.0.
Something definitely changed in the post-season last season, and the team has to make sure it doesn't happen again this season.
September 27 2013, 03:16AM
Man I love Canucks Army. These type of posts are what make this site different that crap you read on team websites or in the paper.
I've always wondered why the Sedins don't draw as many penalties as say a Booth or Raymond. One perspective would say footspeed is the difference. Personally, I think it's zebra perspective. For whatever un-humanitarian reason, the most zebras think the Sedins are divers. They just simply don't get the calls.
Yes I'm a Canucks fan, but I watch as much of other teams as I do the Canucks. And I've never seen 2 players take more physical abuse than the twins - shift in and shift out. They take the abuse, a lot of it cheap and/or illegal. But it rarely gets penalized. Some of the abuse is so clearly visbile, clearly against the rules of the NHL - yet no zebra blows a whistle. It's a strange situation. I can't figure it out.2014 has been creeping along at a slow and steady pace with so much happening I can barely keep up. I’ve slowly been working on the draft for the book so we can get it out, which has delayed new content for the blog, oh no!
But in the meantime I have been doing some writing in other places.
Most recently I’ve been invited to become a blogger with a great parenting site that I discovered that is filled with blogs by Two dad families as well, there are some truly beautiful stories there, so please head on over to check them out.
Recently I also submitted a piece with the Star Observer, as it was a first time piece for the Star it recaps some of our story that we’ve already covered so far, but also contains some little extras, I’ve included it below.
Don’t forget to keep your eyes peeled for the release of our book, which will be able to be purchased online around the world!
IT’S funny how life can change.
Three years ago at 25, life was racing along at a pace I could barely keep up with. I was working 70-hour weeks and powering through a seemingly unstoppable social life. It was busy, it was hectic, it was great — but there was always that lingering knowledge something more was about to come.
As I write this, it’s a Friday afternoon at around 3.30pm. After a day of working through a pile of work strewn around my office at home, I hear the car door close and the slow and steady footsteps of my husband ascending the stairs, followed very closely by a very quick and excited set of footsteps behind him.
The front door creaks open. “We’re home” he calls out.
The excited footsteps continue through the house, and the cheeky smile of my 12-year-old son emerges around the doorway of my office: “Dad, I’ve got a surprise for you!”
He drops his school bag on the floor and starts rummaging through it. “Don’t look!” he says.
He searches some more and comes up with his treasured possession: a wooden shield, with the crest in the centre comprising of a small copper press image of a pokeball. He hands it to me, glowing with pride.
“I made it for you! Do you like it?” he asks.
There’s no questioning it. I love it.
He then trotts about the house to set himself up for his afternoon routine, preparing to get to work on his tutoring before we have Friday night take out and a movie night at home. It’s part of his routine. A routine that gives him stability, love and support — and gives us a sense of family.
How this all came to be is not a story you would usually expect. Most stories about gay families usually revolve around IVF treatments, surrogates, overseas trips and adoptions. Foster care is not an option many people consider when they think of same-sex parent families. The system is littered with horror stories, inaccuracies and assumptions. However, for us it has lead to a life of love and hope that we could never have expected.
In Queensland, our laws are slightly different to other states and for the most part couples I’ve spoken to have always told me that because they know it’s illegal for same-sex couples to adopt here, they had assumed fostering held the same restrictions.
While legally there are no restrictions, the differences in processes and intentions are what separate fostering from anything else. You don’t come into fostering with the intention of settling down and creating your own family so to speak, but it’s a system you enter because you’re prepared to do something for someone else. It’s a system that can be arduous and bogged down in paperwork and departmental mechanics, but it’s an experience you will never regret.
Our situation is rather unique. We didn’t know that we would end up with a child who would be with us for the rest of his childhood.
About 30 per cent of children in foster care never return home, with the other 70 per cent part of a reunification process.
Our son’s history is long and unpleasant, but his resilience and tenacity is astounding and his mind is sharp, remembering and questioning everything as only a child can and testing the boundaries around him to the best of his ability.
He took every opportunity to test these limits when he first moved in. Mornings turned into dramatic scenes like something from a movie. Asking him to brush his teeth meant that he would run away down the street, half undressed and screaming. Introducing consequences and boundaries within the house saw kicking and screaming, holes appearing in walls. There was also a day he decided to try and jump from his two-storey high bedroom window.
But we persevered.
When he came to us, he had lived in a residential care house, a small three-bedroom house where he lived alone, with no other children and only a handful of youth workers who would work shifts that started and finished at 2pm before the next would take over to care of him.
When we visited the house in the early days, it was one of the saddest places I’d ever visited.
Now, we have bought a house that we all call our own, complete with a sandpit and a large drooling canine. It’s not only our home, but the first home he has ever known.
He has his “dad” and “daddy” and for the first time in his life has come to know what it is to be loved. Through all the ups and the downs we’ve continued to love and support him and the terrible behaviour began to desist.
His life has changed and so has ours. The three of us have come together to create a family, in what was perhaps the least-expected manner. It’s been a long hard road, but worth every step.
So next time you consider your options for your future, have a think, is fostering something you could consider?
April 27, 2014 at 3:38 pm
Once again you brought a smile to my face. I love that at such a young age you have done so much and come so far.

I have been brought to this site after listening to the interview with Darren Hayes and I just want to say how much I have enjoyed peering into your world. Your approach to parenting is wonderful – your love and warmth an inspiration. I feel I have learned a little about how to be a better parent after listening to your story. Thank you :-)How to Save Money on Your Kitchen Remodel? Don’t Move the Sink
Who knew saving money on a kitchen remodel could be so simple? Just don’t move the sink. If you do, you will incur all kinds of costs and delays when the plumbing has to be rerouted. When your house is on a concrete slab that has to be cut into for the new plumbing, that’s even more costly.
Of course, there are times when moving the sink is absolutely necessary, and is in fact the reason for the remodel. Some sinks are in unfortunate locations, blocking an expansion of the kitchen, or facing into a dark corner instead of into a window.
But for the most part, leaving the sink location exactly where it is (albeit with a new sink) will save you a lot.
See before and after kitchen remodels where the sink stayed put:
• Kitchen renovation under $1,000 in 2 weekends
• A ‘new’ kitchen but with the same cabinetsNeed to order something not sold on our website?

The Pickerington Central junior was at his kitchen table with his father on Monday night, discussing whether it was time for him to commit to a college basketball program, when he received a text message from Ohio State coach Thad Matta asking if there was a good time to talk.
Matta and assistant Jeff Boals were in Illinois watching their latest commitment, 2014 forward Keita Bates-Diop, who had pledged to the Buckeyes on Sunday. When Matta called Tate about 11 p.m., Tate told him he could pencil in another prospect for the class.
“My dad had approached me on it (Monday) and asked me if I knew for sure what my decision was going to be,” Jae’Sean said yesterday. “With Keita committing and there being only a couple more scholarships left (for 2014), I just didn’t want my dream to slip by.”
Ohio State coaches are targeting two wings, a point guard and a center for the 2014 class, Tate said, “and when Keita committed, that took away one of the wing spots. I didn’t want the other one to slip away.”
Tate, a 6-foot-5, 190-pound wing, helped Pickerington Central win its first Division I championship last season. Two of his teammates were Caris LeVert, a freshman guard at Michigan this season, and Taco Charlton, headed there to play football next season. Tate’s choice was between Ohio State and Michigan.
“Of course, there’s always going to be that Michigan-Ohio State battle,” Tate said, “but they support me and they’re happy for me, and I’m happy for them.”
Tate’s father, Jermaine, was a two-year starter for Ohio State before he was among three players dismissed from the program in 1997 for what newly hired coach Jim O’Brien said was a “failure to live up to their obligations as student-athletes.”
Jermaine Tate finished his career at Cincinnati and played professionally overseas for 10 years. He has no hard feelings over how it ended for him at Ohio State.
“It’s all new people there all the way up to the top,” he said. “I’ve known Thad and (assistant coach) Chris (Jent) for a while, so I’m comfortable with my son going there.”
But Jermaine said he was shocked when he asked Jae’Sean a few months ago if he had a favorite and his son responded, “Ohio State.”
“It was just Michigan at first showing me a lot of love. I had writers from Michigan calling me every day,” Jae’Sean said. “But there was just something about Ohio State. Every time I went up there and every time I talked to coach Matta, I just got that feeling and I just knew.”
Tate played in some open gyms during the offseason and said Ohio State players “were friendly and accepted me. I just felt like part of the family.”
Tate’s coach at Pickerington Central is former Ohio State forward Jerry Francis. He said Tate will bring “great energy, an outstanding motor and a great passion for the game” to the Buckeyes.
“I can see him in the same role as a (Sam) Thompson or a (David) Lighty,” Francis said, “a utility guy who can guard multiple positions and score in multiple ways.”

@BBaptistHoopsSometimes really good tools don’t have to break the bank.
There are thousands of free engineering programs available. Possibly tens of thousands. But there are far fewer free programs in the CAD realm—if only because CAD software is incredibly difficult to create.
Here are three free CAD programs that offer something really special. They’re each from major software developers who sell commercial grade 3D MCAD software. These vendors, of course, hope that you’ll love the software they’re giving away, and will buy their commercial software—but they’re not playing the “let’s give away useless software” game. This software is good stuff. If you try it, you’re going to like it.
IronCAD COMPOSE
IronCAD COMPOSE is one of those programs that takes too much work to describe. Heres’s how it works: You open up a blank scene file in IronCAD COMPOSE, and then drag and drop models and assemblies from other CAD systems into that scene. You then move those models and assemblies as you like, until you get an arrangement you like. And, if you want, add animation.
IronCAD COMPOSE lets you build up assemblies by dragging and dropping individual parts from catalog files. These assemblies can be animated, rendered or exported to 3D PDF format.
That’s the simplistic explanation of how IronCAD COMPOSE works. The important question is this: What can you use it for?
Quite a variety of things, it turns out. You can use it to create assembly instructions and animations for your factory. Your sales people can use it to create customer presentations of configure-to-order products. You can lay out your office, or your assembly line, or most any other space you’d like, in full 3D. And other people in your organization can use the IronCAD viewer to explore those compositions. Or, if you prefer, you can save your compositions as animation files, rendered images, or 3D PDFs, and put them up on your website.
IronCAD COMPOSE is also free. You can download it from IronCAD’s website, and you don’t need to pay anything.
IronCAD COMPOSE is essentially a CAD program for creating assemblies of assemblies. It has all of the parts creation tools removed. It works with existing parts and assemblies, and lets you compose what are essentially digital mock-ups. Out of the box (so to speak), it can read a variety of faceted 3D formats, including STL, VRML, 3D Studio, AutoCAD 3D DXF, TrueSpace, and Wavefront (OBJ). No matter which CAD systems you’re using, you should be able to create one or more of these formats. If you prefer to work with live CAD files (as I do), for $195 IronCAD will sell you a translator (COMPOSE Trans) that’ll read native files from ACIS, PARASOLID, IGES, STEP, CATIA, Pro-E, Unigraphics, SolidWorks, and Inventor. That’s the only “catch” to IronCAD COMPOSE’s free price.
Once files are imported into IronCAD COMPOSE, you can add attachment points on them (to allow smart snapping between parts), and, if you like, save them in a catalog, for later reuse. COMPOSE includes several sample catalogs of parts, finishes and textures. The program is entirely drag-and-drop, push-pull. To lay out a conveyor, for example, you just open the conveyor catalog, and start dropping parts and sub-assemblies into the scene. When you drop one part onto another part, they automatically snap together in the proper orientation, based on their attachment points.
A good example of a company that uses IronCAD catalogs is Skyline Displays, a well known supplier of trade show exhibit furniture. Skyline has taken the CAD models of its products, and saved them as IronCAD catalogs. Using IronCAD COMPOSE and those catalogs, almost anyone could snap-together a custom Skyline trade show booth in no time flat.
Skyline has been using IronCAD, and creating catalogs with it, since about 2004. But, they haven’t actually been using IronCAD COMPOSE. First, because COMPOSE only came out in May of this year, and second, because IronCAD wouldn’t be nuts enough to put everything Skyline needed (for example, a quotation system and an interface to ERP) into a program that they were giving away for free.
IronCAD did, however, put enough capabilities into COMPOSE that it’s a useful and flexible tool for a lot of ancillary jobs that typical CAD systems aren’t really appropriate for.
As you might imagine, IronCAD is hoping that a lot of people will use COMPOSE for interesting projects, and will start liking its drag-and-drop method of operation. If that happens, a certain number of people are going to take a look at IronCAD, and realize that it’s a pretty interesting tool—even working along side other CAD systems.

Inventor Fusion is a “technology preview.” It’s Autodesk’s attempt to grab not just the attention of their existing users, but those of their competitors as well. Inventor Fusion is what is generally called a direct modeling CAD program. It doesn’t require the use of history-based parametric features. Rather, it lets you edit most any 3D CAD files—solid or surface—without the need to understand how they were built, or even what CAD system created it. Inventor Fusion supports reading an exceptionally wide array of 3D CAD formats, including those from most of the major players, including CATIA V5, NX, Pro/E, SolidWorks, Alias, Parasolid, ACIS, STEP, IGES, and even Rhino. About the only important 3D CAD formats it’s missing are JT and 3D PDF.
Autodesk Inventor Fusion supports direct editing of both solid and surface models. Someday it will cost money. For now, it’s free.
While Inventor Fusion is designed to work in conjunction with Autodesk Inventor (the non-fusion version), it stands on its own merits, in three particular areas.
First, Inventor Fusion has a well-refined interface. It doesn’t spread your attention all over the screen. Rather, it keeps the information you need near where you’re working. Its selection tools are nicely done, and its sketching and modeling tools are context aware. Overall, it’s a far nicer user interface than most CAD users would expect.
Second, Inventor Fusion has capable tools for modeling and editing both solid and surface models. While, in my experience working with Inventor Fusion, I found some files that I was unable to edit as I wished, my sense was it was more a matter of my lack of experience than Inventor Fusion’s limitation.
And, third, Inventor Fusion includes a couple of tools that make it really interesting for preparing models for CAE. It has a model simplification wizard, to remove small features, and has a wizard to create fluid volumes from assemblies, for CFD. There’s quite a bit of interest among CAE people in using direct modeling CAD systems for model preparation. Autodesk has bought several CAE companies over the last several years, so it makes sense that they would include these tools in Inventor Fusion.
When Autodesk gets around to charging for Inventor Fusion, they may include more with the software, or, more likely, bundle it with some of their other products. For now, as a standalone product (and one that’s free as well), it has a prominent place in my collection of tools.
Solid Edge 2D Drafting
Some day in the future, it will be common for engineers and designers to create 3D models, and annotate them with 3D GD&T. And never create drawings. But for now, we all love our drawings.
The good 3D MCAD systems all support the semi-automatic creation of drawing views from 3D models, as well as model-to-drawing associativity of dimensions. But there are times when you need to create just a drawing. Without an associated model.
Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to create a 3D model when a 2D drawing will do the job. Solid Edge drawing of a worm shaft, courtesy Thorsten Hartmann.
The most common 2D CAD software is AutoCAD. In its various incarnations, it’s the most popular CAD software in the world. It is certainly good general purpose CAD software, but it’s never been the best mechanical drafting software you could get. For really good 2D drafting software, you need to look for a CAD product with a heritage that can be traced back to the days of the Apollo space program, when Huntsville, Alabama was the epicenter of rocket research in the United States. That product is called Solid Edge. It was conceived and created in Huntsville, and to this day is still developed there.
As good as Solid Edge 2D drafting is, its price is even better. It’s completely free. Siemens PLM Software is keenly interested in selling 3D CAD software, not 2D CAD software. So they just give the 2D software away. They’re rather have you using their 2D software for free than paying their competitor to use their 2D software.
It probably wouldn’t matter If Solid Edge 2D drafting were junk. But it’s far from it. It does all the things you’d want in a really good 2D drafting program: It supports parametric drawing layout, complies with an alphabet soup of international drafting standards, including ISO, ANSI, BSI, DIN, JIS and UNI, and is compatible with the ubiquitous DWG format, used by AutoCAD and most other 2D CAD programs. But it has a few bonuses too.
One nice bonus is support for drag-and-drop diagramming for elecrical schematics and P&ID diagrams. Another is Goal Seek, a function that combines free-body diagrams with a 2D parametric sketch solver. Goal Seek is one of the best kept secrets in Solid Edge 2D Drafting. It’s a true design engineering tool, and its results can be used to drive parameters in your 3D CAD system.

Dear Jessica, with a wink and smile,
The question was for you and not the many pseudonyms used by EMCEB-sponsored commentators. What was respectfully asked and disrespectfully derided with content outside the nature of one HAL of a question to you was a request that you detail, "a thoughtful gathering place for sharing community(s)information and opinion." If it is a BLOG, then enough said.
As Dr. Phil often asks with a comedic intent, "How well is that working out for you so far?" If we are guided by commentary in this forum exchange, you should feel quite questionably protected by the US Constitution to freely answer my question with understanding that it is a common question among neighborhoods in your coverage area.
Ah, but if you don't like that question, maybe you can answer, 1) If tin whistles are made out of tin, what are fog horns made out of?, 2) Just exactly how many furlongs in a fortnight? and 3) If it takes a chicken and a half, a day and a half, to lay an egg and a half, how long will it take for a rooster sitting on a door knob to hatch a hardware store?

Sounds like some grumpy folks here. Agree with 'freedom of speech'.) Cmmn Ralph, Speaking in tongues (see above...lol) is a bit pretentious.
Change is difficult. The technology for communicating and the actual means of communicating is different now and in 10 years, this forum will be antiquated and useless.
My Grandfather feels the same way about the forums and blogs. Its normal for the older generation to have great difficulty in accepting these new communication and information sharing platforms. The reason...EVERYONE has a voice and opinion. Not just the newspaper writers you follow. My kids will say the same thing about me when they grow up.)

Dear Dolores,
Before we drift further into assumptions and comedic responses, let us agree that my continuing roles in advanced technology and its markets qualifies me to ask the questions that illustrate the lack of participation in the EXpress Forum. Thus, the question stands for Bill Johnson and Gina Allen to answer, "What is your definition of the Town Square Forum? At the present time it is not a thoughtful gathering place for sharing community(s)information and opinion due to the near absence of respectful and truthful postings."
It is certainly not fair to put Emily or Jessica in the way of such failure to create forum among a majority of readers. A handful of commentators using multiple pseudonyms is not a thoughtful community(s) gathering place.
Dolores, this needs your very capable consideration and Diablo Views in answer to a fair, rational and broadly considered question.

Dear Jessica,
Readers of EMC's Palo Alto and Menlo Park Town Square Forums answered the question posed to you. Effectively, town square forums are a reflection of those few that participate in each EMC publication's website. "At any moment, such forums can be thoughtful or absurd," notes Sharon, a Google market analyst, "because there is no editor mediation to maintain the quality of the content. Such a forum is what tabloids are made of!"
Many among our corridor's e-exchanges see that definition of the Express as an on-line tabloid as reality for the many years of the Town Square Forum in Danville.
The answer was simple! Jessica, please continue writing well and let your readers celebrate your best work.
Joyous Christmas wishes,

How a rebel psychologist challenged one of the 20th century’s biggest—and most dangerous—ideas.
free download
ePub • Kindle • audiobook and accord with the moral laws of civilization.
In the middle of the 20th century, an alternative school of thought appeared. It was popularized by Carl Rogers, an influential psychotherapist at the University of Chicago, and it reversed the presumption of original sin. Rogers argued that people are innately decent. Children, he believed, should be raised in an environment of “unconditional positive regard”. They should be liberated from the inhibitions and restraints that prevented them from attaining their full potential.
It was a characteristically American idea—perhaps even the American idea. Underneath it all, people are good, and to get the best out of themselves, they just need to be free.
Economic change gave Rogers’s theory traction. It was the 1950s, and a nation of workmen was turning into a nation of salesmen. To make good in life, interpersonal sunniness was becoming essential. Meanwhile, rising divorce rates and the surge of women into the workplace were triggering anxieties about the lives of children born into the baby boom. Parents wanted to counteract the stresses of modern family life, and boosting their children’s self-esteem seemed like the solution.
By the early 1960s, wild thinkers in California were pushing Rogers’s idea even further. The “human potential movement” argued that most people were using just 10 percent of their intellectual capacity. It leaned on the work of Abraham Maslow, who studied exceptional people such as Albert Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt and said there were five human needs, the most important of which was self-actualization—the realization of one’s maximum potential. Number two on the list was esteem.
At the close of the decade, the idea that self-esteem was the key to psychological riches finally exploded. The trigger was Nathaniel Branden, a handsome Canadian psychotherapist who had moved to Los Angeles as a disciple of the philosopher Ayn Rand. One of Rand’s big ideas was that moral good would arise when humans ruthlessly pursued their own self-interest. She and Branden began a tortuous love affair, and her theories had an intense impact on the young psychotherapist. In The Psychology of Self-Esteem, published in 1969, Branden argued that self-esteem “has profound effects on a man’s thinking processes, emotions, desires, values and goals. It is the single most significant key to his behavior.” It was an international bestseller, and it propelled the self-esteem movement out of the counterculture and into the mainstream.
The year that Branden published his book, a sixteen-year-old in Euclid, Ohio named Roy Baumeister was grappling with his own self-esteem problem: his Dad.
Roy’s father, Rudy, was a middle manager at Standard Oil. He’d emigrated from Germany a few years earlier, after serving with Hitler’s army on the eastern front, where he’d spent several months in a Russian POW camp. Rudy dressed plainly: colored button-down shirts, khaki trousers, and a military-style buzz cut. He was quick to anger, and strict on discipline with his two children.
“He was very right-wing,” says his daughter, Susan. “He was a control freak. It was always his way, always needing to be the leader and call all the shots. He had a very big ego. From an early age, he was raised to be looked up to. He was the firstborn, he was the son, he was the one. He always had to be the one.”
Hiding from all this in an upstairs room at the back of the house was Roy: fair-haired, blue-eyed, well-mannered. He was often frightened by his father, but he was smart as well. He would become a distinguished psychologist, and a broad, controversial thinker. In the process, Roy would challenge his father. He would also, perhaps unknowingly, adopt his father’s contrary nature, his instinct for an outsider position. That’s one explanation, at least, for how Roy helped bring the self-esteem movement crashing down.
IN THE YEARS AFTER BRANDEN’S BOOK, the importance of boosting self-esteem became increasingly entrenched in American life. One of the high points occurred in 1986, when Californian legislators created the State Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility. This was a project born perfectly into its time and place. Its purpose was to discover how self-esteem is “nurtured, harmed, rehabilitated” and to understand its relationship to social problems. After three years of review, the task force’s.”
The task force’s conclusion followed a review of the scientific literature that looked at real-world outcomes of high self-esteem. The evidence was limited, but the task force would not contemplate criticism. Leader John Vasconcellos, a California assemblyman, dismissed doubters as people who “only live in their heads,” insisting that “we all know in our gut that it’s true.”
He was right. Thousands and thousands of Americans just knew it in their guts..”)
Meanwhile, in the courts, judges offered self-esteem boosts to drug dealers, sex workers, and people who wrote bad checks. Court appearances were rewarded with key rings; those who completed periods of drug-free living were given doughnuts. “We try to build self-esteem,” explained one judge. “I’m talking in terms of treatment, love, and care.” The movement crossed political divides: Barbara Bush told interviewers that “self-esteem has everything to do with how well all human beings live and work,” while Bill Clinton praised the California task force’s report as a “remarkable document.” When Whitney Houston sang that “the greatest love” was loving yourself, nobody thought that was strange at all.
THE WINDOWS IN ROY’S CHILDHOOD HOME looked out over the branches of beautiful oaks, and the shelves on his light blue walls held the books that gave him an escape. He’d wander through the stories of King Arthur and spend hours poring over his prized encyclopedia, delighting his sister with trivia from presidential campaigns all the way back to George Washington.
At school he was first in his class, but he carried a painful feeling that he was missing out on all the fun. “My parents didn’t believe that kids should do sports,” he says. “They didn’t think we should go to dances or parties. It was pretty much just come home and do the chores and schoolwork.” The pressure to succeed was vast. “We had to be the best in everything,” says Susan. “The tallest, the blondest, the smartest, the most good-looking.” Because Roy found school easy, his parents had him skip the fifth grade. “It’s difficult for a boy to be a year younger than everyone else,” says Roy. “I grew up feeling like a small person.”
One of Roy’s early preoccupations was religion. He read the Bible from cover to cover, trying to find important answers about life and its secrets, but it left him wanting. And, as the years passed, the questions inside Roy began to press against the walls of his smart, colonial-style family house. “As a child, you believe what your parents tell you,” he says. “There was a very strict message about ‘this is what life is and what you have to believe in, and anyone who disagrees is an idiot or evil person’. They made their views seem compelling and plausible. But I started realizing some of the stuff they taught me wasn’t right.”
He went on to study mathematics at Princeton, where the cracks grew and merged. During a foreign study program at the University of Heidelberg, he took up philosophy and started reading Freud. “I wanted to understand what people are like, why we’re here and what we’re doing. It was a revelation: Freud was approaching the question of where our ideas of right and wrong come from.” Here, it seemed, was a superior method for revealing the secret rules of human operation. But when Roy asked his father if he could transfer to psychology, his father dismissed the idea. “You’ll be wasting your brain,” he said. It was only when he discovered that Standard Oil’s staff psychologists were paid more than he was that he permitted his son to switch tracks.
As Roy’s education continued—Princeton, Duke, Berkeley—he would get together with his sister and try to solve the riddle of their domineering and egocentric father. “Roy’s way to cope is to analyze,” says Susan. “We would try and talk through what he’d been learning—‘Well, maybe he’s doing this because he’s feeling this.’” Roy came to believe his father’s experience in the war, which he entered aged just 17, was formative. “It made him tough. Kind of bitter. Ruined his teenage years. For a lot of people, those years are a chance to develop your social skills. They didn’t develop very well.”
But the war hadn’t just changed people: It also changed the world. The USA started to become an alien place to men like Rudy, and as the power of the human potential movement grew, the older generation was being left on the outside.
When Nathaniel Branden’s blockbuster book brought the idea of beneficial high self-esteem to the public, Roy Baumeister was at university. “We didn’t hear much about Branden in academia; he was more out there in the world,” he says. “But he was really a leader of the self-esteem movement with that book. I was sympathetic to the idea, but I remember being disappointed. He would tell a lot of stories. It was fun to read. But I was looking for science.”
To fill in the gaps, Baumeister started studying the differences between people who think highly of themselves and their glum counterparts. His interest was partly pragmatic: Self-esteem was a hot topic, and a great subject for a young academic beginning his career. His undergraduate thesis explored how people respond to public challenges to their self-esteem. “I was looking at how high- and low-self-esteem people react differently to a situation,” he says. “How they relate to others, how they react to failure, how long they keep going when things are difficult versus giving up, whether they’d rather protect themselves with an excuse or go all out to chase success.”
Baumeister remembers reacting angrily to one sociologist who challenged the impact of positive regard. Just like everyone else, Roy Baumeister was a believer.
THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE IN 1984, when Roy was preparing to drive across America with a young psychologist named Dianne Tice. “She had long red hair and a quick wit,” he remembers. “She was a very thoughtful, disciplined person.” Roy was 31, six foot two, and fresh from the implosion of his first marriage. Dianne, too, was bruised by a recent breakup. “We’d known each other as somebody else’s partner for a couple of years,” says Roy. But by the time it came for them to climb into his Honda Accord for their drive out west, “our partners had just sort of disappeared.”
It was a 2,500 mile trip across a continent, 18 hours on the road at a time for five days straight. “You can’t go five days with someone in a small car without either hating them or falling in love,” says Dianne. In California, they lived across the San Francisco Bay from each other and would go away on weekend trips. “We went to Big Sur and I almost got swept into a waterfall,” says Dianne. “A rogue wave knocked me off my feet. There was a bad riptide that would’ve sucked me down very far. But Roy grabbed me. He saved me. I said right then, ‘I owe you my life.’”
Dianne and Roy became partners in love and science. “We did a lot of that early self-esteem work together,” she says, “looking at what made high-self-esteem and low-self-esteem people tick. At the time, he was totally in favor of high-self-esteem.”
But his assumption that high-self-esteem was an unparalleled good, she thinks, was never going to hold. The reasons go back to that smart, sad house near the banks of Lake Erie, during years of the Civil Rights movement, where Roy had weathered the powerful opinions of his out-of-time father.
“His parents always encouraged him very strongly to challenge the authority of popular culture,” she says. “‘If everybody’s doing it, it’s probably wrong’. So he’s always been one to challenge the status quo.” Even deeper than this, she believes, is a pent-up need to revolt against the assumptions. “He was not allowed to challenge his parents at all, so he built up a reservoir of wanting to do that. If you believe in Freud, it’s a Freudian fixation. He always wants to look at embedded views and see ‘could they possibly be wrong?’”
AS THE IDEA OF SELF-ESTEEM AS A SOCIAL VACCINE spread from California to other parts of America and elsewhere, Baumeister was pricked with doubts. “There wasn’t a specific moment,” he says, “there was just a growing sense of skepticism. I started noticing they were making awfully extravagant claims, like they could balance the state’s budget because people with high self-esteem earn more money and pay taxes.” He read the California state report and its argument, and wasn’t impressed. “The data was quite weak. I thought, ‘If that’s the best case, then it’s not that strong.’” wrong.”
In 1996 Baumeister, now teaching at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland,.
BAUMEISTER’S PAPER MADE an unhappy man of Nathaniel Branden. The movement’s founding father complained of the “specious reasoning” in Baumeister’s study, holding it up as an example of “what can happen when consciousness and reality are omitted from the investigation.” For Branden, the violent people Baumeister wrote about might have appeared confident, but underneath all that bluster they actually had low self-esteem. “One does not need to be a trained psychologist to know that some people with low self-esteem strive to compensate for their deficit by boasting, arrogance, and conceited behavior,” he wrote.
But Baumeister had more bad news for the self-esteem boosters. In 1999 the American Psychological Society (since renamed the Association for Psychological Science) asked Baumeister to lead a team that would review the literature in its entirety to see, finally, what effect self-esteem had on behaviors such as happiness, health, and interpersonal success.
“Our first computer search looking for ‘self-esteem’ in the abstract came up with 15,000 papers,” Baumeister recalls. “We had a stack of manuscripts waist-high. Several big boxes-full. We cut it down with strict criteria. We wanted actual data, not just clinical case studies and things like that. We sorted through them, critiqued them, and tried to pull the information together.”
A major problem with many of the papers was that they relied on self-reporting. “People with high self-esteem just say everything about them is great,” Baumeister says. “If you give them a questionnaire and ask them about their relationships, they’ll say, ‘Oh, yeah, my relationships are great!” The team would only accept papers that measured self-esteem objectively. After their cull of the woolly and anecdotal, just 200 or so papers remained..
Baumeister and his team did find a few benefits. “High self-esteem makes you feel good,” he says. “It also seems to support initiative.” But as the paper archly observed in its conclusion, “Hitler had very high self-esteem and plenty of initiative, too, but those were hardly guarantees of ethical behavior.” Baumeister’s study was published in May 2003. “It was,” he says, “a shock to a lot of people.”
Where does all this leave that confused and pulled-apart thing, the human self? What is the nature of that which lies beneath? Are we that saturnine creature of the Old World, of Freud and Baumeister’s father? A beast that needs to be controlled? Or is there still a chance that the New World can prevail, with its hopeful vision of a pure heart that thirsts only for freedom?
.”
We have a word for people who have become high on their own hollow self-esteem: narcissist.
The dangers of narcissism became apparent to Baumeister when he tested his theory that people with high self-esteem are largely responsible for violent acts. In one experiment, two people played a game in which the loser is punished with unpleasant barrages of noise. Each player sets the decibel level at which opponents get blasted. Would those with high self-esteem, as Baumeister predicted, turn the sound up to the most aggressive levels? Actually, no. In fact, the effects of self-esteem on aggression appeared to be vanishingly weak. But participants’ levels of narcissism had also been measured. “People had just started talking about narcissism, which seems to be the nasty kind of high self-esteem,” he says. “That had the strong effects. It was people who were high in narcissism who were more provoked and more aggressive than everybody else.”
The problem seemed to be that high self-esteem is a mixed category. Some who have it are presumably healthily and accurately confident in themselves. Their sociometers are functioning well. “If you went up to Einstein and told him he was stupid,” says Baumeister, “he’s not going to get mad.” Narcissism, though, is different: It’s the desire to feel you’re superior. “Narcissists believe they deserve to be treated better than other people,” he says. They also lack the moral values of people with genuine high self-esteem.?
Baumeister has certainly been noticing something like that amongst his students. “They’re very confident and self-assured, but because of that, they don’t work as hard as they might,” he says. “Other faculties are saying the same thing. Some just cannot take criticism, which is a big problem in academic life. We get criticized endlessly when we submit something. Believing you’re perfect is not a good preparation for that.”
The appalling possibility that the self-esteem movement had created a generation of narcissists was picked up by Jean Twenge, one of Baumeister’s protégés. In her 2006 book Generation Me, Twenge laid out astonishing data. For example, by the mid-1990s, the average college male had higher self-esteem than 86 percent of college men in 1968. The figure for women was 71 percent.. “We fixate on self-esteem and unthinkingly build narcissism,” Twenge wrote. “This will stay with us even if self-esteem programs end up in the dustbin of history.”
Both Baumeister and Twenge have their critics. Some academics take issue with the link between aggression and high self-esteem, arguing instead that factors like shame are more important. The evidence for a narcissism epidemic, too, has suffered an assault: researchers have questioned the methods used to measure narcissism and pointed to studies that don’t support such a rise. More recently, critics have proposed that every generation is “Generation Me,” and narcissism is just an eternal symptom of youth.
Yet Twenge insists she’s supported by the weight of the numbers, observing that there are 22 datasets that show generational increases—and only two that don’t. She also points out that her data compares youngster to youngster, not youngster to middle-aged grump..”.
“My kids have to do tasks at school where they talk about why they’re special,” says Campbell. “I mean, you know, they’re not! They’re kids! It’s a curse in a lot of ways. It’s such a crazy idea.”
THE ESCAPE THAT ROY BAUMEISTER BEGAN in his room in Ohio may have continued through the decades, but the influence of his father seems to still be in close pursuit. Like Rudy, a man out of time, Baumeister is frequently on the outside, railing at the errors of those on the in. As a man of science, he insists his views are influenced only by data; his determination to remain apart from ideology is so strong that he even refuses to vote. “I try not to have political views,” he says. “I try to get rid of all biases. I want to be open to all ideas. Caring just slows me down.”
His most brilliant and controversial work has at its center a refusal to engage with simplistic narratives of right and wrong. “I see the world far more in terms of trade-offs than a lot of other people,” he says. “Good actions are often tied to bad actions. People do things that are corrupt. They take money out of the system. But it’s usually towards supporting their families and relatives.” For example, he has addressed the “myth of pure evil,” observing that most people who commit terrible acts, even mass murder, do so in the sincere conviction that they’re on the side of the angels. “I wanted to understand how ordinary people got caught up in doing these things,” he says. “I came to realize that those who come to do evil don’t view it as evil. Evil is in the mind of the perceiver. Most of the Nazis thought they were doing noble work.”
The feted University of Chicago neuroscientist John Cacioppo is among those who disagree with some of Baumeister’s interpretations—but he recognizes his dedication to thinking the unthinkable. “Too many people just follow others and Roy doesn’t do that. I give him a lot of credit for that. I’m a more conservative, rigorous scientist than he is. He’ll say a lot of things I’d be hesitant to say until I had a lot more data. That’s not meant to be a negative statement about Roy. I don’t think that’s bad. It’s just different. I see a real role for people who have less rigor. It’s antithetical to me personally, but I want to give him kudos for what he’s done. He’s been fearless in a lot of things.”
Dianne Tice, his wife, says that this disregard for conventional thinking is not without incident: “Sometimes I have to keep him quiet because the things he wants to say are not always politically correct.”.”
“After he wrote that book, people didn’t believe that he used to be a feminist,” says Tice. “But he was, much more even than I was. And I think he’s right that society doesn’t place much value on men. What really opened my eyes is the work on battered men. We know that men and women hit each other in about equal amounts. It’s just men are more dangerous because they’re bigger.” She was, however, concerned about the book’s ramifications. “I was worried it might hurt him if he wanted to apply for other jobs or grants. He might be negatively evaluated as a result of people seeing him as sexist.” And did anything like that happen? “One never knows.”
Political correctness upsets Roy Baumeister. He rages against what he sees as a left-wing bias in social psychology that means that white prejudice against the black community is studied frequently, while inter-minority racism is comparatively ignored. Papers that show greed might be in any way good are rejected. “If you have a finding that says the conservative viewpoint did better, nobody wants to publish it,” he says.
Does the breath of Baumeister’s father still tickle the back of his neck? After all, here’s the dictator’s son railing against political correctness; here he is seeking to understand how ordinary people become evil; defenestrating modern feminism; agitating for the representation of right-wing views in academia. Baumeister’s opinions may well come shielded by data, but what are the wounds that guide his analysis?
Does Roy fear becoming Rudy? Is he attempting to correct for that possibility by trusting only the methods of science? Does he find, in his psychology journals, the proximity to humanity’s true nature that his parents, and the Letters of St. Paul, failed to provide?
When I ask him if he’s undergone a drift rightwards since his student days, there’s a long silence.
“Oh, I don’t know,” he says. “I wouldn’t say that. In America there’s a third movement, the libertarians, who are trying to reduce government involvement and promote freedom. To me, they make a lot of sense.”
Once again Baumeister is assuming the pose of heretic—but it’s impossible to avoid the observation that the song he sings is one the political right knows by heart. He’s frustrated by left’s compulsion to look outside individuals for the causes of their problem, be it poverty or addiction. “I sometimes feel like our job is to make excuses for people,” he says. I mention that the “sense” of libertarianism is an ideology that—like the self-esteem movement he rejected—was highly influenced by another thinker who believed in the power of the will: Rand. “I’ve never read her stuff,” he says with a shrug.
NOW 63, BAUMEISTER HAS TRAVELLED FAR from that room in Euclid. Today, as Francis Eppes Professor of Psychology at Florida State University, he’s received the Association for Psychological Science’s highest honor, the William James Award, and written or edited over 30 books on subjects as diverse as free will, masochism, and the meaning of life. His parents, meanwhile, are still alive and married. Susan says her father—who once scoffed at psychology—is proud of his son. “The fact that Roy got a Ph.D. and then became number one in his field, he loves that.”
But pride isn’t love. Susan remembers hearing about a theory that the most successful people in life are those who are still searching for their parents’ unconditional regard. “I don’t know that my father actually had the capacity to love,” she says. “That’s probably a lot of what’s behind Roy.”
Through his work, Baumeister has attempted not only to understand his father, but to escape him and the powerful influence of his ideas. Instead of political ideology, he adopts the methods and disciplines of science. But isn’t it true that all scientists, no matter what their intelligence or learning, believe their data is the best? Nobody is free from the unconscious pulls of instinct and bias. No matter how much we might resist it, we’re all political in the end. Perhaps Roy Baumeister’s greatest victory in his flight from Rudy is his refusal to view the world through the narrow prism of right and wrong. The truth, as he has learned, is that life is never so simple. There’s always a trade-off.
From certain upstairs windows in the house where Baumeister grew up, you could catch tantalizing glimpses of Lake Erie. His father loved sailing and swimming, but would never buy a property on the lakefront. It would be a poor investment, he argued. And what if a great storm blew in off the water? There was no control down there by the lake. It was safer where they were. When Baumeister moved back to Cleveland in 1991, he recalled his father’s warnings as he looked for a new place to live.
They made sense. But it was a trade-off. You could avoid the risks of being by the water, or you could experience the simple joy of waking up and seeing the lake spread out in front of you.
Roy and Dianne signed the purchase papers on Christmas Eve. Their new house was right on the shore.

One of those ten new CPAN contributors was Tim Vroom.

Sharpe will make his first on-air appearance on FOX Sports’ new rugby show, Rugby HQ, which replaces The Rugby Club at the 8.30pm timeslot on Thursday nights.
The Wallabies most-capped forward and two-time John Eales Medallist has swapped his boots for the microphone and will begin his post-rugby career with FOX Sports on the eve of Friday’s season-opening Super Rugby clash.
Sharpe joins the country’s most recognised commentary team, headed by the game’s number one callerGreg Clark and Wallabies greats Phil Kearns and Tim Horan, alongside Greg Martin, Rod Kafer, Brendan Cannon, Nick McArdle and Sean Maloney for the 2013 season.
Rugby HQ will premiere at 8.30pm AEDT this Thursday night (February 14) on FOX Sports 2HD & FOX Sports 2, where Sharpe will be joined by Greg Martin and host Nick McArdle to preview the Super Rugby season for each of the Aussie teams and look ahead to Friday night’s opener between the Rebels and Force.
“Rugby is a genuine love for me, so I hope to carry that into my job with FOX Sports and add a different perspective to what is already a really well established and excellent commentary team,” said Sharpe.
“I’ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of the current crop of players, so I’m going to try to bring some insight into what the individual players and teams are trying to achieve. I feel I can bring a unique perspective in that regard, having only retired from international rugby a couple of months ago,” he said.
Sharpe’s duties with FOX Sports will include regular appearances as a panellist on Rugby HQ, plus sideline commentary duties and behind-the-scenes reporting on match day throughout the Super Rugby and international seasons, including the British & Irish Lions Tour and The Rugby Championship.
FOX Sports will once again be the only place on Australian television to catch every game of the 2013 Super Rugby season Live, Uninterrupted and in High Definition.
The action kicks off with a pair of all-Aussie ‘derbies’ when the Melbourne Rebels host the Western Force on Friday night (7pm AEDT, FOX Sports 2HD & FOX Sports 2) and the Queensland Reds visit the Brumbies on Saturday night (7pm AEDT, FOX Sports 2HD & FOX Sports 2).
Nice to see them embrace diversity.Not Within Top #500

The Way Forward
Part I
that’s all.
But I was told today by a somewhat gloating self-denying lefty that I “had a new boss”. In my view my boss never changes and so I told him “Obama’s not my boss, he’s just the next President”. The Constitution is my boss and the President is the person who I hope will exercise good judgment in the use of my brothers and me. I hope Obama will surround himself with decent advisers… I’ll take Colin Powell for instance. But if we start seeing Alinksites pop up in the nominations I know that we’re in for a rough road.
I do agree that we need to prop up the current crop of Senators and Congressmen. But we need to look forward at what the next four years will likely bring and that has been hashed out here before. We need leadership.
Leadership akin to Newt Gingrich and Michael Steele and Bobby Jindal and yes, Sarah Palin. True conservative leaders who can articulate our message and lay it on on the line for the people to understand, even in bubble gum language. We need John Boehner and Roy Blunt. We need Jack Kingston.
Steel yourself gents and damn the torpedoes and hoist the black flag. We sail into a harsh sea that has no safe harbor until we create one. We’ll have to take it by force and make the inhabitants understand what happens unless they allow us refuge. The Republic needs saving… and only strong, principled, conservative leaders will accomplish that.
Any thing else? I’m too terrified to think about it.Curiosity and Rover Tracks at 'the Kimberley,' April 2014

Pittsburghers take their air quality seriously. That's why I've been worried about the people I met in Beijing in November and what they are breathing these days.
When I arrived in China with four other American journalists the Saturday after Thanksgiving, the afternoon air was thick and gray, with the acrid odor of something burning. We had heard about the notorious Beijing smog, a byproduct of the country's runaway economy, and we figured this was it. Not even close.
In January, when we were back home, the TV networks showed video of Beijing commuters donning face masks and parents keeping their children home from school. Chinese officials tried to limit further the number of cars coming into the city, beyond the rule that already bars 20 percent of vehicles from entering Beijing on any given work day.
To give you some perspective, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers air to be "hazardous," and tells people to stay indoors, when fine-particulate pollution hits 300 on its Air Quality Index. In mid-January, readings on the air monitor at the U.S. embassy in Beijing were an unthinkable 700 or higher. After a couple months of moderation, the readings jumped this week and returned to the "hazardous" zone. Late last night the pollution index cracked 400.
A friend of mine who travels frequently to China canceled a business trip in January because of Beijing's pollution. He said it was not due to any respiratory condition, but advice from his doctor that it's better to be safe than sorry when the air is this bad.
Maybe when Chinese leaders see that the toxic smog is costing them yuan, not just lives, they'll do something about it.

What took me to China was a journalism fellowship sponsored by the East-West Center and the Better Hong Kong Foundation. In the course of two weeks my colleagues and I visited modern Beijing, rural Yunnan and vibrant Hong Kong.
Although I wrote in the Jan. 27 Post-Gazette about how different life is in China, I was reminded over and over that the Chinese want pretty much the same things as Americans. Clean air. A good job. An educated child. A decent car.
While in Yunnan province one day, our mini-bus traveled a remote mountain road on the way to Donglianhua, a 600-year-old village inhabited by Chinese Muslims. Far from any town, we could see the terraced farm plots below, while wind towers dotted the horizon like white toothpicks. I was thinking about my family back home -- my wife and others who were caring for my ailing mother-in-law, who was in her final months of life.
Outside the bus window, a burst of color flashed by. I looked out the back, and it was a slow-moving vehicle we had just passed, with some people walking alongside. We rounded a turn and the scene was gone. It had been a flatbed truck hauling something long and narrow swathed in red, blue and yellow wrapping. In front and behind walked a dozen or so people toting streamers or banners of similar colors. A protest? A mini-parade?
What was that? I asked our interpreter.
"A funeral procession," she said. "The family is taking the body to be buried somewhere, probably on the mountainside. They will use feng shui to find the right place, maybe a spot near other family members."
Elsewhere in Yunnan, people are buried on the family farm. As we drove by cultivated fields, many tended by a solitary farmer with a hoe or rake, the rows of crops were punctuated by an arched stone structure, a crude tomb the size of a small hut. The interpreter said some Chinese want their remains to be near the soil they tilled, in the presence of those who will tend the farm after them.
•
Hong Kong can be dazzling in its high-rise density and Western-style prosperity, but the U.S. journalists were also struck by a weekly phenomenon involving the city's domestic workers, most of them women from the Philippines who cook, clean and take care of children and the elderly.
Sunday is their day off and most of them spend it outdoors with other domestic workers. They congregate in large numbers, on covered sidewalks and under building overhangs. Hundreds sit on sheets of cardboard, with cardboard dividers between groups of friends who talk, play cards or nap.
To visiting Americans, they look like a colony of people who are homeless or a mass of protesters at a sit-in. Yet none was belligerent or tawdry; no one was panhandling. These were people with jobs, many of whom, we were told, send money back home. We asked Hong Kong's leaders why the city doesn't provide a place for them to congregate.
Jasper Tsang, president of the legislative council, said the city has 200,000 domestic workers. "Government would not think of building any kind of community centers because they would have to accommodate so many people and they would be used only on Sunday," he said. "This has developed slowly over the years. To many of us, it doesn't seem to be a problem."
•
Our trip concluded with two days of meetings in Honolulu (I know -- rough duty) with seven Chinese journalists who had visited New York, Washington and Chicago while we were in China. It gave us a chance to compare notes on our respective countries. The Chinese didn't think much of American food. Too rich, too many sauces, too fattening, they said. They were amazed at how little smoking they encountered (whereas we found it pervasive in China) and they wanted to know how the United States had eradicated most of it. Too bad you can't do the same with obesity, one of them said.
We discussed at length our ability as journalists to question, scrutinize, even investigate the behavior of government officials, especially when corruption was involved. The Chinese, despite the fact that they face censors and Internet-jamming by the government, insisted that they had comparable press freedom. They admitted, though, that the two cultures treat national leaders differently. In the United States, it's nothing for the president to appear on a late-night comedy show and poke fun at himself. That is not the case in China.
One of the American journalists had purchased a souvenir in Hawaii, where President Barack Obama spent part of his childhood. It was a bobblehead doll showing the wide-grinned president in swim trunks and on a surf board. She passed the toy around the meeting room for the Chinese to see. They smiled at the Obama head bouncing up and down, then one of them said, "We could never do this in our country."opinion_commentary

92 New Glarus Two Women Lager
(New Glarus, Wisconsin). This is a collaborative beer from two companies led by women: New Glarus Brewing and Weyermann Malting. It’s crisp and malt driven, as you would expect a classic lager to be, but the Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops impart iconic noble-hop notes of grass, soft grapefruit essence and earthy florals. Smooth and balanced in the mouth, with a light green-tea astringency that adds texture to the biscuity malt core. A soft green-apple twang and mineral notes enliven the finish.

Article excerpt
When the website was a less transactional channel, banks had less site--and fewer functions--to manage. As they grew into workhorses of corporate operations, websites gained the complexity of moving parts, and took on such specialty roles as customer service channel, intranet gateway, and e-business venue.
Now, everyone that manages your site, or lands there, has certain expectations and wants snap results--without static. It's little wonder, then, that automation supplied by content management systems is coming to seem a must, almost a decade past their introduction.
At very least, the "CM" toolset has become a "must think about carefully" item in the quest to generate a website worthy of buzz.
Forrester recently surveyed 55 IT decision makers in large corporations, finding that a third of the group were dissatisfied with their current website deployments. Poor usability for content contributors was identified as the primary reason. A quick search online will turn up numerous blog comments on the "difficulty of content management," or "why content management projects tend to fail."
Why do they? "Many organizations are just getting started with content management systems--many users are struggling through their first projects," says Tony Byrne, founder and editor of CMS Watch, a newsletter that reports on content management trends and technologies.
Meanwhile, the field is beyond crowded, with about 2,000 vendors featuring products in this area, so it makes sense that the RFP process is fraught with angst. There are content managment systems that focus broadly on the enterprise, and others that are aimed only at the internet.
As it turns out, there are more details around what needs to be done to create a great website than you'd think. According to a white paper on the subject authored by Step Two Designs, Sydney, Australia, key requirements might include an integrated authoring environment, the ability to separate content from presentation (in order to publish in multiple formats), multi-user authoring, and content re-using.
A step beyond HTML
Prior to a few years ago, the technology used to be tricky to work with and required non-technical users to master HTML, notes Rolf Kraus, director of business development, Sitecore, San Rafael, Calif. Then a new wave of competitors entered the fray. "Our technology is built on the .NET platform and uses XML, a page description language, and XXLTs, which style the page," he explains.
"Our content is separate from the presentation layer, so non-technical people can work with the application the way they would work with a Word document," he explains. The only difference is that users have to fill out a few additional fields of information.
"Then the rendering engine places the document up on a page in accordance with style-sheet designations," Kraus says. While this aspect of web work has been simplified, Kraus doesn't try to kid anybody that working with content management is entirely easy. "What's challenging about these projects is getting everyone in agreement over what type of new system to use and getting system requirements hammered out preinstallation," Kraus explains.
The loan department, for example, would need different content than the wealth management division. The schedule of content update, the workflow, the number of users that need to interact with a given document, all of these will affect requirements.
Keeping it simple--yet useful
CM is becoming more of an issue as businesses grapple with IT simplification and control on the one hand and adding capability on the other, writes Forrester analyst Kyle McNabb, who reviewed vendors that include ECM/Documentum, FatWire, and Interwoven as well as Percussion Software, Stellent, Tridion, and Vignette.
In early April, when ABABJ contacted McNabb, he was attending Forrester's IT Forum, where content management systems were a topic of interest. …Images: Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08 [Image 7 of 28]

After 9ish months of waiting, Scott was granted Canadian citizenship.
The ceremony was okay, as ceremonies go. Quite organized and efficient. But the way the room was set up it was very difficult to get nice pictures. Scott was actually as far away as possible from where I was forced to sit. Ah well.
They all had to say their names, repeat the oath (I did as well) and sing the national anthem before receiving their citizenship certificates. Then a quick photo with the judge, and then done!
After work we had a party at our house. We had butter tarts, maple cookies, ketchup chips, Canadian chocolate bars, poutine, tourtiere, pâté chinois, Canada Dry, and a whole lot of Canadian Club and Molson Canadian. We had a maple leaf cutting out competition and a citizenship test leaderboard, and an epic Canadian music playlist. Scott and I enjoyed ourselves immensely, and I hope everyone else did as well.
Next step: passport! And then an effortless trip across the border, just because we can.
Last 5 CommentsI got a question in the comments of my previous post re this, so I’m going to weigh in real quick:
I’ve used CVS, Subversion (SVN) and Git and dabbled with a few commercial products.
- If it’s not already the most popular, it will be soon.
- It is used for the Linux Kernel and was designed by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. If it can handle Linux’s source and a distributed team that size, your project will do just fine.
- It’s incredibly fast, which is important if you have lots of source and larger files.
- It’s very robust. This was one of the original design considerations.
- It’s designed to work well with a distributed team.
- It’s extremely well supported and many complementary open source and proprietary products are available for git. Check out GitHub for example.
- It specifically fixes flaws in previous revision control systems like CVS so there are many learnings built in that make it better than older systems.
- If you plan to collaborate on an open source project, you’re probably going to be using Git anyway.
I still have some of my legacy projects on Subversion purely because my deployment system is built on subversion. But everything new I do is on Git, both open and closed source.
Yes I believe it does although I don’t use it myself. You might try this:
Mark, do you know if git works well on Windows?
Why not mercurial? It has the same feature, is easier to use, and is not hacked together like git is?The release date for the Beautiful Creatures movie has been set for February 15, 2012.

I think you mean 2013.. ahaha but still YAY! can't wait :o
Wooow I missed it then if that date is right.
I belive it is 2013 lol
LOL at first i thought "wow where have I been" but i bet they meant February !5, 2013
hahaha wrong date guys!
feburary 15th right?! lol So supedI don't think I can exactly recall what happened to get my Wii bricked(?) but now it is booting with a black screen, normally appearing as 'Unable to detect video mode' on my screen.
I have been doing stuff as of late in regards to Brawl texture modifications, PSA hacks and music hacks if it helps for knowledge gathering.
Anyway, to begin, I was running on a 4.2U version of a System Menu. I used the guide to install a cIOS on a v4.2 Wii in combination with cIOSCorp since I wanted to play NSMBWii on a burned DVD Disc through the disc channel.
This proves to be succesful, but I soon want to play brawl. It loads up but winds up freezing after being on the stage selection screen for a bit. I try to rectify the issue by backing up my NAND with a previously saved one, meaning that I have to reinstall the homebrew channel from 1.0.3. Surprisingly I had System Menu v3.3U on it.
I try installing cIOS again with the same method as the v4.2 system menu, but this time proving to be fatal on the last step, installing the cIOS (IOS249). It wasn't able to install cIOS249, but I installed it with a wad manager (v1.5) shortly after.
Again, booting up brawl, getting the same results.
This time I back up my NAND again. Everything seems to be going alright until I decide to boot my Wii again. Apparently I'm greeted with a black screen. Unusually, I talked with someone and they say that the Wii is trying to boot into a PAL video mode, and I can probably believe that since the green light was on. Unfortunately my Wii and my Wiimote are unable to sync with each other.
Any tips on what I can do? BootMii luckily still boots for me. I have no Preloader, and the Homebrew channel yields the same results as the system menu.
EDIT:
Disregard the above since doing another NAND backup seemed to solve the problem. Though of course my copy of Brawl seems to still freeze at the stage selection screen. I'll probably find a solution for this sooner or later.

A Georgian Registers in NOLA Ahmed Yusuf, after the hearing on the temple's "vicinity".
Cambodian officials had said they defined the temple area in accordance with a line indicated on the French Annex I map of 1:200,000 scale, but declined to say how large it is.
"If we want to know about the vicinity of the temple [Preah Vihear] it is clearly defined by the Annex I map," Cambodia's Foreign Minister Hor Namhong told reporters after the court hearing last week.
Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved a map proposed by the Foreign Ministry to demonstrate to the court the area around Preah Vihear. The map has not been made public, but military officers and officials at the ministry said that the area delineated corresponded with the 1962 Thai cabinet resolution on the issue.
Thailand and Cambodia have been at loggerheads over the location of the Hindu temple of Preah Vihear and its territory for decades. The ICJ ruled in 1962 that the temple was situated on territory under the sovereignty of Cambodia. Under the ruling, Thailand was obliged to withdraw its troops from the temple and the "vicinity".
However, the ruling provided no details on the territory that comprised the vicinity surrounding the temple. The Thai cabinet therefore decided that 0.28 square kilometres of territory made up the vicinity of the historic site. Thailand then informed the ICJ that it believed the 0.28 square kilometres was the area from which it should withdraw its troops.
Over the years, Thailand has further argued that the total area in dispute is no larger than 0.35 square kilometres, but Cambodia claims all areas below the boundary line in the Annex I map - including the disputed area of 4.6 square kms - belong to the temple.
Thailand's legal team, headed by Virachai Plasai, will submit the requested documents by next Friday to the ICJ, according to Foreign Ministry deputy permanent secretary Nuttavudh Photisaro.
He said the documents as well as Thailand's accompanying remarks would not be made public at this time, in order to avoid impacting the case.
In a related development, the Supreme Court's division for political office holders yesterday accepted a petition by the national anti-graft body against former foreign minister Noppadon Pattama over a joint communique in support of Cambodia's effort to list Preah Vihear Temple as a World Heritage site in 2008.
The National Anti-Corruption Commission accused Noppadon of misconduct in accordance with Article 175 of the Penal Code for his role in signing the joint communique.
The joint communique, as cited by the Constitutional Court years earlier, is deemed a treaty with a foreign country requiring parliamentary approval before it can be signed.
Noppadon said yesterday that he had not violated Article 190 of the Constitution, as the article does not make clear what kind of documents signed with a foreign country require parliamentary approval.I'm a big fan of New Relic. One of the services they provide is alerts when your traffic goes up unexpectedly above a predetermined level. Does anyone have a favorite, inexpensive "traffic alert" tool that can be used on a small site--a site that's not yet big enough for monthly payments of $150 for New Relic Silver (or even the $36 price tag for New Relic Silver on Heroku). Maybe a nice little does-just-one-thing-well tool that's $2-3/month or something. The closest I've found are Clicky and Chartbeat, both of which seem to have real-time alerts for just under $10 a month. That's not bad, but it's more than $2 or $3. A server-side tool in Ruby would be preferable to a client-side tool in JavaScript. Because a server-side tool would also track API traffic. I know Google Analytics sends email alerts but they're daily. I'm thinking more of a "you've been slashdotted" kind of thing where you can know in a few minutes. Thanks! And if no one knows about one maybe I'll write one myself. Brian

Shuffle your feet to Belly Up for a reggae-rich gig. The Steel Pulse brand has been touring its dub-club riddems round the world since 1975 behind bandleaders David Hinds (guitar/voice) and Selmo Brown (keyboards/voice). The Englishmen took home a couple Grammys (best band, best album) in 1986 for the tropical and topical Babylon the Bandit. Still holds water. San Diego’s Social Green will set the Solana Beach stage with more of a skanky vibe.... Boom Boom, Pat Travers will put out the lights at Anthology tonight. Long considered Canada’s sickest six-string slinger — Kirk Hammett says so — Travers is touring in support of his latest, Fidelis.... Tin Can Ale House fills an avant bill with Zurich grindcore-guy-turned-metal-experimentalist Dave Phillips (Fear of God), scary-as-hell Oaklanders Sixes (with members from famed local tribalists Crash Worship), local sonic-improv collective hING, and psychedelic spook-punk trio Spirit Photography.... For the less adventurous, L.A. alt-pop act the Victor Ship sails into Bar Pink. Looks as if they’ll be in port once a month at the North Park nightspot for the foreseeable future.... Beauty Bar books a pretty solid indie-rock triple bill with Transfer, Dead Feather Moon, and the Secret Seven. (The “secret” is that it’s four guys, not seven.)
Friday 27
Grammy’s Grammys? Lucinda Williams and Chrissie Hynde in the same place. I’ve had this dream. A lot. So, thousands in psychotherapy wasted, they’ll be here at Humphrey’s by the Bay. Mutliple Grammy-winner Williams behind her latest, Little Honey, and Hynde fronting her not-Pretenders project JP, Chrissie & the Fairground Boys with Welsh singer-songwriter JP Jones. Hynde and Jones on Tuesday dropped their debut, Fidelity, a rock-roll tell-all about their May-December thing. “He was learning how to stand when I was wearing my first wedding band.” In a heartbeat, dude.... Lots more to choose from if your paycheck don’t stretch that far. You got Brooklyn’s plink-rocking “happy hardcores” Oneida at Soda Bar with Jonas Reinhardt, the Lights, and Shapes of Future Frames...Super Diamond shining on the postrace stage up at Del Mar...jazz-keys innovator George Duke (Jean-Luc Ponty, Frank Zappa) will check into Anthology for two nights...indie folkies Mississippi Man, Ross Sea Party, and the Drowning Men wash up at Tin Can Ale House...and barroom troubadour Jake Smith, aka White Buffalo, roams into Casbah.

4th&B hosts a blast from the past, as ’80s radio staples Dramarama, the Motels, and Gene Loves Jezebel play the downtown stage. I can’t speak to the “new wave,” but I’ve always liked what Martha Davis brought to the table with the Motels. (This is not them, by the way, it’s Martha and a new them.) Los Angelino Ms. Davis is also apparently making children’s records these days. Grown-up Motels fans with kids might turn the little ones on to this year’s Red Frog Presents: 16 Songs for Parents and Children. Sounds pretty cool, actually.... House of Blues has De La Soul. The Long Island hip-hoppers are out to tout You’re Welcome. The 25-year-strong trio has also been keeping it real by getting with that hip-pop ATM Gorrilaz. No disrespect, we got the stellar 3 Feet High and Rising here somewhere.... Up the hill, Tin Can stacks folk rocks, with Portland’s Archeology on top. The quartet’s touring the Left Coast behind Memorial, a tasty collection of NorWest woodsy harmonics. Check it out: myspace.com/archeology. Fling from Long Beach and like-minded locals Midwinters and Longstay will set the stage.... Else: Mr. Rock Dude! and Lord Howler get heavy at Soda Bar...Ché Café stages Rob Crow’s new noise-rock assignment Mission:Valley, with Riververb and Innerds...and — this is gonna be colorful — the Superhero Slamfest at Soma promises a plethura of pop-punk bands, including A Dull Science, Plane Without a Pilot, the Inheritance, etcetrah, and — and — a bunch of all-agers hopped up on Monster, flying around in superhero gear. Someone please send me a pic.

Rogue Wave hits the Oceanside Pier for 94/9’s Independence Jam, which also features on the main stage Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, the Whigs, and San Dago’s Delta Spirit. The tweeners on the locals-only Casbah stage are Silent Comedy, White Apple Tree, Burning of Rome, and the Nervous Wreckords. Sounds like a day.... According to Mapquest, Oceanside to Chula Vista’s a 45-mile, 49-minute drive. You and your crew can do the math on the gas money because you’ll want to make sure you’ve enough left over for back-to-school concert tees, my little headbangers, as the big ticket at the Cricket this week features SoCal metal stalwarts Slayer and Megadeth. They both put out records last year, and Dave Mustaine won a Golden God award. Who knew.... L.A. pop-rock act Three Dog Night howls ’70s radio hits (“Mama Told Me Not to Come,” “Joy to the World”) at Humphrey’s by the Bay.
Monday 30
Local ecstatic-pop act Echo Revolution reverbs at Tin Can Ale House with indie-rock Seattleites Horde and the Harem and Portland’s And I Was Like, What? What?... And the Uptown regulars keep Uptown regular, as Lady Dottie dons her Diamonds at U-31...and the Styletones funk up Bar Pink.
Tuesday 31
MEN hit on Casbah. The NYC dance-pop production team formerly known as Le Tigre will make you move. Don’t believe me? Click this: myspace.com/men. With Jamuel Saxon and Mrs. Magician opening the show, this is fine prix fixe fare, mon frere.... Belly Up books a couple local up-and-comers in Gun Runner and Maren Parusel. Dramatic pop for boys and dramatic pop for girls, respectively.... Portland folk-pop sextet Brothers Young will be at Bar Pink behind their brand-spanking new t’do Good People. Sounds more ’n a little like Kingsbury Manx, which is super cool.... L.A. orchestral act Seven Saturdays will have a CD-release thing at Tin Can Ale House Tuesday night. Local lo-fi highbrows Tapedeck Mountain up first. Your bartender will be back in about 45 minutes.
Wednesday 1
Fat Possum folkie A.A. Bondy (Verbena) visits Casbah in support of crit hit When the Devil’s Loose. Easy listening: myspace.com/aabondy. New York solo roller JBM and our own Aaron K. Swanton open the show.... SanFran one-woman band Sea of Bees swarms Soda Bar. “Jules” Baenziger is the queen bee behind Songs for the Ravens, an electro-folk affair that chimes like a feamale-fronted Grandaddy. If that’s your tea, you’d do well to get your hands on her — it, sorry. She tours with a troupe to fill all the musical shoes. Chillwave locals Lesands and Portland indie-pop peeps Symmetry/Symmetry set the stage.... And there’s a doozie of an indie-pop double bill humpnight, as New Orleans trio Lovey Dovies alight at Tin Can Ale House with Brooklyn tourmates Little Gold — “a comfortable and incestuous cast of flower children, psychotics, abusers, and nurturers.” Amen.

Linda and Ross Eddy said the Department of Conservation's (DOC's) nearby Porarari River car park free camp, which opened in December, had made their position untenable.
They said the free camp took business away from the council camp and freedom campers with no self-contained facilities continually tried to freeload at the council camp. Petty theft had increased.
Mrs Eddy said the last straw was an email last week from council's chief executive Paul Wylie ordering her and her husband to stop conducting "patrols" of the DOC car park.
Both she and her husband said they had only monitored the free camp to protect council's business.
Mr Eddy said they could no longer cope with the free camp, the type of people it attracted, and the threat they posed to the council's business.
"It's been our job to protect the campground, the business and the rights of the paying guests. That's all we have done. We are not the villains.
"These free camp areas will always attract the parasites, and that's what they are. They are not prepared to pay anything."
He said that over the Christmas period he and his wife had photographed 57 freedom camping vehicles breaching DOC's rule that campers must be self-contained. DOC had issued about 10 infringement notices during that time.
The Eddys will leave after their current contract expires on May 23. They had previously agreed to continue on a three-month rolling contract while council decided the beach camp's future.
They have run camps for 35 years, including 13 years at Punakaiki.
Mr Wylie told The Westport News he had asked the Eddys to stop patrolling the free camp - over which they had no jurisdiction - after complaints from DOC.
The council appreciated the Eddys' diligent service as camp managers and wished them the best in their retirement.
The council was seeking new temporary managers to take over after they left., 09 Mar 2007 18:07:05 -0500 On 2007/03/03 11:55, Joerg Sonnenberger wrote: > Log Message: > Fix almost all shared library issues (with the exception of libgvc_builtin, > where I have no idea what it is supposed to be).

Charter schools have been a source of conflict among Ohio’s educators and policymakers. Some champion charter schools as alternatives to struggling urban districts around the state and as an option for parents seeking schools that best suit their children. Others say charter schools siphon funding from local public school districts and do not offer students a better education..MSF Begins Year-long Real World Motorcycle Safety Study of the 100 motorcycles is equipped with five cameras, a GPS, radar, machine vision lane tracker, accelerometer, gyroscopes, radar and sensors for the brake lever and pedal input. The equipment will be used to gather data in real environments, totaling about 500,000 miles of riding. The test motorcycles were prepared by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute.
The VTTI is recruiting 100 anonymous riders to take part in the study. Riders will represent two groups, the 21-34 age bracket and the 45-64 age bracket. Testers will ride different machines, representing different manufacturers as well as different motorcycle segments.
Testers will be riding in the Blacksburg, Va., where the VTTI is based, as well as near MSF headquarters in Irvine, Calif., and the Motorcycle Mechanics Institute in Orlando, Fla.

The Launching of Modern American Science, 1846–1876
Controlling Life: Jacques Loeb and the Engineering Ideal in Biology
Enlightenment should be possible anywhere, and sometimes is. Benjamin Franklin in colonial Philadelphia created theories of electricity that excited admiration and fruitful argument in the intellectual centers of Europe. But somehow in the century after Franklin a self-limiting provincialism stifled creative science in America. The exception that appears at the end of the century, Willard Gibbs, accentuates the prevailing dullness. In the late 1870s, when European scientists acclaimed Gibbs’s foundational work in physical chemistry, his colleagues at the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, who published the work, could not understand it. They were provincials in mentality, separated from the creative centers of scientific thought not by the Atlantic Ocean but by their unwillingness to learn the mathematical physics that Gibbs had mastered.
Nineteenth-century Americans were interested in science, of a sort. They filled lecture halls to hear a transplanted European savant disclose the great design in nature’s order, and numerous collectors packed the Smithsonian Institution with dried plants, stuffed animals, rocks, bones, Indian artifacts—to show the abundance designed by God for exploitation by energetic white men. The first centenary of American independence was celebrated in Philadelphia by a great exhibition of engines and implements, which the public supposed to be generated by science, never mind exactly how. And even at that level, where “the mystique of Yankee ingenuity” was commonly accepted, the provincial pattern appeared: the American press paid almost no attention to the exhibit of Bell’s newly invented telephone until a distinguished English visitor celebrated it back in his own country.
I am picking out one theme in Robert Bruce’s magisterial history of “the great scientific awakening,” as a contemporary called it—a more apt title, in my opinion, than The Launching of Modern American Science, 1846–1876. To be sure, Bruce’s abundant account of universities, museums, scientific associations, and other institutions founded or rebuilt in the mid-nineteenth century lends itself to the metaphor of shipyards and launchings, but all that busyness is hardly the most interesting theme of his book. It is the most fully developed, with so many little heaps of biographical detail concerning so many forgettable people that the reader must struggle to keep his mind alert for the intermittent passages that connect the institutions and people to Bruce’s more significant concern: the American awakening, from the 1840s through the 1870s, to the authentic spirit of modern science.
That entangles him in fascinating questions about the American mentality: What explains its protracted torpor? What caused its belated awakening—or reawakening if we consider Franklin representative of an original American enlightenment that somehow died out? Underlying those historical, narrowly American issues, is a large philosophical question: What right do we have to make invidious distinctions between creative science and the superficial imitations that prevailed for so long in America? When we locate Franklin and Gibbs at the luminous center of scientific discovery and place the intervening collectors of rocks and bones in provincial dullness, is our account.WEATHER-RELATED CANCELLATIONS AND POSTPONEMENTS

Talk about awesome hotel amenities, Stanford Court Hotel is stepping up their cool-factor by offering guests complimentary use of Google Glass during their stay. Part of the Google Glass Explorer package, they come with overnight accommodations in a deluxe room, breakfast in the hotel's Aurea cafe, and a nightly beverage in the Aurea Lounge.
If you aren’t sure how to use them, don’t worry, when you check-in a concierge will give you a tutorial and teach you how not to become what they cheekily call “a glasshole.” (Don’t be that guy.) Then you’re all set and off to go explore on your own.
During your stay, you will also be encouraged to take part in the social media contest the property will have going on. All you have to do is take three photos of San Francisco landmarks using Google Glass, and post them to Instagram, Facebook, and/or Twitter with the hashtag #stanfordcourtsf.
Your prize? A complimentary appetizer. Okay, not as cool as, well, your very own Google Glass, but hey you’ll be snapping shots anyway, might as well get some food out of it. Available through the end of the year, the package starts at .Boldly Going NOWHERE: USS Enterprise Wind Mobiles
Because the internet is already drying up for the weekend, here's a wooden USS Enterprise wind mobile made by Etsy seller RaysScraps. They're available for $75, but unfortunately don't include any wind chimes. I need chimes, dammit! I wanna hear that tingy-ding-ding when I'm out on the patio. I don't really have any money to spend on chimes though, and I guess beggars can't be choosers. Beggars can spit pretty far though, so remember that before you tell them to f*** off and get a job the next time they ask for change. Those loogies do NOT wash out of clothes (but can burn skin).
Hit the jump for two more shots in case you're up IN THE AIR about your purchase decision.
Thanks to Tam, who told me if it was all metal it wouldn't need chimes because it would BE one big chime. Jesus -- slow down Tam, you're blowing my mind. at odds with the Christian message, it also offers unique opportunities for proclaiming the saving truth of Christ to the whole human family. What is therefore needed in our time is an active and imaginative engagement of the media by the Church. Catholics, do not be afraid to throw open the doors of social communications to Christ, so that his Good News may be heard from the housetops of the world!
The lack of impact by Christians in the popular culture and specifically Hollywood comes back to fear. We mask our fear with disdain or elitism or faux-prudence, but in the end, we are afraid and it renders us mediocre as artists and ineffective as communicators. I will flesh out some of the notes from my talk here over the next few days (or weeks or months...) using the this outline:
A) Why are we Christians afraid of Hollywood?
B) What mistakes do we godly people make in our cultural forays because we are afraid of Hollywood?
C) What could we learn from Hollywood if we could stop being afraid of it?
D) How could we serve Hollywood – what could we bring to it? – if we could stop being afraid of it?
E) Act One as a test case of effective engagement
Stay tuned...This is not rocket science now, so just bare with me please. My mom taught me how to open a jar when I was just a little girl. My brother and I had to learn how to cook really young because my mom had a stroke that left her paralyzed from neck down for a period of time. If we wanted to eat, it was up to my brother and I to cook our meals. It was fun and is what sparked my interest in cooking and baking.
I would get so frustrated because I was not strong enough to open jar lids. I would try and try with all my might but the lid was not budging. Finally, my mother calmed me down from my frustrations and showed me how to open a jar.
Three easy steps
1. Grab a fork, spoon, butter knife etc.
2. Hit the lid with the metal utensil all the way around the jar lid.
3. Open the jar lid.
It is that simple. You may already know this trick, but I am always surprised when I show this trick to a friend and they did not know. They are so thankful.
Hopefully this tip will help some of you.
Going to try this trick for sure next time I can’t open a jar.
We are always have issues over at our house do you mind if I share on my blog please?
Definitely share
Must be a mountain thing. That’s how we do it, too. Works 100% of the time! Might want to mention that this only works on metal lids.

1. George W. Bush, on Jan. 20, 2005. But the word appeared once in his first inaugural address, on Jan. 20, 2001, when Bush harkened back to Thomas Jefferson's era: “The years and changes accumulate. But the themes of this day he wouldknow: our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.”
2. Franklin Pierce, on March 4, 1853. Pierce was still grieving the death of his 11-year-old son, crushed to death in a train accident less than two months earlier.
3. Jimmy Carter, on Jan. 20, 1977. While an early passage mentions God, the speech ends with an “affirmation of our nation's continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American dream.”
4. Theodore Roosevelt, on March 4, 1905. T.R., though, was not downbeat. He expressed an “assured confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and our children's children.”
5. John Adams, on March 4, 1797. His 727-word epic begins: “On this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence ... ” This would not be the last time a president would ignore his better instincts.
6. George Washington, on March 4, 1793. His second inaugural address is a snappy 135 words.
7. Ronald Reagan, on Jan. 21, 1985. At noon, thermometers read 7 degrees. The public inauguration was held in the Capitol Rotunda; the day before, a Sunday, Reagan privately took the oath of office at the White House.
8. Franklin D. Roosevelt. On Jan. 20, 1937, Washington was hit with 1.77 inches of rain. FDR rode to his ceremonies in an open car that, by journey's end, was awash in a half inch of water.
9. Gerald R. Ford, who took the oath of office on Aug. 9, 1974, after Richard M. Nixon's resignation.The temperature: 89.
10. b. 6. The death of Franklin Pierce's son left him in no mood to party. Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt cited fiscal restraints in canceling the galas.
11. c. Arkansas/New Hampshire ball. Clinton personally requested the singer's performance, as first daughter Chelsea Clinton was a fan.
12. a. $4. Refreshments included champagne, brandy punch, oysters and terrapin.
13: c. $500 for general admission, $1,000 for VIP treatment. Both include organic hors d'oeuvres and entertainment from Wyclef Jean, “tailored to minimize environmental impact.”
14. Laura Bush: d. Oscar de la Renta; Hillary Clinton: d. Oscar de la Renta; Nancy Reagan: c. James Galanos; Jacqueline Kennedy: e. from the First Lady's own concept, but made by Ethel Franken at Bergdorf Goodman; Mamie Eisenhower:a. Nettie Rosenstein; Rosalynn Carter: b. Mary Matise for Jimmae

Completely Disappointed
I started homeschooling my 5th grader after the Thanksgivng break. I've come to realize that he is so far behind!! It's like the schools just passed him along. His grades never even got bad until the 5th grade. His behavior was getting worse and his grades were dropping, so I did what I felt was right.. and thank goodness I did! His math is barely at a 3rd grade level! He's 12 years old.. already a lot older than other 5th graders due to his birthday being late in the year and he was held back in kindergarten because off not being at the proper maturity levels. I need help. I'm so worried about his future. How do I get him on the fastrack to being where a 12 year old should be? I've dropped his Math, Science, and Social Studies to a 4th grade level... he does very well in 5th grade Language Arts & Extentions. I'm sick with worry...
Here's some good news: middle school can be used as a time of "catching up".
Most children have already learned to read, write a paragraph, and do the four basic math functions by then. If yours hasn't, he has plenty of time before high school to catch up.
Don't be in a huge hurry. That will put too much pressure on both of you. If he's at a third grade level in math, let him do the third grade level, at a normal pace. Next year, he might be a sixth grader doing fourth grade math. The following year, as a seventh grader, he might be doing fifth grade math, and he'll complete sixth grade math (which is challenging for many adults) as an eighth grader. That will prepare him to take a basic math class as a freshman (for kids who find math challenging) and leave three high school years to fit in some algebra or geometry. He'll be fine.
This is from a homeschooling mom whose kids are math challenged: We took the slow-and-steady route and three of them have graduated from our homeschool and have done just fine in college algebra.
It's good that you have him home, so you can provide some one-on-one tutoring and allow him to proceed at his own rate, without feeling he's a failure. Of course, this all assumes that math is actually challenging for him. If he's being lazy, that's another matter.
Thanks OP for asking this question and thank you, Kelly for the great answer!! I know it has put some of my fears to rest!!
Yes Great answer Kelly!!
I agree try not to worry to much and force him to work a grade level he is not ready for. It is better to take him back a few grades and let him learn the work correctly.
If you want him to catch up faster you could school year round. We personally school year round and really like the freedom of taking breaks when we want to and this allows the kids to work more at thier own pace .
Please keep us updated about how he is doingRoadschooling Mom to DD & DS
This is what happened to my son/sons when we pulled them from 6th and 5th grades. We already knew my older son was behind in Math, its his worst subject but we didnt realize HOW behind he was. I was very sad and angry for him. T4L really made a difference with him. We pulled him from 6th grade in Oct. and by June he was finishing and understanding Math for his grade level! It still isnt his best subject and we are kinda at a road block with it right now BUT..... I feel that pulling him was the best thing we did!
HUGS and Happy Homeschooling to you!

Photo of Hannah Young
Just the other night, I was watching the movie ‘Abraham Lincoln, the Vampire Hunter’.
As soon the movie got over, my critical mind rejected the concept of ‘vampires’ by calling that a myth. “Well, it’s just a movie.” I said to myself.
I found no difference in my skepticism and Mary’s (Abraham Lincoln’s wife in the movie) that had rejected the concept of vampires as a myth when Lincoln had tried to tell her the truth.
Isn’t it funny that our minds jump to conclusions so fast; we either accept or reject things, presuming that we know everything about the world and its mysteries.
But, actually, do we really know everything or is it a technique of mind to not let us have ‘an open mind’?
Do we resist changing our beliefs and conceptions, and by doing so, don’t we resist growth?
Guess what, it seems that we’re afraid at some deeper level that things we reject as ‘myth’ might really exist…..they may be for real. I mean, who knows?

NBA Playoff Primer: April 30, 2013
And let it be known that on April 29, 2013, all three underdogs won their respective games.
It shouldn't that much of a shock, really. The Bulls and Nets are about as even as two teams can be, the Hawks had just come off a smackdown of Indiana in Game 3, and the Rockets were facing a Westbrook-less Thunder team that had beaten them by only three points in each of the past two games.
With Brooklyn and Houston surviving, though, it could be the Nuggets who are the next to be eliminated. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies and Clippers fight for a crucial Game 5 that will swing the series odds heavily one way or another. Who are the most likely teams to advance to the next round? As always, we're here to keep you up-to-date.
For specific game predictions, including betting lines and comparable games, check out our numberFire Premium Section. But for the stats we're watching for and the series odds moving forward, read on below.
Game 5: Golden State Warriors at Denver Nuggets
Most Likely Result: Golden State Warriors in 6
Stat to Know: Golden State Three-Point Percentage
I don't think they can miss. I don't mean that in a sarcastic sense; I mean that in a Bird-MJ-McDonald's-commerical sense. If they did a 2013 playoffs remake with Stephen Curry and Jarrett Jack, I'd totally buy it.
I explored yesterday just how bad the Denver guard defense has been, but it's worth mentioning too that Golden State has perfected a strategy that Houston and Milwaukee also wanted to try this offseason to pull upsets: the high variance strategy.
Shooting three-pointers is high-risk, high-reward. If you make your threes, then your opponent is likely going to have to do the same to keep up. Those long-range shots obviously hold a lower percentage of success, however, so the range of potential outcomes from three-point shots is much wider. But as three-point shooting has gotten better, the curve has been skewed so that shooting a higher percentage of threes is successful more than half of the time.
That's why you've seen Golden State shoot threes on 93 of their 330 total shots, a 28 percent proportion that sits as the fifth-highest in the playoffs behind Oklahoma City, New York, Miami, and Milwaukee. But because they have been able to drain those threes at an alarming rate, a .441 3P% that sits .049 better than any other team in the playoffs (Atlanta's No. 2), they have consistently been able to hit the high end of the variance.
That number is bound to come down to earthy eventually, but when coupled with the poor Denver perimeter defense, it may not come this round. Regression to the mean is why Denver still holds a 27 percent chance of winning this series, but Golden State's potential for high shooting numbers is how they're up 3-1 in the first place.
Game 5: Memphis Grizzlies at Los Angeles Clippers
Most Likely Result: Los Angeles Clippers in 5
Stat to Know: Offensive Rebounding Percentage
Just last week, I mentioned how DeAndre Jordan could be the savior of the series for the Clippers. Well, about that...
Jordan grabbed just 11.9 percent of available offensive boards in Game 3 and 7.5 percent of offensive boards in Game 4. As expected aside from Jordan, the Clippers stayed away from the offensive glass like a plague. The rest of the team collected just seven offensive rebounds total in two games, and three of those came from nine minutes of Ryan Hollins in Game 3.
Memphis, meanwhile, realized that actually trying to rebound the ball might be a good idea for their chances. Two straight games collecting at least 36 percent of available offensive rebounds helped get Memphis right back on track after collecting sub-21 percent in their first two games. Zach Randolph was the Big Collector, grabbing 10 combined offensive rebounds over the course of Games 3 and 4. Of course, that wasn't exactly out-of-the-ordinary for Randolph, considering he finished the regular season No. 4 in the NBA at a 13.8 ORB% clip.
So, which will be the true rebound disparity: the Clippers' dominance from Games 1 and 2 or Memphis' control of Games 3 and 4? I tend to say the latter - Memphis finished five spots higher in offensive rebounding percentage (No. 2 to No. 7) and six spots higher in defensive rebounding percentage (No. 9 to No. 15) during the regular season. But as evidenced through the first four games, the team that dominates the boards will likely also dominate the game. If the rebounding battle is close (ala Game 2), then the game will likely stay close as well.

One thing I find very helpful to keep track of my gardening from year to year is my Garden Notebook. It starts with the seeds.
Another biggie, is knowing where you planted everything. It's good to know so that you can rotate your crops effectively. I find that I can always draw up a beautiful plan, but rarely stick to it. The solution for me was to draw up a final plan.
Separately, I keep a tally of what got canned and preserved. This lets me know if I need to grow more or less of an item depending on our usage. For instance, we're not big green bean eaters. I have 20 more qts of frozen beans in the freezer. I'll only plant a few for fresh eating this summer. Also, last year was an amazing summer for tomatoes. I canned up so many that we'll be good for a while. Now, I won't cut back on those. They're temperamental and a big part of what we eat. What I will do, is experiment a bit on what I'll do with them. But that's a post for another day.
Do you keep a notebook? What do you keep track of?
This post is part of Simple Lives Thursday.

I don't keep a journal. I really should. I keep records but they are all in a spreadsheet. I would love to write things down more, but I have trouble enough keeping up with my blog writing.
We'll take your green beans, we love them. Especially pickled! You are organized. I don't keep any notes during the season, I should though.
This is my first year for a garden notebook. I keep it handy and so far so good. I started off with a garden plan too but I can't seem to stick to it. I think I'll do what you do and just draw up a final "this is where it ended up" plan.
What a great idea! I think I should do this. This will be our 3rd year for a garden. Last year our beans were a bust. Not sure what happened, but they got huge too fast. I just planted greens in the ground yesterday so that gives me a place to start. Thanks again!
I'd be lost without my notebook. It lets me remember all those little things from year to year.
I only wish I were as organized as you!
I make various attempts to keep track each year. My garden journal blog helps in a way, but I like the way yours is visually laid out. Looks "at a glance" easy to keep track of things. I had decided I need to do better this year, so this post is timely. Thanks!
I have kept garden records for a very long time. They originally were all in spiral bound notebooks and done with a pencil or pen (colored pencils for the garden plan drawings!). I then migrated to spreadsheets for certain items and the old manual process for everything else. Fast forward to today - I keep spreadsheets on the harvest tally and I do my garden drawing plan electronically, but everything (including those items) are recapped and noted at various places in my website. I have a calendar that I make notations on daily - planting events, garden tasks/projects, harvests and even what I did with the harvest! Its an integrated approach - much like my notebook of the past was - but online. I think keeping records is important too. It helps us to learn from experience - since we can review what happeneed in previous years.Abstract
Silicon thin film with a nanopore textured surface is systematically studied via simulation for photovoltaic application, where the optical characteristics are closely correlated with the nanopore structural parameters. It is found that the solar energy absorption could be optimized when the nanopore array structure dimensions are set as follows: periodicity of , depth of , and pore diameter versus periodicity ratio of 87.5%. The result provides an additional guideline for the nanostructure surface texturing-process design for photovoltaic applications.

When fans spend their hard-earned money to support their favorite teams, whether it be on buying tickets to watch them play or buying apparrel—they get angry when they don't see results—and rightfully so.
But where does the blame deserve to land in the case of the New York Rangers?
Does it fall at the feet of John Tortorella?
Is his coaching strategy simply not working and should he take the heat for the lackluster performances night-in and night-out?
Or is it not his fault—but rather the players fault—for not performing the way they should be. Are the players simply not giving the effort that they should be giving at a professional level?
Or are they not the right players for the job? Does the blame then shift to GM Glen Sather for assembling the wrong group of players to consistently win?
Is Sather to blame for handcuffing the Rangers with several contracts that weren't warranted?
Did signing the likes of Chris Drury, Wade Redden, and Michal Rozsival to absurd contracts—both in length and worth—hurt this team so badly that it cannot rebound?
Speaking of rebounds, is this the fault of Henrik Lundqvist? Was he too good? Was he simply so good these past few seasons that the rest of his team relied on him too much, and now that he has shown that he is human the team can't compensate?
Maybe it wasn't Sather's fault, after all, it's not just him making the decisions. So are the scouts to blame? Did they simply mis-evaluate the talents that the Rangers invested in?
Was passing on the likes Zach Parise and Ryan Getzlaf to draft Hugh Jessiman enough to sabotage a team for years to come?
How about Neil Smith, remember him?
Was the Cup in '94 worth the dismantling of youth which has held the Blueshirts ransom for the next 10 years?
How about we go straight to the top. Right up to James Dolan himself. Is his disinterest in the Rangers hurting this team so badly that he doesn't even realize what is going on? I mean, we still shell out the money and sell out the Garden every night, so I guess it's not putting too much of a bearing on him now, is it?
Or does this go much, much deeper. Are we to blame? Are we as New Yorkers to blame for these troubling times? Is our "we want it yesterday" attitude so bad that we simply can't live with these results?
While other cities like Pittsburgh and Washington knew that they weren't going to be competitive for a few years if they stuck to a plan, were we too demanding to ever let that happen? Why not us? Why couldn't the Rangers have drafted Alex Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby, Evegni Malkin, or Alex Semin?
Did we really think that Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, Theo Fleury, Brendan Shanahan, Jaromir Jagr, Luc Robitaille, Martin Straka, Jari Kurri, and Wayne Gretzky were going to bring us Cups for years to come?
We were promised rebuilding and were asked for patience. But then the aging stars continued to come.
We were promised a disciplined decisive team, but got nothing but boring 2-1 losses.
We were promised an up-tempo team that delivered full 60-minute efforts—something that hasn't been seen in years—but all we've received is third-period collapses.
So maybe we are to blame; maybe it was our fault all along.
It was our fault for being gullible.457 Deferred Compensation and Cash Match Plans
Employees participating in the Commonwealth of Virginia 457 Deferred Compensation and Cash Match Plans have the following options:
- They may keep their funds in the 457 Plan and continue to manage their investments. They cannot contribute to the plan unless they return to salaried or wage employment with an employer that offers the plan.
- If they have a Virginia Cash Match Plan account, they may request a rollover of their 457 Plan funds to their cash match account, an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or another qualified retirement or tax-deferred savings plan.
- They may request a payment of their 457 plan funds and any cash match funds by electing a lump sum, a periodic payment or a combination of these distribution methods. Funds paid directly to them are subject to federal and state income taxes. Cash match funds also may be subject to a 10 percent federal tax penalty if the participant withdraws them before age 59½. Payments from the 457 Plan are not subject to this tax penalty.
- They may roll over payments for unused sick leave or annual leave into the 457 Plan account. This is allowed only if employees, prior to their last date of employment, provide their employer with a properly completed Payroll Authorization - One-Time Deferral form. The form must be submitted to the employer no later than the month prior to the month in which the contribution will be sent to the plan.
As provided under the Internal Revenue Code, participants cannot contribute cash severance payments to the 457 Plan. For more information, go to Defined Contribution Plans..

A new chapter in green racing revved up this past weekend at the Rolex 24 at Daytona. The endurance race was the first race of the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship and was sanctioned by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA). In a signing ceremony at the Daytona International Speedway, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Michael Carr, and IMSA President, Scott Atherton, announced a five-year partnership that will build on the success of the previous five years of putting advanced vehicle technologies on the racetrack through the Green Racing initiative.
Developed and sponsored by the Energy Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, SAE International (one of the nation’s leading transportation engineering associations), and several automotive industry leaders, Green Racing aims to leverage the technology innovation of the racing community to develop and transfer cleaner, more efficient fuels and vehicle technologies to consumer vehicles.
All of the teams competing in the TUDOR Championship Grand Tour Le Mans class, which features commercially available vehicle technologies, have chosen to use E85 (fuel that is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Using this alternative fuel reduces the petroleum the vehicles consume by 62% and the greenhouse gas emissions they produce by 65%, compared to the previously-used oil-based fuels.
“If racing Corvettes and Ferraris are performing well on E85, then you better believe it’s good for consumers [with flexible-fuel vehicles] to use in their cars,” Atherton said at Rolex 24.
At the end of this year’s season, teams in the TUDOR Championship that go the farthest and the fastest with the smallest environmental footprint will win the Green Racing Challenge award. These teams will serve as a model for sustainable transportation and prove that energy efficient vehicle technologies are capable of high performance in extreme racing conditions.
Green Racing is one of many Energy Department efforts to make motorsports more sustainable. The Energy Department and NASCAR recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to find ways to further incorporate transformative clean energy technologies into NASCAR operations.

Well,.When it comes to going global with your business, retailers will find that there are several “moving parts” to the entire process as it relates to delivering international orders. This is why retailers may want to consider working with a service partner to make the global transition an easy one.
Martin Tully, chief operating officer for eShopworld, spoke during a session at Multichannel Merchant’s Growing Global conference about the challenges and the best global solutions for retailers.
Tully said retailer concerns with cross-border e-tailing included having a limited knowledge of resources, constrained resources, a domestic-focused agenda and the perceived difficulty and risk. Problems that can constrain global ecommerce include the possibility of fraudulent orders, limited marketing budget, logistical issues and resources.
So where do you begin?
Tully said retailers will want to start with a phased approach to an international strategy that includes an expansion roadmap:
- Allow international shoppers to buy from your domestic website. Ship overseas with little regard for customer experience.
- Improve the user experience – Have a tactical focus on tools to assist the international customer. Begin with early-stage marketing and merchandising to improve the customer experience.
- Target markets – Have an enterprise strategy and regional operations. Aspire to duplicate the domestic customer experience. Your site should be translated and flexible enough the offers and pricing should be localized. You should also have local inventory.
Tully said having a service partner provides the retailer with speed to market, helps manage the complexities, leverages scalable infrastructure and provides subject matter expertise.
Other aspects of a successful global ecommerce solution:
Proven solutions help you go to market quickly: The solution should be optimized for destination markets and be configurable to meet your specific requirements. You should also be able to deploy it quickly without a large operational expense.
Manage Complexity: Service partners can help retailers focus on their core business by managing complexities around international inventory and fulfillment, user experience localization, payment methods and currencies, fraud and currency risk, cross-border delivery, customer care, global returns and duties.
Scalable Infrastructure: Service partners can give retailers the ability to scale the solution as the business grows regarding IT capacity, new products, market expansion and seasonal peak periods.
Subject Matter Experts: Service partners provide local market knowledge and insight, risk management as it relates to fraud and regulatory requirements, logistics and fulfillment strategy, trade compliance and user experience localization.
But is it worth it?
Tully said the cross-border opportunity is massive for retailers, growing at double-digit rates across the globe
In Europe, he said, cross-border sales are expected to grow twice as fast as domestic sales.
“There is lots of opportunity for U.S. retailers,” said Tully.Yahoo Tweaks Its Homepage, Allows Content from All Over the Web 2Adam Pash and 17 othersEditDelete InviteInvite manuallyPromoteXDismissXUndismissBlock for lifehackerHide Popular web portal Yahoo has been testing a new look and feature set for a while now, and today they're pushing these changes out into the wild as a beta, opt-in feature. » 7/21/09 7:15am 7/21/09 7:15amI will be a TCU alumni in May of this year which means I am a Horned Frog for life. Growing up in Houston and then deciding to attend TCU in Fort Worth was a difficult transition in the sports world.

I have been contacting people for the last two years and not getting anywhere. I thought I was getting somewhere this summer, but not now. Any certain person or department that would be the best? I've tried through the editors at Retriever News and at least got responses, but haven't gotten many responses from the contacts listed on Entry Express. We have Curlies and under the breed summaries, we get lumped with Flat-Coats at field trials and "others" in hunt tests. We used Entry Express for our breed national field events in September....all curlies.....all listed as a bunch of fcrs in the breed tallies.
Anyone have any advice? (other than get a lab....I have already heard that once or twice or a zillion times as you can imagine

You might not be super sociable–you’ve got your own thing going, after all. If you’re a Chad-style Odd Duck, you might be into strange, loud, flamboyant gestures – maybe you dye your feathers or make crazy art, or have crummy table manners.
Anyone who’s met me can guess which kind of Odd Duck I am. But just like Chad, I’m friends with a bunch of Theodoras, and we have more in common than you might think!
Odd Duck was a joy to work on, and it’s a joy to read. It’s a simple story about accepting differences — your own, and others’ — but it’s also kind of a profound look at friendship. The best books — whether they’re for children or for adults — tell us something about ourselves, and help us understand something about others.
Odd Duck stands with the best, without a doubt. And it has the advantage over many other similarly profound works in that it’s funny, and light-hearted, and as sweet as mango salsa.

To be a good busybody, you need people skills and the best of intentions. (Bad busybodies are something else again.) The middle-aged British heroine of A Surrey State of Affairs, Constance Harding, is perfect for the role, strewing both intended and unintended results of her meddling all around her circle of family, friends and virtual universe with innocent ignorance and a blithe disregard for reality. Not to mention a bewildered disbelief at the occasional unexpected results of her activity.
Trying to live up to the outmoded values of her upper-middle-class upbringing, filtered through the first-person narration of Constance’s blog. It’s whimsical and droll, a good enough premise to provide the setting for the whole novel, but Ceri Radford (called the “new Helen Fielding”) has other plans for her debut. Reader be warned, the story abruptly abandons its old-fashioned character-probe for a startling new tack: Constance suddenly tires of her Wodehousian existence and sets off to bring her outmoded education up to date.
She impulsively follows her husband Jeffrey (“a man of few words and many possible meanings”) to Buenos Aires and Patagonia, being careful, of course, to pack a compass, sturdy boots and Bach’s Rescue Remedy. Readers will be charmed by Constance’s all-out approach to life and swept away by this comical, sparkling adventure.The iPad is a magical device, at least according to Apple, but is it a device worth buying to play games on? [UPDATED for the holidays.]
This is our best advice — updated regularly — about whether or not you should buy an iPad for gaming, what games to get for it and what to watch out for.
[This post was last updated on Oct. 1, 2010 and will be updated if events, news, games, prices or acts of nature cause our opinion to change.]
Should I buy an iPad for gaming now?
No way, not at this price. The iPad is a wonderful device. It's an amazing electronic book, magazine and newspaper reader. It's fantastic for watching movies on and browsing the web. And it has plenty of great applications and not a few amazing games. But gaming is more of a pleasant side effect of owning an iPad than it is an excuse to buy one.
What Else Does It Do Besides Gaming?
The iPad is a tablet computer, that means it can do a lot of the things a low-powered computer can do, but uses a touch screen instead of a physical keyboard or mouse.
You can browse the Internet, check your email, use the iPad as a digital photo frame, watch movies, listen to music, read books, magazines and newspapers, take notes and even organize your work with a calendar and contact database.
There are also those thousands of wonderful apps that add amazing functionality to the sleek, sexy device.
Above: iPad
If I'm going to take the plunge, should I get an iPad or iPad 3G?
The iPad still doesn't strike us as an on-the-go-device. We mostly use our iPads while home, or perhaps in a location with WiFi. When we do travel with the tablet a little pre-planning and an abundance of WiFi hotspots means we rarely miss the ability to log into the Internet with a cell network. Besides, that 3G plan is pricey.
I already have an iPod Touch, should I "upgrade" to an over-sized iPad?
No, not really. While the iPad may look like a bigger iPod Touch, once you get it you'll find that you don't use it in the same ways. The iPhone and iPod Touch are devices you carry around in your pocket or use in your car. The iPad is more like carrying around a book, or a really, really small laptop.
Besides, it's $500!
What are the best games on the iPad?
ANSWER UPDATED, 10/01/10:
The iPad doesn't have the same abundance of tailor-made games that the iPhone and iPod Touch have. But there are some great titles. We're particularly fond of the games that are ports of table top gaming. Games like Boggle for iPad, Crosswords, and Shredder Chess for iPad are all terrific titles.
And there are some amazing action games as well, like Dungeon Hunter HD, Mirror's Edge for Ipad and Warpgate HD. Strategy also seems like a perfect fit for the iPad with titles like We Rule, Defense of the Oasis and Strategery topping the list.
Also, don't forget that every iPhone and iPod Touch game will run on the iPad as well. Sure, they won't look as clear, with their graphics doubling in size to fill the screen, but that's not as bad as it sounds for some games.
Click the gallery for more info about each game.
You should also check out our holiday gift guide for the iPad.
Which Ones Are The worst?
The iPad has a pretty limited selection still, in terms of games designed for the device specifically. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some bad eggs. Top of the list are the flood of quick iPhone ports that hit iTunes the day the iPad went on sale. We're also not huge fans of shooters on the iPad, mostly because that super wide screen makes controlling the game a bit too awkward.
So if I buy a system, what are the first three games I should get?
ANSWER UPDATED, 10/01/10:
1. Angry Birds HD:.
2. Plants Vs. Zombies HD: This larger version of the iPhone game features a few more twists, but the biggest draw is watching the game unfold on a huge screen with liquid fast graphics.
3. USA Today: No, you're not confused. USA Today remains one of the largest newspapers in the United States. But this free newspaper app also comes with daily free crossword puzzles and a remarkable slick interface for playing them. And it's free.
The immensely popular table-top game comes to the iPad with local and online play, a variety of creative AI players to challenge on your own and even a puzzle mode.
Click the gallery for more info about each game.
What are the big drawbacks of the system, the stuff they don't tell you?
The iPad might be a thin device, but it's not really a small device. You won't be tucking this thing into your pocket. On the go you're going to want a bag or a case and it will feel like you're carrying around a legal pad. Not heavy, but not hands free either.
Gaming on the system is still lacking for top titles. There are some good ones out there, but developers seem reluctant to take a full dive into the system. Playing active, action games can tire your arms out unless you plan on resting the iPad in your lap or on a desk.
Any hidden costs?
No, not really. Unless you get the 3G enabled iPad. Then you're talking a $25 a month 2GB data plan.
But is there a better version of iPad coming soon? Or a price drop? Maybe I should hold off
Not that we've heard, but given Apple's love of fancy new hardware updates, there's always a good chance that either a price drop or a new model (or both) are just around the corner.
Essential Facts For The iPad
The iPad was released in 2010.
The iPad is a fancy name for Apple's tablet computer. It doesn't have a physical keyboard or mouse, but it does have a pretty slick touchscreen and a virtual keyboard. The device uses a modified version of the operating system found on the iPhone and iPod Touch.
While the device can run programs and play games, it functions best as a media player. It excels at playing music and videos, displaying magazines, books and newspapers.
Both the iPad and the iPad 3G have built in WiFi.
Currently available models: iPad WiFi 16GB ($499)*, iPad WiFi 32GB ($599), iPad WiFi 64GB ($699), iPad 3G 16GB ($629), iPad 3G 32GB ($729), iPad 3G 64GB ($829).[recommended models marked with an asterisk]
Price of new games: Free to $14.99
Discount line of games: None, though prices are always shifting for games.We talk to customers all the time that want to move to OpenStack, but the tools and processes they rely on just aren’t ready. Or the policies around their applications or data don’t support a true self-service cloud.
Not wanting to be stuck with VMware for the rest of their lives, we talk to them about what I call “cloud blending.”
Depending on what their tools and deployment processes look like today, some of the stateless, cloud-friendly components of their apps can be deployed to Cisco OpenStack Private Cloud, while leaving the scale-up or VMware-reliant (let’s call them “existing” instead of legacy), portions of their applications in the VMware environment.
An example might be to leave your SQL Server database in VMware, but move your web or content tier that’s going through a modern overhaul to a load-balanced, auto-scaling OpenStack environment–freeing up those costly VMware licenses for other purposes.
The response we often hear goes like this “Sure, but what about the processes I have in place to control my environment? Don’t those go away with OpenStack since everything is so self-service, where as today with VMware my teams control what happens?”
The answer is, as always, “It depends.”

Abstract 1) Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a key inhibitory regulator of T-cell function. Its expression is predominantly intracellular however, many theories surrounding it’s inhibitory action do not account for its endocytic behaviour. Recent reports have suggested a process of trans-endocytosis through which CTLA-4 internalises the ligand (CD80/CD86) from antigen presenting cells and prevents ligand binding to its stimulatory homologue CD28. The endocytic pathway of CTLA-4 is currently ill-defined and has a central role in this novel theory. Previous evidence suggests CTLA-4 is internalised via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE). However observations in a transfected CHO cell model have suggested internalisation independent of this pathway. In this study CTLA-4 showed the same endocytic recycling behaviour when transfected into a HeLa cell line. Immunostaining showed a strong degree of co-localisation between internalising CTLA-4 and the transferrin receptor (which is classically associated with CDE). Co-localisation with Adaptor-Protein 1 suggested exocytosis from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane was also clathrin-dependent, however, no association was observed with clathrin directly. Little CTLA-4 co-localisation to a lysosomal marker suggests that only a small proportion of the cytosolic receptor is targeted for degradation. CDE was inhibited by transfection of shRNA for Adaptor Protein 2 (AP-2). In CTLA-4+ CHO cells knock down of AP-2 resulted in decreased intracellular CTLA-4 but this was not statistically significant. This data supports but does not confirm that CTLA-4 can internalise independent of CDE.
Abstract 2)The phenotype of a T-lymphocyte can be defined by its expression of secretory cytokines. However, characterising the different T-cell lineages is challenging given the numerous subsets and significant overlap in cytokine profiles. Additionally the stability of a T-cell once fully differentiated is currently under review, with identifiable functional plasticity between different subsets. I investigated whether the recall cytokine response of CD4+ T-cells is influenced by the nature of the antigenic stimuli presented. PBMC were stimulated ex vivo with bacterial (SEB, PPD, Tetanus Toxoid), viral (EBV) and fungal antigens (yeast). IFNγ, TNFα, IL-17, IL-21 and IL-10 were stained intracellularly and expression analysed by flow cytometry. Results identified stimulus specific IFNγ, TNFα and IL-17 responses in the CD4+ CD45RO+ memory population for all antigens tested; however no detectable IL-21 and IL-10 secretion was established. There was variability in the ratio of IL-17+ : IFNγ + expression between different antigens indicating a potential Th17 or Th1 bias respectively. The ratio of TNFα+:IFNγ+ expressing cells was also variable, highlighting the potential significance of a TNFα+IFNγ- CD4+ population. Low number of responsive cells prevented comprehensive analysis of double positive cytokine secreting cells. However the proportion of IFNγ+ cells also TNFα+ following PPD stimulation was notably but not significantly higher than the positive control (SEB), whereas the IL-17+IFNγ+ proportions were similar. This study suggests but does not confirm that different antigenic stimuli cause an enrichment of differential T-cell subsets. Such findings are highly applicable to multiple disciplines involving cell-mediated immunity.
Repository Staff Only: item control pageBAKER CITY, Ore. (AP) — A treatment plant to guard against another outbreak of the diarrhea that affected as many as one in 10 residents of Baker City could be online in a year, the city manager says.
The town faces a 2016 deadline to act against the waterborne parasite cryptosporidium, but given the summer sickness, it should move quickly, City Manager Mike Kee said.
“We need to do everything we can,” Kee told the Baker City Herald (). “Every week we’ve got to be doing something toward this.”
Kee said he hopes to have a proposal before the City Council later this month to advance a plant that would treat water with ultraviolet light. That’s the least expensive option the city has been considering — a 2009 estimate put the cost at $2.3 million.
A filtration plant might cost six times that. The city of nearly 10,000 people draws heavily from surface water diversions and is exempt from federal water-quality rules requiring filtration of surface supplies.
City leaders haven’t had a consensus.
Some have worried that the city might build an ultraviolet plant but later lose the exemption and have to build the more expensive plant anyway. Some say they’d rather have a filtration plant in any case because it would remain effective — and ultraviolent wouldn’t — in the event a major wildfire causes ash and dirt to get into the water supply.
Health officials still haven’t pinpointed the source of the cryptosporidium that started affecting people in late July. Usually, the parasite is spread by animal feces.
At first, suspicion focused on elk congregating near a mountain lake used for supplemental summer water. More recently, attention has turned to cattle grazing on federal allotments near streams that are the city’s primary sources.
After about three weeks and tests showing no cryptosporidium in the water, the city lifted a boil order for water users.
The outbreak took a toll on the local economy when a local pizza crust bakery company laid off a substantial part of its workforce because of a downturn in orders. The company said customers cited the outbreak.
Kee said the city will have to tap $1.7 million in its water utility fund that hadn’t been scheduled for spending in the current budget. Normally, he said, state law would forbid spending it, but he said an exception for community calamities should apply to Baker City’s circumstances.
He said the city has $230,000 already budgeted that could be used to build a foundation for the plant near the covered reservoirs on the southwest corner of the city.
Construction of the plant would take about six months, Kee said.

Natalia Warner lit with a single Speedlight in a Lovegrove Gemini bracket with a 30cm silver umbrella. 18mm lens, 1/125th second at f/11..
04. A directional pool of light from a bright silver umbrella in the Gemini bracket. 18mm lens, ISo 200, f/14 at 1/125th second. The flash head is right alongside the shaft of an umbrella when rigged in a Gemini making it suitable for creating a directional pool of light.
I used a combination of manual exposure mode and aperture priority with exposure compensation for the continuous light pictures depending upon the situation I was in. All the flash exposures were in manual mode.
06. The light was so wonderful outside we often alternated between shooting interiors and exteriors at each location. 60mm lens, 1/500th second at f/2.8.
07. I love the monochrome set of images I created in Lightroom. There is a presence and sparkle in them. I lit this frame with a bare faced Speedlight. 18mm lens at f/5.6 ISO 200, and 1/125th second.
08. A simple slash of flash gives Natalia a striking contrast. ISO 200, 35mm lens at f/16 using 1/125th second. A five stop ND filter would have dropped the aperture to f/2.8.
09. A typical Lovegrove lighting set up created a striking set of pictures. ISO 200, 60mm lens, f/2.8 at 1/480th second.
15. It was coincidence that the name Natalia was on this wall so I had to use it in a shot of Natalia. I like the 'A's in the graffiti. ISO 1000, 60mm at f/2.4 using 1/250th second hand held.
17. I took this frame of Olivia in the afternoon sunlight using ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/2.8 and 1/250th second.
That was my last sequence of shots from Day 1. Martin and I swapped delegates every now and then so that everyone got to shoot every setup. So this set makes up half the shots the delegates took overall.
We drove back to the hotel some 30 minutes away in three vehicles. Martin and I drove the delegates and Mickie drove our models. The evenings were social affairs starting with a few tapas and finishing with a fine meal in a smart local Taverna. After dinner a certain Gecko made an appearance. The food was wonderful along with the service and all was remarkably inexpensive.
Day two started where we left off on day one, at our ‘barracks in the woods’.
20. The first sequence of day two used a silver reflector on Natalia as a secondary light source. ISO 400, 60mm lens at f/2.8 and 1/250th second shutter speed.
22. A bit more reflector upped the settings needed. ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/2.8 using 1/550th second shutter speed.
Positioning of the Speedlight or reflector, control of the power and balancing with the ambient was the core subject of the workshop. These are all skills that need days to learn and a lifetime to master. Some of the delegates were far more advanced as photographers than others but when we are out in the field the situation is a leveler. Some delegates were concentrating on composition, some on model direction and others on the technical aspects of exposure and lighting. The buzz in the groups was electric.
25. Key and kick lighting with a quick and easy setup when you know how. ISO 800, 60mm lens at f/2.8, 1/1800th second. I could have swapped some shutter speed for ISO but it wouldn't have really noticed because the Fuji X-Pro1 is so clean at ISO 800.
After the barracks session on day two we moved onto the ‘widows cottage’ and the ‘tunnel of love’. Martin shot the tunnel with the delegates while I shot the cottage.
30. ISO 200, 18mm lens, f/8 at 1/420th second. The rocks in this area were tinged with purple, orange and green hues. The sky was deep and blue.
32. This location produced some of the most dramatic pictures from the workshop days. Careful use of a reflector created the light for Natalia to shine in. ISO 200, 18mm lens, f/2.8 at 1/130th second.
34, It was at this point I heard howls of laughter from the other group in the tunnel. Day two was a magical day for me. Being creative with a great group of talented photographers and models in fabulous locations like this is a wonderful life experience. ISO 200 35mm lens, f/5.6 at 1/320th second.
37. One of my favourite pictures this year and perhaps ever. It takes time for a picture to earn it's place in my portfolio because I'm always caught up with the emotion of the moment. I really must mention the monumental effort and dedication Natalia showed to us this day. Total respect! ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/3.2 with 1/350th second.
38. 18mm lens at f/2, ISO 200 at 1/850th. This is the same location as shot 32 but after lunch with group two. The sun moves around 15 degrees an hour so it is easy to predict what will happen.
41. A single Speedlight created the magic. ISO 200, 35mm lens at f/8 with a 1/125th second exposure.
The next location on day two was the old mine workings that Martin and I had discovered in 2010. They were a mere 5 minute drive from the ‘widows cottage’.
42. A simple two Speedlight set up was used to make this portrait of Olivia. ISO 200, 18mm lens at f/13 with a shutter speed of 1/125th second.
Our final location on day two was en route back to the hotel. Martin an I had missed the palm trees at the monastery so we found some others to use at a nearby ruin.
That was my last frame from the two day workshop. All that remained was to get back to the hotel and go out to celebrate. Not too hard though because we had a group creative shoot the next day leaving the hotel at 10:00am.
Day three: The creative day.
By now the Speedlight way had been taught and it was time for the group to take it’s own initiave at the locations Martin and I had chosen. We started near the beach.
47. The intensity of reflected light on Natalia made it hard for her to open her eyes fully and I like her smouldering look that ensued. ISO 200, 60mm at f/3.2 for 1/340th second.
48. The sandstone cliffs gave us a dramatic background to compose with. I used two Speedlights direct on full power in one Gemini bracket to light Natalia. ISO 200, 18mm lens at f/8 (with ND filter) at 1/125th second.
49. Olivia at another double Gemini set up using ISO 200, 18mm lens (with ND) at f/8 for 1/125th second.
50. Natalia at the beach life guard hut. Lit with the twin Speedlight set up. ISO 200, 18mm lens (with ND) at f/8 for 1/125th second.
We had lunch at a beach bar before moving onto the final location of the creative day. An amazing ruinous naval fort with wonderful outbuildings and commanding views.
51. Natalia on the 'wall of destruction'. This was a wonderful place to be soaking up the sun and being creative. ISO 200, 18mm (with ND) at f/8 for 1/250th second using a reflector to light Natalia.
52. Martin had rigged a couple of Speedlights for us at this striking location. The Pocket Wizard triggers worked through the walls okay and that was just what we needed. ISO 200, 18mm lens, f/16 at 1/125th second.
58, Beautiful Olivia. ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/2.4 for 1/90th second. This the absolute bottom shutter speed I can hold this lens steady for. I should have upped the ISO to 400 and used 1/180th second. Focus wide open with the 60mm lens is superb.
59. I went deeper into the ammunition store with Natalia. The light dropped off considerably but it was fabulous light. ISO 1000, 60mm lens at f/2.4 for 1/120th second.
61. This shot was at the top of some spiral stairs to the look out and ranging tower. ISO 400, 35mm lens at f/2.8 and 1/500th second.
This was the end of day three. We made our way back to the vehicles for the hour long journey through the mountains back to our hotel. We had one last night together at the taverna and said our goodbyes. Most of the delegates, martin and Olivia departed first thing in the morning. I stayed on with Natalia and one delegate who came from Singapore for the workshop. We were out on the streets for a 1:1 session on urban portraits the next day. Here are a few frames from our street shoot. We both shot using the Fujifilm X-Pro1 and one Canon Speedlight.
66. Simple natural sunlight through trees and a diagonal composition. ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/2.8 and 1/1800th second.
67. Identical spot as the shot above but a change of angle and a big four stop change of exposure even though the sunlight is the same. ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/2.4 and 1/125th second.
68. It's so easy to miss repeating patterns and historic architecture like this. ISO 200, 60mm at f/4 and 1/450th second.
69. A single Speedlight delivered striking results here. ISO 200, 35mm lens at f/10 for 1/125th second.
71. I lit Natalia with a Canon 580EX2 mounted directly in the hot shoe of my Fuji X-Pro1. I used the flash in manual mode. ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/11 and 1/125th second. The camera triggered the flash perfectly.
72. A single Speedlight with a gel was used to light Natalia. ISO 200, 18mm lens at f/5 and 1/125th second.
73. Nice fencing made from acrylic was a colourful background for this key and kick lighting set up with one off camera Speedlight. ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/14 and 1/125th second.
74. The crisp hard light of a Speedlight is unmistakable and gorgeous. ISo 200, 60mm lens at f/11 and 1/125th second.
75. Reflections in parked cars caught my eye and I thought a pose to match the distorted reflections was a great idea. I'm not sure now. ISO 200, 60mm at f/2.8 for 1/125th second.
79. I used reflected sunlight from a bit of a wall of a bank to light Natalia here. ISO 200, 60mm lens at f/2.8 and 1/250th second.
82. We found some long grass too. I have a shot of Natalia in similar grass that I took two years ago in Bristol. ISO 200, 18mm lens at f/8 and 1/125th second. Flashed with our Speedlight of course.
I dropped Natalia to the airport and my delegate and I went for a Chinese meal. It was a wonderfully calm end to a fiesta of creativity and bonding.

We will be back in the autumn of 2013. Register your interest for 2013 now. Expected price will be approximately £795 for the 2 day workshop plus £120 for the optional creative day. This price covers models, lunches, drinks and transport each day. The creative day happens the day after the workshop and it a chance to put together all the skills learned on the previous two days at new exciting locations. Please look at the 2013 details here and register your interest with Blaise to be kept up to date with information, options and logistics.
Martin and I will be teaching how to shoot the big picture using Elinchrom Quadra in the vistas of Fuerteventura in the Spring of 2013. We would love you to join us on this life enhancing experience.
Please feel free to comment on these pictures or your experience of this workshop if you were fortunate enough to be a delegate.

Incredible photos Damien. I’ve not explored the flash capabilities yet but clearly it’s very capable.
Thanks for your kind words Kevin.
I use Canon PW Mini or PW Plus 2 or any Ebay type transmitter straight on the X-Pro1. Canon flash work in M mode right on the top too if you ever need on camera flash. I rarely do.
Best regards,
Damien.
This was an amazing workshop Damien. I don’t feel I can really call it a workshop as it felt like a holiday. You, Martin, Natalia, Olivia and Mickie were absolutely second to none. Not only in the professional sense but as people to spend time with too. As if that wasn’t enough my fellow delegates were incredible. So much so we all stay in touch and have been arranging our own shoots. Thank you for an incredible experience. One that has had a huge impact on me and my photography!
Amazing!
Thank you Damien and Martin for such a well planned workshop. The rustic ruins, warm coloured landscapes and scenic places are a welcome change to Singapore urban settings and provided so many photo opportunities for learning. It is a pleasure watching and learning Martin Hill’s speedlight
creativity skills and how he frames the model against a background feature, and not forgetting the smoke pellets that he uses in the tunnel shots.
Before the start of each session, I like that both of you would explained the ground situations, how to make use of natural lights and speedlights and offering tips on model positioning and poses during the actual shoots.
Finally the choice of the two models (Natalia and Olivia) were thoughtful and deliberate, representing different contrasting qualities and the challenge is for us to create that yin and yang moments.
Also thank you to Mickie for her endless supply of ice cold coca colas, mineral water and food, making each photography session an effortless task.
PS: Besides the Gecko, the succulent lamb food at the Pincho de Castilla restaurant is a must try for your delegates at the next Spain workshop.
Fantastic read!
How come you went for 1/125 for all the flash shots?
Damien, I bow in front of you:) You are like a master of light!!!! Amazing set of photos as usual, there are so many of them I like that it’s hard to choose only few favourites, but here I’ll try:) 3, 15, 26, 33, 34, 38, 47, 50, 51, 53, 61, 68, 71,78, 81. Once again! Absolutely fantastic work! I can’t wait for our Urban Portraits workshop!!!
Thanks Lee, I’m excited to have met you and to be shooting alongside you at workshops to come. You were a star amongst the group and a joy to be with.
Stay inspired,
Damien.
Thank you Denise. :) I appreciate your comment. Best regards, Damien.
Thank you Teck,
Thank you for your kind words and workshop appraisal. I really enjoyed our time together plus shooting with you exclusively on day four. The workshops were a journey of creativity and information delivery. I’d love the chance of shooting with you again soon.
Kindest regards,
Damien.
Thanks Sam,
Well 1/180th second is the flash sync speed of the X-pro1 but it is not on the shutter speed dial. It would be great to have an x setting but the best we have is 1/125th. There is the facility to nudge the shutter speed up or down one or two thirds of a stop but that ‘electronic’ mode is not fixed like a dial setting. So I settled on 1/125th plus ND filters as required.
Kindest regards,
Damien.
Hi Sona, it’s been a pleasure reading your comments and understanding your passion for photography. Our shoot together will be a very special experience. Bring it on! Thanks for your continued support and kind comments.
Best regards,
Damien.
Superb Damien. I’m writing to Blaise when I’m finished here :-)
The locations are stunning in their own right but the models really emphasise the dilapidation!
That hol(e)y roof is awesome. Fine work.
Howard
A great write up and have to say have been really impressed with what this camera can do! I currently have an x100 and have been pleased with what that can deliver, so having an option to change lenses is a tempting reason to upgrade!
Hi Damien,
Let me introduce myself first. I’m a fellow cameraman, living in the Netherlands. Working for a lot of big shows, for Top of the pops when it was broadcasted here, Strictly come dancing and The Voice of Holland. It’s the greatest way to earn your money I think…
I also own a X-Pro1, with a 18 and 35mm lens. I use it a lot for streetlike-photography. My big question is: do I really miss a 35mm? Or can I do the most of it with the 2 lenses I own. I’ve heard the 35 is great quality-wise…. And in 2 weeks I’ll be in Egypt, so do I want it over there?
Do you have an idea?? (I know it’s a personal thing but I like to talk about it with fellow camera-lovers…)
regards and I really like your work!
Bas Thijssen
Thank you Damien and Martin for this amazing and life changing experience. The locations were captivating, the models were amazing and very well chosen to suit all levels of experience, and the shots that were demonstrated were full of emotion and storytelling. This was photography at its best. I feel I have gained a lot in these three days and this is thanks to all the knowledge and experience that was passed on to all the delegates by two charismatic photographers. Needless to say i made some good friends during these three days!
Beautiful shoot Damien! Good location, light and model forms a good basis to start with. And so much more control then during weddings! :) Keep up the good work
Beautiful work,Completely the style i like
Congratulation

Thanks Howard, I like it when planning and preparation meet opportunity.

Hi Bas,
I hope my reply isn’t too late. I assume it is a typo in your question… “I also own a X-Pro1 with a 18mm and 35mm lens…” I assume you have the 18mm and 60mm as you are enquiring about the 35mm lens. I use all three lenses plus I have the X100 with it’s 23mm lens (35mm equivelent full frame). Egypt has some big slopey buildings that love a moderate wide lens when up close or a standard lens from 400m away :)
Have a great trip :)
Kindest regards, Damien.
Thank you Vangellis,
We are so fortunate to have been in Spain with you guys. The event was truly amazing for Martin and I too. Fuerteventura will take everything to the next level. I do hope you can join us :)
Happy days! Damien.
Hi Stefan,
Yes it’s control all the way and that’s just how I like it. Thank you for your compliments. :)
Kind regards, Damien
Thanks Tom. I’m glad you like them :)
Regards, Damien.
Simply to say “Thank You” just isn’t enough to express my appreciation. Only Damien and Martin could put on a workshop that produces this much creativity and inspiration. Like all Damien’s workshops, they are life changing experiences and your eye’s are forever opened wider in this wonderful world of portrait photography.
Thanks Gwyn,
It was life changing as you say. I’m so glad the group has kept together and is having reunion shoots. Photography can be a lonely occupation or hobby and it’s friendships like ours that make the process exciting and rewarding. Stay inspired,
Damien.
Hi Damien,
It’s really amazing! Very inspiring! Thank you.
As there’s no “good” raw converter software, did you shoot Raw or Jpg?
Quentin.
Hi Quentin,
Lightroom is a brilliant raw converter for the X-Pro1 Some geeky togs who pixel peep pictures of views from bedroom windows don’t like what they see at a microscopic level but trust me the pictures out of Lightroom are sparkling with clarity and verve. Lustre and life is the secret of the Fuji pictures. The detail is as good if not better than my Canon 5D mk2 and my Nikon D700 and the pictures are so vivid. Don’t be put off by the moanings of forum goers. Judge the work of artists and look at real prints of fine photographs. It is then you will see why the X-Pro1 is so enthusiastically received. I happen to think the technical prowess of a camera is less important than it’s ability to excite you into taking pictures. Driving enthusiasm and desire to shoot is a far greater attribute for a camera to have than technical excellence. That’s why I’d favour a good camera phone over a Hasselblad H4D or whatever it’s called. In a bar among friends there would be just one winner.
Stay inspired, stay creative and own a camera that makes you feel warm and fuzzy when you pick it up. Learn to love the process of picture making and then the bits and bytes will become insignificant.
Thanks for your kind words, Damien :)
Hi Damien. Given your latest review and samples of the new 56mm lens I was just curious to find a set of portraits done with the 60mm lens just to see what it can do and I found this post of yours from a while back. Some stunning work! Now I’m almost wondering if I even need to pick up the 56mm as its more expensive and optically probably the same. I know the af is faster and the dof is shallower, but you really did some amazing stuff with the lens here. I’m also thinking a couple of the headshots you are showing here might be a tad too close to focus with on the 56mm. Really really nice work here.
Hi Tomas,
Here is another gallery for you to look at. All the pictures on that gallery were taken with the 60mm lens. The optics are completely different and the bokeh characteristics are different even at the same aperture.
It’s a wonderful problem to have. Which fine lens to choose.At lunch, my boss bragged over her boyfriend buying an Ed Hardy jacket for 700 Euro. Which apparently is okay, because he still lives at home.

You know when you are a kid it can seem like forever...
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Welcome to 2014 (!) and the beginning of the end of the 2013 NFL Season! While the day after Thanksgiving is known as Black Friday…the day after the last Sunday of the NFL season is known as Black Monday. Not because you can find killer deals online and in stores…but because this is the day where Head Coaches in the NFL get canned. A bid morbid and dramatic don’t you think? Well that’s boys for you. This past Monday, just 12 hours after the Eagles put the final mail in the Cowboys’ coffin, 5 coaches received their marching orders:
1.) Leslie Frazier- Minnesota Vokings
2.) Mike Shanahan- Washington Redskins
3.) Jim Schwartz- Detroit Lions
4.) Greg Schiano- Tampa Bay Buccaneers
5.) Rob Chudzinski- Cleveland Browns
Not as many as last year (7 coaches hit the road on Black Monday in 2012) but still enough to shake things up. Too bad the Cowboys can’t fire their owner/GM Jerry Jones.
I don’t know what you’re pouting about JJ, you have job security for life no matter how terrible a job you do. (Photo Credit: washingtonpost.com)
The NFL Playoffs kickoff Saturday afternoon with the first of 4 games in the Wild Card Round. In the Wild Card round the #6 seed of each division plays the #3 seed and the #5 seed plays the #4 seed. This is what the Playoffs look like right now:
– Noticeably absent from the line-up this year is last year’s unlikely Super Bowl Champs, the Baltimore Ravens.
– The Green Bay Packers made it into the playoffs by the skin of their teeth. In his first game back after suffering a broken collarbone Aaron Rogers threw a 48 yard touchdown to Randall Cobb, who was also playing in his first game back after having a broken leg, with 38 seconds to go to win the game 33-28. Aside: I am pretty sure that it would take me a full 2 years to be able to fully function again after having a broken collarbone and/or a broken leg. These guys are back in a matter of weeks. Who are these people?? End of Aside.
Stay tuned for my recap on the Wild Card games and preview of the next round…The Divisional Round. We are getting close to the Super Bowl, friends!I'm using a theme which has it's own simple mail function (sendmail.php) for a built in contact form.

Two goals from highly-rated midfielder Ryan Harley sent United crashing to only their second league defeat of the season and handed Exeter just reward for a committed performance.
"I think we deserved the victory," said Tisdale. "I think we were definitely the better side in the first quarter of the game, we got ourselves in front and we managed to hold on."
He added: "There are arguments to discuss whether we were the better side generally, but sometimes you just have to hang on for a result and it was clear after about 50 minutes that that was going to be the case.
"We managed to get a second, but it was a good day for everyone connected with this football club. We scored two terrific goals, but the first goal was symptomatic of that first quarter where we crossed it early and did to Leeds what they do to most sides.
"The second goal is what we expect from Ryan, but when he scored with his head I think we knew it was going to be our day."
Article CommentsFor most of the past century the scientific consensus held that the adult human brain did not produce any new neurons. Researchers overturned that theory in the 1990s, but what role new neurons played in the adult human brain remained a mystery. Recent work now suggests that one role may be to help the brain recover from traumatic brain injury.
Cory Blaiss, then at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and her colleagues genetically engineered mice such that the researchers could selectively turn neurogenesis on or off in a brain region called the hippocampus, a ribbon of tissue located under the neocortex that is important for learning and memory. They then administered blunt-force trauma to the brain and compared the performance of brain-injured mice that could produce new neurons to brain-injured mice that could not. They sent each mouse through a water maze that required it to find a platform obscured beneath the surface of murky water. The researchers found that after injury only mice with intact neurogenesis could develop an efficient strategy to find the hidden platform, a skill that is known to rely on spatial learning and memory. They concluded that without neurogenesis in the hippocampus, the recovery of cognitive functions after brain injury was significantly impaired.
The finding may lead to much needed therapeutic techniques. Deficits in learning and memory are nearly universal after a traumatic brain injury. The ability to stimulate more robust neurogenesis could lead to faster healing times or perhaps even more complete recovery of cognitive functions, a potentially life-changing prospect for the millions of people who suffer from traumatic brain injury every year.When: Tue., Dec. 11, 12:30-2:30 p.m. 2012

Red Wings overnight report: On Pulkkinen, Jurco and good and bad prospect news
by George Malik on 08/27/14 at 05:29 AM ET
Red Wings players are slowly but surely filtering back into town, and within a day or two, they'll be spotted skating informally in Troy as well as closer to the Joe, but for the present moment, Tomas Tatar's autograph-signing in Bratslava this Thursday's the closest thing we'll get to a "media availability" until the post-Labor Day practices begin.
Until Pro Hockey Talk's "Red Wings Day" begins, quite frankly, its a "slow morning." We won't have many more of 'em.
The Wings posited an author-less article which focuses upon Teemu Pulkkinen's successful North American pro debut:.”
And the article serves as a companion to the Wings' Prospect Profile video from earlier this summer:
In foreign-language news, Tomas Jurco (now wearing Bauer gear) gave an interview to Novy CAS (author cited is "KZ"?), and...I'll give translating it a go, but what follows is very, very roughly translated:
The holidays have ended for the overseas player: Tomas Jurco will battle for the hockey team!
Time is already running out on his time at home, and he'll soon go overseas.
Kosice native Tomas Jurco, 21, will soon head to Detroit, where he hopes to build upon a successful season in the NHL. He performed to his maximum, and the toughness of ice hockey didn't faze him. A clever attacker and Slovakian national team player revealed more about his plans, his vacation and his superstitions. And he trained for the new season aside his sister Petra [who plays for the Slovakian women's national hockey team].
How was your summer at home in Kosice?
"Totally awesome. I had three months at home, which I enjoyed. It was my longest summer over the last five years. I spent time with my family and also my friends."
Did you go on a holiday?
"At the beginning of July I went to Turkey, but I stayed at home for most of my vacation. I relaxed, but that was in addition to daily workouts. [For a while] I just relaxed--sometimes playing video games and doing nothing after a difficult season is important."
Did you indulge in homemade treats, or were you able to abstain from them?
"My mom cooked everything, I always ate well. Not just fried cheese and chicken soup, but also other dishes, and I successfully kept my weight."
Are you superstitious, do you have a lucky charm?
"I do the same thing before games, I'm not sure if I'd call it a ritual. What I plan has to be followed, and I don't change it. I also have my lucky cross that I can't remove from the locker room."
With whom did you train to prepare?
"For the past three years I've worked with Daniel Kicura and Marek Kokinda, who also work with the Extraliga team in Kosice. I can only be satisfied because I was successful last season. This [summer's] training was less athletic and more powerful. So I rode the bike rarely and did a lot of shooting. Practically every day because finishing work's very hard."
Did you train on the ice with your sister Petra's assistance, as she also plays on the Slovak national team? Did she set up your shots?
"Very well! She's a super woman. We train together in the summer."
Did you speak with your teammate from Detroit, Tomas Tatar?
"During the summer, only about three times, but certainly we're almost always together, and we carpool on the way to Detroit. When we're together, there's never a shortage of fun."
Are you already looking forward to Detroit?
"Yes, but I'll miss home. I have to depart for America on September 10th, and I hope to fight my way onto the NHL team and I want to be on it for the upcoming season. Then I'd be satisfied."
While we're discussing foreign-language news, it looks like Tomas Nosek (first picture, orange jersey, red pants as well as gloves and helmet) is still skating with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga as they engage in preseason practices...
And in Russia (the KHL's regular season begins on September 3rd), CSKA Moscow GM Sergei Fedorov's chosen to not sign his 31-year-old brother Fedor, and he conducted a long interview with Sport-Express's Petr Tereschenko after publicly introducing CSKA's new players on Tuesday. The first line doesn't need much translation from GM-speak:
According to the result of the preseason games, CSKA is among [the KHL's] leaders. What do you attach to this?
"To some extent, yes, we have a new coaching staff and a new team. But largely speaking preseason victories aren't representative--the fact is they're called training games."
Back over on this side of the pond, the Red Wings' prospect tournament begins on September 12th, and the Waterloo Record's Josh Brown reports that one of the Wings' try-outs, Kitchener Rangers forward Darby Llewellyn, will head to Traverse City with a chip on his shoulder after being passed over in the 2014 draft:
Down in Philadelphia more than 200 of his peers were taken in the NHL draft. Llewellyn, an Ann Arbor, Mich., native, who is coming off a breakout season with the Rangers, was bypassed.
"It was a rough day," he said. "But it gives me a chance to prove all 30 teams wrong."
The 18-year-old was back in Waterloo Region with his teammates Tuesday for the Rangers' annual charity golf tournament at Whistle Bear Golf Club. More than 40 players will compete for roster spots at training camp, which begins Wednesday with fitness testing and practice.
...
Llewellyn was one of the bright spots on a club that missed the playoffs for the first time in five years. Llewellyn scored 25 goals — and had 19 by Christmas — to finish tied for the team lead with forward Justin Bailey. He potted seven markers during his rookie season.
"Once you get a year under your belt it gets a lot easier," Llewellyn said of his power surge. "Everything kind of slows down. I think that was one of the biggest things."
Confidence played a part as well. Llewellyn's swagger earned him stints on the team's second line and power play minutes. But a second half swoon that saw him post just six goals took some of the shine off an otherwise brilliant campaign. Looking back, the forward admits that he let the draft get to him.
"I think I worried about it a little too much," he said. "This year, I'm going to put it out of my head and play my game. I know what I can bring and hopefully a team will take a chance on me."
Llewellyn was rock-solid defensively but otherwise unspectacular at the summer development camp, and the 6'1," 175-pound forward's 25 goals and 11 assists registered over the course of 66 games weren't quite enough to merit a late-round pick.
Also: I remembered that way back on July 8th, DetroitRedWings.com's Bill Roose revealed a very preliminary WIngs prospect tournament roster.
The Left Wing Lock's Sarah Lindenau (who is also on Twitter, and she's Centre Ice Arena's official Wings-camp "social media captain"; the camp has a Twitter account, too) is the go-to source for official Wings prospect tournament and training camp news; she just released the Rangers' prospect tournament roster--and the Wings are usually last to reveal their roster due to last-minute changes...
But Roose's working roster gives us a glimpse as to the majority of the players who will be defending the Wings' first tournament win:.
That's 11 players in the lineup and 8 "expecteds," or 19 players total. Teams usually bring 14 forwards, 7 or 8 defensemen and 2 or 3 goalies, or a 23-25 players. I'm not going to hazard any guesses save Martin Frk, but this is certainly the time of year for you to do so.
In "familial prospect news," the Saginaw News's Cory Butzin reports that Igor Larionov II has been invited to the Saginaw Spirit's training camp (the Spirit have a scrimmage scheduled for 10 AM today), and given that Igor barely played over the past two seasons due to hip issues, the 5'11," 180-pound forward earning an invite--even as a Saginaw Spirit draftee--is pretty impressive given that he's only 16.
The Plymouth Whalers are holding open scrimmages today and on Thursday, too, and they're holding an exhibition game for charity on Saturday;
In "familial prospect news, bummer version": There's been some confusion regarding this player, so I want to clear things up. Yahoo Sports' Neate Sager offers the details of a plain old weird story. London Knights goaltender Jake Patterson--that's PaTTerson--is considering retiring from hockey at age 20 because the London Knights want him to play as their back-up, not their starter, and while the 6'1," 191-pound goaltender's more or less split time with the Knights' younger goalies, being a back-up as an "overager" would severely limit his chances of earning a pro deal.
Jake PaTTerson was a try-out during the Wings' 2013 summer development camp; Jake Paterson with one T was the Wings' 80th overall pick in the 2012 draft, Jake PaTerson played for the aforementioned Saginaw Spirit, and Jake PaTerson is turning pro this season.
If you wish to chat with a pair of Free Press scribes, "Tigers/Red Wings writer George Sipple" is holding a chat at 10 AM EDT, and Evil Drew Sharp is chatting at 11 AM;
I have exactly one fantasy hockey tidbit for you (40+ websites and a Swedish-language interview with Andreas Lilja's worth of searching and I can give you one fantasy hockey tidbit, but it's not for a lack of trying), but Dobber Hockey's Darryl Dobbs' take on Niklas Kronwall, deeming him a "star," is pretty spiffy:
Niklas Kronwall, Detroit Red Wings – He may be 33 but he seems to be just getting started. Coming off the second best season of his career, Kronwall should have an easier time of it this year with a healthy Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg, as well as the emergence of Gustav Nyquist.
I sure hope he's "just getting started," and I hope that Brendan Smith, Danny DeKeyser and Jonathan Ericsson (among others) can give him assistance in consistently producing offense for the Wings.
I will be out of the office for a good 4-5 hours today, from about 3 to...I really don't know when, so Paul will be updating the NBC post that will come online later this morning, and I will be spending my day in a doctor's office parking lot.
So:
1. We're going to talk about community stuff before the season starts. Guidelines will be brief (my dad's golden rule was, "There are good people and assholes; don't be an *#$%@&," and that's a good place to start) but the comments section has gotten a little more civil over the past month, which is good;
2. This is also, "Suggestions for the blog's form and content" time, so if you have constructive suggestions as to how I can improve my coverage, I would appreciate them;
3. Here it comes...
I've got two weeks and one day.: MLive's Ansar Khan offers a 2014-2015 "outlook" for Drew Miller:?
If he increases his scoring output, something he told the Free Press's Helene St. James that he knows he must improve upon to stave off challenges for his position.

I live a pretty bloody spartan life absent more than a few “luxuries” and “basics,” but what I spend my paycheck on—or don’t spend it on—is not your business.
Nor is your business to be entitled to have a KK account to solely badger myself, Paul or anyone else on this website. The act is more than a little dated, and in a comments section where people tend to earn their keep, you’re trending in the wrong direction, dear friend. It’s not just the digs at me, either, and it’s that within-the-rest-of-the-community shit that may come back to bite you.
That’s not a threat, that’s a warning to either treat other people with some sort of basic modicum of respect, even if you’re trying to rip ‘em a rhetorical new one, or to beat it.

Sommeil, a €5m signing from FC Girondins de Bordeaux in 2003, is not having his contract renewed while City manager Stuart Pearce has decided against extending the loans of Musampa and Riera from Club Atlético de Madrid and RCD Espanyol respectively.
Former Dutch international goalkeeper Sander Westerveld has been released by Portsmouth FC after a solitary season with the English Premiership club. The 31-year-old made only seven appearances for Portsmouth and joined Everton FC on a short-term loan. With his contract expiring this summer, the former Liverpool FC and Real Sociedad de Fútbol man will become a free agent.
Promoted Sheffield United FC have signed defender Chris Lucketti for €440,000 from Preston North End FC. Lucketti joined Sheffield United on loan in March and will now get a first taste of the Premiership at the age of 34.
In Spain, Real Zaragoza defender César Jiménez must undergo surgery after damaging cartilage in his left knee in training on Wednesday. The 28-year-old centre-back only returned from a 16-month injury lay-off with a substitute appearance against Deportivo Alavés at the weekend. This new problem is likely to set him back two months.
UEFA Cup qualifiers AS Nancy-Lorraine have agreed new contracts with five members of their French League Cup winning-squad. Midfielders Emmanuel Duchemin (27), Benjamin Gavanon (25) and Pascal Berenguer (24) will remain at the club until 2010. Meanwhile, defenders Frédéric Biancalani (31) and Cédric Lécluse (34) have signed two and one-year deals respectively.
FC Stal Alchevsk coach Anatoliy Volobuev is to be replaced at the helm of the Ukrainian club by Mykola Pavlov. The new man is Volobuev's choice to succeed him in a job he has done since 1988. "I would like to point out that it is Volobuev's decision to leave and invite me to become coach," said the experienced Pavlov, whose previous coaching assignment at FC Illychivets Mariupil ended 18 months ago. Stal finished eleventh in the Premier League.
Aleksandr Ryabokon has resigned as FC Dinamo Minsk coach. The 42-year-old stepped down after his side lost 3-1 at home to local rivals FC MTZ-RIPO Minsk, a defeat which caused last season's runners-up to slip to 12th in the Belarussian table.
F91 Dudelange and AS Jeunesse Esch will contest the Luxembourg Cup final at the Stade Josy Barthel on Saturday week. Newly-crowned champions Dudelange won 3-1 at FC Racing Union Luxembourg while Jeunesse Esch prevailed 1-0 at FC Victoria Rosport. In European terms, Dudelange will play in the UEFA Champions League while Jeunesse Esch and FC Etzella Ettelbrück will enter the UEFA Cup. CS Grevenmacher go into the UEFA Intertoto Cup.
FC Metz will start next season with a new coach after academy boss Francis de Taddeo replaced Joël Muller, who will become the French club's general manager. "We have two good coaches on our staff - why look elsewhere?" said president Carlo Molinari. Metz are destined to finish bottom of Ligue 1 and be relegated.Battlefield 2

Oh, Toronto
Once again, Toronto is making headlines across the nation for slut-shaming. As you might recall, last year, a Toronto police officer sparked a firestorm of criticism and outrage when he said “women should avoid dressing like sluts not to be victimized” during a speech. That outrage turned into a movement that has swept across the US and Canada: The Slutwalk.
But apparently that wasn’t enough.
Now, shortly after Toronto police held a news conference to warn women in the area about a series of sexual assaults, Krista Ford, the niece of Mayor Tom Ford, and daughter of a Councillor, sent an awful tweet (screenshot courtesy of Gawker media):
Don’t dress like a whore? Really, Ms. Ford? Guess what? My clothing is never an excuse for someone to sexually assault me! It’s never an excuse, period! People of both sexes, all ages, professions and styles of dress have become victims of sexual assaults. It’s not just the drunk girl walking home by herself after dancing at a club all night, it’s the girl wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, it’s the guy rushing for a frat who is getting hazed, or anyone who finds themselves in a vulnerable position.
With all of this in mind, I have signed up to attend San Francisco’s Slutwalk, occurring next weekend, September 8th, at Dolores Park. I hope that all of my readers in the Bay Area will join me. For those of you who are not in San Francisco, I’ll be taking some pictures!Chapter 140: Investments
140.020 Financial Planning
140.020 Financial Planning
Executive Guideline No. 17, April 26, 1982.
In any period of financial stringency, the University's educational services to the people of Missouri would be greatly diminished. Hence, those in the University community are obligated to do the sound planning that would enable the University to avoid such a situation or, in the event of financial crisis, to preserve its educational functions to the greatest extent possible.
Effective preventive planning can help to preserve the basic missions of the University, including the unique roles which it serves in the state's higher education system. At each level of operation, the administration and faculty must continue to establish priorities among these missions as a basis for sound resource allocation.
In planning to prevent or to cope with a financial crisis, the educational interests of students are of high importance. Planning must also take into account the essential contributions to the University's operation which are made by administrative and support staff. The University's Plan for Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action is yet another factor which must be considered. Financial stringency must not become a cloak for abandoning the University's commitments in any of these areas.
- Warning Signs
- Signals -- The University community must always be alert to signals which warn that a financial crisis may be near. The following items are examples of some indicators of possible financial problems that warrant immediate attention by campus budget committees, Chancellors, and the central administration staff. These example are neither mutually exclusive nor listed in order of importance.
- State appropriations insufficient to meet contractual commitments.
- A substantial loss of students on one or more campuses.
- Mandated increases in costs or functions which are not equaled by funding resources.
- Inflationary cost increases not matched by adjustments for inflation in revenue sources.
- An absolute decline in dollar income from one year to the next, without corresponding program or student reduction.
- A budget that is flexible because of firm commitments, with the concurrent inability to respond to emergencies; for instance, a very high ratio of S&W to E&E funds.
- Evaluation -- Whenever these indicators are observed, an evaluation of the situation must be made and the preventive planning activities specified in this Executive Guideline at D must be intensified.
- Resource Committees -- Faculty must be meaningfully involved through regular on-going mechanisms with the total University fiscal situation. Appropriate committees with faculty members at the system and campus levels shall be created or designated to advise in educational planning, to appraise resource needs and fiscal conditions, and to advise on allocation and reallocation of resources.
- Primary responsibility for projections of fiscal resources and their allocation rests with the campuses, with necessary support and coordination functions being provided by central administration offices. Hence, it is especially important that each campus have such a resource/planning committee or committees, each including a substantial number of faculty members designated by a representatively elected faculty governance body, to be informed by and to be involved with the Chancellors and their staffs in dealing with campus fiscal planning and allocation.
- Similarly structured advisory committees should also be considered within major campus administrative subdivisions. Except for required faculty membership, the composition of such committees is a prerogative of the campus or subunit.
- It is essential that all relevant data be made available to these committees. Responsible persons should coordinate their efforts to insure the regular and timely provision of forecasting data to these committees related to programs and to anticipated fiscal resources.
- Effective Use of University Resources -- A careful examination of resource use must be undertaken by these resource/planning committees on a regular basis. As a part of this review, the University will expand its efforts in the area of performance audits. For instance, productivity in administrative offices, faculty loads, physical plant activities, and research centers will be assessed. The University must look as carefully at its administration and support personnel picture, at the efficiency of certain seasonal offices, at bidding and purchasing operations, as it does at faculty staffing patterns. Each campus and the central administration shall set up a regular procedure by which resource committees can systematically examine each issues. Expert advice from outside the University may be employed if appropriate.
- Possible Retrenchment Steps to be Taken if Financial Stringency is Threatening -- The University routinely takes steps to improve its financial situation as a part of sound management practices. However, if warning signals of financial stress are detected, the appropriate planning and fiscal resource allocation committees, working with University administration, should identify and recommend additional measures short of declaring exigency that could be adopted. Such possibilities include, but by no means are limited to, the following:
- Reduction of faculty positions through attrition or nonrenewal.
- Adjustment of faculty and staff work loads, so long as the faculty can remain professionally active and the staff effective.
- Reduction or elimination of administrative and support services.
- Modifications of the staff benefits and retirement program to provide incentives for voluntary early retirement and part-time appointments and to provide equitably for persons terminated because of the financial situation.
- Reduction or elimination of academic programs.
- Professional development programs to enable faculty and staff to accommodate to the changing needs of the University.
- Limitations on enrollments.
- Decreased numbers of courses and frequency of offerings, and increased class size.
- Conversion to nine-month of twelve-month appointments.
- Increased utilization of short-term non-tenurable positions.
- The closing of facilities.
These actions could have quite serious impact upon the quality of the University's educational mission and must be carefully weighted against the severity of the economic situation. The University, as a University, must not be sacrificed in order to avoid hard decisions about retrenchment or financial exigency.
- External Relations -- The University always attempts to maintain full communication with state officers, alumni, and the public about its financial situation. During any period of retrenchment or financial stringency, however, it will be especially important that a coordinated effort be made to (a) seek full public understanding of the University's crisis, including an explanation of the impact of planned reductions; (b) solicit special alumni and other private gifts to minimize educational cutbacks.
- Chancellors should take appropriate steps to provide for implementation of this Executive Guideline on the individual campuses.

8 May 2009 (afternoon)
For use of information media; not an official record
· The Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review Working Group reviewed the fulfillment of human rights obligations by the Viet Nam this afternoon, during which 60 Council members and observers raised a number of issues pertaining to the human rights situation in the country.
· This afternoon, the Working Group also adopted, ad referendum, the report on Malta, following the review of the country on Wednesday, 6 May.
· Presenting the national report of Viet Nam was PHAM BINH MINH, First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, who noted that the Government had established an inter-agency working group to prepare its national report for the UPR, in that regard consultations were held with dozens of organizations. Viet Nam had a consistent policy of respecting and guaranteeing human rights and had acceded to 18 conventions of the ILO and several other bilateral and multilateral conventions. The policy to respect human rights was rooted in Viet Nam’s history and culture of thousands of years. In Viet Nam there were 54 ethnic groups who have been living together. The State had been able to lead a process of comprehensive renewal with significant successes which were recognized by the international community. The human rights policy of Viet Nam was translated into laws and concrete polices which had bore positive results on the ground. Viet Nam attached great importance to the building of a comprehensive legal system to guarantee and promote human rights. The Constitution and legal normative documents clearly stipulated the rights and measures to guarantee civil and political human rights in the country in conformity with international human rights treaties. The National Assembly had the power of supreme oversight over all activities of the State. Viet Nam has been implementing the Master Plan on Administrative Reform in the 2001 to 2010 period.
The head of delegation recalled that the mass media had been growing rapidly in Viet Nam. At present there were 700 print press agencies with 850 publications, 68 TV and Radio stations and 80 on-line media magazines. Religious and belief activities were now a vibrant and enriching social feature as there were over 20 million followers of different religions. It was recalled that Viet Nam will host the World Buddhist Summit 2010. The ethnic minority of Viet Nam participated in an increasingly equal manner in the country’s socio-political life. Moreover, Viet Nam had attained significant achievements in promoting women’s rights against the indicators of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights in Viet Nam had also made significant progress, especially in the past years of renewal. The economy has continued to grow steadily over 7% per annum for over a decade. The United Nations has claimed that Viet Nam had attained or surpassed many of the MDGs and was capable of attaining all of them by 2015. In ethnic minority areas, the percentage of poor households had been reduced by an average of 3-5% per year.
The Vietnamese Government’s national UPR report has described in detail lessons drawn from achievements in protecting and promoting human rights and has underscored the close relationship between the protection of human rights and national independence and sovereignty, he stated. Viet Nam’s accomplishment in the area of human rights derived from the country’s foreign policy of openness and increasingly active participation in regional and international human rights mechanisms and activities, including those of the United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights Council and the Asia-Europe Meeting. Viet Nam was currently working with other countries in the region to establish a human rights body of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). On the issue of Special Procedures, Viet Nam had recently extended invitations to five Special Procedures – on the right to food, extreme poverty, education, health and foreign debt. Viet Nam remained a poor country still having to cope with the aftermaths of war, including supporting the many victims of bombs, mines and Agent Orange/dioxin. The UPR report of Viet Nam identified a number of priorities for the near future. Viet Nam will continue to place high on its agenda poverty reduction, healthcare, development and social safety nets. Promotion and protection of human rights remained a matter of priority for the international community and for Viet Nam. The ultimate goal was to build a strong country with prosperous people and a just, democratic and advanced society.
· During the three-hour interactive discussion delegations noted a number of positive achievements of the State under review. These included Viet Nam’s engagement with the international community on human rights; Viet Nam’s constructive role in the ASEAN process; increased school enrolment rates; advancements in promoting and protecting the rights of disabled persons; efforts to improve the situation of ethnic minorities; steps to rehabilitate those suffering from the consequences of the war, including land mine victims and Agent Orange; steps to mitigate the effects of natural disasters; the reform of the legal system; and steps to eliminate discrimination against women. Several States applauded Viet Nam for its poverty reduction strategy and the progress made in socio-economic development.

The dilemma I'm currently in is that I need a frontend that will support new(er) graphics output (to hook to a 46" Samsung DLP) and the old hardware I have laying around just won't cut it. I could get an eMachine T3256 for $598. from walmart.com which seems fairly cheap yet fully capable (I have the ability to hide the box in the basement under my TV) but I'm also considering building a nicer HTPC for use in the entertainment center. It would have to be quiet, look nice, support DVD burning, blah blah blah. My price range is $400-600 which would still keep me under an HDTivo even when considering the added cost of a HD capture card. So with that in mind, could I build an HTPC based on the VIA EPIA M-Series Mini-ITX motherboard and stay within my price range? Or is there some other alternative all together (still using Myth) that I haven't thought about? Any and all thoughts/ideas/opinions GREATLY appreciated. I think this is going to be an early Christmas present to myself and my family so the sooner, the better! Thanks!

Some early season league matchups this week should provide a clearer picture of where things stand in baseball.
On Wednesday night, Santa Ana Mater Dei plays Orange Lutheran in a Trinity League showdown at Hart Park. Both won their league openers last week.
On Tuesday, North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake sends out Lucas Giolito to take on host Mission Hills Alemany, which was swept in its two-game Mission League series with West Hills Chaminade. The team that can beat Giolito will probably win the league title.
On Wednesday in a nonleague doubleheader, Mission Viejo continues on the road back to promience by facing Lake Forest El Toro at Saddleback College. Mission Viejo was ranked No. 1 in preseason, then lost to Capistrano Valley, Mater Dei and Bishop Amat. I still think the Diablos are going to be heard from this season.
-- Eric SondheimerFamily, friends and random internet surfers:
A good friend of mine, Mr. Danny Dover is blogging about his international experiences and recently shared a rather amusing and nightmare inducing sex dream experience he had on a plane during an international flight.
My journey in Korea won't get as many stamps on my passport as Danny and the Kodak Moments will be a bit more dispersed but he inspired me to share my experiences.
If majoring in Business taught me anything it is the principle of scarcity. Acting on this, I will only post every month or so and try to keep things interesting. I understand that the attention span of those on the internet is comparable with that of a NASCAR fan. I'll try to be entertaining and brief so you can go back to Lol Cats or that video of a monkey peeing into his own mouth.
Peace (kinda...): If you feel relaxed and at peace after meditating Buddhist style, your not doing it right. With the exception of gymnasts, ballerinas and the cast of Cirque De Soleil, humans are not meant to sit in such an uncomfortable position for a long period of time. I am talking about the Lotus position.
Does it look easy? I thought it would be. It isn't. Try it. Remember to keep your back straight, don't move a muscle or make a sound and hold it for 20 minutes while thinking about nothing (that last part might be a bit too easy for some you...). I consider myself to be a healthy person. I enjoy the occasional gin and tonic but I don't smoke and I exercise on the regular. None of that matters in mediating. If done properly, muscles you didn't know you had will be sore for a few days.
Yeo Yeo, the Buddhist Monk and spiritual guide who walked us through life at the temple took mercy on us foreigners and kept the "Whacking Stick" (thats what I call it anyway) on the shelf. During Monk training, any monk-to-be who is meditating with poor form is hit in the back with a big hollow bamboo stick by a silent monk who is walking around the prayer room Crouching Tiger style looking to find unsuspecting victims! Try reaching zen with that going on. My form was so poor I would have been beaten to death in 5 minutes. I won't go into all the details of my 24 hours at the Temple but I'll say a few things.
1. Buddhist chanting is awesome.
2. Waking up at 4AM for the chanting after sleeping on a hard floor is not.
3. Buddhist food is gross (sorry Vegans but your food is 85% awful. I'll sacrifice 5 years of watching Price is Right, playing golf and seeing everyone else my age die if it means I get to enjoy chicken and barbeque a burger whenever the hell I want while I'm alive).
4. I do NOT want to be a Buddhist.
Love:
This section is titled love because I might just love Taylor Swift. Back off. I like the NFL, Gladiator and the Rolling Stones too. The concert itself was great. T-Swizzle could never disappoint me. The crowd itself was a different story. Everyone sat the whole time and the silence between songs was painful. Why weren't there screaming girls? Where were the drunk people? At least take out a lighter or a cell phone and wave it in the air. I guess maybe Taylor Swift just isn't that popular in Korea. Maybe I need to go see Girl's Generation in concert.
Full disclosure: I think that this song is catchy.
I'm sure there would be so many screaming teenagers at a Girls Generation concert that Justin Beiber would be jealous.
Naked Asian Men:
Korean Bath Houses, or jimijibongs, want you take it all off. You know that old guy in the gym locker room who walks around completely naked, strolling back and forth like someone looking for their car in a crowded parking lot? His favorite activities are stretching and doing lunges. I don't know about female locker rooms and I'm sure the depictions I've seen on the internet are not at all accurate but at every gym I've ever set foot in some manifestation of this guy can be found. In a Korean Bath House "that guy" is every guy.
The bathing room is very orientally ornate (say that 5 times fast) and after showering you have a choice of many different jacuzzi style tubs. The water can be freezing, very hot, or somewhere in the middle and comes in the colors of clear, robin-egg blue, and sea-foam green. Sorry, no pictures. I didn't think it would be appropriate for some reason. Being a first-timer to the bathhouse scene and life-long hot tub enthusiast (at one point I had spent 4 consecutive New Year's Eve's in a hot tub, a point of pride) I jumped from tub to tub, excited to discover what temperature would greet my naked body next. I am sure that there are different health purposes for each tub and that they all have minerals of some sort. There is likely a logical order that Koreans follow during the bathing process, but in true foreigner fashion I did it my way. My gallivanting about the room combined with the fact that I am white drew quite a bit of attention my way. Have you ever had that dream where you are naked and everyone is looking at you? Well, come to a Korean bath house and your dreams can become a reality for only 8,000 won.
There are also misty steam rooms of various decor, seating arrangements and temperatures to choose from. And if that's not enough, for a nominal fee you can get a massage or a full-body skin-peeling scrub down. After a hard workout this place is an inexpensive haven of relaxation and recuperation. If you can ignore all the naked men it's great. If you can't, you might be gay (no judgement).
Until next time. Go forth and prosper.NFL

Working the Wire: Taking Advantage of Roster CutsAt the end of last week, according to Strollerderby, a federal appeals court ordered a new law requiring all Texas abortion providers to perform ultrasounds and play fetal heartbeat sounds to pregnant women seeking abortions.
The law became immediately enforceable. So much for the standard 22-day waiting period.
While the law mandates that the ultrasound images be shown to abortion patients along with a detailed description of what they are looking at, preferably while listening to a soothing soundtrack of their baby’s heartbeat, women are not required to accept this “service.” They must, however, listen to the detailed verbal description of the exam unless they are otherwise “exonerated” due to rape, incest or fetal abnormality.
The president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, Nancy Northrup, was not impressed with the high speed implementation of this new law. On the website, reproductiverights.org, the measure is referred to as an “intrusive and demeaning anti-choice law” and was criticized for not allowing opponents to react before it was given the green light.
I agree that this new law is demeaning.
The thought of an abortion doctor giving a pregnant woman a tutorial on what is happening inside her own body is unbearably patronizing in my opinion. To assume that a woman seeking an abortion is not already acutely aware of the fact that there is life inside of her. Whether or not she chooses to see it as life, potential life, human or zygote, she knows it’s there. She feels the weight of responsibility it carries, the miracle, the burden,the life altering potential, all of it. To treat her as if she does not fully “understand,” is to presume and to disrespect.
What really bugs me, though, is the way the man, father, sperm donor, whoever he is, is exempt from any and all of this forced, Gestation-101 tutoring. If this law is to be imposed on all pregnant women seeking abortions in Texas, should not the father of the child be forced to wear the scarlet letter as well?
What do you think about this new Texas abortion law?
I’m not pro-choice necessarily but how demeaning for those women that are ‘exonerated’ to have to explain why they are ‘exonerated.’ And what would stop those that aren’t ‘exonerated’ from saying they are. Very unsound law…
I feel like abortion is a womans choice and if her and her partner have talked about it throughly and know that now is not the right time to have a baby they shouldn’t have to be pressured like this. However if someone is abusing it and trying to use abortion as a form of birth control they should have to go through this everytime.
In some cases, I believe its necessary. There are many women I know that have had an abortion just for the fact that they don’t want the responsibility. To me, its cruel. That baby may be unborn but it still has a heartbeat and IS a baby. I can understand a rape victim or whatever the case may be but does that mean that anyone who gets pregnant should just be able to take a life? Yea, she knows the baby is there but maybe she will think twice before making such a huge decision. Half of the women I know have all regreted the decision they made and maybe, if this law would have been enforced before, that child would have its life.
Maybe the CHOICE to have a child should be made PRIOR to having unprotected sex.
I think the women who seek abortions should go through this “Gestation 101″ and feel the full weight of their “choice” to kill their baby. To know they are terminating a life with a heartbeat, feelings.
Everyone wants to debate women’s rights. Women have a number of better choices to make PRIOR to creating a life they want to terminate. Nobody ever takes into consideration the rights of the babies that are ripped from their mothers’ wombs.
If it has a heartbeat it is alive. If you stop an adults heart from beating its murder. If you stop a newborns heart from beating its murder. Just because the baby is inside of a woman does not mean she has the right to stop that heart through abortion.
“Your rights end where mine begin” most of us have probably heard this statement. The same is true for that baby.
The law is by no means perfect. Because it leaves room for people to lie and say “rape” etc to get out of this without proof. But either way Texas deserves a big round of applause for at least doing something.
One of the previous commenters said its demeaning to assume the woman doesn’t know whats going on. It’s demeaning to be so irresponsible as to abort a baby because you don’t want it. Somebody else will love that baby. It’s called adoption.
I believe many young women don’t really think of the good things that come along with having children. How much joy and pride they brings us and how much more love there is in the world when you have a child of your own. They are mostly thinking of the negative impact of having a baby. I have to say that in this regard, showing ultrasound and heartbeat might actually work in keeping abortion rates down.
shelby,
it’s not your abortion= not your concern, go save dying children in africa.
and there is no baby in the womb, go look at the human development chart.
the human fetus is a parasite.
I think it is important for women to know what exactly they are doing when they choose to have an abortion. I don’t see anything wrong with women having to “listen to the detailed verbal description of the exam”…whenever you have surgery the doctor tells you what they are going to be doing and what is involved so why should the abortion procedure be any different? I think a lot of people take the issue of abortion too lightly and anything that will make them stop and realize that it is a serious decision they are making, one they may later regret, is a good idea.
Awful. Their way around not being able to make abortion illegal. Instead they will add more emotional pressure and make an already difficult decision agonizingly more so…I believe I saw somewhere that it isn’t believed this will reduce abortion rates much, so it basically can just hurt already hurting women.
Thank you Laura! The thought of women having abortions ‘just because’ sickens me. First of all, if you are going to have sex and you aren’t ready for a baby u should try using birth control, condoms. Whatever. If u aren’t responsible enough to protect yourself then u shouldn’t be having sex at all. There are many many women who would do anything to get pregnant, while there are others taking advantage of such a beautiful thing. I think its pretty selfish, actually. And I bet in the end, a lot of women regret it.
Other than in the cases of Rape or Involuntary Incest…too damned bad…you got knocked up…should have kept your legs closed if you didn’t want to get pregnant. I am sick of women using abortion as a form of birth control! Even if there are problems with the fetus…my first son was not expected to live at all due to not having kidneys…I did not abort him and he lived for 19 hours and 13 minutes!!! It should not be a choice!!!
As horrible as it is to admit, I had one. And before they do the procedure they do the ultrasound (screen facing away from you and they don’t say a word about it) I figured they were seeing how far a long i was and that was all. After, they make sure as possible that’s what you want and they give u a pill to help dialate u. After that there is “no turning back”. Next they sit u in a room to watch a video and ask questions about the procedure. They give you all your paperwork to hold as well. As I was sitting there trying to ignore the video I looked at my paper work.. There underneath a few papers, was my ultrasound, my baby. I never knew they’d printed out the sonogram and they never once offered me to see it (understandably) but this is the moment that stays engraved in my mind bc this is the moment that changed my mind about everything. But after the pill it was too late. Had I seen the sonogram I would have walked straight out regardless of any circumstances. I am pro choice but I strongly believe this law will save many innocent lives and I strongly support it. In a time like that any woman is confused lost and scared but that picture is all the reassurance many woman would need.. </3
They need this law everywhere.
It shouldn’t even be an option to kill a living thing. Abortion is heinous, and so are the women that choose it, they deserve to be treated like they don’t understand, because they clearly don’t. If they did, they would know it is murder.
Someone needs to whack some sense into America. What is up with this? Why is all the responsibility placed on the women, and who are these irritating, stupid people talking about “women using abortion as borth-control”. If the statement that abortion is being over-used as birth-control is true (which it isn’t) aren’t men equally guilty of this?
There are too many people on this planet anyway, why do you need more of them? Once they are here, lord knows you won’t care about them anymore. Why don’t you go out and care for some actual, living people, people who are already here, and people who are suffering? Why not help them? Why are you so unable to show even the least bit of rudementary kindness and mercy to the parents of these unwanted babies? Where is your empathy (the real one, the one that actually matters, the kind shown to actual, living people?)?
Stupid and short-sighted, that’s what your agenda is.
And Aquesa, I am sorry for your loss, but why, why, why would you keep your unwell featus alive long enough so that it may suffer through 19 hours of not being able to breathe on its own before finally being allowed to die?!? How is that showing mercy? How is that the right thing to do? Too cruel.
@Mia, and others: you cannot BOTH 1) regret that all the responsibility lay on women’s shoulders YET also defend abortion on the grounds that the woman decides because it is HER body. These two stances are simply too contradictory to be resolved. Imagine the opposite: the man is indeed “invited” to the scan and as a result INSISTS that you not abort…. You see how complicated this gets?? Ethically, philosophically and legally, this is very thorny…. The problem with this law is its desire to motivate a woman through guilt. However, I do think it is a positive thing to connect the idea that “the body is pregnant” with the vision of a child growing “in there” because some women, indeed, would be spared the experience of abortion. Abortion is an important legal right to maintain YET I don’t know any women who have aborted “comfortably” – which means it must continue to exist but in no case be “banalized”. The problem is using guilt as leverage… That is a problem. Guilt is not consciousness… If I had not seen my lovely number three, and done what her father wanted, knowing how special and wonderful she is, I would have regretted it my entire life. A scan saved me from a huge mistake. However, when I was 17, different story….What We Do

The Pleasant Local School District is asking voters for what, if approved, would be its first new operating revenue in nearly 18 years.
Pleasant is seeking a 5-mill, five-year emergency operating levy on the Nov. 5 ballot that would raise $900,000 a year. If passed, a homeowner with a property worth $100,000 would pay $175 per year toward the levy.
School officials are focusing their message on why they believe there is a need for money, telling voters in a letter that the district "has been living within its means." The letter states the need is because the loss of revenue has been severe enough ..."I'm thinking Patty Griffin, Nanci Griffith and Iris DeMent....spellbinding from the opening track" - BBC Radio

Studio apartment in 3rd arrondissement, Paris
October 2007, 2 weeks
It was ideally located in Paris; close to several metro stops, and minutes to the Centre Pompidou with all the nearby cafes, restaurants and shops. Three metro stops were a five minute walk away. The building was a charming old apartment building with a winding staircase, yet the apartment itself was bright, airy, and newly renovated. It is on a quiet street which is not a through-way, no not much traffic. I really liked the area because it was so central and had so many conveniences nearby, yet wasn't busy and touristy.
My recommendations for the area: The Monoprix at Blvd Sebastopol had everything I could need for meals, etc. and was convenient walking distance, less than ten minute walk. A smaller grocery store was literally right around the corner. Within two blocks were countless restaurants, bakeries, take-aways, and cafes. Be sure to walk to the rue des Rosiers and eat at As du Falafel ... I guarantee you won't be able to eat there just once!
My stay at this apartment in Paris met and exceeded all of my expectations! The apartment was clean, newly updated, had all the modern conveniences I could need, and was very comfortable. It was a perfect home away from home! The host was more than helpful, and I felt very safe and comfortable there.
You can view the property directly: Rue St Martin.

Everything seemed fairly new, all in good condition, very comfortable.
I didn't cook full meals there, but the kitchen was well-stocked for preparing snacks, light meals, coffee and breakfast, etc.
The owner of the apartment was American and lives in Paris, he met me at the apartment was was gracious and welcoming despite the fact that I was so late. The agency representative in Paris was located across the street and also spoke English, and was available in case I needed anything.
Yes! The apartment had everything my fiance and I needed: Internet, phone, flat-screen TV, CD player, stocked kitchen, and was so clean and comfortable. It was the perfect location. I would recommend this apartment or this rental agency to anyone going to Paris, and I would love to stay there. (Spartanburg, S.C.) 1898-1900

Character
Shu uses a device called the Income, Special Chapter: I Caught a.
Shu made his first official appearance in Shu and Pikachu's Debut! traveling with Pikachu. While encountering a Caterpie, he has Pikachu battle it before a Pidgey eats it for dinner. Pikachu refused as he was tired and fell asleep in a hanging sleeping bag. Pikachu told Shu to capture it himself. Shu tried many tactics to catch Caterpie but they all failed. Shu tried the Transformation Tactic as his last tactic by dressing up as one. As Caterpie got distracted by the sight of Shu's disguise, Shu escaped from his costume and caught Caterpie. As Shu was celebrating, a flock of Pidgey grab him by the costume as they think he was their dinner. Shu was freed by Pikachu as the flock released him from midair and as they crashed, Shu and Pikachu go back to their arguing.
In A Powerful Opponent, Venusaur!, they get lost in a forest and while Shu quietly sneaked in the grass, he bumped into a Venusaur. He pulled it out to get a closer look but Venusaur started to become angry at Shu for doing so. As Pikachu battled it, Shu told him to get away from Venusaur as it was too big. Shu eventually protected Pikachu after Venusaur was about to attack him with its vines. The bond between Shu and Pikachu caused Venusaur to cease its attacks.
In A Match For Pokémon, Shu attempted to capture a Venomoth but Tomio beated him to it. Tomio accused Shu of being a slowpoke when he was unable to capture Venomoth as well as other Pokémon from a couple of meters away. Shu, insulted, challenged Tomio to a match to see who can capture the most Pokémon. The match went underway and by the time it was sunset, Shu had 19 Pokémon. He encountered a Nidoran♂ and since Nidoran♂ had an injured leg, Shu gave him a bandage instead of capturing him. As the contest concluded, Shu had less Pokémon caught than Tomio so he was about to give up his Pokédex until Nidoran♂ and its family showed up and the match went to Shu.
Shu arrived in Celadon University in The Challenge at Celadon University!. A gatekeeper stopped him before Shu went in. The gatekeeper gives him an entrance exam in order to determine if Shu will be allowed in. Shu answered the question correctly and went in. He went to the Chemical Research Laboratory first and was given more questions during his journey in Celadon University in which he incorrectly answered the first as it was asking for the highest price tag instead of the tallest.
Shu heard a noise in the Pokémon University Hospital and went to check it out, which was a Machamp struggling during treatment. Shu tried getting Machamp to calm down with Pikachu's ThunderShock but it made Machamp more angry and destroyed a fish tank containing a Magikarp. Shu jumped in to protect Magikarp and gets pounded on by Machamp. Eventually, Magikarp saved him with Dragon Rage as it wanted to do the same that Shu did for it. As Shu saved the university, he was rewarded with a medal with Magikarp and Gyarados engravings on it.
In A Farfetch'd Fencing Match!, he attempts to catch a Farfetch'd but Farfetch'd sliced the Poké Ball in half. Farfetch'd's Trainer, Ryoma, arrived and accused Shu of stealing his Farfetch'd. Ryoma battled Shu after making fun of Shu and Pikachu. Shu had trouble keeping up with Farfetch'd since it was too fast. Eventually, Shu came up with a technique called Lightning Sword and defeated Ryoma and Farfetch'd.

"Remember, remember, the fifth of November...".
Evey (Natalie Portman) is a production assistant living in a post-slightly-less-than-apocalyptic world in which the British government has installed totalitarian rule over its people. After being attacked and nearly raped by government officials, Evey is saved by V (Hugo Weaving), a theatrically garbed terrorist. And V is a terrorist, let us not forget. He uses bombings and murder to sell his message to a complacent society of couch potatoes
Similar to 1984 or FAHRENHEIT 451, the story has all the trappings of a solid dystopian future: evil government, complacent public and a hero willing to risk it all for a single message of hope. While the comic book series was originally published between 1982 and 1985, the filmmakers have updated the story for today's political climate. Themes such as intolerance, invasion of privacy and repression of minority thought are all timeless, but specific political hot topics such as Islam, gay marriage and Avian flu find their way into the film and resonate with today's audiences.
The film's message is not of anarchy, but instead focuses on the sheer power of an idea. A man can be killed, but an idea never dies. All the terrible things V does are done with the sole intention of waking up the public and reminding it of the power of ideas. Teetering on moral ambiguity, the movie remains a tough sell, but the message is just as important now as it was in 1982.All Samsung

By Tommy A. Purvis
Speaking up for workers’ rights gets you straight-up fired, warehouse employees say.
The subsequent action—inspired by the farmworkers movement—was also a catalyst in pressuring Gov. Jerry Brown to sign Assembly Bill 1855. The warehouse worker bill pushed by Assemblywoman Norma Torres (D-Pomona) extends protection found in the construction, farm labor, janitorial and security industries for up to 85,000 warehouse workers in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Still, workers at NFI Industries reported continued retaliation against their organizing efforts, including terminations, demotions and a drastic reduction in hours.
Operators of distribution centers are concerned the legislation will bring regulation to the Southern California logistics sector that thrives on imported Asian goods headed to Walmart stores spread across the heartland of America from the Port of Long Beach.
Garcia’s descriptions of what he directly experienced leaves little doubt that he was in the crosshairs of NFI Industries executives. Once, the son of one of the company’s owners used an expletive when he told Garcia to remove his yellow-and-blue WWU T-shirt. Garcia says that workers loyal to NFI stole his scan gun and discarded it outside for management to find and write him up. The dock supervisor would select the hardest of the cargo containers with heavy boxes for him to unload.
Then, Garcia says, he was sent home from work on phony charges of insubordination shortly after he returned from WalMarch. A few days later, an executive from NFI Industries corporate office in New Jersey called him at home to let him he was terminated. Furthermore, he was told that if he stepped foot on company property that he would be arrested and have a restraining order filed against him.
“Because workers have spoken out about inhumane working conditions, the warehouse company is now scrambling to rent fans, add water coolers and fix broken equipment,” says Guadalupe Palma, a campaign director with WWU. “While it’s good they have acknowledged [that] workers’ concerns about safety are legitimate, it does not excuse the fact that workers who bravely spoke out are being severely retaliated against,” she adds.
In response to the termination of Garcia, other NFI warehouse workers organized through WWU to plan to wage another temporary work stoppage and picket this week, starting today. The effort is another nuisance for Walmart executives to consider as associates at hundreds of Walmart stores plan to walk off the job early next week through Black Friday in protest of work conditions. The effort is organized through the help of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW).
The UFCW is both an ally and supporter of WWU and workers’ right group Organization United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart) that is fighting for change.
Until that change comes, Garcia told the Weekly that he will rely on his family, friends and the WWU to see things through.Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade
